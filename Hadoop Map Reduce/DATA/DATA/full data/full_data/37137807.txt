tony i do confess it   do you think id tell you truths    fletchers wife for a month   the following adventures were related to me by the same nervous gentleman who told me the romantic tale of the stout gentleman published in bracebridge hall  it is very singular that although i expressly stated that story to have been told to me and described the very person who told it still it has been received as an adventure that happened to myself now i protest i never met with any adventure of the kind i should not have grieved at this had it not been intimated by the author of waverley in an introduction to his romance of peveril of the peak that he was himself the stout gentleman alluded to i have ever since been importuned by letters and questions from gentlemen and particularly from ladies without number touching what i had seen of the great unknown  now all this is extremely tantalizing it is like being congratulated on the high prize when one has drawn a blank for i have just as great a desire as any one of the public to penetrate the mystery of that very singular personage whose voice fills every corner of the world without any one being able to tell from whence it comes he who keeps up such a wonderful and whimsical incognito whom nobody knows and yet whom every body thinks he can swear to  my friend the nervous gentleman also who is a man of very shy retired habits complains that he has been excessively annoyed in consequence of its getting about in his neighborhood that he is the fortunate personage insomuch that he has become a character of considerable notoriety in two or three country towns and has been repeatedly teased to exhibit himself at bluestocking parties for no other reason than that of being the gentleman who has had a glimpse of the author of waverley  indeed the poor man has grown ten times as nervous as ever since he has discovered on such good authority who the stout gentleman was and will never forgive himself for not having made a more resolute effort to get a full sight of him he has anxiously endeavored to call up a recollection of what he saw of that portly personage and has ever since kept a curious eye on all gentlemen of more than ordinary dimensions whom he has seen getting into stage coaches all in vain the features he had caught a glimpse of seem common to the whole race of stout gentlemen and the great unknown remains as great an unknown as ever     a hunting dinner   i was once at a hunting dinner given by a worthy foxhunting old baronet who kept bachelors hall in jovial style in an ancient rookhaunted family mansion in one of the middle counties he had been a devoted admirer of the fair sex in his young days but having travelled much studied the sex in various countries with distinguished success and returned home profoundly instructed as he supposed in the ways of woman and a perfect master of the art of pleasing he had the mortification of being jilted by a little boarding school girl who was scarcely versed in the accidence of love  the baronet was completely overcome by such an incredible defeat retired from the world in disgust put himself under the government of his housekeeper and took to foxhunting like a perfect jehu whatever poets may say to the contrary a man will grow out of love as he grows old and a pack of fox hounds may chase out of his heart even the memory of a boardingschool goddess the baronet was when i saw him as merry and mellow an old bachelor as ever followed a hound and the love he had once felt for one woman had spread itself over the whole sex so that there was not a pretty face in the whole country round but came in for a share  the dinner was prolonged till a late hour for our host having no ladies in his household to summon us to the drawingroom the bottle maintained its true bachelor sway unrivalled by its potent enemy the teakettle the old hall in which we dined echoed to bursts of robustious foxhunting merriment that made the ancient antlers shake on the walls by degrees however the wine and wassail of mine host began to operate upon bodies already a little jaded by the chase the choice spirits that flashed up at the beginning of the dinner sparkled for a time then gradually went out one after another or only emitted now and then a faint gleam from the socket  some of the briskest talkers who had given tongue so bravely at the first burst fell fast asleep and none kept on their way but certain of those longwinded prosers who like shortlegged hounds worry on unnoticed at the bottom of conversation but are sure to be in at the death even these at length subsided into silence and scarcely any thing was heard but the nasal communications of two or three veteran masticators who having been silent while awake were indemnifying the company in their sleep  at length the announcement of tea and coffee in the cedar parlor roused all hands from this temporary torpor every one awoke marvellously renovated and while sipping the refreshing beverage out of the baronets oldfashioned hereditary china began to think of departing for their several homes but here a sudden difficulty arose while we had been prolonging our repast a heavy winter storm had set in with snow rain and sleet driven by such bitter blasts of wind that they threatened to penetrate to the very bone  its all in vain said our hospitable host to think of putting ones head out of doors in such weather so gentlemen i hold you my guests for this night at least and will have your quarters prepared accordingly  the unruly weather which became more and more tempestuous rendered the hospitable suggestion unanswerable the only question was whether such an unexpected accession of company to an already crowded house would not put the housekeeper to her trumps to accommodate them  pshaw cried mine host did you ever know of a bachelors hall that was not elastic and able to accommodate twice as many as it could hold so out of a goodhumored pique the housekeeper was summoned to consultation before us all the old lady appeared in her gala suit of faded brocade which rustled with flurry and agitation for in spite of mine hosts bravado she was a little perplexed but in a bachelors house and with bachelor guests these matters are readily managed there is no lady of the house to stand upon squeamish points about lodging guests in odd holes and corners and exposing the shabby parts of the establishment a bachelors housekeeper is used to shifts and emergencies after much worrying to and fro and divers consultations about the red room and the blue room and the chintz room and the damask room and the little room with the bow window the matter was finally arranged  when all this was done we were once more summoned to the standing rural amusement of eating the time that had been consumed in dozing after dinner and in the refreshment and consultation of the cedar parlor was sufficient in the opinion of the rosyfaced butler to engender a reasonable appetite for supper a slight repast had therefore been tricked up from the residue of dinner consisting of cold sirloin of beef hashed venison a devilled leg of a turkey or so and a few other of those light articles taken by country gentlemen to ensure sound sleep and heavy snoring  the nap after dinner had brightened up every ones wit and a great deal of excellent humor was expended upon the perplexities of mine host and his housekeeper by certain married gentlemen of the company who considered themselves privileged in joking with a bachelors establishment from this the banter turned as to what quarters each would find on being thus suddenly billeted in so antiquated a mansion  by my soul said an irish captain of dragoons one of the most merry and boisterous of the partyby my soul but i should not be surprised if some of those goodlooking gentlefolks that hang along the walls should walk about the rooms of this stormy night or if i should find the ghost of one of these longwaisted ladies turning into my bed in mistake for her grave in the churchyard  do you believe in ghosts then said a thin hatchetfaced gentleman with projecting eyes like a lobster  i had remarked this last personage throughout dinnertime for one of those incessant questioners who seem to have a craving unhealthy appetite in conversation he never seemed satisfied with the whole of a story never laughed when others laughed but always put the joke to the question he could never enjoy the kernel of the nut but pestered himself to get more out of the shell  do you believe in ghosts then said the inquisitive gentleman  faith but i do replied the jovial irishman i was brought up in the fear and belief of them we had a benshee in our own family honey  a bensheeand whats that cried the questioner  why an old lady ghost that tends upon your real milesian families and wails at their window to let them know when some of them are to die  a mighty pleasant piece of information cried an elderly gentleman with a knowing look and a flexible nose to which he could give a whimsical twist when he wished to be waggish  by my soul but id have you know its a piece of distinction to be waited upon by a benshee its a proof that one has pure blood in ones veins but egad now were talking of ghosts there never was a house or a night better fitted than the present for a ghost adventure faith sir john havent you such a thing as a haunted chamber to put a guest in  perhaps said the baronet smiling i might accommodate you even on that point  oh i should like it of all things my jewel some dark oaken room with ugly wobegone portraits that stare dismally at one and about which the housekeeper has a power of delightful stories of love and murder and then a dim lamp a table with a rusty sword across it and a spectre all in white to draw aside ones curtains at midnight  in truth said an old gentleman at one end of the table you put me in mind of an anecdote  oh a ghost story a ghost story was vociferated round the board every one edging his chair a little nearer  the attention of the whole company was now turned upon the speaker he was an old gentleman one side of whose face was no match for the other the eyelid drooped and hung down like an unhinged window shutter indeed the whole side of his head was dilapidated and seemed like the wing of a house shut up and haunted ill warrant that side was well stuffed with ghost stories  there was a universal demand for the tale  nay said the old gentleman its a mere anecdoteand a very commonplace one but such as it is you shall have it it is a story that i once heard my uncle tell when i was a boy but whether as having happened to himself or to another i cannot recollect but no matter its very likely it happened to himself for he was a man very apt to meet with strange adventures i have heard him tell of others much more singular at any rate we will suppose it happened to himself  what kind of man was your uncle said the questioning gentleman  why he was rather a dry shrewd kind of body a great traveller and fond of telling his adventures  pray how old might he have been when this happened  when what happened cried the gentleman with the flexible nose impatientlyegad you have not given any thing a chance to happen come never mind our uncles age let us have his adventures  the inquisitive gentleman being for the moment silenced the old gentleman with the haunted head proceeded     the adventure of my uncle   many years since a long time before the french revolution my uncle had passed several months at paris the english and french were on better terms in those days than at present and mingled cordially together in society the english went abroad to spend money then and the french were always ready to help them they go abroad to save money at present and that they can do without french assistance perhaps the travelling english were fewer and choicer then than at present when the whole nation has broke loose and inundated the continent at any rate they circulated more readily and currently in foreign society and my uncle during his residence in paris made many very intimate acquaintances among the french noblesse  some time afterwards he was making a journey in the wintertime in that part of normandy called the pays de caux when as evening was closing in he perceived the turrets of an ancient chateau rising out of the trees of its walled park each turret with its high conical roof of gray slate like a candle with an extinguisher on it  to whom does that chateau belong friend cried my uncle to a meager but fiery postillion who with tremendous jack boots and cocked hat was floundering on before him  to monseigneur the marquis de  said the postillion touching his hat partly out of respect to my uncle and partly out of reverence to the noble name pronounced my uncle recollected the marquis for a particular friend in paris who had often expressed a wish to see him at his paternal chateau my uncle was an old traveller one that knew how to turn things to account he revolved for a few moments in his mind how agreeable it would be to his friend the marquis to be surprised in this sociable way by a pop visit and how much more agreeable to himself to get into snug quarters in a chateau and have a relish of the marquiss wellknown kitchen and a smack of his superior champagne and burgundy rather than take up with the miserable lodgment and miserable fare of a country inn in a few minutes therefore the meager postillion was cracking his whip like a very devil or like a true frenchman up the long straight avenue that led to the chateau  you have no doubt all seen french chateaus as every body travels in france nowadays this was one of the oldest standing naked and alone in the midst of a desert of gravel walks and cold stone terraces with a coldlooking formal garden cut into angles and rhomboids and a cold leafless park divided geometrically by straight alleys and two or three noseless coldlooking statues without any clothing and fountains spouting cold water enough to make ones teeth chatter at least such was the feeling they imparted on the wintry day of my uncles visit though in hot summer weather ill warrant there was glare enough to scorch ones eyes out  the smacking of the postillions whip which grew more and more intense the nearer they approached frightened a flight of pigeons out of the dovecote and rooks out of the roofs and finally a crew of servants out of the chateau with the marquis at their head he was enchanted to see my uncle for his chateau like the house of our worthy host had not many more guests at the time than it could accommodate so he kissed my uncle on each cheek after the french fashion and ushered him into the castle  the marquis did the honors of his house with the urbanity of his country in fact he was proud of his old family chateau for part of it was extremely old there was a tower and chapel that had been built almost before the memory of man but the rest was more modern the castle having been nearly demolished during the wars of the league the marquis dwelt upon this event with great satisfaction and seemed really to entertain a grateful feeling towards henry iv for having thought his paternal mansion worth battering down he had many stories to tell of the prowess of his ancestors and several skullcaps helmets and crossbows to show and divers huge boots and buff jerkins that had been worn by the leaguers above all there was a twohandled sword which he could hardly wield but which he displayed as a proof that there had been giants in his family  in truth he was but a small descendant from such great warriors when you looked at their bluff visages and brawny limbs as depicted in their portraits and then at the little marquis with his spindle shanks his sallow lanthern visage flanked with a pair of powdered earlocks or ailes de pigeon that seemed ready to fly away with it you would hardly believe him to be of the same race but when you looked at the eyes that sparkled out like a beetles from each side of his hooked nose you saw at once that he inherited all the fiery spirit of his forefathers in fact a frenchmans spirit never exhales however his body may dwindle it rather rarefies and grows more inflammable as the earthly particles diminish and i have seen valor enough in a little fieryhearted french dwarf to have furnished out a tolerable giant  when once the marquis as he was wont put on one of the old helmets that were stuck up in his hall though his head no more filled it than a dry pea its pease cod yet his eyes sparkled from the bottom of the iron cavern with the brilliancy of carbuncles and when he poised the ponderous twohandled sword of his ancestors you would have thought you saw the doughty little david wielding the sword of goliath which was unto him like a weavers beam  however gentlemen i am dwelling too long on this description of the marquis and his chateau but you must excuse me he was an old friend of my uncles and whenever my uncle told the story he was always fond of talking a great deal about his hostpoor little marquis he was one of that handful of gallant courtiers who made such a devoted but hopeless stand in the cause of their sovereign in the chateau of the tuilleries against the irruption of the mob on the sad tenth of august  he displayed the valor of a preux french chevalier to the last flourished feebly his little court sword with a sasa in face of a whole legion of sansculottes but was pinned to the wall like a butterfly by the pike of a poissarde and his heroic soul was borne up to heaven on his ailes de pigeon  but all this has nothing to do with my story to the point then  when the hour arrived for retiring for the night my uncle was shown to his room in a venerable old tower it was the oldest part of the chateau and had in ancient times been the donjon or stronghold of course the chamber was none of the best the marquis had put him there however because he knew him to be a traveller of taste and fond of antiquities and also because the better apartments were already occupied indeed he perfectly reconciled my uncle to his quarters by mentioning the great personages who had once inhabited them all of whom were in some way or other connected with the family if you would take his word for it john baliol or as he called him jean de bailleul had died of chagrin in this very chamber on hearing of the success of his rival robert the bruce at the battle of bannockburn and when he added that the duke de guise had slept in it during the wars of the league my uncle was fain to felicitate himself upon being honored with such distinguished quarters  the night was shrewd and windy and the chamber none of the warmest an old longfaced longbodied servant in quaint livery who attended upon my uncle threw down an armful of wood beside the fireplace gave a queer look about the room and then wished him bon repos with a grimace and a shrug that would have been suspicious from any other than an old french servant the chamber had indeed a wild crazy look enough to strike any one who had read romances with apprehension and foreboding the windows were high and narrow and had once been loopholes but had been rudely enlarged as well as the extreme thickness of the walls would permit and the illfitted casements rattled to every breeze you would have thought on a windy night some of the old leaguers were tramping and clanking about the apartment in their huge boots and rattling spurs a door which stood ajar and like a true french door would stand ajar in spite of every reason and effort to the contrary opened upon a long dark corridor that led the lord knows whither and seemed just made for ghosts to air themselves in when they turned out of their graves at midnight the wind would spring up into a hoarse murmur through this passage and creak the door to and fro as if some dubious ghost were balancing in its mind whether to come in or not in a word it was precisely the kind of comfortless apartment that a ghost if ghost there were in the chateau would single out for its favourite lounge  my uncle however though a man accustomed to meet with strange adventures apprehended none at the time he made several attempts to shut the door but in vain not that he apprehended any thing for he was too old a traveller to be daunted by a wildlooking apartment but the night as i have said was cold and gusty something like the present and the wind howled about the old turret pretty much as it does round this old mansion at this moment and the breeze from the long dark corridor came in as damp and chilly as if from a dungeon my uncle therefore since he could not close the door threw a quantity of wood on the fire which soon sent up a flame in the great widemouthed chimney that illumined the whole chamber and made the shadow of the tongs on the opposite wall look like a longlegged giant my uncle now clambered on top of the half score of mattresses which form a french bed and which stood in a deep recess then tucking himself snugly in and burying himself up to the chin in the bedclothes he lay looking at the fire and listening to the wind and chuckling to think how knowingly he had come over his friend the marquis for a nights lodgings and so he fell asleep  he had not taken above half of his first nap when he was awakened by the clock of the chateau in the turret over his chamber which struck midnight it was just such an old clock as ghosts are fond of it had a deep dismal tone and struck so slowly and tediously that my uncle thought it would never have done he counted and counted till he was confident he counted thirteen and then it stopped  the fire had burnt low and the blaze of the last faggot was almost expiring burning in small blue flames which now and then lengthened up into little white gleams my uncle lay with his eyes half closed and his nightcap drawn almost down to his nose his fancy was already wandering and began to mingle up the present scene with the crater of vesuvius the french opera the coliseum at rome dollys chophouse in london and all the farrago of noted places with which the brain of a traveller is crammedin a word he was just falling asleep  suddenly he was aroused by the sound of footsteps that appeared to be slowly pacing along the corridor my uncle as i have often heard him say himself was a man not easily frightened so he lay quiet supposing that this might be some other guest or some servant on his way to bed the footsteps however approached the door the door gently opened whether of its own accord or whether pushed open my uncle could not distinguisha figure all in white glided in it was a female tall and stately in person and of a most commanding air her dress was of an ancient fashion ample in volume and sweeping the floor she walked up to the fireplace without regarding my uncle who raised his nightcap with one hand and stared earnestly at her she remained for some time standing by the fire which flashing up at intervals cast blue and white gleams of light that enabled my uncle to remark her appearance minutely  her face was ghastly pale and perhaps rendered still more so by the blueish light of the fire it possessed beauty but its beauty was saddened by care and anxiety there was the look of one accustomed to trouble but of one whom trouble could not cast down nor subdue for there was still the predominating air of proud unconquerable resolution such at least was the opinion formed by my uncle and he considered himself a great physiognomist  the figure remained as i said for some time by the fire putting out first one hand then the other then each foot alternately as if warming itself for your ghosts if ghost it really was are apt to be cold my uncle furthermore remarked that it wore highheeled shoes after an ancient fashion with paste or diamond buckles that sparkled as though they were alive at length the figure turned gently round casting a glassy look about the apartment which as it passed over my uncle made his blood run cold and chilled the very marrow in his bones it then stretched its arms toward heaven clasped its hands and wringing them in a supplicating manner glided slowly out of the room  my uncle lay for some time meditating on this visitation for as he remarked when he told me the story though a man of firmness he was also a man of reflection and did not reject a thing because it was out of the regular course of events however being as i have before said a great traveller and accustomed to strange adventures he drew his nightcap resolutely over his eyes turned his back to the door hoisted the bedclothes high over his shoulders and gradually fell asleep  how long he slept he could not say when he was awakened by the voice of some one at his bedside he turned round and beheld the old french servant with his earlocks in tight buckles on each side of a long lanthorn face on which habit had deeply wrinkled an everlasting smile he made a thousand grimaces and asked a thousand pardons for disturbing monsieur but the morning was considerably advanced while my uncle was dressing he called vaguely to mind the visitor of the preceding night he asked the ancient domestic what lady was in the habit of rambling about this part of the chateau at night the old valet shrugged his shoulders as high as his head laid one hand on his bosom threw open the other with every finger extended made a most whimsical grimace which he meant to be complimentary  it was not for him to know any thing of les braves fortunes of monsieur  my uncle saw there was nothing satisfactory to be learnt in this quarter after breakfast he was walking with the marquis through the modern apartments of the chateau sliding over the wellwaxed floors of silken saloons amidst furniture rich in gilding and brocade until they came to a long picture gallery containing many portraits some in oil and some in chalks  here was an ample field for the eloquence of his host who had all the family pride of a nobleman of the ancient regime there was not a grand name in normandy and hardly one in france that was not in some way or other connected with his house my uncle stood listening with inward impatience resting sometimes on one leg sometimes on the other as the little marquis descanted with his usual fire and vivacity on the achievements of his ancestors whose portraits hung along the wall from the martial deeds of the stern warriors in steel to the gallantries and intrigues of the blueeyed gentlemen with fair smiling faces powdered earlocks laced ruffles and pink and blue silk coats and breeches not forgetting the conquests of the lovely shepherdesses with hoop petticoats and waists no thicker than an hour glass who appeared ruling over their sheep and their swains with dainty crooks decorated with fluttering ribbands  in the midst of his friends discourse my uncles eyes rested on a fulllength portrait which struck him as being the very counterpart of his visitor of the preceding night  methinks said he pointing to it i have seen the original of this portrait  pardonnez moi replied the marquis politely that can hardly be as the lady has been dead more than a hundred years that was the beautiful duchess de longueville who figured during the minority of louis the fourteenth  and was there any thing remarkable in her history  never was question more unlucky the little marquis immediately threw himself into the attitude of a man about to tell a long story in fact my uncle had pulled upon himself the whole history of the civil war of the fronde in which the beautiful duchess had played so distinguished a part turenne coligni mazarin were called up from their graves to grace his narration nor were the affairs of the barricadoes nor the chivalry of the pertcocheres forgotten my uncle began to wish himself a thousand leagues off from the marquis and his merciless memory when suddenly the little mans recollections took a more interesting turn he was relating the imprisonment of the duke de longueville with the princes condé and conti in the chateau of vincennes and the ineffectual efforts of the duchess to rouse the sturdy normans to their rescue he had come to that part where she was invested by the royal forces in the chateau of dieppe and in imminent danger of falling into their hands  the spirit of the duchess proceeded the marquis rose with her trials it was astonishing to see so delicate and beautiful a being buffet so resolutely with hardships she determined on a desperate means of escape one dark unruly night she issued secretly out of a small postern gate of the castle which the enemy had neglected to guard she was followed by her female attendants a few domestics and some gallant cavaliers who still remained faithful to her fortunes her object was to gain a small port about two leagues distant where she had privately provided a vessel for her escape in case of emergency  the little band of fugitives were obliged to perform the distance on foot when they arrived at the port the wind was high and stormy the tide contrary the vessel anchored far off in the road and no means of getting on board but by a fishing shallop that lay tossing like a cockle shell on the edge of the surf the duchess determined to risk the attempt the seamen endeavored to dissuade her but the imminence of her danger on shore and the magnanimity of her spirit urged her on she had to be borne to the shallop in the arms of a mariner such was the violence of the wind and waves that he faltered lost his foothold and let his precious burden fall into the sea  the duchess was nearly drowned but partly through her own struggles partly by the exertions of the seamen she got to land as soon as she had a little recovered strength she insisted on renewing the attempt the storm however had by this time become so violent as to set all efforts at defiance to delay was to be discovered and taken prisoner as the only resource left she procured horses mounted with her female attendants en croupe behind the gallant gentlemen who accompanied her and scoured the country to seek some temporary asylum  while the duchess continued the marquis laying his forefinger on my uncles breast to arouse his flagging attention while the duchess poor lady was wandering amid the tempest in this disconsolate manner she arrived at this chateau her approach caused some uneasiness for the clattering of a troop of horse at dead of night up the avenue of a lonely chateau in those unsettled times and in a troubled part of the country was enough to occasion alarm  a tall broadshouldered chasseur armed to the teeth galloped ahead and announced the name of the visitor all uneasiness was dispelled the household turned out with flambeaux to receive her and never did torches gleam on a more weatherbeaten travelstained band than came tramping into the court such pale careworn faces such bedraggled dresses as the poor duchess and her females presented each seated behind her cavalier while half drenched half drowsy pages and attendants seemed ready to fall from their horses with sleep and fatigue  the duchess was received with a hearty welcome by my ancestors she was ushered into the hall of the chateau and the fires soon crackled and blazed to cheer herself and her train and every spit and stewpan was put in requisition to prepare ample refreshments for the wayfarers  she had a right to our hospitalities continued the little marquis drawing himself up with a slight degree of stateliness for she was related to our family ill tell you how it was her father henry de bourbon prince of condé  but did the duchess pass the night in the chateau said my uncle rather abruptly terrified at the idea of getting involved in one of the marquiss genealogical discussions  oh as to the duchess she was put into the apartment you occupied last night which at that time was a kind of state apartment her followers were quartered in the chambers opening upon the neighboring corridor and her favorite page slept in an adjoining closet up and down the corridor walked the great chasseur who had announced her arrival and who acted as a kind of sentinel or guard he was a dark stern powerfullooking fellow and as the light of a lamp in the corridor fell upon his deeplymarked face and sinewy form he seemed capable of defending the castle with his single arm  it was a rough rude night about this time of the yearaproposnow i think of it last night was the anniversary of her visit i may well remember the precise date for it was a night not to be forgotten by our house there is a singular tradition concerning it in our family here the marquis hesitated and a cloud seemed to gather about his bushy eyebrows there is a traditionthat a strange occurrence took place that nighta strange mysterious inexplicable occurrence  here he checked himself and paused  did it relate to that lady inquired my uncle eagerly  it was past the hour of midnight resumed the marquiswhen the whole chateau  here he paused againmy uncle made a movement of anxious curiosity  excuse me said the marquisa slight blush streaking his sullen visage there are some circumstances connected with our family history which i do not like to relate that was a rude period a time of great crimes among great men for you know high blood when it runs wrong will not run tamely like blood of the canaillepoor ladybut i have a little family pride thatexcuse mewe will change the subject if you please  my uncles curiosity was piqued the pompous and magnificent introduction had led him to expect something wonderful in the story to which it served as a kind of avenue he had no idea of being cheated out of it by a sudden fit of unreasonable squeamishness besides being a traveller in quest of information considered it his duty to inquire into every thing  the marquis however evaded every question  well said my uncle a little petulantly whatever you may think of it i saw that lady last night  the marquis stepped back and gazed at him with surprise  she paid me a visit in my bedchamber  the marquis pulled out his snuffbox with a shrug and a smile taking it no doubt for an awkward piece of english pleasantry which politeness required him to be charmed with my uncle went on gravely however and related the whole circumstance the marquis heard him through with profound attention holding his snuffbox unopened in his hand when the story was finished he tapped on the lid of his box deliberately took a long sonorous pinch of snuff  bah said the marquis and walked toward the other end of the gallery                                       here the narrator paused the company waited for some time for him to resume his narrative but he continued silent  well said the inquisitive gentleman and what did your uncle say then  nothing replied the other  and what did the marquis say farther  nothing  and is that all  that is all said the narrator filling a glass of wine  i surmise said the shrewd old gentleman with the waggish nosei surmise it was the old housekeeper walking her rounds to see that all was right  bah said the narrator my uncle was too much accustomed to strange sights not to know a ghost from a housekeeper  there was a murmur round the table half of merriment half of disappointment i was inclined to think the old gentleman had really an afterpart of his story in reserve but he sipped his wine and said nothing more and there was an odd expression about his dilapidated countenance that left me in doubt whether he were in drollery or earnest  egad said the knowing gentleman with the flexible nose this story of your uncle puts me in mind of one that used to be told of an aunt of mine by the mothers side though i dont know that it will bear a comparison as the good lady was not quite so prone to meet with strange adventures but at any rate you shall have it     the adventure of my aunt   my aunt was a lady of large frame strong mind and great resolution she was what might be termed a very manly woman my uncle was a thin puny little man very meek and acquiescent and no match for my aunt it was observed that he dwindled and dwindled gradually away from the day of his marriage his wifes powerful mind was too much for him it wore him out my aunt however took all possible care of him had half the doctors in town to prescribe for him made him take all their prescriptions willy nilly and dosed him with physic enough to cure a whole hospital all was in vain my uncle grew worse and worse the more dosing and nursing he underwent until in the end he added another to the long list of matrimonial victims who have been killed with kindness  and was it his ghost that appeared to her asked the inquisitive gentleman who had questioned the former storyteller  you shall hear replied the narratormy aunt took on mightily for the death of her poor dear husband perhaps she felt some compunction at having given him so much physic and nursed him into his grave at any rate she did all that a widow could do to honor his memory she spared no expense in either the quantity or quality of her mourning weeds she wore a miniature of him about her neck as large as a little sun dial and she had a fulllength portrait of him always hanging in her bed chamber all the world extolled her conduct to the skies and it was determined that a woman who behaved so well to the memory of one husband deserved soon to get another  it was not long after this that she went to take up her residence in an old country seat in derbyshire which had long been in the care of merely a steward and housekeeper she took most of her servants with her intending to make it her principal abode the house stood in a lonely wild part of the country among the gray derbyshire hills with a murderer hanging in chains on a bleak height in full view  the servants from town were half frightened out of their wits at the idea of living in such a dismal paganlooking place especially when they got together in the servants hall in the evening and compared notes on all the hobgoblin stories they had picked up in the course of the day they were afraid to venture alone about the forlorn blacklooking chambers my ladies maid who was troubled with nerves declared she could never sleep alone in such a gashly rummaging old building and the footman who was a kindhearted young fellow did all in his power to cheer her up  my aunt herself seemed to be struck with the lonely appearance of the house before she went to bed therefore she examined well the fastenings of the doors and windows locked up the plate with her own hands and carried the keys together with a little box of money and jewels to her own room for she was a notable woman and always saw to all things herself having put the keys under her pillow and dismissed her maid she sat by her toilet arranging her hair for being in spite of her grief for my uncle rather a buxom widow she was a little particular about her person she sat for a little while looking at her face in the glass first on one side then on the other as ladies are apt to do when they would ascertain if they have been in good looks for a roystering country squire of the neighborhood with whom she had flirted when a girl had called that day to welcome her to the country  all of a sudden she thought she heard something move behind her she looked hastily round but there was nothing to be seen nothing but the grimly painted portrait of her poor dear man which had been hung against the wall she gave a heavy sigh to his memory as she was accustomed to do whenever she spoke of him in company and went on adjusting her nightdress her sigh was reechoed or answered by a longdrawn breath she looked round again but no one was to be seen she ascribed these sounds to the wind oozing through the rat holes of the old mansion and proceeded leisurely to put her hair in papers when all at once she thought she perceived one of the eyes of the portrait move  the back of her head being towards it said the storyteller with the ruined head giving a knowing wink on the sound side of his visagegood  yes sir replied drily the narrator her back being towards the portrait but her eye fixed on its reflection in the glass  well as i was saying she perceived one of the eyes of the portrait move so strange a circumstance as you may well suppose gave her a sudden shock to assure herself cautiously of the fact she put one hand to her forehead as if rubbing it peeped through her fingers and moved the candle with the other hand the light of the taper gleamed on the eye and was reflected from it she was sure it moved nay more it seemed to give her a wink as she had sometimes known her husband to do when living it struck a momentary chill to her heart for she was a lone woman and felt herself fearfully situated  the chill was but transient my aunt who was almost as resolute a personage as your uncle sir turning to the old storyteller became instantly calm and collected she went on adjusting her dress she even hummed a favorite air and did not make a single false note she casually overturned a dressing box took a candle and picked up the articles leisurely one by one from the floor pursued a rolling pincushion that was making the best of its way under the bed then opened the door looked for an instant into the corridor as if in doubt whether to go and then walked quietly out  she hastened downstairs ordered the servants to arm themselves with the first weapons that came to hand placed herself at their head and returned almost immediately  her hastily levied army presented a formidable force the steward had a rusty blunderbuss the coachman a loaded whip the footman a pair of horse pistols the cook a huge chopping knife and the butler a bottle in each hand my aunt led the van with a redhot poker and in my opinion she was the most formidable of the party the waiting maid brought up the rear dreading to stay alone in the servants hall smelling to a broken bottle of volatile salts and expressing her terror of the ghosteses  ghosts said my aunt resolutely ill singe their whiskers for them  they entered the chamber all was still and undisturbed as when she left it they approached the portrait of my uncle  pull me down that picture cried my aunt  a heavy groan and a sound like the chattering of teeth was heard from the portrait the servants shrunk back the maid uttered a faint shriek and clung to the footman  instantly added my aunt with a stamp of the foot  the picture was pulled down and from a recess behind it in which had formerly stood a clock they hauled forth a roundshouldered blackbearded varlet with a knife as long as my arm but trembling all over like an aspen leaf  well and who was he no ghost i suppose said the inquisitive gentleman  a knight of the post replied the narrator who had been smitten with the worth of the wealthy widow or rather a marauding tarquin who had stolen into her chamber to violate her purse and rifle her strong box when all the house should be asleep in plain terms continued he the vagabond was a loose idle fellow of the neighborhood who had once been a servant in the house and had been employed to assist in arranging it for the reception of its mistress he confessed that he had contrived his hidingplace for his nefarious purposes and had borrowed an eye from the portrait by way of a reconnoitering hole  and what did they do with himdid they hang him resumed the questioner  hang himhow could they exclaimed a beetlebrowed barrister with a hawks nosethe offence was not capitalno robbery nor assault had been committedno forcible entry or breaking into the premises  my aunt said the narrator was a woman of spirit and apt to take the law into her own hands she had her own notions of cleanliness also she ordered the fellow to be drawn through the horsepond to cleanse away all offences and then to be well rubbed down with an oaken towel  and what became of him afterwards said the inquisitive gentleman  i do not exactly knowi believe he was sent on a voyage of improvement to botany bay  and your aunt said the inquisitive gentlemanill warrant she took care to make her maid sleep in the room with her after that  no sir she did bettershe gave her hand shortly after to the roystering squire for she used to observe it was a dismal thing for a woman to sleep alone in the country  she was right observed the inquisitive gentleman nodding his head sagaciouslybut i am sorry they did not hang that fellow  it was agreed on all hands that the last narrator had brought his tale to the most satisfactory conclusion though a country clergyman present regretted that the uncle and aunt who figured in the different stories had not been married together they certainly would have been well matched  but i dont see after all said the inquisitive gentleman that there was any ghost in this last story  oh if its ghosts you want honey cried the irish captain of dragoons if its ghosts you want you shall have a whole regiment of them and since these gentlemen have been giving the adventures of their uncles and aunts faith and ill een give you a chapter too out of my own family history     the bold dragoon  or the adventure of my grandfather   my grandfather was a bold dragoon for its a profession dye see that has run in the family all my forefathers have been dragoons and died upon the field of honor except myself and i hope my posterity may be able to say the same however i dont mean to be vainglorious well my grandfather as i said was a bold dragoon and had served in the low countries in fact he was one of that very army which according to my uncle toby swore so terribly in flanders he could swear a good stick himself and moreover was the very man that introduced the doctrine corporal trim mentions of radical heat and radical moisture or in other words the mode of keeping out the damps of ditch water by burnt brandy be that as it may its nothing to the purport of my story i only tell it to show you that my grandfather was a man not easily to be humbugged he had seen service or according to his own phrase he had seen the deviland thats saying everything  well gentlemen my grandfather was on his way to england for which he intended to embark at ostendbad luck to the place for one where i was kept by storms and head winds for three long days and the divil of a jolly companion or pretty face to comfort me well as i was saying my grandfather was on his way to england or rather to ostendno matter which its all the same so one evening towards nightfall he rode jollily into bruges very like you all know bruges gentlemen a queer oldfashioned flemish town once they say a great place for trade and moneymaking in old times when the mynheers were in their glory but almost as large and as empty as an irishmans pocket at the present day  well gentlemen it was the time of the annual fair all bruges was crowded and the canals swarmed with dutch boats and the streets swarmed with dutch merchants and there was hardly any getting along for goods wares and merchandises and peasants in big breeches and women in half a score of petticoats  my grandfather rode jollily along in his easy slashing way for he was a saucy sunshiny fellowstaring about him at the motley crowd and the old houses with gable ends to the street and storks nests on the chimneys winking at the ya vrouws who showed their faces at the windows and joking the women right and left in the street all of whom laughed and took it in amazing good part for though he did not know a word of their language yet he always had a knack of making himself understood among the women  well gentlemen it being the time of the annual fair all the town was crowded every inn and tavern full and my grandfather applied in vain from one to the other for admittance at length he rode up to an old rackety inn that looked ready to fall to pieces and which all the rats would have run away from if they could have found room in any other house to put their heads it was just such a queer building as you see in dutch pictures with a tall roof that reached up into the clouds and as many garrets one over the other as the seven heavens of mahomet nothing had saved it from tumbling down but a storks nest on the chimney which always brings good luck to a house in the low countries and at the very time of my grandfathers arrival there were two of these longlegged birds of grace standing like ghosts on the chimney top faith but theyve kept the house on its legs to this very day for you may see it any time you pass through bruges as it stands there yet only it is turned into a brewerya brewery of strong flemish beer at least it was so when i came that way after the battle of waterloo  my grandfather eyed the house curiously as he approached it might not altogether have struck his fancy had he not seen in large letters over the door  heer verkoopt man goeden drank  my grandfather had learnt enough of the language to know that the sign promised good liquor this is the house for me said he stopping short before the door  the sudden appearance of a dashing dragoon was an event in an old inn frequented only by the peaceful sons of traffic a rich burgher of antwerp a stately ample man in a broad flemish hat and who was the great man and great patron of the establishment sat smoking a clean long pipe on one side of the door a fat little distiller of geneva from schiedam sat smoking on the other and the bottlenosed host stood in the door and the comely hostess in crimped cap beside him and the hostess daughter a plump flanders lass with long gold pendants in her ears was at a side window  humph said the rich burgher of antwerp with a sulky glance at the stranger  der duyvel said the fat little distiller of schiedam  the landlord saw with the quick glance of a publican that the new guest was not at all at all to the taste of the old ones and to tell the truth he did not himself like my grandfathers saucy eye  he shook his headnot a garret in the house but was full  not a garret echoed the landlady  not a garret echoed the daughter  the burgher of antwerp and the little distiller of schiedam continued to smoke their pipes sullenly eyed the enemy askance from under their broad hats but said nothing  my grandfather was not a man to be browbeaten he threw the reins on his horses neck cocked his hat on one side stuck one arm akimbo slapped his broad thigh with the other hand  faith and troth said he but ill sleep in this house this very night  my grandfather had on a tight pair of buckskinsthe slap went to the landladys heart  he followed up the vow by jumping off his horse and making his way past the staring mynheers into the public room may be youve been in the barroom of an old flemish innfaith but a handsome chamber it was as youd wish to see with a brick floor a great fireplace with the whole bible history in glazed tiles and then the mantelpiece pitching itself head foremost out of the wall with a whole regiment of cracked teapots and earthen jugs paraded on it not to mention half a dozen great delft platters hung about the room by way of pictures and the little bar in one corner and the bouncing barmaid inside of it with a red calico cap and yellow eardrops  my grandfather snapped his fingers over his head as he cast an eye round the room faith this is the very house ive been looking after said he  there was some farther show of resistance on the part of the garrison but my grandfather was an old soldier and an irishman to boot and not easily repulsed especially after he had got into the fortress so he blarneyd the landlord kissed the landlords wife tickled the landlords daughter chucked the barmaid under the chin and it was agreed on all hands that it would be a thousand pities and a burning shame into the bargain to turn such a bold dragoon into the streets so they laid their heads together that is to say my grandfather and the landlady and it was at length agreed to accommodate him with an old chamber that had for some time been shut up  some say its haunted whispered the landlords daughter but youre a bold dragoon and i dare say you dont fear ghosts  the divil a bit said my grandfather pinching her plump cheek but if i should be troubled by ghosts ive been to the red sea in my time and have a pleasant way of laying them my darling  and then he whispered something to the girl which made her laugh and give him a goodhumored box on the ear in short there was nobody knew better how to make his way among the petticoats than my grandfather  in a little while as was his usual way he took complete possession of the house swaggering all over itinto the stable to look after his horse into the kitchen to look after his supper he had something to say or do with every one smoked with the dutchmen drank with the germans slapped the men on the shoulders tickled the women under the ribsnever since the days of ally croaker had such a rattling blade been seen the landlord stared at him with astonishment the landlords daughter hung her head and giggled whenever he came near and as he turned his back and swaggered along his tight jacket setting off his broad shoulders and plump buckskins and his long sword trailing by his side the maids whispered to one anotherwhat a proper man  at supper my grandfather took command of the table dhôte as though he had been at home helped everybody not forgetting himself talked with every one whether he understood their language or not and made his way into the intimacy of the rich burgher of antwerp who had never been known to be sociable with any one during his life in fact he revolutionized the whole establishment and gave it such a rouse that the very house reeled with it he outsat every one at table excepting the little fat distiller of schiedam who had sat soaking for a long time before he broke forth but when he did he was a very devil incarnate he took a violent affection for my grandfather so they sat drinking and smoking and telling stories and singing dutch and irish songs without understanding a word each other said until the little hollander was fairly swampt with his own gin and water and carried off to bed whooping and hiccuping and trolling the burthen of a low dutch love song  well gentlemen my grandfather was shown to his quarters up a huge staircase composed of loads of hewn timber and through long rigmarole passages hung with blackened paintings of fruit and fish and game and country frollics and huge kitchens and portly burgomasters such as you see about oldfashioned flemish inns till at length he arrived at his room  an oldtimes chamber it was sure enough and crowded with all kinds of trumpery it looked like an infirmary for decayed and superannuated furniture where everything diseased and disabled was sent to nurse or to be forgotten or rather it might have been taken for a general congress of old legitimate moveables where every kind and country had a representative no two chairs were alike such high backs and low backs and leather bottoms and worsted bottoms and straw bottoms and no bottoms and cracked marble tables with curiously carved legs holding balls in their claws as though they were going to play at ninepins  my grandfather made a bow to the motley assemblage as he entered and having undressed himself placed his light in the fireplace asking pardon of the tongs which seemed to be making love to the shovel in the chimney corner and whispering soft nonsense in its ear  the rest of the guests were by this time sound asleep for your mynheers are huge sleepers the house maids one by one crept up yawning to their attics and not a female head in the inn was laid on a pillow that night without dreaming of the bold dragoon  my grandfather for his part got into bed and drew over him one of those great bags of down under which they smother a man in the low countries and there he lay melting between two feather beds like an anchovy sandwich between two slices of toast and butter he was a warmcomplexioned man and this smothering played the very deuce with him so sure enough in a little while it seemed as if a legion of imps were twitching at him and all the blood in his veins was in fever heat  he lay still however until all the house was quiet excepting the snoring of the mynheers from the different chambers who answered one another in all kinds of tones and cadences like so many bullfrogs in a swamp the quieter the house became the more unquiet became my grandfather he waxed warmer and warmer until at length the bed became too hot to hold him  may be the maid had warmed it too much said the curious gentleman inquiringly  i rather think the contrary replied the irishman but be that as it may it grew too hot for my grandfather  faith theres no standing this any longer says he so he jumped out of bed and went strolling about the house  what for said the inquisitive gentleman  why to cool himself to be sure replied the other or perhaps to find a more comfortable bedor perhapsbut no matter what he went forhe never mentioned and theres no use in taking up our time in conjecturing  well my grandfather had been for some time absent from his room and was returning perfectly cool when just as he reached the door he heard a strange noise within he paused and listened it seemed as if some one was trying to hum a tune in defiance of the asthma he recollected the report of the rooms being haunted but he was no believer in ghosts so he pushed the door gently ajar and peeped in  egad gentlemen there was a gambol carrying on within enough to have astonished st anthony  by the light of the fire he saw a pale weazenfaced fellow in a long flannel gown and a tall white nightcap with a tassel to it who sat by the fire with a bellows under his arm by way of bagpipe from which he forced the asthmatical music that had bothered my grandfather as he played too he kept twitching about with a thousand queer contortions nodding his head and bobbing about his tasselled nightcap  my grandfather thought this very odd and mighty presumptuous and was about to demand what business he had to play his wind instruments in another gentlemans quarters when a new cause of astonishment met his eye from the opposite side of the room a longbacked bandylegged chair covered with leather and studded all over in a coxcomical fashion with little brass nails got suddenly into motion thrust out first a claw foot then a crooked arm and at length making a leg slided gracefully up to an easy chair of tarnished brocade with a hole in its bottom and led it gallantly out in a ghostly minuet about the floor  the musician now played fiercer and fiercer and bobbed his head and his nightcap about like mad by degrees the dancing mania seemed to seize upon all the other pieces of furniture the antique longbodied chairs paired off in couples and led down a country dance a threelegged stool danced a hornpipe though horribly puzzled by its supernumerary leg while the amorous tongs seized the shovel round the waist and whirled it about the room in a german waltz in short all the moveables got in motion capering about pirouetting hands across right and left like so many devils all except a great clothespress which kept curtseying and curtseying like a dowager in one corner in exquisite time to the musicbeing either too corpulent to dance or perhaps at a loss for a partner  my grandfather concluded the latter to be the reason so being like a true irishman devoted to the sex and at all times ready for a frolic he bounced into the room calling to the musician to strike up paddy orafferty capered up to the clothespress and seized upon two handles to lead her outwhen whizzthe whole revel was at an end the chairs tables tongs and shovel slunk in an instant as quietly into their places as if nothing had happened and the musician vanished up the chimney leaving the bellows behind him in his hurry my grandfather found himself seated in the middle of the floor with the clothespress sprawling before him and the two handles jerked off and in his hands  then after all this was a mere dream said the inquisitive gentleman  the divil a bit of a dream replied the irishman there never was a truer fact in this world faith i should have liked to see any man tell my grandfather it was a dream  well gentlemen as the clothespress was a mighty heavy body and my grandfather likewise particularly in rear you may easily suppose two such heavy bodies coming to the ground would make a bit of a noise faith the old mansion shook as though it had mistaken it for an earthquake the whole garrison was alarmed the landlord who slept just below hurried up with a candle to inquire the cause but with all his haste his daughter had hurried to the scene of uproar before him the landlord was followed by the landlady who was followed by the bouncing barmaid who was followed by the simpering chambermaids all holding together as well as they could such garments as they had first lain hands on but all in a terrible hurry to see what the devil was to pay in the chamber of the bold dragoon  my grandfather related the marvellous scene he had witnessed and the prostrate clothespress and the broken handles bore testimony to the fact there was no contesting such evidence particularly with a lad of my grandfathers complexion who seemed able to make good every word either with sword or shillelah so the landlord scratched his head and looked silly as he was apt to do when puzzled the landlady scratchedno she did not scratch her headbut she knit her brow and did not seem half pleased with the explanation but the landladys daughter corroborated it by recollecting that the last person who had dwelt in that chamber was a famous juggler who had died of st vituss dance and no doubt had infected all the furniture  this set all things to rights particularly when the chambermaids declared that they had all witnessed strange carryings on in that roomand as they declared this upon their honors there could not remain a doubt upon the subject  and did your grandfather go to bed again in that room said the inquisitive gentleman  thats more than i can tell where he passed the rest of the night was a secret he never disclosed in fact though he had seen much service he was but indifferently acquainted with geography and apt to make blunders in his travels about inns at night that it would have puzzled him sadly to account for in the morning  was he ever apt to walk in his sleep said the knowing old gentleman  never that i heard of     the adventure of the mysterious picture   as one story of the kind produces another and as all the company seemed fully engrossed by the topic and disposed to bring their relatives and ancestors upon the scene there is no knowing how many more ghost adventures we might have heard had not a corpulent old foxhunter who had slept soundly through the whole now suddenly awakened with a loud and longdrawn yawn the sound broke the charm the ghosts took to flight as though it had been cockcrowing and there was a universal move for bed  and now for the haunted chamber said the irish captain taking his candle  aye whos to be the hero of the night said the gentleman with the ruined head  that we shall see in the morning said the old gentleman with the nose whoever looks pale and grizzly will have seen the ghost  well gentlemen said the baronet theres many a true thing said in jest in fact one of you will sleep in a room tonight  whata haunted room a haunted room i claim the adventureand iand iand i cried a dozen guests talking and laughing at the same time  nono said mine host there is a secret about one of my rooms on which i feel disposed to try an experiment so gentlemen none of you shall know who has the haunted chamber until circumstances reveal it i will not even know it myself but will leave it to chance and the allotment of the housekeeper at the same time if it will be any satisfaction to you i will observe for the honor of my paternal mansion that theres scarcely a chamber in it but is well worthy of being haunted  we now separated for the night and each went to his allotted room mine was in one wing of the building and i could not but smile at its resemblance in style to those eventful apartments described in the tales of the supper table it was spacious and gloomy decorated with lampblack portraits a bed of ancient damask with a tester sufficiently lofty to grace a couch of state and a number of massive pieces of oldfashioned furniture i drew a great clawfooted armchair before the wide fireplace stirred up the fire sat looking into it and musing upon the odd stories i had heard until partly overcome by the fatigue of the days hunting and partly by the wine and wassail of mine host i fell asleep in my chair  the uneasiness of my position made my slumber troubled and laid me at the mercy of all kinds of wild and fearful dreams now it was that my perfidious dinner and supper rose in rebellion against my peace i was hagridden by a fat saddle of mutton a plum pudding weighed like lead upon my conscience the merry thought of a capon filled me with horrible suggestions and a devilled leg of a turkey stalked in all kinds of diabolical shapes through my imagination in short i had a violent fit of the nightmare some strange indefinite evil seemed hanging over me that i could not avert something terrible and loathsome oppressed me that i could not shake off i was conscious of being asleep and strove to rouse myself but every effort redoubled the evil until gasping struggling almost strangling i suddenly sprang bolt upright in my chair and awoke  the light on the mantelpiece had burnt low and the wick was divided there was a great winding sheet made by the dripping wax on the side towards me the disordered taper emitted a broad flaring flame and threw a strong light on a painting over the fireplace which i had not hitherto observed  it consisted merely of a head or rather a face that appeared to be staring full upon me and with an expression that was startling it was without a frame and at the first glance i could hardly persuade myself that it was not a real face thrusting itself out of the dark oaken pannel i sat in my chair gazing at it and the more i gazed the more it disquieted me i had never before been affected in the same way by any painting the emotions it caused were strange and indefinite they were something like what i have heard ascribed to the eyes of the basilisk or like that mysterious influence in reptiles termed fascination i passed my hand over my eyes several times as if seeking instinctively to brush away this allusionin vainthey instantly reverted to the picture and its chilling creeping influence over my flesh was redoubled  i looked around the room on other pictures either to divert my attention or to see whether the same effect would be produced by them some of them were grim enough to produce the effect if the mere grimness of the painting produced itno such thing my eye passed over them all with perfect indifference but the moment it reverted to this visage over the fireplace it was as if an electric shock darted through me the other pictures were dim and faded but this one protruded from a plain black ground in the strongest relief and with wonderful truth of coloring the expression was that of agonythe agony of intense bodily pain but a menace scowled upon the brow and a few sprinklings of blood added to its ghastliness yet it was not all these characteristicsit was some horror of the mind some inscrutable antipathy awakened by this picture which harrowed up my feelings  i tried to persuade myself that this was chimerical that my brain was confused by the fumes of mine hosts good cheer and in some measure by the odd stories about paintings which had been told at supper i determined to shake off these vapors of the mind rose from my chair and walked about the room snapped my fingers rallied myself laughed aloud it was a forced laugh and the echo of it in the old chamber jarred upon my ear i walked to the window tried to discern the landscape through the glass it was pitch darkness and howling storm without and as i heard the wind moan among the trees i caught a reflection of this accursed visage in the pane of glass as though it were staring through the window at me even the reflection of it was thrilling  how was this vile nervous fit for such i now persuaded myself it was to be conquered i determined to force myself not to look at the painting but to undress quickly and get into bed i began to undress but in spite of every effort i could not keep myself from stealing a glance every now and then at the picture and a glance was now sufficient to distress me even when my back was turned to it the idea of this strange face behind me peering over my shoulder was insufferable i threw off my clothes and hurried into bed but still this visage gazed upon me i had a full view of it from my bed and for some time could not take my eyes from it i had grown nervous to a dismal degree  i put out the light and tried to force myself to sleepall in vain the fire gleaming up a little threw an uncertain light about the room leaving however the region of the picture in deep shadow what thought i if this be the chamber about which mine host spoke as having a mystery reigning over iti had taken his words merely as spoken in jest might they have a real import i looked around the faintly lighted apartment had all the qualifications requisite for a haunted chamber it began in my infected imagination to assume strange appearances the old portraits turned paler and paler and blacker and blacker the streaks of light and shadow thrown among the quaint old articles of furniture gave them singular shapes and characters there was a huge dark clothespress of antique form gorgeous in brass and lustrous with wax that began to grow oppressive to me  am i then thought i indeed the hero of the haunted room is there really a spell laid upon me or is this all some contrivance of mine host to raise a laugh at my expense the idea of being hagridden by my own fancy all night and then bantered on my haggard looks the next day was intolerable but the very idea was sufficient to produce the effect and to render me still more nervous pish said i it can be no such thing how could my worthy host imagine that i or any man would be so worried by a mere picture it is my own diseased imagination that torments me i turned in my bed and shifted from side to side to try to fall asleep but all in vain when one cannot get asleep by lying quiet it is seldom that tossing about will effect the purpose the fire gradually went out and left the room in darkness still i had the idea of this inexplicable countenance gazing and keeping watch upon me through the darkness nay what was worse the very darkness seemed to give it additional power and to multiply its terrors it was like having an unseen enemy hovering about one in the night instead of having one picture now to worry me i had a hundred i fancied it in every direction and there it is thought iand there and therewith its horrible and mysterious expression still gazing and gazing on me no if i must suffer this strange and dismal influence it were better face a single foe than thus be haunted by a thousand images of it  whoever has been in such a state of nervous agitation must know that the longer it continues the more uncontrollable it grows the very air of the chamber seemed at length infected by the baleful presence of this picture i fancied it hovering over me i almost felt the fearful visage from the wall approaching my faceit seemed breathing upon me this is not to be borne said i at length springing out of bed i can stand this no longer i shall only tumble and toss about here all night make a very spectre of myself and become the hero of the haunted chamber in good earnest whatever be the consequence ill quit this cursed room and seek a nights rest elsewhere they can but laugh at me at all events and theyll be sure to have the laugh upon me if i pass a sleepless night and show them a haggard and wobegone visage in the morning  all this was half muttered to myself as i hastily slipped on my clothes which having done i groped my way out of the room and downstairs to the drawingroom here after tumbling over two or three pieces of furniture i made out to reach a sofa and stretching myself upon it determined to bivouac there for the night  the moment i found myself out of the neighborhood of that strange picture it seemed as if the charm were broken all its influence was at an end i felt assured that it was confined to its own dreary chamber for i had with a sort of instinctive caution turned the key when i closed the door i soon calmed down therefore into a state of tranquillity from that into a drowsiness and finally into a deep sleep out of which i did not awake until the housemaid with her besom and her matin song came to put the room in order she stared at finding me stretched upon the sofa but i presume circumstances of the kind were not uncommon after hunting dinners in her masters bachelor establishment for she went on with her song and her work and took no farther heed of me  i had an unconquerable repugnance to return to my chamber so i found my way to the butlers quarters made my toilet in the best way circumstances would permit and was among the first to appear at the breakfast table our breakfast was a substantial foxhunters repast and the company were generally assembled at it when ample justice had been done to the tea coffee cold meats and humming ale for all these were furnished in abundance according to the tastes of the different guests the conversation began to break out with all the liveliness and freshness of morning mirth  but who is the hero of the haunted chamberwho has seen the ghost last night said the inquisitive gentleman rolling his lobster eyes about the table  the question set every tongue in motion a vast deal of bantering criticising of countenances of mutual accusation and retort took place some had drunk deep and some were unshaven so that there were suspicious faces enough in the assembly i alone could not enter with ease and vivacity into the joke i felt tonguetiedembarrassed a recollection of what i had seen and felt the preceding night still haunted my mind  it seemed as if the mysterious picture still held a thrall upon me i thought also that our hosts eye was turned on me with an air of curiosity in short i was conscious that i was the hero of the night and felt as if every one might read it in my looks  the jokes however passed over and no suspicion seemed to attach to me i was just congratulating myself on my escape when a servant came in saying that the gentleman who had slept on the sofa in the drawingroom had left his watch under one of the pillows my repeater was in his hand  what said the inquisitive gentleman did any gentleman sleep on the sofa  soho soho a harea hare cried the old gentleman with the flexible nose  i could not avoid acknowledging the watch and was rising in great confusion when a boisterous old squire who sat beside me exclaimed slapping me on the shoulder sblood lad thourt the man as has seen the ghost  the attention of the company was immediately turned to me if my face had been pale the moment before it now glowed almost to burning i tried to laugh but could only make a grimace and found all the muscles of my face twitching at sixes and sevens and totally out of all control  it takes but little to raise a laugh among a set of foxhunters there was a world of merriment and joking at my expense and as i never relished a joke overmuch when it was at my own expense i began to feel a little nettled i tried to look cool and calm and to restrain my pique but the coolness and calmness of a man in a passion are confounded treacherous  gentlemen said i with a slight cocking of the chin and a bad attempt at a smile this is all very pleasantha havery pleasantbut id have you know i am as little superstitious as any of youha haand as to anything like timidityyou may smile gentlemenbut i trust there is no one here means to insinuate thatas to a rooms being haunted i repeat gentlemengrowing a little warm at seeing a cursed grin breaking out round meas to a rooms being haunted i have as little faith in such silly stories as any one but since you put the matter home to me i will say that i have met with something in my room strange and inexplicable to mea shout of laughter gentlemen i am seriousi know well what i am sayingi am calm gentlemen striking my flat upon the tableby heaven i am calm i am neither trifling nor do i wish to be trifled withthe laughter of the company suppressed with ludicrous attempts at gravity there is a picture in the room in which i was put last night that has had an effect upon me the most singular and incomprehensible  a picture said the old gentleman with the haunted head a picture cried the narrator with the waggish nose a picture a picture echoed several voices here there was an ungovernable peal of laughter  i could not contain myself i started up from my seatlooked round on the company with fiery indignationthrust both my hands into my pockets and strode up to one of the windows as though i would have walked through it i stopped short looked out upon the landscape without distinguishing a feature of it and felt my gorge rising almost to suffocation  mine host saw it was time to interfere he had maintained an air of gravity through the whole of the scene and now stepped forth as if to shelter me from the overwhelming merriment of my companions  gentlemen said he i dislike to spoil sport but you have had your laugh and the joke of the haunted chamber has been enjoyed i must now take the part of my guest i must not only vindicate him from your pleasantries but i must reconcile him to himself for i suspect he is a little out of humor with his own feelings and above all i must crave his pardon for having made him the subject of a kind of experiment  yes gentlemen there is something strange and peculiar in the chamber to which our friend was shown last night there is a picture which possesses a singular and mysterious influence and with which there is connected a very curious story it is a picture to which i attach a value from a variety of circumstances and though i have often been tempted to destroy it from the odd and uncomfortable sensations it produces in every one that beholds it yet i have never been able to prevail upon myself to make the sacrifice it is a picture i never like to look upon myself and which is held in awe by all my servants i have therefore banished it to a room but rarely used and should have had it covered last night had not the nature of our conversation and the whimsical talk about a haunted chamber tempted me to let it remain by way of experiment whether a stranger totally unacquainted with its story would be affected by it  the words of the baronet had turned every thought into a different channel all were anxious to hear the story of the mysterious picture and for myself so strongly were my feelings interested that i forgot to feel piqued at the experiment which my host had made upon my nerves and joined eagerly in the general entreaty  as the morning was stormy and precluded all egress my host was glad of any means of entertaining his company so drawing his armchair beside the fire he began     the adventure of the mysterious stranger   many years since when i was a young man and had just left oxford i was sent on the grand tour to finish my education i believe my parents had tried in vain to inoculate me with wisdom so they sent me to mingle with society in hopes i might take it the natural way such at least appears to be the reason for which ninetenths of our youngsters are sent abroad  in the course of my tour i remained some time at venice the romantic character of the place delighted me i was very much amused by the air of adventure and intrigue that prevailed in this region of masks and gondolas and i was exceedingly smitten by a pair of languishing black eyes that played upon my heart from under an italian mantle so i persuaded myself that i was lingering at venice to study men and manners at least i persuaded my friends so and that answered all my purpose indeed i was a little prone to be struck by peculiarities in character and conduct and my imagination was so full of romantic associations with italy that i was always on the lookout for adventure  every thing chimed in with such a humor in this old mermaid of a city my suite of apartments were in a proud melancholy palace on the grand canal formerly the residence of a magnifico and sumptuous with the traces of decayed grandeur my gondolier was one of the shrewdest of his class active merry intelligent and like his brethren secret as the grave that is to say secret to all the world except his master i had not had him a week before he put me behind all the curtains in venice i liked the silence and mystery of the place and when i sometimes saw from my window a black gondola gliding mysteriously along in the dusk of the evening with nothing visible but its little glimmering lantern i would jump into my own zenduletto and give a signal for pursuit but i am running away from my subject with the recollection of youthful follies said the baronet checking himself let me come to the point  among my familiar resorts was a cassino under the arcades on one side of the grand square of st mark here i used frequently to lounge and take my ice on those warm summer nights when in italy every body lives abroad until morning i was seated here one evening when a group of italians took seat at a table on the opposite side of the saloon their conversation was gay and animated and carried on with italian vivacity and gesticulation  i remarked among them one young man however who appeared to take no share and find no enjoyment in the conversation though he seemed to force himself to attend to it he was tall and slender and of extremely prepossessing appearance his features were fine though emaciated he had a profusion of black glossy hair that curled lightly about his head and contrasted with the extreme paleness of his countenance his brow was haggard deep furrows seemed to have been ploughed into his visage by care not by age for he was evidently in the prime of youth his eye was full of expression and fire but wild and unsteady he seemed to be tormented by some strange fancy or apprehension in spite of every effort to fix his attention on the conversation of his companions i noticed that every now and then he would turn his head slowly round give a glance over his shoulder and then withdraw it with a sudden jerk as if something painful had met his eye this was repeated at intervals of about a minute and he appeared hardly to have got over one shock before i saw him slowly preparing to encounter another  after sitting some time in the cassino the party paid for the refreshments they had taken and departed the young man was the last to leave the saloon and i remarked him glancing behind him in the same way just as he passed out at the door i could not resist the impulse to rise and follow him for i was at an age when a romantic feeling of curiosity is easily awakened the party walked slowly down the arcades talking and laughing as they went they crossed the piazzetta but paused in the middle of it to enjoy the scene it was one of those moonlight nights so brilliant and clear in the pure atmosphere of italy the moonbeams streamed on the tall tower of st mark and lighted up the magnificent front and swelling domes of the cathedral the party expressed their delight in animated terms i kept my eye upon the young man he alone seemed abstracted and selfoccupied i noticed the same singular and as it were furtive glance over the shoulder that had attracted my attention in the cassino the party moved on and i followed they passed along the walks called the broglio turned the corner of the ducal palace and getting into a gondola glided swiftly away  the countenance and conduct of this young man dwelt upon my mind there was something in his appearance that interested me exceedingly i met him a day or two after in a gallery of paintings he was evidently a connoisseur for he always singled out the most masterly productions and the few remarks drawn from him by his companions showed an intimate acquaintance with the art his own taste however ran on singular extremes on salvator rosa in his most savage and solitary scenes on raphael titian and corregio in their softest delineations of female beauty on these he would occasionally gaze with transient enthusiasm but this seemed only a momentary forgetfulness still would recur that cautious glance behind and always quickly withdrawn as though something terrible had met his view  i encountered him frequently afterwards at the theatre at balls at concerts at the promenades in the gardens of san georgio at the grotesque exhibitions in the square of st mark among the throng of merchants on the exchange by the rialto he seemed in fact to seek crowds to hunt after bustle and amusement yet never to take any interest in either the business or gayety of the scene ever an air of painful thought of wretched abstraction and ever that strange and recurring movement of glancing fearfully over the shoulder i did not know at first but this might be caused by apprehension of arrest or perhaps from dread of assassination but if so why should he go thus continually abroad why expose himself at all times and in all places  i became anxious to know this stranger i was drawn to him by that romantic sympathy that sometimes draws young men towards each other his melancholy threw a charm about him in my eyes which was no doubt heightened by the touching expression of his countenance and the manly graces of his person for manly beauty has its effect even upon man i had an englishmans habitual diffidence and awkwardness of address to contend with but i subdued it and from frequently meeting him in the cassino gradually edged myself into his acquaintance i had no reserve on his part to contend with he seemed on the contrary to court society and in fact to seek anything rather than be alone  when he found i really took an interest in him he threw himself entirely upon my friendship he clung to me like a drowning man he would walk with me for hours up and down the place of st markor he would sit until night was far advanced in my apartment he took rooms under the same roof with me and his constant request was that i would permit him when it did not incommode me to sit by me in my saloon it was not that he seemed to take a particular delight in my conversation but rather that he craved the vicinity of a human being and above all of a being that sympathized with him i have often heard said he of the sincerity of englishmenthank god i have one at length for a friend  yet he never seemed disposed to avail himself of my sympathy other than by mere companionship he never sought to unbosom himself to me there appeared to be a settled corroding anguish in his bosom that neither could be soothed by silence nor by speaking a devouring melancholy preyed upon his heart and seemed to be drying up the very blood in his veins it was not a soft melancholythe disease of the affections but a parching withering agony i could see at times that his mouth was dry and feverish he almost panted rather than breathed his eyes were bloodshot his cheeks pale and livid with now and then faint streaks athwart thembaleful gleams of the fire that was consuming his heart as my arm was within his i felt him press it at times with a convulsive motion to his side his hands would clinch themselves involuntarily and a kind of shudder would run through his frame i reasoned with him about his melancholy and sought to draw from him the causehe shrunk from all confiding do not seek to know it said he you could not relieve it if you knew it you would not even seek to relieve iton the contrary i should lose your sympathy and that said he pressing my hand convulsively that i feel has become too dear to me to risk  i endeavored to awaken hope within him he was young life had a thousand pleasures in store for him there is a healthy reaction in the youthful heart it medicines its own wounds  come come said i there is no grief so great that youth cannot outgrow itno no said he clinching his teeth and striking repeatedly with the energy of despair upon his bosomit is hereheredeeprooted draining my hearts blood it grows and grows while my heart withers and withers i have a dreadful monitor that gives me no reposethat follows me step by step and will follow me step by step until it pushes me into my grave  as he said this he gave involuntarily one of those fearful glances over his shoulder and shrunk back with more than usual horror i could not resist the temptation to allude to this movement which i supposed to be some mere malady of the nerves the moment i mentioned it his face became crimsoned and convulsedhe grasped me by both hands for gods sake exclaimed he with a piercing agony of voicenever allude to that again let us avoid this subject my friend you cannot relieve me indeed you cannot relieve me but you may add to the torments i sufferat some future day you shall know all  i never resumed the subject for however much my curiosity might be aroused i felt too true compassion for his sufferings to increase them by my intrusion i sought various ways to divert his mind and to arouse him from the constant meditations in which he was plunged he saw my efforts and seconded them as far as in his power for there was nothing moody or wayward in his nature on the contrary there was something frank generous unassuming in his whole deportment all the sentiments that he uttered were noble and lofty he claimed no indulgence he asked no toleration he seemed content to carry his load of misery in silence and only sought to carry it by my side there was a mute beseeching manner about him as if he craved companionship as a charitable boon and a tacit thankfulness in his looks as if he felt grateful to me for not repulsing him  i felt this melancholy to be infectious it stole over my spirits interfered with all my gay pursuits and gradually saddened my life yet i could not prevail upon myself to shake off a being who seemed to hang upon me for support in truth the generous traits of character that beamed through all this gloom had penetrated to my heart his bounty was lavish and openhanded his charity melting and spontaneous not confined to mere donations which often humiliate as much as they relieve the tone of his voice the beam of his eye enhanced every gift and surprised the poor suppliant with that rarest and sweetest of charities the charity not merely of the hand but of the heart indeed his liberality seemed to have something in it of selfabasement and expiation he humbled himself in a manner before the mendicant what right have i to ease and affluence would he murmur to himself when innocence wanders in misery and rags  the carnival time arrived i had hoped that the gay scenes which then presented themselves might have some cheering effect i mingled with him in the motley throng that crowded the place of st mark we frequented operas masquerades balls all in vain the evil kept growing on him he became more and more haggard and agitated often after we had returned from one of these scenes of revelry i have entered his room and found him lying on his face on the sofa his hands clinched in his fine hair and his whole countenance bearing traces of the convulsions of his mind  the carnival passed away the season of lent succeeded passion week arrived we attended one evening a solemn service in one of the churches in the course of which a grand piece of vocal and instrumental music was performed relating to the death of our saviour  i had remarked that he was always powerfully affected by music on this occasion he was so in an extraordinary degree as the peeling notes swelled through the lofty aisles he seemed to kindle up with fervor his eyes rolled upwards until nothing but the whites were visible his hands were clasped together until the fingers were deeply imprinted in the flesh when the music expressed the dying agony his face gradually sunk upon his knees and at the touching words resounding through the church jesu mori sobs burst from him uncontrolled i had never seen him weep before his had always been agony rather than sorrow i augured well from the circumstance i let him weep on uninterrupted when the service was ended we left the church he hung on my arm as we walked homewards with something of a softer and more subdued manner instead of that nervous agitation i had been accustomed to witness he alluded to the service we had heard music said he is indeed the voice of heaven never before have i felt more impressed by the story of the atonement of our saviour yes my friend said he clasping his hands with a kind of transport i know that my redeemer liveth  we parted for the night his room was not far from mine and i heard him for some time busied in it i fell asleep but was awakened before daylight the young man stood by my bedside dressed for travelling he held a sealed packet and a large parcel in his hand which he laid on the table farewell my friend said he i am about to set forth on a long journey but before i go i leave with you these remembrances in this packet you will find the particulars of my story when you read them i shall be far away do not remember me with aversion you have been indeed a friend to me you have poured oil into a broken heartbut you could not heal itfarewelllet me kiss your handi am unworthy to embrace you he sunk on his knees seized my hand in despite of my efforts to the contrary and covered it with kisses i was so surprised by all this scene that i had not been able to say a word  but we shall meet again said i hastily as i saw him hurrying towards the door  nevernever in this world said he solemnly he sprang once more to my bedsideseized my hand pressed it to his heart and to his lips and rushed out of the room  here the baronet paused he seemed lost in thought and sat looking upon the floor and drumming with his fingers on the arm of his chair  and did this mysterious personage return said the inquisitive gentleman never replied the baronet with a pensive shake of the head i never saw him again and pray what has all this to do with the picture inquired the old gentleman with the nosetrue said the questioneris it the portrait of this crackbrained italian no said the baronet drily not half liking the appellation given to his hero but this picture was inclosed in the parcel he left with me the sealed packet contained its explanation there was a request on the outside that i would not open it until six months had elapsed i kept my promise in spite of my curiosity i have a translation of it by me and had meant to read it by way of accounting for the mystery of the chamber but i fear i have already detained the company too long  here there was a general wish expressed to have the manuscript read particularly on the part of the inquisitive gentleman so the worthy baronet drew out a fairly written manuscript and wiping his spectacles read aloud the following story     the story of the young italian   i was born at naples my parents though of noble rank were limited in fortune or rather my father was ostentatious beyond his means and expended so much in his palace his equipage and his retinue that he was continually straitened in his pecuniary circumstances i was a younger son and looked upon with indifference by my father who from a principle of family pride wished to leave all his property to my elder brother  i showed when quite a child an extreme sensibility every thing affected me violently while yet an infant in my mothers arms and before i had learnt to talk i could be wrought upon to a wonderful degree of anguish or delight by the power of music as i grew older my feelings remained equally acute and i was easily transported into paroxysms of pleasure or rage it was the amusement of my relatives and of the domestics to play upon this irritable temperament i was moved to tears tickled to laughter provoked to fury for the entertainment of company who were amused by such a tempest of mighty passion in a pigmy frame they little thought or perhaps little heeded the dangerous sensibilities they were fostering i thus became a little creature of passion before reason was developed in a short time i grew too old to be a plaything and then i became a torment the tricks and passions i had been teased into became irksome and i was disliked by my teachers for the very lessons they had taught me  my mother died and my power as a spoiled child was at an end there was no longer any necessity to humor or tolerate me for there was nothing to be gained by it as i was no favorite of my father i therefore experienced the fate of a spoiled child in such situation and was neglected or noticed only to be crossed and contradicted such was the early treatment of a heart which if i am judge of it at all was naturally disposed to the extremes of tenderness and affection  my father as i have already said never liked mein fact he never understood me he looked upon me as wilful and wayward as deficient in natural affectionit was the stateliness of his own manner the loftiness and grandeur of his own look that had repelled me from his arms i always pictured him to myself as i had seen him clad in his senatorial robes rustling with pomp and pride the magnificence of his person had daunted my strong imagination i could never approach him with the confiding affection of a child  my fathers feelings were wrapped up in my elder brother he was to be the inheritor of the family title and the family dignity and every thing was sacrificed to himi as well as every thing else it was determined to devote me to the church that so my humors and myself might be removed out of the way either of tasking my fathers time and trouble or interfering with the interests of my brother at an early age therefore before my mind had dawned upon the world and its delights or known any thing of it beyond the precincts of my fathers palace i was sent to a convent the superior of which was my uncle and was confided entirely to his care  my uncle was a man totally estranged from the world he had never relished for he had never tasted its pleasures and he deemed rigid selfdenial as the great basis of christian virtue he considered every ones temperament like his own or at least he made them conform to it his character and habits had an influence over the fraternity of which he was superior a more gloomy saturnine set of beings were never assembled together the convent too was calculated to awaken sad and solitary thoughts it was situated in a gloomy gorge of those mountains away south of vesuvius all distant views were shut out by sterile volcanic heights a mountain stream raved beneath its walls and eagles screamed about its turrets  i had been sent to this place at so tender an age as soon to lose all distinct recollection of the scenes i had left behind as my mind expanded therefore it formed its idea of the world from the convent and its vicinity and a dreary world it appeared to me an early tinge of melancholy was thus infused into my character and the dismal stories of the monks about devils and evil spirits with which they affrighted my young imagination gave me a tendency to superstition which i could never effectually shake off they took the same delight to work upon my ardent feelings that had been so mischievously exercised by my fathers household  i can recollect the horrors with which they fed my heated fancy during an eruption of vesuvius we were distant from that volcano with mountains between us but its convulsive throes shook the solid foundations of nature earthquakes threatened to topple down our convent towers a lurid baleful light hung in the heavens at night and showers of ashes borne by the wind fell in our narrow valley the monks talked of the earth being honeycombed beneath us of streams of molten lava raging through its veins of caverns of sulphurous flames roaring in the centre the abodes of demons and the damned of fiery gulfs ready to yawn beneath our feet all these tales were told to the doleful accompaniment of the mountains thunders whose low bellowing made the walls of our convent vibrate  one of the monks had been a painter but had retired from the world and embraced this dismal life in expiation of some crime he was a melancholy man who pursued his art in the solitude of his cell but made it a source of penance to him his employment was to portray either on canvas or in waxen models the human face and human form in the agonies of death and in all the stages of dissolution and decay the fearful mysteries of the charnel house were unfolded in his laborsthe loathsome banquet of the beetle and the wormi turn with shuddering even from the recollection of his works yet at that time my strong but illdirected imagination seized with ardor upon his instructions in his art any thing was a variety from the dry studies and monotonous duties of the cloister in a little while i became expert with my pencil and my gloomy productions were thought worthy of decorating some of the altars of the chapel  in this dismal way was a creature of feeling and fancy brought up every thing genial and amiable in my nature was repressed and nothing brought out but what was unprofitable and ungracious i was ardent in my temperament quick mercurial impetuous formed to be a creature all love and adoration but a leaden hand was laid on all my finer qualities i was taught nothing but fear and hatred i hated my uncle i hated the monks i hated the convent in which i was immured i hated the world and i almost hated myself for being as i supposed so hating and hateful an animal  when i had nearly attained the age of sixteen i was suffered on one occasion to accompany one of the brethren on a mission to a distant part of the country we soon left behind us the gloomy valley in which i had been pent up for so many years and after a short journey among the mountains emerged upon the voluptuous landscape that spreads itself about the bay of naples heavens how transported was i when i stretched my gaze over a vast reach of delicious sunny country gay with groves and vineyards with vesuvius rearing its forked summit to my right the blue mediterranean to my left with its enchanting coast studded with shining towns and sumptuous villas and naples my native naples gleaming far far in the distance  good god was this the lovely world from which i had been excluded i had reached that age when the sensibilities are in all their bloom and freshness mine had been checked and chilled they now burst forth with the suddenness of a retarded spring my heart hitherto unnaturally shrunk up expanded into a riot of vague but delicious emotions the beauty of nature intoxicated bewildered me the song of the peasants their cheerful looks their happy avocations the picturesque gayety of their dresses their rustic music their dances all broke upon me like witchcraft my soul responded to the music my heart danced in my bosom all the men appeared amiable all the women lovely  i returned to the convent that is to say my body returned but my heart and soul never entered there again i could not forget this glimpse of a beautiful and a happy world a world so suited to my natural character i had felt so happy while in it so different a being from what i felt myself while in the conventthat tomb of the living i contrasted the countenances of the beings i had seen full of fire and freshness and enjoyment with the pallid leaden lacklustre visages of the monks the music of the dance with the droning chant of the chapel i had before found the exercises of the cloister wearisome they now became intolerable the dull round of duties wore away my spirit my nerves became irritated by the fretful tinkling of the convent bell evermore dinging among the mountain echoes evermore calling me from my repose at night my pencil by day to attend to some tedious and mechanical ceremony of devotion  i was not of a nature to meditate long without putting my thoughts into action my spirit had been suddenly aroused and was now all awake within me i watched my opportunity fled from the convent and made my way on foot to naples as i entered its gay and crowded streets and beheld the variety and stir of life around me the luxury of palaces the splendor of equipages and the pantomimic animation of the motley populace i seemed as if awakened to a world of enchantment and solemnly vowed that nothing should force me back to the monotony of the cloister  i had to inquire my way to my fathers palace for i had been so young on leaving it that i knew not its situation i found some difficulty in getting admitted to my fathers presence for the domestics scarcely knew that there was such a being as myself in existence and my monastic dress did not operate in my favor even my father entertained no recollection of my person i told him my name threw myself at his feet implored his forgiveness and entreated that i might not be sent back to the convent  he received me with the condescension of a patron rather than the kindness of a parent he listened patiently but coldly to my tale of monastic grievances and disgusts and promised to think what else could be done for me this coldness blighted and drove back all the frank affection of my nature that was ready to spring forth at the least warmth of parental kindness all my early feelings towards my father revived i again looked up to him as the stately magnificent being that had daunted my childish imagination and felt as if i had no pretensions to his sympathies my brother engrossed all his care and love he inherited his nature and carried himself towards me with a protecting rather than a fraternal air it wounded my pride which was great i could brook condescension from my father for i looked up to him with awe as a superior being but i could not brook patronage from a brother who i felt was intellectually my inferior the servants perceived that i was an unwelcome intruder in the paternal mansion and meniallike they treated me with neglect thus baffled at every point my affections outraged wherever they would attach themselves i became sullen silent and despondent my feelings driven back upon myself entered and preyed upon my own heart i remained for some days an unwelcome guest rather than a restored son in my fathers house i was doomed never to be properly known there i was made by wrong treatment strange even to myself and they judged of me from my strangeness  i was startled one day at the sight of one of the monks of my convent gliding out of my fathers room he saw me but pretended not to notice me and this very hypocrisy made me suspect something i had become sore and susceptible in my feelings every thing inflicted a wound on them in this state of mind i was treated with marked disrespect by a pampered minion the favorite servant of my father all the pride and passion of my nature rose in an instant and i struck him to the earth  my father was passing by he stopped not to inquire the reason nor indeed could he read the long course of mental sufferings which were the real cause he rebuked me with anger and scorn he summoned all the haughtiness of his nature and grandeur of his look to give weight to the contumely with which he treated me i felt i had not deserved iti felt that i was not appreciatedi felt that i had that within me which merited better treatment my heart swelled against a fathers injustice i broke through my habitual awe of him i replied to him with impatience my hot spirit flushed in my cheek and kindled in my eye but my sensitive heart swelled as quickly and before i had half vented my passion i felt it suffocated and quenched in my tears my father was astonished and incensed at this turning of the worm and ordered me to my chamber i retired in silence choking with contending emotions  i had not been long there when i overheard voices in an adjoining apartment it was a consultation between my father and the monk about the means of getting me back quietly to the convent my resolution was taken i had no longer a home nor a father that very night i left the paternal roof i got on board a vessel about making sail from the harbor and abandoned myself to the wide world no matter to what port she steered any part of so beautiful a world was better than my convent no matter where i was cast by fortune any place would be more a home to me than the home i had left behind the vessel was bound to genoa we arrived there after a voyage of a few days  as i entered the harbor between the moles which embrace it and beheld the amphitheatre of palaces and churches and splendid gardens rising one above another i felt at once its title to the appellation of genoa the superb i landed on the mole an utter stranger without knowing what to do or whither to direct my steps no matter i was released from the thraldom of the convent and the humiliations of home when i traversed the strada balbi and the strada nuova those streets of palaces and gazed at the wonders of architecture around me when i wandered at close of day amid a gay throng of the brilliant and the beautiful through the green alleys of the aqua verdi or among the colonnades and terraces of the magnificent doria gardens i thought it impossible to be ever otherwise than happy in genoa  a few days sufficed to show me my mistake my scanty purse was exhausted and for the first time in my life i experienced the sordid distress of penury i had never known the want of money and had never adverted to the possibility of such an evil i was ignorant of the world and all its ways and when first the idea of destitution came over my mind its effect was withering i was wandering pensively through the streets which no longer delighted my eyes when chance led my stops into the magnificent church of the annunciata  a celebrated painter of the day was at that moment superintending the placing of one of his pictures over an altar the proficiency which i had acquired in his art during my residence in the convent had made me an enthusiastic amateur i was struck at the first glance with the painting it was the face of a madonna so innocent so lovely such a divine expression of maternal tenderness i lost for the moment all recollection of myself in the enthusiasm of my art i clasped my hands together and uttered an ejaculation of delight the painter perceived my emotion he was flattered and gratified by it my air and manner pleased him and he accosted me i felt too much the want of friendship to repel the advances of a stranger and there was something in this one so benevolent and winning that in a moment he gained my confidence  i told him my story and my situation concealing only my name and rank he appeared strongly interested by my recital invited me to his house and from that time i became his favorite pupil he thought he perceived in me extraordinary talents for the art and his encomiums awakened all my ardor what a blissful period of my existence was it that i passed beneath his roof another being seemed created within me or rather all that was amiable and excellent was drawn out i was as recluse as ever i had been at the convent but how different was my seclusion my time was spent in storing my mind with lofty and poetical ideas in meditating on all that was striking and noble in history or fiction in studying and tracing all that was sublime and beautiful in nature i was always a visionary imaginative being but now my reveries and imaginings all elevated me to rapture  i looked up to my master as to a benevolent genius that had opened to me a region of enchantment i became devotedly attached to him he was not a native of genoa but had been drawn thither by the solicitation of several of the nobility and had resided there but a few years for the completion of certain works he had undertaken his health was delicate and he had to confide much of the filling up of his designs to the pencils of his scholars he considered me as particularly happy in delineating the human countenance in seizing upon characteristic though fleeting expressions and fixing them powerfully upon my canvas i was employed continually therefore in sketching faces and often when some particular grace or beauty or expression was wanted in a countenance it was entrusted to my pencil my benefactor was fond of bringing me forward and partly perhaps through my actual skill and partly by his partial praises i began to be noted for the expression of my countenances  among the various works which he had undertaken was an historical piece for one of the palaces of genoa in which were to be introduced the likenesses of several of the family among these was one entrusted to my pencil it was that of a young girl who as yet was in a convent for her education she came out for the purpose of sitting for the picture i first saw her in an apartment of one of the sumptuous palaces of genoa she stood before a casement that looked out upon the bay a stream of vernal sunshine fell upon her and shed a kind of glory round her as it lit up the rich crimson chamber she was but sixteen years of ageand oh how lovely the scene broke upon me like a mere vision of spring and youth and beauty i could have fallen down and worshipped her she was like one of those fictions of poets and painters when they would express the beau ideal that haunts their minds with shapes of indescribable perfection  i was permitted to sketch her countenance in various positions and i fondly protracted the study that was undoing me the more i gazed on her the more i became enamoured there was something almost painful in my intense admiration i was but nineteen years of age shy diffident and inexperienced i was treated with attention and encouragement for my youth and my enthusiasm in my art had won favor for me and i am inclined to think that there was something in my air and manner that inspired interest and respect still the kindness with which i was treated could not dispel the embarrassment into which my own imagination threw me when in presence of this lovely being it elevated her into something almost more than mortal she seemed too exquisite for earthly use too delicate and exalted for human attainment as i sat tracing her charms on my canvas with my eyes occasionally riveted on her features i drank in delicious poison that made me giddy my heart alternately gushed with tenderness and ached with despair now i became more than ever sensible of the violent fires that had lain dormant at the bottom of my soul you who are born in a more temperate climate and under a cooler sky have little idea of the violence of passion in our southern bosoms  a few days finished my task bianca returned to her convent but her image remained indelibly impressed upon my heart it dwelt on my imagination it became my pervading idea of beauty it had an effect even upon my pencil i became noted for my felicity in depicting female loveliness it was but because i multiplied the image of bianca i soothed and yet fed my fancy by introducing her in all the productions of my master i have stood with delight in one of the chapels of the annunciata and heard the crowd extol the seraphic beauty of a saint which i had painted i have seen them bow down in adoration before the painting they were bowing before the loveliness of bianca  i existed in this kind of dream i might almost say delirium for upwards of a year such is the tenacity of my imagination that the image which was formed in it continued in all its power and freshness indeed i was a solitary meditative being much given to reverie and apt to foster ideas which had once taken strong possession of me i was roused from this fond melancholy delicious dream by the death of my worthy benefactor i cannot describe the pangs his death occasioned me it left me alone and almost brokenhearted he bequeathed to me his little property which from the liberality of his disposition and his expensive style of living was indeed but small and he most particularly recommended me in dying to the protection of a nobleman who had been his patron  the latter was a man who passed for munificent he was a lover and an encourager of the arts and evidently wished to be thought so he fancied he saw in me indications of future excellence my pencil had already attracted attention he took me at once under his protection seeing that i was overwhelmed with grief and incapable of exerting myself in the mansion of my late benefactor he invited me to sojourn for a time in a villa which he possessed on the border of the sea in the picturesque neighborhood of sestri de ponenti  i found at the villa the counts only son filippo he was nearly of my age prepossessing in his appearance and fascinating in his manners he attached himself to me and seemed to court my good opinion i thought there was something of profession in his kindness and of caprice in his disposition but i had nothing else near me to attach myself to and my heart felt the need of something to repose itself upon his education had been neglected he looked upon me as his superior in mental powers and acquirements and tacitly acknowledged my superiority i felt that i was his equal in birth and that gave an independence to my manner which had its effect the caprice and tyranny i saw sometimes exercised on others over whom he had power were never manifested towards me we became intimate friends and frequent companions still i loved to be alone and to indulge in the reveries of my own imagination among the beautiful scenery by which i was surrounded  the villa stood in the midst of ornamented grounds finely decorated with statues and fountains and laid out into groves and alleys and shady bowers it commanded a wide view of the mediterranean and the picturesque ligurian coast every thing was assembled here that could gratify the taste or agreeably occupy the mind soothed by the tranquillity of this elegant retreat the turbulence of my feelings gradually subsided and blending with the romantic spell that still reigned over my imagination produced a soft voluptuous melancholy  i had not been long under the roof of the count when our solitude was enlivened by another inhabitant it was a daughter of a relation of the count who had lately died in reduced circumstances bequeathing this only child to his protection i had heard much of her beauty from filippo but my fancy had become so engrossed by one idea of beauty as not to admit of any other we were in the central saloon of the villa when she arrived she was still in mourning and approached leaning on the counts arm as they ascended the marble portico i was struck by the elegance of her figure and movement by the grace with which the mezzaro the bewitching veil of genoa was folded about her slender form  they entered heavens what was my surprise when i beheld bianca before me it was herself pale with grief but still more matured in loveliness than when i had last beheld her the time that had elapsed had developed the graces of her person and the sorrow she had undergone had diffused over her countenance an irresistible tenderness  she blushed and trembled at seeing me and tears rushed into her eyes for she remembered in whose company she had been accustomed to behold me for my part i cannot express what were my emotions by degrees i overcame the extreme shyness that had formerly paralyzed me in her presence we were drawn together by sympathy of situation we had each lost our best friend in the world we were each in some measure thrown upon the kindness of others when i came to know her intellectually all my ideal picturings of her were confirmed her newness to the world her delightful susceptibility to every thing beautiful and agreeable in nature reminded me of my own emotions when first i escaped from the convent her rectitude of thinking delighted my judgment the sweetness of her nature wrapped itself around my heart and then her young and tender and budding loveliness sent a delicious madness to my brain  i gazed upon her with a kind of idolatry as something more than mortal and i felt humiliated at the idea of my comparative unworthiness yet she was mortal and one of mortalitys most susceptible and loving compounds for she loved me  how first i discovered the transporting truth i cannot recollect i believe it stole upon me by degrees as a wonder past hope or belief we were both at such a tender and loving age in constant intercourse with each other mingling in the same elegant pursuits for music poetry and painting were our mutual delights and we were almost separated from society among lovely and romantic scenery is it strange that two young hearts thus brought together should readily twine round each other  oh gods what a dreama transient dream of unalloyed delight then passed over my soul then it was that the world around me was indeed a paradise for i had a womanlovely delicious woman to share it with me how often have i rambled over the picturesque shores of sestri or climbed its wild mountains with the coast gemmed with villas and the blue sea far below me and the slender pharo of genoa on its romantic promontory in the distance and as i sustained the faltering steps of bianca have thought there could no unhappiness enter into so beautiful a world why oh why is this budding season of life and love so transientwhy is this rosy cloud of love that sheds such a glow over the morning of our days so prone to brew up into the whirlwind and the storm  i was the first to awaken from this blissful delirium of the affections i had gained biancas heart what was i to do with it i had no wealth nor prospects to entitle me to her hand was i to take advantage of her ignorance of the world of her confiding affection and draw her down to my own poverty was this requiting the hospitality of the countwas this requiting the love of bianca  now first i began to feel that even successful love may have its bitterness a corroding care gathered about my heart i moved about the palace like a guilty being i felt as if i had abused its hospitalityas if i were a thief within its walls i could no longer look with unembarrassed mien in the countenance of the count i accused myself of perfidy to him and i thought he read it in my looks and began to distrust and despise me his manner had always been ostentatious and condescending it now appeared cold and haughty filippo too became reserved and distant or at least i suspected him to be so heavenswas this mere coinage of my brain was i to become suspicious of all the worlda poor surmising wretch watching looks and gestures and torturing myself with misconstructions or if truewas i to remain beneath a roof where i was merely tolerated and linger there on sufferance this is not to be endured exclaimed i i will tear myself from this state of selfabasement i will break through this fascination and flyflywhitherfrom the worldfor where is the world when i leave bianca behind me  my spirit was naturally proud and swelled within me at the idea of being looked upon with contumely many times i was on the point of declaring my family and rank and asserting my equality in the presence of bianca when i thought her relatives assumed an air of superiority but the feeling was transient i considered myself discarded and contemned by my family and had solemnly vowed never to own relationship to them until they themselves should claim it  the struggle of my mind preyed upon my happiness and my health it seemed as if the uncertainty of being loved would be less intolerable than thus to be assured of it and yet not dare to enjoy the conviction i was no longer the enraptured admirer of bianca i no longer hung in ecstasy on the tones of her voice nor drank in with insatiate gaze the beauty of her countenance her very smiles ceased to delight me for i felt culpable in having won them  she could not but be sensible of the change in me and inquired the cause with her usual frankness and simplicity i could not evade the inquiry for my heart was full to aching i told her all the conflict of my soul my devouring passion my bitter selfupbraiding yes said i i am unworthy of you i am an offcast from my familya wanderera nameless homeless wanderer with nothing but poverty for my portion and yet i have dared to love youhave dared to aspire to your love  my agitation moved her to tears but she saw nothing in my situation so hopeless as i had depicted it brought up in a convent she knew nothing of the world its wants its caresand indeed what woman is a worldly casuist in matters of the heartnay moreshe kindled into a sweet enthusiasm when she spoke of my fortunes and myself we had dwelt together on the works of the famous masters i had related to her their histories the high reputation the influence the magnificence to which they had attainedthe companions of princes the favorites of kings the pride and boast of nations all this she applied to me her love saw nothing in their greatest productions that i was not able to achieve and when i saw the lovely creature glow with fervor and her whole countenance radiant with the visions of my glory which seemed breaking upon her i was snatched up for the moment into the heaven of her own imagination  i am dwelling too long upon this part of my story yet i cannot help lingering over a period of my life on which with all its cares and conflicts i look back with fondness for as yet my soul was unstained by a crime i do not know what might have been the result of this struggle between pride delicacy and passion had i not read in a neapolitan gazette an account of the sudden death of my brother it was accompanied by an earnest inquiry for intelligence concerning me and a prayer should this notice meet my eye that i would hasten to naples to comfort an infirm and afflicted father  i was naturally of an affectionate disposition but my brother had never been as a brother to me i had long considered myself as disconnected from him and his death caused me but little emotion the thoughts of my father infirm and suffering touched me however to the quick and when i thought of him that lofty magnificent being now bowed down and desolate and suing to me for comfort all my resentment for past neglect was subdued and a glow of filial affection was awakened within me  the predominant feeling however that overpowered all others was transport at the sudden change in my whole fortunes a homea namea rankwealth awaited me and love painted a still more rapturous prospect in the distance i hastened to bianca and threw myself at her feet oh bianca exclaimed i at length i can claim you for my own i am no longer a nameless adventurer a neglected rejected outcast lookread behold the tidings that restore me to my name and to myself  i will not dwell on the scene that ensued bianca rejoiced in the reverse of my situation because she saw it lightened my heart of a load of care for her own part she had loved me for myself and had never doubted that my own merits would command both fame and fortune  i now felt all my native pride buoyant within me i no longer walked with my eyes bent to the dust hope elevated them to the skies my soul was lit up with fresh fires and beamed from my countenance  i wished to impart the change in my circumstances to the count to let him know who and what i was and to make formal proposals for the hand of bianca but the count was absent on a distant estate i opened my whole soul to filippo now first i told him of my passion of the doubts and fears that had distracted me and of the tidings that had suddenly dispelled them he overwhelmed me with congratulations and with the warmest expressions of sympathy i embraced him in the fullness of my heart i felt compunctious for having suspected him of coldness and asked him forgiveness for having ever doubted his friendship  nothing is so warm and enthusiastic as a sudden expansion of the heart between young men filippo entered into our concerns with the most eager interest he was our confidant and counsellor it was determined that i should hasten at once to naples to reestablish myself in my fathers affections and my paternal home and the moment the reconciliation was effected and my fathers consent insured i should return and demand bianca of the count filippo engaged to secure his fathers acquiescence indeed he undertook to watch over our interests and was the channel through which we were to correspond  my parting with bianca was tenderdeliciousagonizing  it was in a little pavilion of the garden which had been one of our favorite resorts how often and often did i return to have one more adieuto have her look once more on me in speechless emotionto enjoy once more the rapturous sight of those tears streaming down her lovely cheeksto seize once more on that delicate hand the frankly accorded pledge of love and cover it with tears and kisses heavens there is a delight even in the parting agony of two lovers worth a thousand tame pleasures of the world i have her at this moment before my eyesat the window of the pavilion putting aside the vines that clustered about the casementher light form beaming forth in virgin whiteher countenance all tears and smilessending a thousand and a thousand adieus after me as hesitating in a delirium of fondness and agitation i faltered my way down the avenue  as the bark bore me out of the harbor of genoa how eagerly my eyes stretched along the coast of sestri till it discerned the villa gleaming from among trees at the foot of the mountain as long as day lasted i gazed and gazed upon it till it lessened and lessened to a mere white speck in the distance and still my intense and fixed gaze discerned it when all other objects of the coast had blended into indistinct confusion or were lost in the evening gloom  on arriving at naples i hastened to my paternal home my heart yearned for the longwithheld blessing of a fathers love as i entered the proud portal of the ancestral palace my emotions were so great that i could not speak no one knew me the servants gazed at me with curiosity and surprise a few years of intellectual elevation and development had made a prodigious change in the poor fugitive stripling from the convent still that no one should know me in my rightful home was overpowering i felt like the prodigal son returned i was a stranger in the house of my father i burst into tears and wept aloud when i made myself known however all was changed i who had once been almost repulsed from its walls and forced to fly as an exile was welcomed back with acclamation with servility one of the servants hastened to prepare my father for my reception my eagerness to receive the paternal embrace was so great that i could not await his return but hurried after him  what a spectacle met my eyes as i entered the chamber my father whom i had left in the pride of vigorous age whose noble and majestic bearing had so awed my young imagination was bowed down and withered into decrepitude a paralysis had ravaged his stately form and left it a shaking ruin he sat propped up in his chair with pale relaxed visage and glassy wandering eye his intellects had evidently shared in the ravage of his frame the servant was endeavoring to make him comprehend the visitor that was at hand i tottered up to him and sunk at his feet all his past coldness and neglect were forgotten in his present sufferings i remembered only that he was my parent and that i had deserted him i clasped his knees my voice was almost stifled with convulsive sobs pardonpardonoh my father was all that i could utter his apprehension seemed slowly to return to him he gazed at me for some moments with a vague inquiring look a convulsive tremor quivered about his lips he feebly extended a shaking hand laid it upon my head and burst into an infantine flow of tears  from that moment he would scarcely spare me from his sight i appeared the only object that his heart responded to in the world all else was as a blank to him he had almost lost the powers of speech and the reasoning faculty seemed at an end he was mute and passive excepting that fits of childlike weeping would sometimes come over him without any immediate cause if i left the room at any time his eye was incessantly fixed on the door till my return and on my entrance there was another gush of tears  to talk with him of my concerns in this ruined state of mind would have been worse than useless to have left him for ever so short a time would have been cruel unnatural here then was a new trial for my affections i wrote to bianca an account of my return and of my actual situation painting in colors vivid for they were true the torments i suffered at our being thus separated for to the youthful lover every day of absence is an age of love lost i enclosed the letter in one to filippo who was the channel of our correspondence i received a reply from him full of friendship and sympathy from bianca full of assurances of affection and constancy  week after week month after month elapsed without making any change in my circumstances the vital flame which had seemed nearly extinct when first i met my father kept fluttering on without any apparent diminution i watched him constantly faithfullyi had almost said patiently i knew that his death alone would set me free yet i never at any moment wished it i felt too glad to be able to make any atonement for past disobedience and denied as i had been all endearments of relationship in my early days my heart yearned towards a father who in his age and helplessness had thrown himself entirely on me for comfort my passion for bianca gained daily more force from absence by constant meditation it wore itself a deeper and deeper channel i made no new friends nor acquaintances sought none of the pleasures of naples which my rank and fortune threw open to me mine was a heart that confined itself to few objects but dwelt upon those with the intenser passion to sit by my father and administer to his wants and to meditate on bianca in the silence of his chamber was my constant habit sometimes i amused myself with my pencil in portraying the image that was ever present to my imagination i transferred to canvas every look and smile of hers that dwelt in my heart i showed them to my father in hopes of awakening an interest in his bosom for the mere shadow of my love but he was too far sunk in intellect to take any more than a childlike notice of them  when i received a letter from bianca it was a new source of solitary luxury her letters it is true were less and less frequent but they were always full of assurances of unabated affection they breathed not the frank and innocent warmth with which she expressed herself in conversation but i accounted for it from the embarrassment which inexperienced minds have often to express themselves upon paper filippo assured me of her unaltered constancy they both lamented in the strongest terms our continued separation though they did justice to the filial feeling that kept me by my fathers side  nearly eighteen months elapsed in this protracted exile to me they were so many ages ardent and impetuous by nature i scarcely know how i should have supported so long an absence had i not felt assured that the faith of bianca was equal to my own at length my father died life went from him almost imperceptibly i hung over him in mute affliction and watched the expiring spasms of nature his last faltering accents whispered repeatedly a blessing on mealas how has it been fulfilled  when i had paid due honors to his remains and laid them in the tomb of our ancestors i arranged briefly my affairs put them in a posture to be easily at my command from a distance and embarked once more with a bounding heart for genoa  our voyage was propitious and oh what was my rapture when first in the dawn of morning i saw the shadowy summits of the apennines rising almost like clouds above the horizon the sweet breath of summer just moved us over the long wavering billows that were rolling us on towards genoa by degrees the coast of sestri rose like a sweet creation of enchantment from the silver bosom of the deep i behold the line of villages and palaces studding its borders my eye reverted to a wellknown point and at length from the confusion of distant objects it singled out the villa which contained bianca it was a mere speck in the landscape but glimmering from afar the polar star of my heart  again i gazed at it for a livelong summers day but oh how different the emotions between departure and return it now kept growing and growing instead of lessening on my sight my heart seemed to dilate with it i looked at it through a telescope i gradually defined one feature after another the balconies of the central saloon where first i met bianca beneath its roof the terrace where we so often had passed the delightful summer evenings the awning that shaded her chamber windowi almost fancied i saw her form beneath it could she but know her lover was in the bark whose white sail now gleamed on the sunny bosom of the sea my fond impatience increased as we neared the coast the ship seemed to lag lazily over the billows i could almost have sprung into the sea and swam to the desired shore  the shadows of evening gradually shrouded the scene but the moon arose in all her fullness and beauty and shed the tender light so dear to lovers over the romantic coast of sestri my whole soul was bathed in unutterable tenderness i anticipated the heavenly evenings i should pass in wandering with bianca by the light of that blessed moon  it was late at night before we entered the harbor as early next morning as i could get released from the formalities of landing i threw myself on horseback and hastened to the villa as i galloped round the rocky promontory on which stands the faro and saw the coast of sestri opening upon me a thousand anxieties and doubts suddenly sprang up in my bosom there is something fearful in returning to those we love while yet uncertain what ills or changes absence may have effected the turbulence of my agitation shook my very frame i spurred my horse to redoubled speed he was covered with foam when we both arrived panting at the gateway that opened to the grounds around the villa i left my horse at a cottage and walked through the grounds that i might regain tranquillity for the approaching interview i chid myself for having suffered mere doubts and surmises thus suddenly to overcome me but i was always prone to be carried away by these gusts of the feelings  on entering the garden everything bore the same look as when i had left it and this unchanged aspect of things reassured me there were the alleys in which i had so often walked with bianca the same shades under which we had so often sat during the noontide there were the same flowers of which she was fond and which appeared still to be under the ministry of her hand everything around looked and breathed of bianca hope and joy flushed in my bosom at every step i passed a little bower in which we had often sat and read together a book and a glove lay on the bench it was biancas glove it was a volume of the metestasio i had given her the glove lay in my favorite passage i clasped them to my heart all is safe exclaimed i with rapture she loves me she is still my own  i bounded lightly along the avenue down which i had faltered so slowly at my departure i beheld her favorite pavilion which had witnessed our parting scene the window was open with the same vine clambering about it precisely as when she waved and wept me an adieu oh how transporting was the contrast in my situation as i passed near the pavilion i heard the tones of a female voice they thrilled through me with an appeal to my heart not to be mistaken before i could think i felt they were biancas for an instant i paused overpowered with agitation i feared to break in suddenly upon her i softly ascended the steps of the pavilion the door was open i saw bianca seated at a table her back was towards me she was warbling a soft melancholy air and was occupied in drawing a glance sufficed to show me that she was copying one of my own paintings i gazed on her for a moment in a delicious tumult of emotions she paused in her singing a heavy sigh almost a sob followed i could no longer contain myself bianca exclaimed i in a half smothered voice she started at the sound brushed back the ringlets that hung clustering about her face darted a glance at me uttered a piercing shriek and would have fallen to the earth had i not caught her in my arms  bianca my own bianca exclaimed i folding her to my bosom my voice stifled in sobs of convulsive joy she lay in my arms without sense or motion alarmed at the effects of my own precipitation i scarce knew what to do i tried by a thousand endearing words to call her back to consciousness she slowly recovered and half opening her eyeswhere am i murmured she faintly here exclaimed i pressing her to my bosom here close to the heart that adores you in the arms of your faithful ottavio  oh no no no shrieked she starting into sudden life and terroraway away leave me leave me  she tore herself from my arms rushed to a corner of the saloon and covered her face with her hands as if the very sight of me were baleful i was thunderstrucki could not believe my senses i followed her trembling confounded i endeavored to take her hand but she shrunk from my very touch with horror  good heavens bianca exclaimed i what is the meaning of this is this my reception after so long an absence is this the love you professed for me  at the mention of love a shuddering ran through her she turned to me a face wild with anguish no more of that no more of that gasped shetalk not to me of loveiiam married  i reeled as if i had received a mortal blow a sickness struck to my very heart i caught at a window frame for support for a moment or two everything was chaos around me when i recovered i beheld bianca lying on a sofa her face buried in a pillow and sobbing convulsively indignation at her fickleness for a moment overpowered every other feeling  faithlessperjured cried i striding across the room but another glance at that beautiful being in distress checked all my wrath anger could not dwell together with her idea in my soul  oh bianca exclaimed i in anguish could i have dreamt of this could i have suspected you would have been false to me  she raised her face all streaming with tears all disordered with emotion and gave me one appealing lookfalse to youthey told me you were dead  what said i in spite of our constant correspondence  she gazed wildly at mecorrespondencewhat correspondence  have you not repeatedly received and replied to my letters  she clasped her hands with solemnity and fervoras i hope for mercy never  a horrible surmise shot through my brainwho told you i was dead  it was reported that the ship in which you embarked for naples perished at sea  but who told you the report  she paused for an instant and trembled  filippo  may the god of heaven curse him cried i extending my clinched fists aloft  oh do not curse himdo not curse him exclaimed shehe ishe is my husband  this was all that was wanting to unfold the perfidy that had been practised upon me my blood boiled like liquid fire in my veins i gasped with rage too great for utterance i remained for a time bewildered by the whirl of horrible thoughts that rushed through my mind the poor victim of deception before me thought it was with her i was incensed she faintly murmured forth her exculpation i will not dwell upon it i saw in it more than she meant to reveal i saw with a glance how both of us had been betrayed tis well muttered i to myself in smothered accents of concentrated fury he shall account to me for this  bianca overhead me new terror flashed in her countenance for mercys sake do not meet himsay nothing of what has passedfor my sake say nothing to himi only shall be the sufferer  a new suspicion darted across my mindwhat exclaimed ido you then fear himis he unkind to youtell me reiterated i grasping her hand and looking her eagerly in the facetell medares he to use you harshly  no no no cried she faltering and embarrassed but the glance at her face had told me volumes i saw in her pallid and wasted features in the prompt terror and subdued agony of her eye a whole history of a mind broken down by tyranny great god and was this beauteous flower snatched from me to be thus trampled upon the idea roused me to madness i clinched my teeth and my hands i foamed at the mouth every passion seemed to have resolved itself into the fury that like a lava boiled within my heart bianca shrunk from me in speechless affright as i strode by the window my eye darted down the alley fatal moment i beheld filippo at a distance my brain was in a deliriumi sprang from the pavilion and was before him with the quickness of lightning he saw me as i came rushing upon himhe turned pale looked wildly to right and left as if he would have fled and trembling drew his sword  wretch cried i well may you draw your weapon  i spake not another wordi snatched forth a stiletto put by the sword which trembled in his hand and buried my poniard in his bosom he fell with the blow but my rage was unsated i sprang upon him with the bloodthirsty feeling of a tiger redoubled my blows mangled him in my frenzy grasped him by the throat until with reiterated wounds and strangling convulsions he expired in my grasp i remained glaring on the countenance horrible in death that seemed to stare back with its protruded eyes upon me piercing shrieks roused me from my delirium i looked round and beheld bianca flying distractedly towards us my brain whirled i waited not to meet her but fled from the scene of horror i fled forth from the garden like another cain a hell within my bosom and a curse upon my head i fled without knowing whitheralmost without knowing whymy only idea was to get farther and farther from the horrors i had left behind as if i could throw space between myself and my conscience i fled to the apennines and wandered for days and days among their savage heights how i existed i cannot tellwhat rocks and precipices i braved and how i braved them i know not i kept on and ontrying to outtravel the curse that clung to me alas the shrieks of bianca rung for ever in my ear the horrible countenance of my victim was for ever before my eyes the blood of filippo cried to me from the ground rocks trees and torrents all resounded with my crime  then it was i felt how much more insupportable is the anguish of remorse than every other mental pang oh could i but have cast off this crime that festered in my heart could i but have regained the innocence that reigned in my breast as i entered the garden at sestri could i but have restored my victim to life i felt as if i could look on with transport even though bianca were in his arms  by degrees this frenzied fever of remorse settled into a permanent malady of the mind into one of the most horrible that ever poor wretch was cursed with wherever i went the countenance of him i had slain appeared to follow me wherever i turned my head i beheld it behind me hideous with the contortions of the dying moment i have tried in every way to escape from this horrible phantom but in vain i know not whether it is an illusion of the mind the consequence of my dismal education at the convent or whether a phantom really sent by heaven to punish me but there it ever isat all timesin all placesnor has time nor habit had any effect in familiarizing me with its terrors i have travelled from place to place plunged into amusementstried dissipation and distraction of every kindallall in vain  i once had recourse to my pencil as a desperate experiment i painted an exact resemblance of this phantom face i placed it before me in hopes that by constantly contemplating the copy i might diminish the effect of the original but i only doubled instead of diminishing the misery  such is the curse that has clung to my footstepsthat has made my life a burthenbut the thoughts of death terrible god knows what i have suffered what days and days and nights and nights of sleepless torment what a neverdying worm has preyed upon my heart what an unquenchable fire has burned within my brain he knows the wrongs that wrought upon my poor weak nature that converted the tenderest of affections into the deadliest of fury he knows best whether a frail erring creature has expiated by longenduring torture and measureless remorse the crime of a moment of madness often often have i prostrated myself in the dust and implored that he would give me a sign of his forgiveness and let me die  thus far had i written some time since i had meant to leave this record of misery and crime with you to be read when i should be no more my prayer to heaven has at length been heard you were witness to my emotions last evening at the performance of the miserere when the vaulted temple resounded with the words of atonement and redemption i heard a voice speaking to me from the midst of the music i heard it rising above the pealing of the organ and the voices of the choir it spoke to me in tones of celestial melody it promised mercy and forgiveness but demanded from me full expiation i go to make it tomorrow i shall be on my way to genoa to surrender myself to justice you who have pitied my sufferings who have poured the balm of sympathy into my wounds do not shrink from my memory with abhorrence now that you know my story recollect when you read of my crime i shall have atoned for it with my blood  when the baronet had finished there was an universal desire expressed to see the painting of this frightful visage after much entreaty the baronet consented on condition that they should only visit it one by one he called his housekeeper and gave her charge to conduct the gentlemen singly to the chamber they all returned varying in their stories some affected in one way some in another some more some less but all agreeing that there was a certain something about the painting that had a very odd effect upon the feelings  i stood in a deep bow window with the baronet and could not help expressing my wonder after all said i there are certain mysteries in our nature certain inscrutable impulses and influences that warrant one in being superstitious who can account for so many persons of different characters being thus strangely affected by a mere painting  and especially when not one of them has seen it said the baronet with a smile  how exclaimed i not seen it  not one of them replied he laying his finger on his lips in sign of secrecy i saw that some of them were in a bantering vein and i did not choose that the memento of the poor italian should be made a jest of so i gave the housekeeper a hint to show them all to a different chamber  thus end the stories of the nervous gentleman     part second  buckthorne and his friends    tis a very good world that we live in   to lend or to spend or to give in   but to beg or to borrow or get a mans own   tis the very worst world sir that ever was known    lines from an inn window     literary life   among the great variety of characters which fall in a travellers way i became acquainted during my sojourn in london with an eccentric personage of the name of buckthorne he was a literary man had lived much in the metropolis and had acquired a great deal of curious though unprofitable knowledge concerning it he was a great observer of character and could give the natural history of every odd animal that presented itself in this great wilderness of men finding me very curious about literary life and literary characters he took much pains to gratify my curiosity  the literary world of england said he to me one day is made up of a number of little fraternities each existing merely for itself and thinking the rest of the world created only to look on and admire it may be resembled to the firmament consisting of a number of systems each composed of its own central sun with its revolving train of moons and satellites all acting in the most harmonious concord but the comparison fails in part inasmuch as the literary world has no general concord each system acts independently of the rest and indeed considers all other stars as mere exhalations and transient meteors beaming for awhile with false fires but doomed soon to fall and be forgotten while its own luminaries are the lights of the universe destined to increase in splendor and to shine steadily on to immortality  and pray said i how is a man to get a peep into one of these systems you talk of i presume an intercourse with authors is a kind of intellectual exchange where one must bring his commodities to barter and always give a quid pro quo  pooh poohhow you mistake said buckthorne smiling you must never think to become popular among wits by shining they go into society to shine themselves not to admire the brilliancy of others i thought as you do when i first cultivated the society of men of letters and never went to a bluestocking coterie without studying my part beforehand as diligently as an actor the consequence was i soon got the name of an intolerable proser and should in a little while have been completely excommunicated had i not changed my plan of operations from thenceforth i became a most assiduous listener or if ever i were eloquent it was têteatête with an author in praise of his own works or what is nearly as acceptable in disparagement of the works of his contemporaries if ever he spoke favorably of the productions of some particular friend i ventured boldly to dissent from him and to prove that his friend was a blockhead and much as people say of the pertinacity and irritability of authors i never found one to take offence at my contradictions no no sir authors are particularly candid in admitting the faults of their friends  indeed i was extremely sparing of my remarks on all modern works excepting to make sarcastic observations on the most distinguished writers of the day i never ventured to praise an author that had not been dead at least half a century and even then i was rather cautious for you must know that many old writers have been enlisted under the banners of different sects and their merits have become as complete topics of party prejudice and dispute as the merits of living statesmen and politicians nay there have been whole periods of literature absolutely tabood to use a south sea phrase it is for example as much as a mans reputation is worth in some circles to say a word in praise of any writers of the reign of charles the second or even of queen anne they being all declared to be frenchmen in disguise  and pray then said i when am i to know that i am on safe grounds being totally unacquainted with the literary landmarks and the boundary lines of fashionable taste  oh replied he there is fortunately one tract of literature that forms a kind of neutral ground on which all the literary world meet amicably lay down their weapons and even run riot in their excess of good humor and this is the reigns of elizabeth and james here you may praise away at a venture here it is cut and come again and the more obscure the author and the more quaint and crabbed his style the more your admiration will smack of the real relish of the connoisseur whose taste like that of an epicure is always for game that has an antiquated flavor  but continued he as you seem anxious to know something of literary society i will take an opportunity to introduce you to some coterie where the talents of the day are assembled i cannot promise you however that they will be of the first order somehow or other our great geniuses are not gregarious they do not go in flocks but fly singly in general society they prefer mingling like common men with the multitude and are apt to carry nothing of the author about them but the reputation it is only the inferior orders that herd together acquire strength and importance by their confederacies and bear all the distinctive characteristics of their species     a literary dinner   a few days after this conversation with mr buckthorne he called upon me and took me with him to a regular literary dinner it was given by a great bookseller or rather a company of booksellers whose firm surpassed in length even that of shadrach meschach and abednego  i was surprised to find between twenty and thirty guests assembled most of whom i had never seen before buckthorne explained this to me by informing me that this was a business dinner or kind of field day which the house gave about twice a year to its authors it is true they did occasionally give snug dinners to three or four literary men at a time but then these were generally select authors favorites of the public such as had arrived at their sixth and seventh editions there are said he certain geographical boundaries in the land of literature and you may judge tolerably well of an authors popularity by the wine his bookseller gives him an author crosses the port line about the third edition and gets into claret but when he has reached the sixth and seventh he may revel in champagne and burgundy  and pray said i how far may these gentlemen have reached that i see around me are any of these claret drinkers  not exactly not exactly you find at these great dinners the common steady run of authors one two edition menor if any others are invited they are aware that it is a kind of republican meetingyou understand mea meeting of the republic of letters and that they must expect nothing but plain substantial fare  these hints enabled me to comprehend more fully the arrangement of the table the two ends were occupied by two partners of the house and the host seemed to have adopted addisons ideas as to the literary precedence of his guests a popular poet had the post of honor opposite to whom was a hotpressed traveller in quarto with plates a gravelooking antiquarian who had produced several solid works which were much quoted and little read was treated with great respect and seated next to a neat dressy gentleman in black who had written a thin genteel hotpressed octavo on political economy that was getting into fashion several threevolume duodecimo men of fair currency were placed about the centre of the table while the lower end was taken up with small poets translators and authors who had not as yet risen into much notice  the conversation during dinner was by fits and starts breaking out here and there in various parts of the table in small flashes and ending in smoke the poet who had the confidence of a man on good terms with the world and independent of his bookseller was very gay and brilliant and said many clever things which set the partner next him in a roar and delighted all the company the other partner however maintained his sedateness and kept carving on with the air of a thorough man of business intent upon the occupation of the moment his gravity was explained to me by my friend buckthorne he informed me that the concerns of the house were admirably distributed among the partners thus for instance said he the grave gentleman is the carving partner who attends to the joints and the other is the laughing partner who attends to the jokes  the general conversation was chiefly carried on at the upper end of the table as the authors there seemed to possess the greatest courage of the tongue as to the crew at the lower end if they did not make much figure in talking they did in eating never was there a more determined inveterate thoroughlysustained attack on the trencher than by this phalanx of masticators when the cloth was removed and the wine began to circulate they grew very merry and jocose among themselves their jokes however if by chance any of them reached the upper end of the table seldom produced much effect even the laughing partner did not seem to think it necessary to honor them with a smile which my neighbour buckthorne accounted for by informing me that there was a certain degree of popularity to be obtained before a bookseller could afford to laugh at an authors jokes  among this crew of questionable gentlemen thus seated below the salt my eye singled out one in particular he was rather shabbily dressed though he had evidently made the most of a rusty black coat and wore his shirtfrill plaited and puffed out voluminously at the bosom his face was dusky but floridperhaps a little too florid particularly about the nose though the rosy hue gave the greater lustre to a twinkling black eye he had a little the look of a boon companion with that dash of the poor devil in it which gives an inexpressibly mellow tone to a mans humor i had seldom seen a face of richer promise but never was promise so ill kept he said nothing ate and drank with the keen appetite of a gazetteer and scarcely stopped to laugh even at the good jokes from the upper end of the table i inquired who he was buckthorne looked at him attentively gad said he i have seen that face before but where i cannot recollect he cannot be an author of any note i suppose some writer of sermons or grinder of foreign travels  after dinner we retired to another room to take tea and coffee where we were reenforced by a cloud of inferior guests authors of small volumes in boards and pamphlets stitched in blue paper these had not as yet arrived to the importance of a dinner invitation but were invited occasionally to pass the evening in a friendly way they were very respectful to the partners and indeed seemed to stand a little in awe of them but they paid very devoted court to the lady of the house and were extravagantly fond of the children i looked round for the poor devil author in the rusty black coat and magnificent frill but he had disappeared immediately after leaving the table having a dread no doubt of the glaring light of a drawingroom finding nothing farther to interest my attention i took my departure as soon as coffee had been served leaving the port and the thin genteel hotpressed octavo gentlemen masters of the field     the club of queer fellows   i think it was but the very next evening that in coming out of covent garden theatre with my eccentric friend buckthorne he proposed to give me another peep at life and character finding me willing for any research of the kind he took me through a variety of the narrow courts and lanes about covent garden until we stopped before a tavern from which we heard the bursts of merriment of a jovial party there would be a loud peal of laughter then an interval then another peal as if a prime wag were telling a story after a little while there was a song and at the close of each stanza a hearty roar and a vehement thumping on the table  this is the place whispered buckthorne it is the club of queer fellows a great resort of the small wits thirdrate actors and newspaper critics of the theatres any one can go in on paying a shilling at the bar for the use of the club  we entered therefore without ceremony and took our seats at a lone table in a dusky corner of the room the club was assembled round a table on which stood beverages of various kinds according to the taste of the individual the members were a set of queer fellows indeed but what was my surprise on recognizing in the prime wit of the meeting the poor devil author whom i had remarked at the booksellers dinner for his promising face and his complete taciturnity matters however were entirely changed with him there he was a mere cypher here he was lord of the ascendant the choice spirit the dominant genius he sat at the head of the table with his hat on and an eye beaming even more luminously than his nose he had a quiz and a fillip for every one and a good thing on every occasion nothing could be said or done without eliciting a spark from him and i solemnly declare i have heard much worse wit even from noblemen his jokes it must be confessed were rather wet but they suited the circle in which he presided the company were in that maudlin mood when a little wit goes a great way every time he opened his lips there was sure to be a roar and sometimes before he had time to speak  we were fortunate enough to enter in time for a glee composed by him expressly for the club and which he sang with two boon companions who would have been worthy subjects for hogarths pencil as they were each provided with a written copy i was enabled to procure the reading of it    merrily merrily push round the glass   and merrily troll the glee   for he who wont drink till he wink is an ass   so neighbor i drink to thee   merrily merrily puddle thy nose   until it right rosy shall be   for a jolly red nose i speak under the rose   is a sign of good company  we waited until the party broke up and no one but the wit remained he sat at the table with his legs stretched under it and wide apart his hands in his breeches pockets his head drooped upon his breast and gazing with lacklustre countenance on an empty tankard his gayety was gone his fire completely quenched  my companion approached and startled him from his fit of brown study introducing himself on the strength of their having dined together at the booksellers  by the way said he it seems to me i have seen you before your face is surely the face of an old acquaintance though for the life of me i cannot tell where i have known you  very likely said he with a smile many of my old friends have forgotten me though to tell the truth my memory in this instance is as bad as your own if however it will assist your recollection in any way my name is thomas dribble at your service  what tom dribble who was at old birchells school in warwickshire  the same said the other coolly  why then we are old schoolmates though its no wonder you dont recollect me i was your junior by several years dont you recollect little jack buckthorne  here then ensued a scene of schoolfellow recognition and a world of talk about old school times and school pranks mr dribble ended by observing with a heavy sigh that times were sadly changed since those days  faith mr dribble said i you seem quite a different man here from what you were at dinner i had no idea that you had so much stuff in you there you were all silence but here you absolutely keep the table in a roar  ah my dear sir replied he with a shake of the head and a shrug of the shoulder im a mere glowworm i never shine by daylight besides its a hard thing for a poor devil of an author to shine at the table of a rich bookseller who do you think would laugh at any thing i could say when i had some of the current wits of the day about me but here though a poor devil i am among still poorer devils than myself men who look up to me as a man of letters and a bel esprit and all my jokes pass as sterling gold from the mint  you surely do yourself injustice sir said i i have certainly heard more good things from you this evening than from any of those beaux esprits by whom you appear to have been so daunted  ah sir but they have luck on their side they are in the fashion theres nothing like being in fashion a man that has once got his character up for a wit is always sure of a laugh say what he may he may utter as much nonsense as he pleases and all will pass current no one stops to question the coin of a rich man but a poor devil cannot pass off either a joke or a guinea without its being examined on both sides wit and coin are always doubted with a threadbare coat  for my part continued he giving his hat a twitch a little more on one side for my part i hate your fine dinners theres nothing sir like the freedom of a chophouse id rather any time have my steak and tankard among my own set than drink claret and eat venison with your cursed civil elegant company who never laugh at a good joke from a poor devil for fear of its being vulgar a good joke grows in a wet soil it flourishes in low places but withers on your dd high dry grounds i once kept high company sir until i nearly ruined myself i grew so dull and vapid and genteel nothing saved me but being arrested by my landlady and thrown into prison where a course of catchclubs eightpenny ale and poordevil company manured my mind and brought it back to itself again  as it was now growing late we parted for the evening though i felt anxious to know more of this practical philosopher i was glad therefore when buckthorne proposed to have another meeting to talk over old school times and inquired his schoolmates address the latter seemed at first a little shy of naming his lodgings but suddenly assuming an air of hardihoodgreen arbour court sir exclaimed henumberin green arbour court you must know the place classic ground sir classic ground it was there goldsmith wrote his vicar of wakefield i always like to live in literary haunts  i was amused with this whimsical apology for shabby quarters on our way homewards buckthorne assured me that this dribble had been the prime wit and great wag of the school in their boyish days and one of those unlucky urchins denominated bright geniuses as he perceived me curious respecting his old schoolmate he promised to take me with him in his proposed visit to green arbour court  a few mornings afterwards he called upon me and we set forth on our expedition he led me through a variety of singular alleys and courts and blind passages for he appeared to be profoundly versed in all the intricate geography of the metropolis at length we came out upon fleet market and traversing it turned up a narrow street to the bottom of a long steep flight of stone steps named breakneck stairs these he told me led up to green arbour court and that down them poor goldsmith might many a time have risked his neck when we entered the court i could not but smile to think in what outoftheway corners genius produces her bantlings and the muses those capricious dames who forsooth so often refuse to visit palaces and deny a single smile to votaries in splendid studies and gilded drawingroomswhat holes and burrows will they frequent to lavish their favors on some ragged disciple  this green arbour court i found to be a small square of tall and miserable houses the very intestines of which seemed turned inside out to judge from the old garments and frippery that fluttered from every window it appeared to be a region of washerwomen and lines were stretched about the little square on which clothes were dangling to dry just as we entered the square a scuffle took place between two viragos about a disputed right to a washtub and immediately the whole community was in a hubbub heads in mob caps popped out of every window and such a clamor of tongues ensued that i was fain to stop my ears every amazon took part with one or other of the disputants and brandished her arms dripping with soapsuds and fired away from her window as from the embrazure of a fortress while the swarms of children nestled and cradled in every procreant chamber of this hive waking with the noise set up their shrill pipes to swell the general concert  poor goldsmith what a time must he have had of it with his quiet disposition and nervous habits penned up in this den of noise and vulgarity how strange that while every sight and sound was sufficient to embitter the heart and fill it with misanthropy his pen should be dropping the honey of hybla yet it is more than probable that he drew many of his inimitable pictures of low life from the scenes which surrounded him in this abode the circumstance of mrs tibbs being obliged to wash her husbands two shirts in a neighbors house who refused to lend her washtub may have been no sport of fancy but a fact passing under his own eye his landlady may have sat for the picture and beau tibbs scanty wardrobe have been a facsimile of his own  it was with some difficulty that we found our way to dribbles lodgings they were up two pair of stairs in a room that looked upon the court and when we entered he was seated on the edge of his bed writing at a broken table he received us however with a free open poor devil air that was irresistible it is true he did at first appear slightly confused buttoned up his waistcoat a little higher and tucked in a stray frill of linen but he recollected himself in an instant gave a half swagger half leer as he stepped forth to receive us drew a threelegged stool for mr buckthorne pointed me to a lumbering old damask chair that looked like a dethroned monarch in exile and bade us welcome to his garret  we soon got engaged in conversation buckthorne and he had much to say about early school scenes and as nothing opens a mans heart more than recollections of the kind we soon drew from him a brief outline of his literary career     the poor devil author   i began life unluckily by being the wag and bright fellow at school and i had the farther misfortune of becoming the great genius of my native village my father was a country attorney and intended that i should succeed him in business but i had too much genius to study and he was too fond of my genius to force it into the traces so i fell into bad company and took to bad habits do not mistake me i mean that i fell into the company of village literati and village blues and took to writing village poetry  it was quite the fashion in the village to be literary we had a little knot of choice spirits who assembled frequently together formed ourselves into a literary scientific and philosophical society and fancied ourselves the most learned philos in existence every one had a great character assigned him suggested by some casual habit or affectation one heavy fellow drank an enormous quantity of tea rolled in his armchair talked sententiously pronounced dogmatically and was considered a second dr johnson another who happened to be a curate uttered coarse jokes wrote doggerel rhymes and was the swift of our association thus we had also our popes and goldsmiths and addisons and a bluestocking lady whose drawingroom we frequented who corresponded about nothing with all the world and wrote letters with the stiffness and formality of a printed book was cried up as another mrs montagu i was by common consent the juvenile prodigy the poetical youth the great genius the pride and hope of the village through whom it was to become one day as celebrated as stratfordonavon  my father died and left me his blessing and his business his blessing brought no money into my pocket and as to his business it soon deserted me for i was busy writing poetry and could not attend to law and my clients though they had great respect for my talents had no faith in a poetical attorney  i lost my business therefore spent my money and finished my poem it was the pleasures of melancholy and was cried up to the skies by the whole circle the pleasures of imagination the pleasures of hope and the pleasures of memory though each had placed its author in the first rank of poets were blank prose in comparison our mrs montagu would cry over it from beginning to end it was pronounced by all the members of the literary scientific and philosophical society the greatest poem of the age and all anticipated the noise it would make in the great world there was not a doubt but the london booksellers would be mad after it and the only fear of my friends was that i would make a sacrifice by selling it too cheap  every time they talked the matter over they increased the price they reckoned up the great sums given for the poems of certain popular writers and determined that mine was worth more than all put together and ought to be paid for accordingly for my part i was modest in my expectations and determined that i would be satisfied with a thousand guineas so i put my poem in my pocket and set off for london  my journey was joyous my heart was light as my purse and my head full of anticipations of fame and fortune with what swelling pride did i cast my eyes upon old london from the heights of highgate i was like a general looking down upon a place he expects to conquer the great metropolis lay stretched before me buried under a homemade cloud of murky smoke that wrapped it from the brightness of a sunny day and formed for it a kind of artificial bad weather at the outskirts of the city away to the west the smoke gradually decreased until all was clear and sunny and the view stretched uninterrupted to the blue line of the kentish hills  my eye turned fondly to where the mighty cupola of st pauls swelled dimly through this misty chaos and i pictured to myself the solemn realm of learning that lies about its base how soon should the pleasures of melancholy throw this world of booksellers and printers into a bustle of business and delight how soon should i hear my name repeated by printers devils throughout pater noster row and angel court and ave maria lane until amen corner should echo back the sound  arrived in town i repaired at once to the most fashionable publisher every new author patronizes him of course in fact it had been determined in the village circle that he should be the fortunate man i cannot tell you how vaingloriously i walked the streets my head was in the clouds i felt the airs of heaven playing about it and fancied it already encircled by a halo of literary glory  as i passed by the windows of bookshops i anticipated the time when my work would be shining among the hotpressed wonders of the day and my face scratched on copper or cut in wood figuring in fellowship with those of scott and byron and moore  when i applied at the publishers house there was something in the loftiness of my air and the dinginess of my dress that struck the clerks with reverence they doubtless took me for some person of consequence probably a digger of greek roots or a penetrator of pyramids a proud man in a dirty shirt is always an imposing character in the world of letters one must feel intellectually secure before he can venture to dress shabbily none but a great scholar or a great genius dares to be dirty so i was ushered at once to the sanctum sanctorum of this high priest of minerva  the publishing of books is a very different affair nowadays from what it was in the time of bernard lintot i found the publisher a fashionablydressed man in an elegant drawingroom furnished with sofas and portraits of celebrated authors and cases of splendidly bound books he was writing letters at an elegant table this was transacting business in style the place seemed suited to the magnificent publications that issued from it i rejoiced at the choice i had made of a publisher for i always liked to encourage men of taste and spirit  i stepped up to the table with the lofty poetical port that i had been accustomed to maintain in our village circle though i threw in it something of a patronizing air such as one feels when about to make a mans fortune the publisher paused with his pen in his hand and seemed waiting in mute suspense to know what was to be announced by so singular an apparition  i put him at his ease in a moment for i felt that i had but to come see and conquer i made known my name and the name of my poem produced my precious roll of blotted manuscript laid it on the table with an emphasis and told him at once to save time and come directly to the point the price was one thousand guineas  i had given him no time to speak nor did he seem so inclined he continued looking at me for a moment with an air of whimsical perplexity scanned me from head to foot looked down at the manuscript then up again at me then pointed to a chair and whistling softly to himself went on writing his letter  i sat for some time waiting his reply supposing he was making up his mind but he only paused occasionally to take a fresh dip of ink to stroke his chin or the tip of his nose and then resumed his writing it was evident his mind was intently occupied upon some other subject but i had no idea that any other subject should be attended to and my poem lie unnoticed on the table i had supposed that every thing would make way for the pleasures of melancholy  my gorge at length rose within me i took up my manuscript thrust it into my pocket and walked out of the room making some noise as i went to let my departure be heard the publisher however was too much busied in minor concerns to notice it i was suffered to walk downstairs without being called back i sallied forth into the street but no clerk was sent after me nor did the publisher call after me from the drawingroom window i have been told since that he considered me either a madman or a fool i leave you to judge how much he was in the wrong in his opinion  when i turned the corner my crest fell i cooled down in my pride and my expectations and reduced my terms with the next bookseller to whom i applied i had no better success nor with a third nor with a fourth i then desired the booksellers to make an offer themselves but the deuce an offer would they make they told me poetry was a mere drug everybody wrote poetry the market was overstocked with it and then they said the title of my poem was not taking that pleasures of all kinds were worn threadbare nothing but horrors did nowadays and even these were almost worn out tales of pirates robbers and bloody turks might answer tolerably well but then they must come from some established wellknown name or the public would not look at them  at last i offered to leave my poem with a bookseller to read it and judge for himself why really my dear mraai forget your name said he cutting an eye at my rusty coat and shabby gaiters really sir we are so pressed with business just now and have so many manuscripts on hand to read that we have not time to look at any new production but if you can call again in a week or two or say the middle of next month we may be able to look over your writings and give you an answer dont forget the month after nextgood morning sirhappy to see you any time you are passing this wayso saying he bowed me out in the civilest way imaginable in short sir instead of an eager competition to secure my poem i could not even get it read in the mean time i was harassed by letters from my friends wanting to know when the work was to appear who was to be my publisher but above all things warning me not to let it go too cheap  there was but one alternative left i determined to publish the poem myself and to have my triumph over the booksellers when it should become the fashion of the day i accordingly published the pleasures of melancholy and ruined myself excepting the copies sent to the reviews and to my friends in the country not one i believe ever left the booksellers warehouse the printers bill drained my purse and the only notice that was taken of my work was contained in the advertisements paid for by myself  i could have borne all this and have attributed it as usual to the mismanagement of the publisher or the want of taste in the public and could have made the usual appeal to posterity but my village friends would not let me rest in quiet they were picturing me to themselves feasting with the great communing with the literary and in the high course of fortune and renown every little while some one came to me with a letter of introduction from the village circle recommending him to my attentions and requesting that i would make him known in society with a hint that an introduction to the house of a celebrated literary nobleman would be extremely agreeable  i determined therefore to change my lodgings drop my correspondence and disappear altogether from the view of my village admirers besides i was anxious to make one more poetic attempt i was by no means disheartened by the failure of my first my poem was evidently too didactic the public was wise enough it no longer read for instruction they want horrors do they said i ifaith then they shall have enough of them so i looked out for some quiet retired place where i might be out of reach of my friends and have leisure to cook up some delectable dish of poetical hellbroth  i had some difficulty in finding a place to my mind when chance threw me in the way of canonbury castle it is an ancient brick tower hard by merry islington the remains of a huntingseat of queen elizabeth where she took the pleasures of the country when the neighborhood was all woodland what gave it particular interest in my eyes was the circumstance that it had been the residence of a poet it was here goldsmith resided when he wrote his deserted village i was shown the very apartment it was a relique of the original style of the castle with pannelled wainscots and gothic windows i was pleased with its air of antiquity and with its having been the residence of poor goldy  goldsmith was a pretty poet said i to myself a very pretty poet though rather of the old school he did not think and feel so strongly as is the fashion nowadays but had he lived in these times of hot hearts and hot heads he would have written quite differently  in a few days i was quietly established in my new quarters my books all arranged my writing desk placed by a window looking out into the field and i felt as snug as robinson crusoe when he had finished his bower for several days i enjoyed all the novelty of change and the charms which grace a new lodgings before one has found out their defects i rambled about the fields where i fancied goldsmith had rambled i explored merry islington ate my solitary dinner at the black bull which according to tradition was a country seat of sir walter raleigh and would sit and sip my wine and muse on old times in a quaint old room where many a council had been held  all this did very well for a few days i was stimulated by novelty inspired by the associations awakened in my mind by these curious haunts and began to think i felt the spirit of composition stirring within me but sunday came and with it the whole city world swarming about canonbury castle i could not open my window but i was stunned with shouts and noises from the cricket ground the late quiet road beneath my window was alive with the tread of feet and clack of tongues and to complete my misery i found that my quiet retreat was absolutely a show house the tower and its contents being shown to strangers at sixpence a head  there was a perpetual tramping upstairs of citizens and their families to look about the country from the top of the tower and to take a peep at the city through the telescope to try if they could discern their own chimneys and then in the midst of a vein of thought or a moment of inspiration i was interrupted and all my ideas put to flight by my intolerable landladys tapping at the door and asking me if i would jist please to let a lady and gentleman come in to take a look at mr goldsmiths room  if you know anything what an authors study is and what an author is himself you must know that there was no standing this i put a positive interdict on my rooms being exhibited but then it was shown when i was absent and my papers put in confusion and on returning home one day i absolutely found a cursed tradesman and his daughters gaping over my manuscripts and my landlady in a panic at my appearance i tried to make out a little longer by taking the key in my pocket but it would not do i overheard mine hostess one day telling some of her customers on the stairs that the room was occupied by an author who was always in a tantrum if interrupted and i immediately perceived by a slight noise at the door that they were peeping at me through the keyhole by the head of apollo but this was quite too much with all my eagerness for fame and my ambition of the stare of the million i had no idea of being exhibited by retail at sixpence a head and that through a keyhole so i bade adieu to canonbury castle merry islington and the haunts of poor goldsmith without having advanced a single line in my labors  my next quarters were at a small whitewashed cottage which stands not far from hempstead just on the brow of a hill looking over chalk farm and camden town remarkable for the rival houses of mother red cap and mother black cap and so across cruckskull common to the distant city  the cottage is in no wise remarkable in itself but i regarded it with reverence for it had been the asylum of a persecuted author hither poor steele had retreated and lain perdue when persecuted by creditors and bailiffs those immemorial plagues of authors and freespirited gentlemen and here he had written many numbers of the spectator it was from hence too that he had despatched those little notes to his lady so full of affection and whimsicality in which the fond husband the careless gentleman and the shifting spendthrift were so oddly blended i thought as i first eyed the window of his apartment that i could sit within it and write volumes  no such thing it was haymaking season and as ill luck would have it immediately opposite the cottage was a little alehouse with the sign of the load of hay whether it was there in steeles time or not i cannot say but it set all attempt at conception or inspiration at defiance it was the resort of all the irish haymakers who mow the broad fields in the neighborhood and of drovers and teamsters who travel that road here would they gather in the endless summer twilight or by the light of the harvest moon and sit round a table at the door and tipple and laugh and quarrel and fight and sing drowsy songs and dawdle away the hours until the deep solemn notes of st pauls clock would warn the varlets home  in the daytime i was still less able to write it was broad summer the haymakers were at work in the fields and the perfume of the newmown hay brought with it the recollection of my native fields so instead of remaining in my room to write i went wandering about primrose hill and hempstead heights and shepherds field and all those arcadian scenes so celebrated by london bards i cannot tell you how many delicious hours i have passed lying on the cocks of newmown hay on the pleasant slopes of some of those hills inhaling the fragrance of the fields while the summer fly buzzed above me or the grasshopper leaped into my bosom and how i have gazed with halfshut eye upon the smoky mass of london and listened to the distant sound of its population and pitied the poor sons of earth toiling in its bowels like gnomes in the dark gold mine  people may say what they please about cockney pastorals but after all there is a vast deal of rural beauty about the western vicinity of london and any one that has looked down upon the valley of westend with its soft bosom of green pasturage lying open to the south and dotted with cattle the steeple of hempstead rising among rich groves on the brow of the hill and the learned height of harrow in the distance will confess that never has he seen a more absolutely rural landscape in the vicinity of a great metropolis  still however i found myself not a whit the better off for my frequent change of lodgings and i began to discover that in literature as in trade the old proverb holds good a rolling stone gathers no moss  the tranquil beauty of the country played the very vengeance with me i could not mount my fancy into the termagant vein i could not conceive amidst the smiling landscape a scene of blood and murder and the smug citizens in breeches and gaiters put all ideas of heroes and bandits out of my brain i could think of nothing but dulcet subjects the pleasures of springthe pleasures of solitudethe pleasures of tranquillitythe pleasures of sentimentnothing but pleasures and i had the painful experience of the pleasures of melancholy too strongly in my recollection to be beguiled by them  chance at length befriended me i had frequently in my ramblings loitered about hempstead hill which is a kind of parnassus of the metropolis at such times i occasionally took my dinner at jack straws castle it is a country inn so named the very spot where that notorious rebel and his followers held their council of war it is a favorite resort of citizens when rurally inclined as it commands fine fresh air and a good view of the city  i sat one day in the public room of this inn ruminating over a beefsteak and a pint of port when my imagination kindled up with ancient and heroic images i had long wanted a theme and a hero both suddenly broke upon my mind i determined to write a poem on the history of jack straw i was so full of my subject that i was fearful of being anticipated i wondered that none of the poets of the day in their researches after ruffian heroes had ever thought of jack straw i went to work pellmell blotted several sheets of paper with choice floating thoughts and battles and descriptions to be ready at a moments warning in a few days time i sketched out the skeleton of my poem and nothing was wanting but to give it flesh and blood i used to take my manuscript and stroll about caen wood and read aloud and would dine at the castle by way of keeping up the vein of thought  i was taking a meal there one day at a rather late hour in the public room there was no other company but one man who sat enjoying his pint of port at a window and noticing the passersby he was dressed in a green shooting coat his countenance was strongly marked he had a hooked nose a romantic eye excepting that it had something of a squint and altogether as i thought a poetical style of head i was quite taken with the man for you must know i am a little of a physiognomist i set him down at once for either a poet or a philosopher  as i like to make new acquaintances considering every man a volume of human nature i soon fell into conversation with the stranger who i was pleased to find was by no means difficult of access after i had dined i joined him at the window and we became so sociable that i proposed a bottle of wine together to which he most cheerfully assented  i was too full of my poem to keep long quiet on the subject and began to talk about the origin of the tavern and the history of jack straw i found my new acquaintance to be perfectly at home on the topic and to jump exactly with my humor in every respect i became elevated by the wine and the conversation in the fullness of an authors feelings i told him of my projected poem and repeated some passages and he was in raptures he was evidently of a strong poetical turn  sir said he filling my glass at the same time our poets dont look at home i dont see why we need go out of old england for robbers and rebels to write about i like your jack straw sir hes a homemade hero i like him sir i like him exceedingly hes english to the back bone damme give me honest old england after all thems my sentiments sir  i honor your sentiments cried i zealously they are exactly my own an english ruffian for poetry is as good a ruffian for poetry as any in italy or germany or the archipelago but it is hard to make our poets think so  more shame for them replied the man in green what a plague would they have what have we to do with their archipelagos of italy and germany havent we heaths and commons and highways on our own little island aye and stout fellows to pad the hoof over them too come sir my service to youi agree with you perfectly  poets in old times had right notions on this subject continued i witness the fine old ballads about robin hood allen adale and other staunch blades of yore  right sir right interrupted he robin hood he was the lad to cry stand to a man and never flinch  ah sir said i they had famous bands of robbers in the good old times those were glorious poetical days the merry crew of sherwood forest who led such a roving picturesque life under the greenwood tree i have often wished to visit their haunts and tread the scenes of the exploits of friar tuck and clym of the clough and sir william of coudeslie  nay sir said the gentleman in green we have had several very pretty gangs since their day those gallant dogs that kept about the great heaths in the neighborhood of london about bagshot and hounslow and black heath for instancecome sir my service to you you dont drink  i suppose said i emptying my glassi suppose you have heard of the famous turpin who was born in this very village of hempstead and who used to lurk with his gang in epping forest about a hundred years since  have i cried heto be sure i have a hearty old blade that sound as pitch old turpentineas we used to call him a famous fine fellow sir  well sir continued i i have visited waltham abbey and chinkford church merely from the stories i heard when a boy of his exploits there and i have searched epping forest for the cavern where he used to conceal himself you must know added i that i am a sort of amateur of highwaymen they were dashing daring fellows the last apologies that we had for the knight errants of yore ah sir the country has been sinking gradually into tameness and commonplace we are losing the old english spirit the bold knights of the post have all dwindled down into lurking footpads and sneaking pickpockets theres no such thing as a dashing gentlemanlike robbery committed nowadays on the kings highway a man may roll from one end of england to the other in a drowsy coach or jingling postchaise without any other adventure than that of being occasionally overturned sleeping in damp sheets or having an illcooked dinner  we hear no more of public coaches being stopped and robbed by a wellmounted gang of resolute fellows with pistols in their hands and crapes over their faces what a pretty poetical incident was it for example in domestic life for a family carriage on its way to a country seat to be attacked about dusk the old gentleman eased of his purse and watch the ladies of their necklaces and earrings by a politelyspoken highwayman on a blood mare who afterwards leaped the hedge and galloped across the country to the admiration of miss carolina the daughter who would write a long and romantic account of the adventure to her friend miss juliana in town ah sir we meet with nothing of such incidents nowadays  that sirsaid my companion taking advantage of a pause when i stopped to recover breath and to take a glass of wine which he had just poured outthat sir craving your pardon is not owing to any want of old english pluck it is the effect of this cursed system of banking people do not travel with bags of gold as they did formerly they have post notes and drafts on bankers to rob a coach is like catching a crow where you have nothing but carrion flesh and feathers for your pains but a coach in old times sir was as rich as a spanish galleon it turned out the yellow boys bravely and a private carriage was a cool hundred or two at least  i cannot express how much i was delighted with the sallies of my new acquaintance he told me that he often frequented the castle and would be glad to know more of me and i promised myself many a pleasant afternoon with him when i should read him my poem as it proceeded and benefit by his remarks for it was evident he had the true poetical feeling  come sir said he pushing the bottle damme i like youyoure a man after my own heart im cursed slow in making new acquaintances in general one must stand on the reserve you know but when i meet with a man of your kidney damme my heart jumps at once to him thems my sentiments sir come sir heres jack straws health i presume one can drink it nowadays without treason  with all my heart said i gayly and dick turpins into the bargain  ah sir said the man in green those are the kind of men for poetry the newgate kalendar sir the newgate kalendar is your only reading theres the place to look for bold deeds and dashing fellows  we were so much pleased with each other that we sat until a late hour i insisted on paying the bill for both my purse and my heart were full and i agreed that he should pay the score at our next meeting as the coaches had all gone that run between hempstead and london he had to return on foot he was so delighted with the idea of my poem that he could talk of nothing else he made me repeat such passages as i could remember and though i did it in a very mangled manner having a wretched memory yet he was in raptures  every now and then he would break out with some scrap which he would misquote most terribly but would rub his hands and exclaim by jupiter thats fine thats noble damme sir if i can conceive how you hit upon such ideas  i must confess i did not always relish his misquotations which sometimes made absolute nonsense of the passages but what author stands upon trifles when he is praised never had i spent a more delightful evening i did not perceive how the time flew i could not bear to separate but continued walking on arm in arm with him past my lodgings through camden town and across crackscull common talking the whole way about my poem  when we were halfway across the common he interrupted me in the midst of a quotation by telling me that this had been a famous place for footpads and was still occasionally infested by them and that a man had recently been shot there in attempting to defend himself  the more fool he cried i a man is an idiot to risk life or even limb to save a paltry purse of money its quite a different case from that of a duel where ones honor is concerned for my part added i i should never think of making resistance against one of those desperadoes  say you so cried my friend in green turning suddenly upon me and putting a pistol to my breast why then have at you my ladcome disburse empty unsack  in a word i found that the muse had played me another of her tricks and had betrayed me into the hands of a footpad there was no time to parley he made me turn my pockets inside out and hearing the sound of distant footsteps he made one fell swoop upon purse watch and all gave me a thwack over my unlucky pate that laid me sprawling on the ground and scampered away with his booty  i saw no more of my friend in green until a year or two afterwards when i caught a sight of his poetical countenance among a crew of scapegraces heavily ironed who were on the way for transportation he recognized me at once tipped me an impudent wink and asked me how i came on with the history of jack straws castle  the catastrophe at crackscull common put an end to my summers campaign i was cured of my poetical enthusiasm for rebels robbers and highwaymen i was put out of conceit of my subject and what was worse i was lightened of my purse in which was almost every farthing i had in the world so i abandoned sir richard steeles cottage in despair and crept into less celebrated though no less poetical and airy lodgings in a garret in town  i see you are growing weary so i will not detain you with any more of my luckless attempts to get astride of pegasus still i could not consent to give up the trial and abandon those dreams of renown in which i had indulged how should i ever be able to look the literary circle of my native village in the face if i were so completely to falsify their predictions for some time longer therefore i continued to write for fame and of course was the most miserable dog in existence besides being in continual risk of starvation  i have many a time strolled sorrowfully along with a sad heart and an empty stomach about five oclock and looked wistfully down the areas in the west end of the town and seen through the kitchen windows the fires gleaming and the joints of meat turning on the spits and dripping with gravy and the cook maids beating up puddings or trussing turkeys and have felt for the moment that if i could but have the run of one of those kitchens apollo and the muses might have the hungry heights of parnassus for me oh sir talk of meditations among the tombsthey are nothing so melancholy as the meditations of a poor devil without penny in pouch along a line of kitchen windows towards dinnertime  at length when almost reduced to famine and despair the idea all at once entered my head that perhaps i was not so clever a fellow as the village and myself had supposed it was the salvation of me the moment the idea popped into my brain it brought conviction and comfort with it i awoke as from a dream i gave up immortal fame to those who could live on air took to writing for mere bread and have ever since led a very tolerable life of it there is no man of letters so much at his ease sir as he that has no character to gain or lose i had to train myself to it a little however and to clip my wings short at first or they would have carried me up into poetry in spite of myself so i determined to begin by the opposite extreme and abandoning the higher regions of the craft i came plump down to the lowest and turned creeper  creeper interrupted i and pray what is that oh sir i see you are ignorant of the language of the craft a creeper is one who furnishes the newspapers with paragraphs at so much a line one that goes about in quest of misfortunes attends the bowstreet office the courts of justice and every other den of mischief and iniquity we are paid at the rate of a penny a line and as we can sell the same paragraph to almost every paper we sometimes pick up a very decent days work now and then the muse is unkind or the day uncommonly quiet and then we rather starve and sometimes the unconscionable editors will clip our paragraphs when they are a little too rhetorical and snip off twopence or threepence at a go i have many a time had my pot of porter snipped off of my dinner in this way and have had to dine with dry lips however i cannot complain i rose gradually in the lower ranks of the craft and am now i think in the most comfortable region of literature  and pray said i what may you be at present at present said he i am a regular job writer and turn my hand to anything i work up the writings of others at so much a sheet turn off translations write secondrate articles to fill up reviews and magazines compile travels and voyages and furnish theatrical criticisms for the newspapers all this authorship you perceive is anonymous it gives no reputation except among the trade where i am considered an author of all work and am always sure of employ thats the only reputation i want i sleep soundly without dread of duns or critics and leave immortal fame to those that choose to fret and fight about it take my word for it the only happy author in this world is he who is below the care of reputation  the preceding anecdotes of buckthornes early schoolmate and a variety of peculiarities which i had remarked in himself gave me a strong curiosity to know something of his own history there was a dash of careless good humor about him that pleased me exceedingly and at times a whimsical tinge of melancholy ran through his humor that gave it an additional relish he had evidently been a little chilled and buffeted by fortune without being soured thereby as some fruits become mellower and sweeter from having been bruised or frostbitten he smiled when i expressed my desire i have no great story said he to relate a mere tissue of errors and follies but such as it is you shall have one epoch of it by which you may judge of the rest and so without any farther prelude he gave me the following anecdotes of his early adventures     buckthorne or the young man of great expectations   i was born to very little property but to great expectations which is perhaps one of the most unlucky fortunes that a man can be born to my father was a country gentleman the last of a very ancient and honorable but decayed family and resided in an old hunting lodge in warwickshire he was a keen sportsman and lived to the extent of his moderate income so that i had little to expect from that quarter but then i had a rich uncle by the mothers side a penurious accumulating curmudgeon who it was confidently expected would make me his heir because he was an old bachelor because i was named after him and because he hated all the world except myself  he was in fact an inveterate hater a miser even in misanthropy and hoarded up a grudge as he did a guinea thus though my mother was an only sister he had never forgiven her marriage with my father against whom he had a cold still immovable pique which had lain at the bottom of his heart like a stone in a well ever since they had been school boys together my mother however considered me as the intermediate being that was to bring every thing again into harmony for she looked upon me as a prodigygod bless her my heart overflows whenever i recall her tenderness she was the most excellent the most indulgent of mothers i was her only child it was a pity she had no more for she had fondness of heart enough to have spoiled a dozen  i was sent at an early age to a public school sorely against my mothers wishes but my father insisted that it was the only way to make boys hardy the school was kept by a conscientious prig of the ancient system who did his duty by the boys intrusted to his care that is to say we were flogged soundly when we did not get our lessons we were put into classes and thus flogged on in droves along the highways of knowledge in the same manner as cattle are driven to market where those that are heavy in gait or short in leg have to suffer for the superior alertness or longer limbs of their companions  for my part i confess it with shame i was an incorrigible laggard i have always had the poetical feeling that is to say i have always been an idle fellow and prone to play the vagabond i used to get away from my books and school whenever i could and ramble about the fields i was surrounded by seductions for such a temperament the schoolhouse was an oldfashioned whitewashed mansion of wood and plaister standing on the skirts of a beautiful village close by it was the venerable church with a tall gothic spire before it spread a lovely green valley with a little stream glistening along through willow groves while a line of blue hills that bounded the landscape gave rise to many a summer day dream as to the fairy land that lay beyond  in spite of all the scourgings i suffered at that school to make me love my book i cannot but look back upon the place with fondness indeed i considered this frequent flagellation as the common lot of humanity and the regular mode in which scholars were made my kind mother used to lament over my details of the sore trials i underwent in the cause of learning but my father turned a deaf ear to her expostulations he had been flogged through school himself and swore there was no other way of making a man of parts though let me speak it with all due reverence my father was but an indifferent illustration of his own theory for he was considered a grievous blockhead  my poetical temperament evinced itself at a very early period the village church was attended every sunday by a neighboring squirethe lord of the manor whose park stretched quite to the village and whose spacious country seat seemed to take the church under its protection indeed you would have thought the church had been consecrated to him instead of to the deity the parish clerk bowed low before him and the vergers humbled themselves into the dust in his presence he always entered a little late and with some stir striking his cane emphatically on the ground swaying his hat in his hand and looking loftily to the right and left as he walked slowly up the aisle and the parson who always ate his sunday dinner with him never commenced service until he appeared he sat with his family in a large pew gorgeously lined humbling himself devoutly on velvet cushions and reading lessons of meekness and lowliness of spirit out of splendid gold and morocco prayerbooks whenever the parson spoke of the difficulty of the rich mans entering the kingdom of heaven the eyes of the congregation would turn towards the grand pew and i thought the squire seemed pleased with the application  the pomp of this pew and the aristocratical air of the family struck my imagination wonderfully and i fell desperately in love with a little daughter of the squires about twelve years of age this freak of fancy made me more truant from my studies than ever i used to stroll about the squires park and would lurk near the house to catch glimpses of this little damsel at the windows or playing about the lawns or walking out with her governess  i had not enterprise or impudence enough to venture from my concealment indeed i felt like an arrant poacher until i read one or two of ovids metamorphoses when i pictured myself as some sylvan deity and she a coy wood nymph of whom i was in pursuit there is something extremely delicious in these early awakenings of the tender passion i can feel even at this moment the thrilling of my boyish bosom whenever by chance i caught a glimpse of her white frock fluttering among the shrubbery i now began to read poetry i carried about in my bosom a volume of waller which i had purloined from my mothers library and i applied to my little fair one all the compliments lavished upon sacharissa  at length i danced with her at a school ball i was so awkward a booby that i dared scarcely speak to her i was filled with awe and embarrassment in her presence but i was so inspired that my poetical temperament for the first time broke out in verse and i fabricated some glowing lines in which i berhymed the little lady under the favorite name of sacharissa i slipped the verses trembling and blushing into her hand the next sunday as she came out of church the little prude handed them to her mamma the mamma handed them to the squire the squire who had no soul for poetry sent them in dudgeon to the schoolmaster and the schoolmaster with a barbarity worthy of the dark ages gave me a sound and peculiarly humiliating flogging for thus trespassing upon parnassus  this was a sad outset for a votary of the muse it ought to have cured me of my passion for poetry but it only confirmed it for i felt the spirit of a martyr rising within me what was as well perhaps it cured me of my passion for the young lady for i felt so indignant at the ignominious horsing i had incurred in celebrating her charms that i could not hold up my head in church  fortunately for my wounded sensibility the midsummer holydays came on and i returned home my mother as usual inquired into all my school concerns my little pleasures and cares and sorrows for boyhood has its share of the one as well as of the others i told her all and she was indignant at the treatment i had experienced she fired up at the arrogance of the squire and the prudery of the daughter and as to the schoolmaster she wondered where was the use of having schoolmasters and why boys could not remain at home and be educated by tutors under the eye of their mothers she asked to see the verses i had written and she was delighted with them for to confess the truth she had a pretty taste in poetry she even showed to them to the parsons wife who protested they were charming and the parsons three daughters insisted on each having a copy of them  all this was exceedingly balsamic and i was still more consoled and encouraged when the young ladies who were the bluestockings of the neighborhood and had read dr johnsons lives quite through assured my mother that great geniuses never studied but were always idle upon which i began to surmise that i was myself something out of the common run my father however was of a very different opinion for when my mother in the pride of her heart showed him my copy of verses he threw them out of the window asking her if she meant to make a ballad monger of the boy but he was a careless commonthinking man and i cannot say that i ever loved him much my mother absorbed all my filial affection  i used occasionally during holydays to be sent on short visits to the uncle who was to make me his heir they thought it would keep me in his mind and render him fond of me he was a withered anxiouslooking old fellow and lived in a desolate old country seat which he suffered to go to ruin from absolute niggardliness he kept but one manservant who had lived or rather starved with him for years no woman was allowed to sleep in the house a daughter of the old servant lived by the gate in what had been a porters lodge and was permitted to come into the house about an hour each day to make the beds and cook a morsel of provisions  the park that surrounded the house was all run wild the trees grown out of shape the fishponds stagnant the urns and statues fallen from their pedestals and buried among the rank grass the hares and pheasants were so little molested except by poachers that they bred in great abundance and sported about the rough lawns and weedy avenues to guard the premises and frighten off robbers of whom he was somewhat apprehensive and visitors whom he held in almost equal awe my uncle kept two or three bloodhounds who were always prowling round the house and were the dread of the neighboring peasantry they were gaunt and halfstarved seemed ready to devour one from mere hunger and were an effectual check on any strangers approach to this wizard castle  such was my uncles house which i used to visit now and then during the holydays i was as i have before said the old mans favorite that is to say he did not hate me so much as he did the rest of the world i had been apprised of his character and cautioned to cultivate his goodwill but i was too young and careless to be a courtier and indeed have never been sufficiently studious of my interests to let them govern my feelings however we seemed to jog on very well together and as my visits cost him almost nothing they did not seem to be very unwelcome i brought with me my gun and fishingrod and half supplied the table from the park and the fishponds  our meals were solitary and unsocial my uncle rarely spoke he pointed for whatever he wanted and the servant perfectly understood him indeed his man john or iron john as he was called in the neighborhood was a counterpart of his master he was a tall bony old fellow with a dry wig that seemed made of cows tail and a face as tough as though it had been made of bulls hide he was generally clad in a long patched livery coat taken out of the wardrobe of the house and which bagged loosely about him having evidently belonged to some corpulent predecessor in the more plenteous days of the mansion from long habits of taciturnity the hinges of his jaws seemed to have grown absolutely rusty and it cost him as much effort to set them ajar and to let out a tolerable sentence as it would have done to set open the iron gates of a park and let out the family carriage that was dropping to pieces in the coachhouse  i cannot say however but that i was for some time amused with my uncles peculiarities even the very desolateness of the establishment had something in it that hit my fancy when the weather was fine i used to amuse myself in a solitary way by rambling about the park and coursing like a colt across its lawns the hares and pheasants seemed to stare with surprise to see a human being walking these forbidden grounds by daylight sometimes i amused myself by jerking stones or shooting at birds with a bow and arrows for to have used a gun would have been treason now and then my path was crossed by a little redheaded raggedtailed urchin the son of the woman at the lodge who ran wild about the premises i tried to draw him into familiarity and to make a companion of him but he seemed to have imbibed the strange unsocial character of every thing around him and always kept aloof so i considered him as another orson and amused myself with shooting at him with my bow and arrows and he would hold up his breeches with one hand and scamper away like a deer  there was something in all this loneliness and wildness strangely pleasing to me the great stables empty and weatherbroken with the names of favorite horses over the vacant stalls the windows bricked and boarded up the broken roofs garrisoned by rooks and jackdaws all had a singularly forlorn appearance one would have concluded the house to be totally uninhabited were it not for a little thread of blue smoke which now and then curled up like a corkscrew from the centre of one of the wide chimneys when my uncles starveling meal was cooking  my uncles room was in a remote corner of the building strongly secured and generally locked i was never admitted into this stronghold where the old man would remain for the greater part of the time drawn up like a veteran spider in the citadel of his web the rest of the mansion however was open to me and i sauntered about it unconstrained the damp and rain which beat in through the broken windows crumbled the paper from the walls mouldered the pictures and gradually destroyed the furniture i loved to rove about the wide waste chambers in bad weather and listen to the howling of the wind and the banging about of the doors and windowshutters i pleased myself with the idea how completely when i came to the estate i would renovate all things and make the old building ring with merriment till it was astonished at its own jocundity  the chamber which i occupied on these visits was the same that had been my mothers when a girl there was still the toilettable of her own adorning the landscapes of her own drawing she had never seen it since her marriage but would often ask me if every thing was still the same all was just the same for i loved that chamber on her account and had taken pains to put every thing in order and to mend all the flaws in the windows with my own hands i anticipated the time when i should once more welcome her to the house of her fathers and restore her to this little nestlingplace of her childhood  at length my evil genius or what perhaps is the same thing the muse inspired me with the notion of rhyming again my uncle who never went to church used on sundays to read chapters out of the bible and iron john the woman from the lodge and myself were his congregation it seemed to be all one to him what he read so long as it was something from the bible sometimes therefore it would be the song of solomon and this withered anatomy would read about being stayed with flagons and comforted with apples for he was sick of love sometimes he would hobble with spectacle on nose through whole chapters of hard hebrew names in deuteronomy at which the poor woman would sigh and groan as if wonderfully moved his favorite book however was the pilgrims progress and when he came to that part which treats of doubting castle and giant despair i thought invariably of him and his desolate old country seat so much did the idea amuse me that i took to scribbling about it under the trees in the park and in a few days had made some progress in a poem in which i had given a description of the place under the name of doubting castle and personified my uncle as giant despair  i lost my poem somewhere about the house and i soon suspected that my uncle had found it as he harshly intimated to me that i could return home and that i need not come and see him again until he should send for me  just about this time my mother diedi cannot dwell upon this circumstance my heart careless and wayworn as it is gushes with the recollection her death was an event that perhaps gave a turn to all my after fortunes with her died all that made home attractive for my father was harsh as i have before said and had never treated me with kindness not that he exerted any unusual severity towards me but it was his way i do not complain of him in fact i have never been of a complaining disposition i seem born to be buffeted by friends and fortune and nature has made me a careless endurer of buffetings  i now however began to grow very impatient of remaining at school to be flogged for things that i did not like i longed for variety especially now that i had not my uncles to resort to by way of diversifying the dullness of school with the dreariness of his country seat i was now turned of sixteen tall for my age and full of idle fancies i had a roving inextinguishable desire to see different kinds of life and different orders of society and this vagrant humor had been fostered in me by tom dribble the prime wag and great genius of the school who had all the rambling propensities of a poet  i used to set at my desk in the school on a fine summers day and instead of studying the book which lay open before me my eye was gazing through the window on the green fields and blue hills how i envied the happy groups seated on the tops of stagecoaches chatting and joking and laughing as they were whirled by the schoolhouse on their way to the metropolis even the wagoners trudging along beside their ponderous teams and traversing the kingdom from one end to the other were objects of envy to me i fancied to myself what adventures they must experience and what odd scenes of life they must witness all this was doubtless the poetical temperament working within me and tempting me forth into a world of its own creation which i mistook for the world of real life  while my mother lived this strange propensity to roam was counteracted by the stronger attractions of home and by the powerful ties of affection which drew me to her side but now that she was gone the attractions had ceased the ties were severed i had no longer an anchorage ground for my heart but was at the mercy of every vagrant impulse nothing but the narrow allowance on which my father kept me and the consequent penury of my purse prevented me from mounting the top of a stagecoach and launching myself adrift on the great ocean of life  just about this time the village was agitated for a day or two by the passing through of several caravans containing wild beasts and other spectacles for a great fair annually held at a neighboring town  i had never seen a fair of any consequence and my curiosity was powerfully awakened by this bustle of preparation i gazed with respect and wonder at the vagrant personages who accompanied these caravans i loitered about the village inn listening with curiosity and delight to the slang talk and cant jokes of the showmen and their followers and i felt an eager desire to witness this fair which my fancy decked out as something wonderfully fine  a holyday afternoon presented when i could be absent from the school from noon until evening a wagon was going from the village to the fair i could not resist the temptation nor the eloquence of tom dribble who was a truant to the very hearts core we hired seats and set off full of boyish expectation i promised myself that i would but take a peep at the land of promise and hasten back again before my absence should be noticed  heavens how happy i was on arriving at the fair how i was enchanted with the world of fun and pageantry around me the humors of punch the feats of the equestrians the magical tricks of the conjurors but what principally caught my attention wasan itinerant theatre where a tragedy pantomime and farce were all acted in the course of half an hour and more of the dramatis personae murdered than at either drury lane or covent garden in a whole evening i have since seen many a play performed by the best actors in the world but never have i derived half the delight from any that i did from this first representation  there was a ferocious tyrant in a skull cap like an inverted porringer and a dress of red baize magnificently embroidered with gilt leather with his face so bewhiskered and his eyebrows so knit and expanded with burnt cork that he made my heart quake within me as he stamped about the little stage i was enraptured too with the surpassing beauty of a distressed damsel in faded pink silk and dirty white muslin whom he held in cruel captivity by way of gaining her affections and who wept and wrung her hands and flourished a ragged pocket handkerchief from the top of an impregnable tower of the size of a bandbox  even after i had come out from the play i could not tear myself from the vicinity of the theatre but lingered gazing and wondering and laughing at the dramatis personae as they performed their antics or danced upon a stage in front of the booth to decoy a new set of spectators  i was so bewildered by the scene and so lost in the crowd of sensations that kept swarming upon me that i was like one entranced i lost my companion tom dribble in a tumult and scuffle that took place near one of the shows but i was too much occupied in mind to think long about him i strolled about until dark when the fair was lighted up and a new scene of magic opened upon me the illumination of the tents and booths the brilliant effect of the stages decorated with lamps with dramatic groups flaunting about them in gaudy dresses contrasted splendidly with the surrounding darkness while the uproar of drums trumpets fiddles hautboys and cymbals mingled with the harangues of the showmen the squeaking of punch and the shouts and laughter of the crowd all united to complete my giddy distraction  time flew without my perceiving it when i came to myself and thought of the school i hastened to return i inquired for the wagon in which i had come it had been gone for hours i asked the time it was almost midnight a sudden quaking seized me how was i to get back to school i was too weary to make the journey on foot and i knew not where to apply for a conveyance even if i should find one could i venture to disturb the schoolhouse long after midnight to arouse that sleeping lion the usher in the very midst of his nights rest the idea was too dreadful for a delinquent schoolboy all the horrors of return rushed upon memy absence must long before this have been remarkedand absent for a whole night a deed of darkness not easily to be expiated the rod of the pedagogue budded forth into tenfold terrors before my affrighted fancy i pictured to myself punishment and humiliation in every variety of form and my heart sickened at the picture alas how often are the petty ills of boyhood as painful to our tender natures as are the sterner evils of manhood to our robuster minds  i wandered about among the booths and i might have derived a lesson from my actual feelings how much the charms of this world depend upon ourselves for i no longer saw anything gay or delightful in the revelry around me at length i lay down wearied and perplexed behind one of the large tents and covering myself with the margin of the tent cloth to keep off the night chill i soon fell fast asleep  i had not slept long when i was awakened by the noise of merriment within an adjoining booth it was the itinerant theatre rudely constructed of boards and canvas i peeped through an aperture and saw the whole dramatis personae tragedy comedy pantomime all refreshing themselves after the final dismissal of their auditors they were merry and gamesome and made their flimsy theatre ring with laughter i was astonished to see the tragedy tyrant in red baize and fierce whiskers who had made my heart quake as he strutted about the boards now transformed into a fat good humored fellow the beaming porringer laid aside from his brow and his jolly face washed from all the terrors of burnt cork i was delighted too to see the distressed damsel in faded silk and dirty muslin who had trembled under his tyranny and afflicted me so much by her sorrows now seated familiarly on his knee and quaffing from the same tankard harlequin lay asleep on one of the benches and monks satyrs and vestal virgins were grouped together laughing outrageously at a broad story told by an unhappy count who had been barbarously murdered in the tragedy this was indeed novelty to me it was a peep into another planet i gazed and listened with intense curiosity and enjoyment they had a thousand odd stories and jokes about the events of the day and burlesque descriptions and mimickings of the spectators who had been admiring them their conversation was full of allusions to their adventures at different places where they had exhibited the characters they had met with in different villages and the ludicrous difficulties in which they had occasionally been involved all past cares and troubles were now turned by these thoughtless beings into matter of merriment and made to contribute to the gayety of the moment they had been moving from fair to fair about the kingdom and were the next morning to set out on their way to london  my resolution was taken i crept from my nest and scrambled through a hedge into a neighboring field where i went to work to make a tatterdemalion of myself i tore my clothes soiled them with dirt begrimed my face and hands and crawling near one of the booths purloined an old hat and left my new one in its place it was an honest theft and i hope may not hereafter rise up in judgment against me  i now ventured to the scene of merrymaking and presenting myself before the dramatic corps offered myself as a volunteer i felt terribly agitated and abashed for never before stood i in such a presence i had addressed myself to the manager of the company he was a fat man dressed in dirty white with a red sash fringed with tinsel swathed round his body his face was smeared with paint and a majestic plume towered from an old spangled black bonnet he was the jupiter tonans of this olympus and was surrounded by the interior gods and goddesses of his court he sat on the end of a bench by a table with one arm akimbo and the other extended to the handle of a tankard which he had slowly set down from his lips as he surveyed me from head to foot it was a moment of awful scrutiny and i fancied the groups around all watching us in silent suspense and waiting for the imperial nod  he questioned me as to who i was what were my qualifications and what terms i expected i passed myself off for a discharged servant from a gentlemans family and as happily one does not require a special recommendation to get admitted into bad company the questions on that head were easily satisfied as to my accomplishments i would spout a little poetry and knew several scenes of plays which i had learnt at school exhibitions i could dance that was enough no further questions were asked me as to accomplishments it was the very thing they wanted and as i asked no wages but merely meat and drink and safe conduct about the world a bargain was struck in a moment  behold me therefore transformed of a sudden from a gentleman student to a dancing buffoon for such in fact was the character in which i made my debut i was one of those who formed the groups in the dramas and were principally employed on the stage in front of the booth to attract company i was equipped as a satyr in a dress of drab frize that fitted to my shape with a great laughing mask ornamented with huge ears and short horns i was pleased with the disguise because it kept me from the danger of being discovered whilst we were in that part of the country and as i had merely to dance and make antics the character was favorable to a debutant being almost on a par with simon snugs part of the lion which required nothing but roaring  i cannot tell you how happy i was at this sudden change in my situation i felt no degradation for i had seen too little of society to be thoughtful about the differences of rank and a boy of sixteen is seldom aristocratical i had given up no friend for there seemed to be no one in the world that cared for me now my poor mother was dead i had given up no pleasure for my pleasure was to ramble about and indulge the flow of a poetical imagination and i now enjoyed it in perfection there is no life so truly poetical as that of a dancing buffoon  it may be said that all this argued grovelling inclinations i do not think so not that i mean to vindicate myself in any great degree i know too well what a whimsical compound i am but in this instance i was seduced by no love of low company nor disposition to indulge in low vices i have always despised the brutally vulgar and i have always had a disgust at vice whether in high or low life i was governed merely by a sudden and thoughtless impulse i had no idea of resorting to this profession as a mode of life or of attaching myself to these people as my future class of society i thought merely of a temporary gratification of my curiosity and an indulgence of my humors i had already a strong relish for the peculiarities of character and the varieties of situation and i have always been fond of the comedy of life and desirous of seeing it through all its shifting scenes  in mingling therefore among mountebanks and buffoons i was protected by the very vivacity of imagination which had led me among them i moved about enveloped as it were in a protecting delusion which my fancy spread around me i assimilated to these people only as they struck me poetically their whimsical ways and a certain picturesqueness in their mode of life entertained me but i was neither amused nor corrupted by their vices in short i mingled among them as prince hal did among his graceless associates merely to gratify my humor  i did not investigate my motives in this manner at the time for i was too careless and thoughtless to reason about the matter but i do so now when i look back with trembling to think of the ordeal to which i unthinkingly exposed myself and the manner in which i passed through it nothing i am convinced but the poetical temperament that hurried me into the scrape brought me out of it without my becoming an arrant vagabond  full of the enjoyment of the moment giddy with the wildness of animal spirits so rapturous in a boy i capered i danced i played a thousand fantastic tricks about the stage in the villages in which we exhibited and i was universally pronounced the most agreeable monster that had ever been seen in those parts my disappearance from school had awakened my fathers anxiety for i one day heard a description of myself cried before the very booth in which i was exhibiting with the offer of a reward for any intelligence of me i had no great scruple about letting my father suffer a little uneasiness on my account it would punish him for past indifference and would make him value me the more when he found me again i have wondered that some of my comrades did not recognize in me the stray sheep that was cried but they were all no doubt occupied by their own concerns they were all laboring seriously in their antic vocations for folly was a mere trade with the most of them and they often grinned and capered with heavy hearts with me on the contrary it was all real i acted con amore and rattled and laughed from the irrepressible gayety of my spirits it is true that now and then i started and looked grave on receiving a sudden thwack from the wooden sword of harlequin in the course of my gambols as it brought to mind the birch of my schoolmaster but i soon got accustomed to it and bore all the cuffing and kicking and tumbling about that form the practical wit of your itinerant pantomime with a good humor that made me a prodigious favorite  the country campaign of the troupe was soon at an end and we set off for the metropolis to perform at the fairs which are held in its vicinity the greater part of our theatrical property was sent on direct to be in a state of preparation for the opening of the fairs while a detachment of the company travelled slowly on foraging among the villages i was amused with the desultory haphazard kind of life we led here today and gone tomorrow sometimes revelling in alehouses sometimes feasting under hedges in the green fields when audiences were crowded and business profitable we fared well and when otherwise we fared scantily and consoled ourselves with anticipations of the next days success  at length the increasing frequency of coaches hurrying past us covered with passengers the increasing number of carriages carts wagons gigs droves of cattle and flocks of sheep all thronging the road the snug country boxes with trim flower gardens twelve feet square and their trees twelve feet high all powdered with dust and the innumerable seminaries for young ladies and gentlemen situated along the road for the benefit of country air and rural retirement all these insignia announced that the mighty london was at hand the hurry and the crowd and the bustle and the noise and the dust increased as we proceeded until i saw the great cloud of smoke hanging in the air like a canopy of state over this queen of cities  in this way then did i enter the metropolis a strolling vagabond on the top of a caravan with a crew of vagabonds about me but i was as happy as a prince for like prince hal i felt myself superior to my situation and knew that i could at any time cast it off and emerge into my proper sphere  how my eyes sparkled as we passed hydepark corner and i saw splendid equipages rolling by with powdered footmen behind in rich liveries and fine nosegays and goldheaded canes and with lovely women within so sumptuously dressed and so surpassingly fair i was always extremely sensible to female beauty and here i saw it in all its fascination for whatever may be said of beauty unadorned there is something almost awful in female loveliness decked out in jewelled state the swanlike neck encircled with diamonds the raven locks clustered with pearls the ruby glowing on the snowy bosom are objects that i could never contemplate without emotion and a dazzling white arm clasped with bracelets and taper transparent fingers laden with sparkling rings are to me irresistible my very eyes ached as i gazed at the high and courtly beauty that passed before me it surpassed all that my imagination had conceived of the sex i shrunk for a moment into shame at the company in which i was placed and repined at the vast distance that seemed to intervene between me and these magnificent beings  i forbear to give a detail of the happy life which i led about the skirts of the metropolis playing at the various fairs held there during the latter part of spring and the beginning of summer this continual change from place to place and scene to scene fed my imagination with novelties and kept my spirits in a perpetual state of excitement  as i was tall of my age i aspired at one time to play heroes in tragedy but after two or three trials i was pronounced by the manager totally unfit for the line and our first tragic actress who was a large woman and held a small hero in abhorrence confirmed his decision  the fact is i had attempted to give point to language which had no point and nature to scenes which had no nature they said i did not fill out my characters and they were right the characters had all been prepared for a different sort of man our tragedy hero was a round robustious fellow with an amazing voice who stamped and slapped his breast until his wig shook again and who roared and bellowed out his bombast until every phrase swelled upon the ear like the sound of a kettledrum i might as well have attempted to fill out his clothes as his characters when we had a dialogue together i was nothing before him with my slender voice and discriminating manner i might as well have attempted to parry a cudgel with a small sword if he found me in any way gaining ground upon him he would take refuge in his mighty voice and throw his tones like peals of thunder at me until they were drowned in the still louder thunders of applause from the audience  to tell the truth i suspect that i was not shown fair play and that there was management at the bottom for without vanity i think i was a better actor than he as i had not embarked in the vagabond line through ambition i did not repine at lack of preferment but i was grieved to find that a vagrant life was not without its cares and anxieties and that jealousies intrigues and mad ambition were to be found even among vagabonds  indeed as i become more familiar with my situation and the delusions of fancy began to fade away i discovered that my associates were not the happy careless creatures i had at first imagined them they were jealous of each others talents they quarrelled about parts the same as the actors on the grand theatres they quarrelled about dresses and there was one robe of yellow silk trimmed with red and a headdress of three rumpled ostrich feathers which were continually setting the ladies of the company by the ears even those who had attained the highest honors were not more happy than the rest for mr flimsey himself our first tragedian and apparently a jovial goodhumored fellow confessed to me one day in the fullness of his heart that he was a miserable man he had a brotherinlaw a relative by marriage though not by blood who was manager of a theatre in a small country town and this same brother a little more than kin but less than kind looked down upon him and treated him with contumely because forsooth he was but a strolling player i tried to console him with the thoughts of the vast applause he daily received but it was all in vain he declared that it gave him no delight and that he should never be a happy man until the name of flimsey rivalled the name of crimp  how little do those before the scenes know of what passes behind how little can they judge from the countenances of actors of what is passing in their hearts i have known two lovers quarrel like cats behind the scenes who were the moment after ready to fly into each others embraces and i have dreaded when our belvidera was to take her farewell kiss of her jaffier lest she should bite a piece out of his cheek our tragedian was a rough joker off the stage our prime clown the most peevish mortal living the latter used to go about snapping and snarling with a broad laugh painted on his countenance and i can assure you that whatever may be said of the gravity of a monkey or the melancholy of a gibed cat there is no more melancholy creature in existence than a mountebank off duty  the only thing in which all parties agreed was to backbite the manager and cabal against his regulations this however i have since discovered to be a common trait of human nature and to take place in all communities it would seem to be the main business of man to repine at government in all situations of life into which i have looked i have found mankind divided into two grand partiesthose who ride and those who are ridden the great struggle of life seems to be which shall keep in the saddle this it appears to me is the fundamental principle of politics whether in great or little life however i do not mean to moralize but one cannot always sink the philosopher  well then to return to myself it was determined as i said that i was not fit for tragedy and unluckily as my study was bad having a very poor memory i was pronounced unfit for comedy also besides the line of young gentlemen was already engrossed by an actor with whom i could not pretend to enter into competition he having filled it for almost half a century i came down again therefore to pantomime in consequence however of the good offices of the managers lady who had taken a liking to me i was promoted from the part of the satyr to that of the lover and with my face patched and painted a huge cravat of paper a steeplecrowned hat and dangling longskirted skyblue coat was metamorphosed into the lover of columbine my part did not call for much of the tender and sentimental i had merely to pursue the fugitive fair one to have a door now and then slammed in my face to run my head occasionally against a post to tumble and roll about with pantaloon and the clown and to endure the hearty thwacks of harlequins wooden sword  as ill luck would have it my poetical temperament began to ferment within me and to work out new troubles the inflammatory air of a great metropolis added to the rural scenes in which the fairs were held such as greenwich park epping forest and the lovely valley of the west end had a powerful effect upon me while in greenwich park i was witness to the old holiday games of running down hill and kissing in the ring and then the firmament of blooming faces and blue eyes that would be turned towards me as i was playing antics on the stage all these set my young blood and my poetical vein in full flow in short i played my character to the life and became desperately enamored of columbine she was a trim wellmade tempting girl with a rougish dimpling face and fine chestnut hair clustering all about it the moment i got fairly smitten there was an end to all playing i was such a creature of fancy and feeling that i could not put on a pretended when i was powerfully affected by a real emotion i could not sport with a fiction that came so near to the fact i became too natural in my acting to succeed and then what a situation for a lover i was a mere stripling and she played with my passion for girls soon grow more adroit and knowing in these than your awkward youngsters what agonies had i to suffer every time that she danced in front of the booth and made such liberal displays of her charms i was in torment to complete my misery i had a real rival in harlequin an active vigorous knowing varlet of sixandtwenty what had a raw inexperienced youngster like me to hope from such a competition  i had still however some advantages in my favor in spite of my change of life i retained that indescribable something which always distinguishes the gentleman that something which dwells in a mans air and deportment and not in his clothes and which it is as difficult for a gentleman to put off as for a vulgar fellow to put on the company generally felt it and used to call me little gentleman jack the girl felt it too and in spite of her predilection for my powerful rival she liked to flirt with me this only aggravated my troubles by increasing my passion and awakening the jealousy of her particolored lover  alas think what i suffered at being obliged to keep up an ineffectual chase after my columbine through whole pantomimes to see her carried off in the vigorous arms of the happy harlequin and to be obliged instead of snatching her from him to tumble sprawling with pantaloon and the clown and bear the infernal and degrading thwacks of my rivals weapon of lath which may heaven confound him excuse my passion the villain laid on with a malicious goodwill nay i could absolutely hear him chuckle and laugh beneath his accursed maski beg pardon for growing a little warm in my narration i wish to be cool but these recollections will sometimes agitate me i have heard and read of many desperate and deplorable situations of lovers but none i think in which true love was ever exposed to so severe and peculiar a trial  this could not last long flesh and blood at least such flesh and blood as mine could not bear it i had repeated heartburnings and quarrels with my rival in which he treated me with the mortifying forbearance of a man towards a child had he quarrelled outright with me i could have stomached it at least i should have known what part to take but to be humored and treated as a child in the presence of my mistress when i felt all the bantam spirit of a little man swelling within megods it was insufferable  at length we were exhibiting one day at west end fair which was at that time a very fashionable resort and often beleaguered by gay equipages from town among the spectators that filled the front row of our little canvas theatre one afternoon when i had to figure in a pantomime was a party of young ladies from a boardingschool with their governess guess my confusion when in the midst of my antics i beheld among the number my quondam flame her whom i had berhymed at school her for whose charms i had smarted so severely tho cruel sacharissa what was worse i fancied she recollected me and was repeating the story of my humiliating flagellation for i saw her whispering her companions and her governess i lost all consciousness of the part i was acting and of the place where i was i felt shrunk to nothing and could have crept into a ratholeunluckily none was open to receive me before i could recover from my confusion i was tumbled over by pantaloon and the clown and i felt the sword of harlequin making vigorous assaults in a manner most degrading to my dignity  heaven and earth was i again to suffer martyrdom in this ignominious manner in the knowledge and even before the very eyes of this most beautiful but most disdainful of fair ones all my longsmothered wrath broke out at once the dormant feelings of the gentleman arose within me stung to the quick by intolerable mortification i sprang on my feet in an instant leaped upon harlequin like a young tiger tore off his mask buffeted him in the face and soon shed more blood on the stage than had been spilt upon it during a whole tragic campaign of battles and murders  as soon as harlequin recovered from his surprise he returned my assault with interest i was nothing in his hands i was game to be sure for i was a gentleman but he had the clownish advantages of bone and muscle i felt as if i could have fought even unto the death and i was likely to do so for he was according to the vulgar phrase putting my head into chancery when the gentle columbine flew to my assistance god bless the women they are always on the side of the weak and the oppressed  the battle now became general the dramatis personae ranged on either side the manager interfered in vain in vain were his spangled black bonnet and towering white feathers seen whisking about and nodding and bobbing in the thickest of the fight warriors ladies priests satyrs kings queens gods and goddesses all joined pellmell in the fray never since the conflict under the walls of troy had there been such a chance medley warfare of combatants human and divine the audience applauded the ladies shrieked and fled from the theatre and a scene of discord ensued that baffles all description  nothing but the interference of the peace officers restored some degree of order the havoc however that had been made among dresses and decorations put an end to all farther acting for that day the battle over the next thing was to inquire why it was begun a common question among politicians after a bloody and unprofitable war and one not always easy to be answered it was soon traced to me and my unaccountable transport of passion which they could only attribute to my having run a muck the manager was judge and jury and plaintiff in the bargain and in such cases justice is always speedily administered he came out of the fight as sublime a wreck as the santissìma trinidada his gallant plumes which once towered aloft were drooping about his ears his robe of state hung in ribbands from his back and but ill concealed the ravages he had suffered in the rear he had received kicks and cuffs from all sides during the tumult for every one took the opportunity of slyly gratifying some lurking grudge on his fat carcass he was a discreet man and did not choose to declare war with all his company so he swore all those kicks and cuffs had been given by me and i let him enjoy the opinion some wounds he bore however which were the incontestible traces of a womans warfare his sleek rosy cheek was scored by trickling furrows which were ascribed to the nails of my intrepid and devoted columbine the ire of the monarch was not to be appeased he had suffered in his person and he had suffered in his purse his dignity too had been insulted and that went for something for dignity is always more irascible the more petty the potentate he wreaked his wrath upon the beginners of the affray and columbine and myself were discharged at once from the company  figure me then to yourself a stripling of little more than sixteen a gentleman by birth a vagabond by trade turned adrift upon the world making the best of my way through the crowd of west end fair my mountebank dress fluttering in rags about me the weeping columbine hanging upon my arm in splendid but tattered finery the tears coursing one by one down her face carrying off the red paint in torrents and literally preying upon her damask cheek  the crowd made way for us as we passed and hooted in our rear i felt the ridicule of my situation but had too much gallantry to desert this fair one who had sacrificed everything for me having wandered through the fair we emerged like another adam and eve into unknown regions and had the world before us where to choose never was a more disconsolate pair seen in the soft valley of west end the luckless columbine cast back many a lingering look at the fair which seemed to put on a more than usual splendor its tents and booths and particolored groups all brightening in the sunshine and gleaming among the trees and its gay flags and streamers playing and fluttering in the light summer airs with a heavy sigh she would lean on my arm and proceed i had no hope or consolation to give her but she had linked herself to my fortunes and she was too much of a woman to desert me  pensive and silent then we traversed the beautiful fields that lie behind hempstead and wandered on until the fiddle and the hautboy and the shout and the laugh were swallowed up in the deep sound of the big bass drum and even that died away into a distant rumble we passed along the pleasant sequestered walk of nightingale lane for a pair of lovers what scene could be more propitiousbut such a pair of lovers not a nightingale sang to soothe us the very gypsies who were encamped there during the fair made no offer to tell the fortunes of such an illomened couple whose fortunes i suppose they thought too legibly written to need an interpreter and the gypsey children crawled into their cabins and peeped out fearfully at us as we went by for a moment i paused and was almost tempted to turn gypsey but the poetical feeling for the present was fully satisfied and i passed on thus we travelled and travelled like a prince and princess in nursery chronicle until we had traversed a part of hempstead heath and arrived in the vicinity of jack straws castle  here wearied and dispirited we seated ourselves on the margin of the hill hard by the very milestone where whittington of yore heard the bow bells ring out the presage of his future greatness alas no bell rung in invitation to us as we looked disconsolately upon the distant city old london seemed to wrap itself up unsociably in its mantle of brown smoke and to offer no encouragement to such a couple of tatterdemalions  for once at least the usual course of the pantomime was reversed harlequin was jilted and the lover had earned off columbine in good earnest but what was i to do with her i had never contemplated such a dilemma and i now felt that even a fortunate lover may be embarrassed by his good fortune i really knew not what was to become of me for i had still the boyish fear of returning home standing in awe of the stern temper of my father and dreading the ready arm of the pedagogue and even if i were to venture home what was i to do with columbine i could not take her in my hand and throw myself on my knees and crave his forgiveness and his blessing according to dramatic usage the very dogs would have chased such a draggletailed beauty from the grounds  in the midst of my doleful dumps some one tapped me on the shoulder and looking up i saw a couple of rough sturdy fellows standing behind me not knowing what to expect i jumped on my legs and was preparing again to make battle but i was tripped up and secured in a twinkling  come come young master said one of the fellows in a gruff but goodhumored tone dont lets have any of your tantrums one would have thought that you had had swing enough for this bout come its high time to leave off harlequinading and go home to your father  in fact i had a couple of bow street officers hold of me the cruel sacharissa had proclaimed who i was and that a reward had been offered throughout the country for any tidings of me and they had seen a description of me that had been forwarded to the police office in town those harpies therefore for the mere sake of filthy lucre were resolved to deliver me over into the hands of my father and the clutches of my pedagogue  it was in vain that i swore i would not leave my faithful and afflicted columbine it was in vain that i tore myself from their grasp and flew to her and vowed to protect her and wiped the tears from her cheek and with them a whole blush that might have vied with the carnation for brilliancy my persecutors were inflexible they even seemed to exult in our distress and to enjoy this theatrical display of dirt and finery and tribulation i was carried off in despair leaving my columbine destitute in the wide world but many a look of agony did i cast back at her as she stood gazing piteously after me from the brink of hempstead hill so forlorn so fine so ragged so bedraggled yet so beautiful  thus ended my first peep into the world i returned home rich in goodfornothing experience and dreading the reward i was to receive for my improvement my reception however was quite different from what i had expected my father had a spice of the devil in him and did not seem to like me the worse for my freak which he termed sowing my wild oats he happened to have several of his sporting friends to dine with him the very day of my return they made me tell some of my adventures and laughed heartily at them one old fellow with an outrageously red nose took to me hugely i heard him whisper to my father that i was a lad of mettle and might make something clever to which my father replied that i had good points but was an illbroken whelp and required a great deal of the whip perhaps this very conversation raised me a little in his esteem for i found the rednosed old gentleman was a veteran foxhunter of the neighborhood for whose opinion my father had vast deference indeed i believe he would have pardoned anything in me more readily than poetry which he called a cursed sneaking puling housekeeping employment the bane of all true manhood he swore it was unworthy of a youngster of my expectations who was one day to have so great an estate and would he able to keep horses and hounds and hire poets to write songs for him into the bargain  i had now satisfied for a time my roving propensity i had exhausted the poetical feeling i had been heartily buffeted out of my love for theatrical display i felt humiliated by my exposure and was willing to hide my head anywhere for a season so that i might be out of the way of the ridicule of the world for i found folks not altogether so indulgent abroad as they were at my fathers table i could not stay at home the house was intolerably doleful now that my mother was no longer there to cherish me every thing around spoke mournfully of her the little flowergarden in which she delighted was all in disorder and overrun with weeds i attempted for a day or two to arrange it but my heart grew heavier and heavier as i labored every little brokendown flower that i had seen her rear so tenderly seemed to plead in mute eloquence to my feelings there was a favorite honeysuckle which i had seen her often training with assiduity and had heard her say it should be the pride of her garden i found it grovelling along the ground tangled and wild and twining round every worthless weed and it struck me as an emblem of myself a mere scatterling running to waste and uselessness i could work no longer in the garden  my father sent me to pay a visit to my uncle by way of keeping the old gentleman in mind of me i was received as usual without any expression of discontent which we always considered equivalent to a hearty welcome whether he had ever heard of my strolling freak or not i could not discover he and his man were both so taciturn i spent a day or two roaming about the dreary mansion and neglected park and felt at one time i believe a touch of poetry for i was tempted to drown myself in a fishpond i rebuked the evil spirit however and it left me i found the same redheaded boy running wild about the park but i felt in no humor to hunt him at present on the contrary i tried to coax him to me and to make friends with him but the young savage was untameable  when i returned from my uncles i remained at home for some time for my father was disposed he said to make a man of me he took me out hunting with him and i became a great favorite of the rednosed squire because i rode at everything never refused the boldest leap and was always sure to be in at the death i used often however to offend my father at hunting dinners by taking the wrong side in politics my father was amazingly ignorantso ignorant in fact as not to know that he knew nothing he was staunch however to church and king and full of oldfashioned prejudices now i had picked up a little knowledge in politics and religion during my rambles with the strollers and found myself capable of setting him right as to many of his antiquated notions i felt it my duty to do so we were apt therefore to differ occasionally in the political discussions that sometimes arose at these hunting dinners  i was at that age when a man knows least and is most vain of his knowledge and when he is extremely tenacious in defending his opinion upon subjects about which he knows nothing my father was a hard man for any one to argue with for he never knew when he was refuted i sometimes posed him a little but then he had one argument that always settled the question he would threaten to knock me down i believe he at last grew tired of me because i both outtalked and outrode him the rednosed squire too got out of conceit of me because in the heat of the chase i rode over him one day as he and his horse lay sprawling in the dirt my father therefore thought it high time to send me to college and accordingly to trinity college at oxford was i sent  i had lost my habits of study while at home and i was not likely to find them again at college i found that study was not the fashion at college and that a lad of spirit only ate his terms and grew wise by dint of knife and fork i was always prone to follow the fashions of the company into which i fell so i threw by my books and became a man of spirit as my father made me a tolerable allowance notwithstanding the narrowness of his income having an eye always to my great expectations i was enabled to appear to advantage among my fellowstudents i cultivated all kinds of sports and exercises i was one of the most expert oarsmen that rowed on the isis i boxed and fenced i was a keen huntsman and my chambers in college were always decorated with whips of all kinds spurs foils and boxing gloves a pair of leather breeches would seem to be throwing one leg out of the halfopen drawers and empty bottles lumbered the bottom of every closet  i soon grew tired of this and relapsed into my vein of mere poetical indulgence i was charmed with oxford for it was full of poetry to me i thought i should never grow tired of wandering about its courts and cloisters and visiting the different college halls i used to love to get in places surrounded by the colleges where all modern buildings were screened from the sight and to walk about them in twilight and see the professors and students sweeping along in the dusk in their caps and gowns there was complete delusion in the scene it seemed to transport me among the edifices and the people of old times it was a great luxury too for me to attend the evening service in the new college chapel and to hear the fine organ and the choir swelling an anthem in that solemn building where painting and music and architecture seem to combine their grandest effects  i became a loiterer also about the bodleian library and a great dipper into books but too idle to follow any course of study or vein of research one of my favorite haunts was the beautiful walk bordered by lofty elms along the isis under the old gray walls of magdalen college which goes by the name of addisons walk and was his resort when a student at the college i used to take a volume of poetry in my hand and stroll up and down this walk for hours  my father came to see me at college he asked me how i came on with my studies and what kind of hunting there was in the neighborhood he examined my sporting apparatus wanted to know if any of the professors were foxhunters and whether they were generally good shots for he suspected this reading so much was rather hurtful to the sight such was the only person to whom i was responsible for my improvement is it matter of wonder therefore that i became a confirmed idler  i do not know how it is but i cannot be idle long without getting in love i became deeply smitten with a shopkeepers daughter in the high street who in fact was the admiration of many of the students i wrote several sonnets in praise of her and spent half of my pocketmoney at the shop in buying articles which i did not want that i might have an opportunity of speaking to her her father a severelooking old gentleman with bright silver buckles and a crisp curled wig kept a strict guard on her as the fathers generally do upon their daughters in oxford and well they may i tried to get into his good graces and to be sociable with him but in vain i said several good things in his shop but he never laughed he had no relish for wit and humor he was one of those dry old gentlemen who keep youngsters at bay he had already brought up two or three daughters and was experienced in the ways of students  he was as knowing and wary as a gray old badger that has often been hunted to see him on sunday so stiff and starched in his demeanor so precise in his dress with his daughter under his arm and his ivoryheaded cane in his hand was enough to deter all graceless youngsters from approaching  i managed however in spite of his vigilance to have several conversations with the daughter as i cheapened articles in the shop i made terrible long bargains and examined the articles over and over before i purchased in the meantime i would convey a sonnet or an acrostic under cover of a piece of cambric or slipped into a pair of stockings i would whisper soft nonsense into her ear as i haggled about the price and would squeeze her hand tenderly as i received my halfpence of change in a bit of whitybrown paper let this serve as a hint to all haberdashers who have pretty daughters for shopgirls and young students for customers i do not know whether my words and looks were very eloquent but my poetry was irresistible for to tell the truth the girl had some literary taste and was seldom without a book from the circulating library  by the divine power of poetry therefore which is irresistible with the lovely sex did i subdue the heart of this fair little haberdasher we carried on a sentimental correspondence for a time across the counter and i supplied her with rhyme by the stockingful at length i prevailed on her to grant me an assignation but how was it to be effected her father kept her always under his eye she never walked out alone and the house was locked up the moment that the shop was shut all these difficulties served but to give zest to the adventure i proposed that the assignation should be in her own chamber into which i would climb at night the plan was irresistible a cruel father a secret lover and a clandestine meeting all the little girls studies from the circulating library seemed about to be realised but what had i in view in making this assignation indeed i know not i had no evil intentions nor can i say that i had any good ones i liked the girl and wanted to have an opportunity of seeing more of her and the assignation was made as i have done many things else heedlessly and without forethought i asked myself a few questions of the kind after all my arrangements were made but the answers were very unsatisfactory am i to ruin this poor thoughtless girl said i to myself no was the prompt and indignant answer am i to run away with her whitherand to what purpose well then am i to marry herpah a man of my expectations marry a shopkeepers daughter what then am i to do with her humwhylet me get into her chamber first and then considerand so the selfexamination ended  well sir come what come might i stole under cover of the darkness to the dwelling of my dulcinea all was quiet at the concerted signal her window was gently opened it was just above the projecting bowwindow of her fathers shop which assisted me in mounting the house was low and i was enabled to scale the fortress with tolerable ease i clambered with a beating heart i reached the casement i hoisted my body half into the chamber and was welcomed not by the embraces of my expecting fair one but by the grasp of the crabbedlooking old father in the crisp curled wig  i extricated myself from his clutches and endeavored to make my retreat but i was confounded by his cries of thieves and robbers i was bothered too by his sunday cane which was amazingly busy about my head as i descended and against which my hat was but a poor protection never before had i an idea of the activity of an old mans arm and hardness of the knob of an ivoryheaded cane in my hurry and confusion i missed my footing and fell sprawling on the pavement i was immediately surrounded by myrmidons who i doubt not were on the watch for me indeed i was in no situation to escape for i had sprained my ankle in the fall and could not stand i was seized as a housebreaker and to exonerate myself from a greater crime i had to accuse myself of a less i made known who i was and why i came there alas the varlets knew it already and were only amusing themselves at my expense my perfidious muse had been playing me one of her slippery tricks the old curmudgeon of a father had found my sonnets and acrostics hid away in holes and corners of his shop he had no taste for poetry like his daughter and had instituted a rigorous though silent observation he had moused upon our letters detected the ladder of ropes and prepared everything for my reception thus was i ever doomed to be led into scrapes by the muse let no man henceforth carry on a secret amour in poetry  the old mans ire was in some measure appeased by the pummelling of my head and the anguish of my sprain so he did not put me to death on the spot he was even humane enough to furnish a shutter on which i was carried back to the college like a wounded warrior the porter was roused to admit me the college gate was thrown open for my entry the affair was blazed abroad the next morning and became the joke of the college from the buttery to the hall  i had leisure to repent during several weeks confinement by my sprain which i passed in translating boethius consolations of philosophy i received a most tender and illspelled letter from my mistress who had been sent to a relation in coventry she protested her innocence of my misfortunes and vowed to be true to me till death i took no notice of the letter for i was cured for the present both of love and poetry women however are more constant in their attachments than men whatever philosophers may say to the contrary i am assured that she actually remained faithful to her vow for several months but she had to deal with a cruel father whose heart was as hard as the knob of his cane he was not to be touched by tears or poetry but absolutely compelled her to marry a reputable young tradesman who made her a happy woman in spite of herself and of all the rules of romance and what is more the mother of several children they are at this very day a thriving couple and keep a snug corner shop just opposite the figure of peeping tom at coventry  i will not fatigue you by any more details of my studies at oxford though they were not always as severe as these nor did i always pay as dear for my lessons people may say what they please a studious life has its charms and there are many places more gloomy than the cloisters of a university  to be brief then i lived on in my usual miscellaneous manner gradually getting a knowledge of good and evil until i had attained my twentyfirst year i had scarcely come of age when i heard of the sudden death of my father the shock was severe for though he had never treated me with kindness still he was my father and at his death i felt myself alone in the world  i returned home to act as chief mourner at his funeral it was attended by many of the sportsmen of the country for he was an important member of their fraternity according to his request his favorite hunter was led after the hearse the rednosed foxhunter who had taken a little too much wine at the house made a maudlin eulogy of the deceased and wished to give the view halloo over the grave but he was rebuked by the rest of the company they all shook me kindly by the hand said many consolatory things to me and invited me to become a member of the hunt in my fathers place  when i found myself alone in my paternal home a crowd of gloomy feelings came thronging upon me it was a place that always seemed to sober me and bring me to reflection now especially it looked so deserted and melancholy the furniture displaced about the room the chairs in groups as their departed occupants had sat either in whispering têteàtêtes or gossiping clusters the bottles and decanters and wineglasses half emptied and scattered about the tablesall dreary traces of a funeral festival i entered the little breakfasting room there were my fathers whip and spurs hanging by the fireplace and his favorite pointer lying on the hearthrug the poor animal came fondling about me and licked my hand though he had never before noticed me and then he looked round the room and whined and wagged his tail slightly and gazed wistfully in my face i felt the full force of the appeal poor dash said i we are both alone in the world with nobody to care for us and well take care of one another the dog never quitted me afterwards  i could not go into my mothers room my heart swelled when i passed within sight of the door her portrait hung in the parlor just over the place where she used to sit as i cast my eyes on it i thought it looked at me with tenderness and i burst into tears my heart had long been seared by living in public schools and buffeting about among strangers who cared nothing for me but the recollection of a mothers tenderness was overcoming  i was not of an age or a temperament to be long depressed there was a reaction in my system that always brought me up again at every pressure and indeed my spirits were most buoyant after a temporary prostration i settled the concerns of the estate as soon as possible realized my property which was not very considerable but which appeared a vast deal to me having a poetical eye that magnified everything and finding myself at the end of a few months free of all farther business or restraint i determined to go to london and enjoy myself why should not ii was young animated joyous had plenty of funds for present pleasures and my uncles estate in the perspective let those mope at college and pore over books thought i who have their way to make in the world it would be ridiculous drudgery in a youth of my expectations  well sir away to london i rattled in a tandem determined to take the town gaily i passed through several of the villages where i had played the jackpudding a few years before and i visited the scenes of many of my adventures and follies merely from that feeling of melancholy pleasure which we have in stepping again into the footprints of foregone existence even when they have passed among weeds and briars i made a circuit in the latter part of my journey so as to take in west end and hempstead the scenes of my last dramatic exploit and of the battle royal of the booth as i drove along the ridge of hempstead hill by jack straws castle i paused at the spot where columbine and i had sat down so disconsolately in our ragged finery and looked dubiously upon london i almost expected to see her again standing on the hills brink like niobe all tearsmournful as babylon in ruins  poor columbine said i with a heavy sigh thou wert a gallant generous girla true woman faithful to the distressed and ready to sacrifice thyself in the cause of worthless man  i tried to whistle off the recollection of her for there was always something of selfreproach with it i drove gayly along the road enjoying the stare of hostlers and stableboys as i managed my horses knowingly down the steep street of hempstead when just at the skirts of the village one of the traces of my leader came loose i pulled up and as the animal was restive and my servant a bungler i called for assistance to the robustious master of a snug alehouse who stood at his door with a tankard in his hand he came readily to assist me followed by his wife with her bosom half open a child in her arms and two more at her heels i stared for a moment as if doubting my eyes i could not be mistaken in the fat beerblown landlord of the alehouse i recognized my old rival harlequin and in his slattern spouse the once trim and dimpling columbine  the change of my looks from youth to manhood and the change of my circumstances prevented them from recognizing me they could not suspect in the dashing young buck fashionably dressed and driving his own equipage their former comrade the painted beau with old peaked hat and long flimsy skyblue coat my heart yearned with kindness towards columbine and i was glad to see her establishment a thriving one as soon as the harness was adjusted i tossed a small purse of gold into her ample bosom and then pretending give my horses a hearty cut of the whip i made the lash curl with a whistling about the sleek sides of ancient harlequin the horses dashed off like lightning and i was whirled out of sight before either of the parties could get over their surprise at my liberal donations i have always considered this as one of the greatest proofs of my poetical genius it was distributing poetical justice in perfection  i now entered london en cavalier and became a blood upon town i took fashionable lodgings in the west end employed the first tailor frequented the regular lounges gambled a little lost my money goodhumoredly and gained a number of fashionable goodfornothing acquaintances had i had more industry and ambition in my nature i might have worked my way to the very height of fashion as i saw many laborious gentlemen doing around me but it is a toilsome an anxious and an unhappy life there are few beings so sleepless and miserable as your cultivators of fashionable smiles  i was quite content with that kind of society which forms the frontiers of fashion and may be easily taken possession of i found it a light easy productive soil i had but to go about and sow visiting cards and i reaped a whole harvest of invitations indeed my figure and address were by no means against me it was whispered too among the young ladies that i was prodigiously clever and wrote poetry and the old ladies had ascertained that i was a young gentleman of good family handsome fortune and great expectations  i now was carried away by the hurry of gay life so intoxicating to a young man and which a man of poetical temperament enjoys so highly on his first tasting of it that rapid variety of sensations that whirl of brilliant objects that succession of pungent pleasures i had no time for thought i only felt i never attempted to write poetry my poetry seemed all to go off by transpiration i lived poetry it was all a poetical dream to me a mere sensualist knows nothing of the delights of a splendid metropolis he lives in a round of animal gratifications and heartless habits but to a young man of poetical feelings it is an ideal world a scene of enchantment and delusion his imagination is in perpetual excitement and gives a spiritual zest to every pleasure  a season of town life somewhat sobered me of my intoxication or rather i was rendered more serious by one of my old complaintsi fell in love it was with a very pretty though a very haughty fair one who had come to london under the care of an old maiden aunt to enjoy the pleasures of a winter in town and to get married there was not a doubt of her commanding a choice of lovers for she had long been the belle of a little cathedral town and one of the prebendaries had absolutely celebrated her beauty in a copy of latin verses  i paid my court to her and was favorably received both by her and her aunt nay i had a marked preference shown me over the younger son of a needy baronet and a captain of dragoons on half pay i did not absolutely take the field in form for i was determined not to be precipitate but i drove my equipage frequently through the street in which she lived and was always sure to see her at the window generally with a book in her hand i resumed my knack at rhyming and sent her a long copy of verses anonymously to be sure but she knew my handwriting they displayed however the most delightful ignorance on the subject the young lady showed them to me wondered who they could be written by and declared there was nothing in this world she loved so much as poetry while the maiden aunt would put her pinching spectacles on her nose and read them with blunders in sense and sound that were excruciating to an authors ears protesting there was nothing equal to them in the whole elegant extracts  the fashionable season closed without my adventuring to make a declaration though i certainly had encouragement i was not perfectly sure that i had effected a lodgment in the young ladys heart and to tell the truth the aunt overdid her part and was a little too extravagant in her liking of me i knew that maiden aunts were not apt to be captivated by the mere personal merits of their nieces admirers and i wanted to ascertain how much of all this favor i owed to my driving an equipage and having great expectations  i had received many hints how charming their native town was during the summer months what pleasant society they had and what beautiful drives about the neighborhood they had not therefore returned home long before i made my appearance in dashing style driving down the principal street it is an easy thing to put a little quiet cathedral town in a buzz the very next morning i was seen at prayers seated in the pew of the reigning belle all the congregation was in a flutter the prebends eyed me from their stalls questions were whispered about the aisles after service who is he and what is he and the replies were as usuala young gentleman of good family and fortune and great expectations  i was pleased with the peculiarities of a cathedral town where i found i was a personage of some consequence i was quite a brilliant acquisition to the young ladies of the cathedral circle who were glad to have a beau that was not in a black coat and clerical wig  you must know that there was a vast distinction between the classes of society of the town as it was a place of some trade there were many wealthy inhabitants among the commercial and manufacturing classes who lived in style and gave many entertainments nothing of trade however was admitted into the cathedral circlefaugh the thing could not be thought of the cathedral circle therefore was apt to be very select very dignified and very dull they had evening parties at which the old ladies played cards with the prebends and the young ladies sat and looked on and shifted from one chair to another about the room until it was time to go home  it was difficult to get up a ball from the want of partners the cathedral circle being very deficient in dancers and on those occasions there was an occasional drafting among the dancing men of the other circle who however were generally regarded with great reserve and condescension by the gentlemen in powdered wigs several of the young ladies assured me in confidence that they had often looked with a wistful eye at the gayety of the other circle where there was such plenty of young beaux and where they all seemed to enjoy themselves so merrily but that it would be degradation to think of descending from their sphere  i admired the degree of oldfashioned ceremony and superannuated courtesy that prevailed in this little place the bowings and courtseyings that would take place about the cathedral porch after morning service where knots of old gentlemen and ladies would collect together to ask after each others health and settle the card party for the evening the little presents of fruits and delicacies and the thousand petty messages that would pass from house to house for in a tranquil community like this living entirely at ease and having little to do little duties and little civilities and little amusements fill up the day i have smiled as i looked from my window on a quiet street near the cathedral in the middle of a warm summer day to see a corpulent powdered footman in rich livery carrying a small tart on a large silver salver a dainty titbit sent no doubt by some worthy old dowager to top off the dinner of her favorite prebend  nothing could be more delectable also than the breaking up of one of their evening card parties such shaking of hands such mobbing up in cloaks and tippets there were two or three old sedan chairs that did the duty of the whole place though the greater part made their exit in clogs and pattens with a footman or waitingmaid carrying a lanthorn in advance and at a certain hour of the night the clank of pattens and the gleam of these jack lanthorns here and there about the quiet little town gave notice that the cathedral card party had dissolved and the luminaries were severally seeking their homes to such a community therefore or at least to the female part of it the accession of a gay dashing young beau was a matter of some importance the old ladies eyed me with complacency through their spectacles and the young ladies pronounced me divine everybody received me favorably excepting the gentleman who had written the latin verses on the bellenot that he was jealous of my success with the lady for he had no pretensions to her but he heard my verses praised wherever he went and he could not endure a rival with the muse  i was thus carrying every thing before me i was the adonis of the cathedral circle when one evening there was a public ball which was attended likewise by the gentry of the neighborhood i took great pains with my toilet on the occasion and i had never looked better i had determined that night to make my grand assault on the heart of the young lady to batter it with all my forces and the next morning to demand a surrender in due form  i entered the ballroom amidst a buzz and flutter which generally took place among the young ladies on my appearance i was in fine spirits for to tell the truth i had exhilarated myself by a cheerful glass of wine on the occasion i talked and rattled and said a thousand silly things slapdash with all the confidence of a man sure of his auditors and every thing had its effect  in the midst of my triumph i observed a little knot gathering together in the upper part of the room by degrees it increased a tittering broke out there and glances were cast round at me and then there would be fresh tittering some of the young ladies would hurry away to distant parts of the room and whisper to their friends wherever they went there was still this tittering and glancing at me i did not know what to make of all this i looked at myself from head to foot and peeped at my back in a glass to see if any thing was odd about my person any awkward exposure any whimsical tag hanging outnoevery thing was right i was a perfect picture  i determined that it must be some choice saying of mine that was handled about in this knot of merry beauties and i determined to enjoy one of my good things in the rebound  i stepped gently therefore up the room smiling at every one as i passed who i must say all smiled and tittered in return i approached the group smirking and perking my chin like a man who is full of pleasant feeling and sure of being well received the cluster of little belles opened as i advanced  heavens and earth whom should i perceive in the midst of them but my early and tormenting flame the everlasting sacharissa she was grown up it is true into the full beauty of womanhood but showed by the provoking merriment of her countenance that she perfectly recollected me and the ridiculous flagellations of which she had twice been the cause  i saw at once the exterminating cloud of ridicule that was bursting over me my crest fell the flame of love went suddenly out in my bosom or was extinguished by overwhelming shame how i got down the room i know not i fancied every one tittering at me just as i reached the door i caught a glance of my mistress and her aunt listening to the whispers of my poetic rival the old lady raising her hands and eyes and the face of the young one lighted up with scorn ineffable i paused to see no more but made two steps from the top of the stairs to the bottom the next morning before sunrise i beat a retreat and did not feel the blushes cool from my tingling cheeks until i had lost sight of the old towers of the cathedral  i now returned to town thoughtful and crestfallen my money was nearly spent for i had lived freely and without calculation the dream of love was over and the reign of pleasure at an end i determined to retrench while i had yet a trifle left so selling my equipage and horses for half their value i quietly put the money in my pocket and turned pedestrian i had not a doubt that with my great expectations i could at any time raise funds either on usury or by borrowing but i was principled against both one and the other and resolved by strict economy to make my slender purse hold out until my uncle should give up the ghost or rather the estate  i stayed at home therefore and read and would have written but i had already suffered too much from my poetical productions which had generally involved me in some ridiculous scrape i gradually acquired a rusty look and had a straightened moneyborrowing air upon which the world began to shy me i have never felt disposed to quarrel with the world for its conduct it has always used me well when i have been flush and gay and disposed for society it has caressed me and when i have been pinched and reduced and wished to be alone why it has left me alone and what more could a man desiretake my word for it this world is a more obliging world than people generally represent it  well sir in the midst of my retrenchment my retirement and my studiousness i received news that my uncle was dangerously ill i hastened on the wings of an heirs affection to receive his dying breath and his last testament i found him attended by his faithful valet old iron john by the woman who occasionally worked about the house and by the foxyheaded boy young orson whom i had occasionally hunted about the park  iron john gasped a kind of asthmatical salutation as i entered the room and received me with something almost like a smile of welcome the woman sat blubbering at the foot of the bed and the foxyheaded orson who had now grown to be a lubberly lout stood gazing in stupid vacancy at a distance  my uncle lay stretched upon his back the chamber was without a fire or any of the comforts of a sickroom the cobwebs flaunted from the ceiling the tester was covered with dust and the curtains were tattered from underneath the bed peeped out one end of his strong box against the wainscot were suspended rusty blunderbusses horse pistols and a cutandthrust sword with which he had fortified his room to defend his life and treasure he had employed no physician during his illness and from the scanty relics lying on the table seemed almost to have denied himself the assistance of a cook  when i entered the room he was lying motionless with his eyes fixed and his mouth open at the first look i thought him a corpse the noise of my entrance made him turn his head at the sight of me a ghastly smile came over his face and his glazing eye gleamed with satisfaction it was the only smile he had ever given me and it went to my heart poor old man thought i why would you not let me love youwhy would you force me to leave you thus desolate when i see that my presence has the power to cheer you  nephew said he after several efforts and in a low gasping voice i am glad you are come i shall now die with satisfaction look said he raising his withered hand and pointinglookin that box on the table you will find that i have not forgotten you  i pressed his hand to my heart and the tears stood in my eyes i sat down by his bedside and watched him but he never spoke again my presence however gave him evident satisfactionfor every now and then as he looked at me a vague smile would come over his visage and he would feebly point to the sealed box on the table as the day wore away his life seemed to wear away with it towards sunset his hand sunk on the bed and lay motionless his eyes grew glazed his mouth remained open and thus he gradually died  i could not but feel shocked at this absolute extinction of my kindred i dropped a tear of real sorrow over this strange old man who had thus reserved his smile of kindness to his deathbed like an evening sun after a gloomy day just shining out to set in darkness leaving the corpse in charge of the domestics i retired for the night  it was a rough night the winds seemed as if singing my uncles requiem about the mansion and the bloodhounds howled without as if they knew of the death of their old master iron john almost grudged me the tallow candle to burn in my apartment and light up its dreariness so accustomed had he been to starveling economy i could not sleep the recollection of my uncles dying scene and the dreary sounds about the house affected my mind these however were succeeded by plans for the future and i lay awake the greater part of the night indulging the poetical anticipation how soon i would make these old walls ring with cheerful life and restore the hospitality of my mothers ancestors  my uncles funeral was decent but private i knew there was nobody that respected his memory and i was determined that none should be summoned to sneer over his funeral wines and make merry at his grave he was buried in the church of the neighboring village though it was not the burying place of his race but he had expressly enjoined that he should not be buried with his family he had quarrelled with the most of them when living and he carried his resentments even into the grave  i defrayed the expenses of the funeral out of my own purse that i might have done with the undertakers at once and clear the illomened birds from the premises i invited the parson of the parish and the lawyer from the village to attend at the house the next morning and hear the reading of the will i treated them to an excellent breakfast a profusion that had not been seen at the house for many a year as soon as the breakfast things were removed i summoned iron john the woman and the boy for i was particular of having every one present and proceeding regularly the box was placed on the table all was silence i broke the seal raised the lid and beheldnot the will but my accursed poem of doubting castle and giant despair  could any mortal have conceived that this old withered man so taciturn and apparently lost to feeling could have treasured up for years the thoughtless pleasantry of a boy to punish him with such cruel ingenuity i could now account for his dying smile the only one he had ever given me he had been a grave man all his life it was strange that he should die in the enjoyment of a joke and it was hard that that joke should be at my expense  the lawyer and the parson seemed at a loss to comprehend the matter here must be some mistake said the lawyer there is no will here  oh said iron john creaking forth his rusty jaws if it is a will you are looking for i believe i can find one  he retired with the same singular smile with which he had greeted me on my arrival and which i now apprehended boded me no good in a little while he returned with a will perfect at all points properly signed and sealed and witnessed worded with horrible correctness in which he left large legacies to iron john and his daughter and the residue of his fortune to the foxyheaded boy who to my utter astonishment was his son by this very woman he having married her privately and as i verily believe for no other purpose than to have an heir and so baulk my father and his issue of the inheritance there was one little proviso in which he mentioned that having discovered his nephew to have a pretty turn for poetry he presumed he had no occasion for wealth he recommended him however to the patronage of his heir and requested that he might have a garret rent free in doubting castle  mr buckthorne had paused at the death of his uncle and the downfall of his great expectations which formed as he said an epoch in his history and it was not until some little time afterwards and in a very sober mood that he resumed his particolored narrative  after leaving the domains of my defunct uncle said he when the gate closed between me and what was once to have been mine i felt thrust out naked into the world and completely abandoned to fortune what was to become of me i had been brought up to nothing but expectations and they had all been disappointed i had no relations to look to for counsel or assistance the world seemed all to have died away from me wave after wave of relationship had ebbed off and i was left a mere hulk upon the strand i am not apt to be greatly cast down but at this time i felt sadly disheartened i could not realize my situation nor form a conjecture how i was to get forward  i was now to endeavor to make money the idea was new and strange to me it was like being asked to discover the philosophers stone i had never thought about money other than to put my hand into my pocket and find it or if there were none there to wait until a new supply came from home i had considered life as a mere space of time to be filled up with enjoyments but to have it portioned out into long hours and days of toil merely that i might gain bread to give me strength to toil on to labor but for the purpose of perpetuating a life of labor was new and appalling to me this may appear a very simple matter to some but it will be understood by every unlucky wight in my predicament who has had the misfortune of being born to great expectations  i passed several days in rambling about the scenes of my boyhood partly because i absolutely did not know what to do with myself and partly because i did not know that i should ever see them again i clung to them as one clings to a wreck though he knows he must eventually cast himself loose and swim for his life i sat down on a hill within sight of my paternal home but i did not venture to approach it for i felt compunction at the thoughtlessness with which i had dissipated my patrimony but was i to blame when i had the rich possessions of my curmudgeon of an uncle in expectation  the new possessor of the place was making great alterations the house was almost rebuilt the trees which stood about it were cut down my mothers flowergarden was thrown into a lawn all was undergoing a change i turned my back upon it with a sigh and rambled to another part of the country  how thoughtful a little adversity makes one as i came in sight of the schoolhouse where i had so often been flogged in the cause of wisdom you would hardly have recognized the truant boy who but a few years since had eloped so heedlessly from its walls i leaned over the paling of the playground and watched the scholars at their games and looked to see if there might not be some urchin among them like i was once full of gay dreams about life and the world the playground seemed smaller than when i used to sport about it the house and park too of the neighboring squire the father of the cruel sacharissa had shrunk in size and diminished in magnificence the distant hills no longer appeared so far off and alas no longer awakened ideas of a fairy land beyond  as i was rambling pensively through a neighboring meadow in which i had many a time gathered primroses i met the very pedagogue who had been the tyrant and dread of my boyhood i had sometimes vowed to myself when suffering under his rod that i would have my revenge if ever i met him when i had grown to be a man the time had come but i had no disposition to keep my vow the few years which had matured me into a vigorous man had shrunk him into decrepitude he appeared to have had a paralytic stroke i looked at him and wondered that this poor helpless mortal could have been an object of terror to me that i should have watched with anxiety the glance of that failing eye or dreaded the power of that trembling hand he tottered feebly along the path and had some difficulty in getting over a stile i ran and assisted him he looked at me with surprise but did not recognize me and made a low bow of humility and thanks i had no disposition to make myself known for i felt that i had nothing to boast of the pains he had taken and the pains he had inflicted had been equally useless his repeated predictions were fully verified and i felt that little jack buckthorne the idle boy had grown up to be a very goodfornothing man  this is all very comfortless detail but as i have told you of my follies it is meet that i show you how for once i was schooled for them  the most thoughtless of mortals will some time or other have this day of gloom when he will be compelled to reflect i felt on this occasion as if i had a kind of penance to perform and i made a pilgrimage in expiation of my past levity  having passed a night at leamington i set off by a private path which leads up a hill through a grove and across quiet fields until i came to the small village or rather hamlet of lenington i sought the village church it is an old low edifice of gray stone on the brow of a small hill looking over fertile fields to where the proud towers of warwick castle lifted themselves against the distant horizon a part of the churchyard is shaded by large trees under one of these my mother lay buried you have no doubt thought me a light heartless being i thought myself sobut there are moments of adversity which let us into some feelings of our nature to which we might otherwise remain perpetual strangers  i sought my mothers grave the weeds were already matted over it and the tombstone was half hid among nettles i cleared them away and they stung my hands but i was heedless of the pain for my heart ached too severely i sat down on the grave and read over and over again the epitaph on the stone it was simple but it was true i had written it myself i had tried to write a poetical epitaph but in vain my feelings refused to utter themselves in rhyme my heart had gradually been filling during my lonely wanderings it was now charged to the brim and overflowed i sank upon the grave and buried my face in the tall grass and wept like a child yes i wept in manhood upon the grave as i had in infancy upon the bosom of my mother alas how little do we appreciate a mothers tenderness while living how heedless are we in youth of all her anxieties and kindness but when she is dead and gone when the cares and coldness of the world come withering to our hearts when we find how hard it is to find true sympathy how few love us for ourselves how few will befriend us in our misfortunes then it is we think of the mother we have lost it is true i had always loved my mother even in my most heedless days but i felt how inconsiderate and ineffectual had been my love my heart melted as i retraced the days of infancy when i was led by a mothers hand and rocked to sleep in a mothers arms and was without care or sorrow oh my mother exclaimed i burying my face again in the grass of the graveoh that i were once more by your side sleeping never to wake again on the cares and troubles of this world  i am not naturally of a morbid temperament and the violence of my emotion gradually exhausted itself it was a hearty honest natural discharge of griefs which had been slowly accumulating and gave me wonderful relief i rose from the grave as if i had been offering up a sacrifice and i felt as if that sacrifice had been accepted  i sat down again on the grass and plucked one by one the weeds from her grave the tears trickled more slowly down my cheeks and ceased to be bitter it was a comfort to think that she had died before sorrow and poverty came upon her child and that all his great expectations were blasted  i leaned my cheek upon my hand and looked upon the landscape its quiet beauty soothed me the whistle of a peasant from an adjoining field came cheerily to my ear i seemed to respire hope and comfort with the free air that whispered through the leaves and played lightly with my hair and dried the tears upon my cheek a lark rising from the field before me and leaving as it were a stream of song behind him as he rose lifted my fancy with him he hovered in the air just above the place where the towers of warwick castle marked the horizon and seemed as if fluttering with delight at his own melody surely thought i if there were such a thing as transmigration of souls this might be taken for some poet let loose from earth but still revelling in song and carolling about fair fields and lordly towns  at this moment the long forgotten feeling of poetry rose within me a thought sprung at once into my mind i will become an author said i i have hitherto indulged in poetry as a pleasure and it has brought me nothing but pain let me try what it will do when i cultivate it with devotion as a pursuit  the resolution thus suddenly aroused within me heaved a load from off my heart i felt a confidence in it from the very place where it was formed it seemed as though my mothers spirit whispered it to me from her grave i will henceforth said i endeavor to be all that she fondly imagined me i will endeavor to act as if she were witness of my actions i will endeavor to acquit myself in such manner that when i revisit her grave there may at least be no compunctious bitterness in my tears  i bowed down and kissed the turf in solemn attestation of my vow i plucked some primroses that were growing there and laid them next my heart i left the churchyard with my spirits once more lifted up and set out a third time for london in the character of an author                                       here my companion made a pause and i waited in anxious suspense hoping to have a whole volume of literary life unfolded to me he seemed however to have sunk into a fit of pensive musing and when after some time i gently roused him by a question or two as to his literary career no said he smiling over that part of my story i wish to leave a cloud let the mysteries of the craft rest sacred for me let those who have never adventured into the republic of letters still look upon it as a fairy land let them suppose the author the very being they picture him from his works i am not the man to mar their illusion i am not the man to hint while one is admiring the silken web of persia that it has been spun from the entrails of a miserable worm  well said i if you will tell me nothing of your literary history let me know at least if you have had any farther intelligence from doubting castle  willingly replied he though i have but little to communicate     the booby squire   a long time elapsed said buckthorne without my receiving any accounts of my cousin and his estate indeed i felt so much soreness on the subject that i wished if possible to shut it from my thoughts at length chance took me into that part of the country and i could not refrain from making some inquiries  i learnt that my cousin had grown up ignorant selfwilled and clownish his ignorance and clownishness had prevented his mingling with the neighboring gentry in spite of his great fortune he had been unsuccessful in an attempt to gain the hand of the daughter of the parson and had at length shrunk into the limits of such society as a mere man of wealth can gather in a country neighborhood  he kept horses and hounds and a roaring table at which were collected the loose livers of the country round and the shabby gentlemen of a village in the vicinity when he could get no other company he would smoke and drink with his own servants who in their turns fleeced and despised him still with all this apparent prodigality he had a leaven of the old man in him which showed that he was his trueborn son he lived far within his income was vulgar in his expenses and penurious on many points on which a gentleman would be extravagant his house servants were obliged occasionally to work on the estate and part of the pleasure grounds were ploughed up and devoted to husbandry  his table though plentiful was coarse his liquors strong and bad and more ale and whiskey were expended in his establishment than generous wine he was loud and arrogant at his own table and exacted a rich mans homage from his vulgar and obsequious guests  as to iron john his old grandfather he had grown impatient of the tight hand his own grandson kept over him and quarrelled with him soon after he came to the estate the old man had retired to a neighboring village where he lived on the legacy of his late master in a small cottage and was as seldom seen out of it as a rat out of his hole in daylight  the cub like caliban seemed to have an instinctive attachment to his mother she resided with him but from long habit she acted more as servant than as mistress of the mansion for she toiled in all the domestic drudgery and was oftener in the kitchen than the parlor such was the information which i collected of my rival cousin who had so unexpectedly elbowed me out of all my expectations  i now felt an irresistible hankering to pay a visit to this scene of my boyhood and to get a peep at the odd kind of life that was passing within the mansion of my maternal ancestors i determined to do so in disguise my booby cousin had never seen enough of me to be very familiar with my countenance and a few years make great difference between youth and manhood i understood he was a breeder of cattle and proud of his stock i dressed myself therefore as a substantial farmer and with the assistance of a red scratch that came low down on my forehead made a complete change in my physiognomy  it was past three oclock when i arrived at the gate of the park and was admitted by an old woman who was washing in a dilapidated building which had once been a porters lodge i advanced up the remains of a noble avenue many of the trees of which had been cut down and sold for timber the grounds were in scarcely better keeping than during my uncles lifetime the grass was overgrown with weeds and the trees wanted pruning and clearing of dead branches cattle were grazing about the lawns and ducks and geese swimming in the fishponds  the road to the house bore very few traces of carriage wheels as my cousin received few visitors but such as came on foot or on horseback and never used a carriage himself once indeed as i was told he had had the old family carriage drawn out from among the dust and cobwebs of the coachhouse and furbished up and had drove with his mother to the village church to take formal possession of the family pew but there was such hooting and laughing after them as they passed through the village and such giggling and bantering about the church door that the pageant had never made a reappearance  as i approached the house a legion of whelps sallied out barking at me accompanied by the low howling rather than barking of two old wornout bloodhounds which i recognized for the ancient lifeguards of my uncle the house had still a neglected random appearance though much altered for the better since my last visit several of the windows were broken and patched up with boards and others had been bricked up to save taxes i observed smoke however rising from the chimneys a phenomenon rarely witnessed in the ancient establishment on passing that part of the house where the diningroom was situated i heard the sound of boisterous merriment where three or four voices were talking at once and oaths and laughter were horribly mingled  the uproar of the dogs had brought a servant to the door a tall hardfisted country clown with a livery coat put over the undergarments of a ploughman i requested to see the master of the house but was told he was at dinner with some gemmen of the neighborhood i made known my business and sent in to know if i might talk with the master about his cattle for i felt a great desire to have a peep at him at his orgies word was returned that he was engaged with company and could not attend to business but that if i would step in and take a drink of something i was heartily welcome i accordingly entered the hall where whips and hats of all kinds and shapes were lying on an oaken table two or three clownish servants were lounging about everything had a look of confusion and carelessness  the apartments through which i passed had the same air of departed gentility and sluttish housekeeping the once rich curtains were faded and dusty the furniture greased and tarnished on entering the diningroom i found a number of odd vulgarlooking rustic gentlemen seated round a table on which were bottles decanters tankards pipes and tobacco several dogs were lying about the room or sitting and watching their masters and one was gnawing a bone under a sidetable  the master of the feast sat at the head of the board he was greatly altered he had grown thickset and rather gummy with a fiery foxy head of hair there was a singular mixture of foolishness arrogance and conceit in his countenance he was dressed in a vulgarly fine style with leather breeches a red waistcoat and green coat and was evidently like his guests a little flushed with drinking the whole company stared at me with a whimsical muggy look like men whose senses were a little obfuscated by beer rather than wine  my cousin god forgive me the appellation sticks in my throat my cousin invited me with awkward civility or as he intended it condescension to sit to the table and drink we talked as usual about the weather the crops politics and hard times my cousin was a loud politician and evidently accustomed to talk without contradiction at his own table he was amazingly loyal and talked of standing by the throne to the last guinea as every gentleman of fortune should do the village exciseman who was half asleep could just ejaculate very true to every thing he said  the conversation turned upon cattle he boasted of his breed his mode of managing it and of the general management of his estate this unluckily drew on a history of the place and of the family he spoke of my late uncle with the greatest irreverence which i could easily forgive he mentioned my name and my blood began to boil he described my frequent visits to my uncle when i was a lad and i found the varlet even at that time imp as he was had known that he was to inherit the estate  he described the scene of my uncles death and the opening of the will with a degree of coarse humor that i had not expected from him and vexed as i was i could not help joining in the laugh for i have always relished a joke even though made at my own expense he went on to speak of my various pursuits my strolling freak and that somewhat nettled me at length he talked of my parents he ridiculed my father i stomached even that though with great difficulty he mentioned my mother with a sneerand in an instant he lay sprawling at my feet  here a scene of tumult succeeded the table was nearly overturned bottles glasses and tankards rolled crashing and clattering about the floor the company seized hold of both of us to keep us from doing farther mischief i struggled to get loose for i was boiling with fury my cousin defied me to strip and fight him on the lawn i agreed for i felt the strength of a giant in me and i longed to pummel him soundly  away then we were borne a ring was formed i had a second assigned me in true boxing style my cousin as he advanced to fight said something about his generosity in showing me such fair play when i had made such an unprovoked attack upon him at his own table  stop there cried i in a rageunprovokedknow that i am john buckthorne and you have insulted the memory of my mother  the lout was suddenly struck by what i said he drew back and reflected for a moment  nay damn it said he thats too muchthats clear another thing ive a mother myself and no one shall speak ill of her bad as she is  he paused again nature seemed to have a rough struggle in his rude bosom  damn it cousin cried he im sorry for what i said thoust served me right in knocking me down and i like thee the better for it heres my hand come and live with me and damme but the best room in the house and the best horse in the stable shall be at thy service  i declare to you i was strongly moved at this instance of nature breaking her way through such a lump of flesh i forgave the fellow in a moment all his crimes of having been born in wedlock and inheriting my estate i shook the hand he offered me to convince him that i bore him no ill will and then making my way through the gaping crowd of toadeaters bade adieu to my uncles domains forever this is the last i have seen or heard of my cousin or of the domestic concerns of doubting castle     the strolling manager   as i was walking one morning with buckthorne near one of the principal theaters he directed my attention to a group of those equivocal beings that may often be seen hovering about the stagedoors of theaters they were marvellously illfavored in their attire their coats buttoned up to their chins yet they wore their hats smartly on one side and had a certain knowing dirtygentlemanlike air which is common to the subalterns of the drama buckthorne knew them well by early experience  these said he are the ghosts of departed kings and heroes fellows who sway sceptres and truncheons command kingdoms and armies and after giving way realms and treasures over night have scarce a shilling to pay for a breakfast in the morning yet they have the true vagabond abhorrence of all useful and industrious employment and they have their pleasures too one of which is to lounge in this way in the sunshine at the stagedoor during rehearsals and make hackneyed theatrical jokes on all passersby  nothing is more traditional and legitimate than the stage old scenery old clothes old sentiments old ranting and old jokes are handed down from generation to generation and will probably continue to be so until time shall be no more every hangeron of a theater becomes a wag by inheritance and flourishes about at taprooms and sixpenny clubs with the property jokes of the greenroom  while amusing ourselves with reconnoitring this group we noticed one in particular who appeared to be the oracle he was a weatherbeaten veteran a little bronzed by time and beer who had no doubt grown gray in the parts of robbers cardinals roman senators and walking noblemen  theres something in the set of that hat and the turn of that physiognomy that is extremely familiar to me said buckthorne he looked a little closer i cannot be mistaken added he that must be my old brother of the truncheon flimsey the tragic hero of the strolling company  it was he in fact the poor fellow showed evident signs that times went hard with him he was so finely and shabbily dressed his coat was somewhat threadbare and of the lord townly cut singlebreasted and scarcely capable of meeting in front of his body which from long intimacy had acquired the symmetry and robustness of a beerbarrel he wore a pair of dingy white stockinet pantaloons which had much ado to reach his waistcoat a great quantity of dirty cravat and a pair of old russetcolored tragedy boots  when his companions had dispersed buckthorne drew him aside and made himself known to him the tragic veteran could scarcely recognize him or believe that he was really his quondam associate little gentleman jack buckthorne invited him to a neighboring coffeehouse to talk over old times and in the course of a little while we were put in possession of his history in brief  he had continued to act the heroes in the strolling company for some time after buckthorne had left it or rather had been driven from it so abruptly at length the manager died and the troop was thrown into confusion every one aspired to the crown every one was for taking the lead and the managers widow although a tragedy queen and a brimstone to boot pronounced it utterly impossible to keep any control over such a set of tempestuous rascallions  upon this hint i spoke said flimseyi stepped forward and offered my services in the most effectual way they were accepted in a weeks time i married the widow and succeeded to the throne the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage table as hamlet says but the ghost of my predecessor never haunted me and i inherited crowns sceptres bowls daggers and all the stage trappings and trumpery not omitting the widow without the least molestation  i now led a flourishing life of it for our company was pretty strong and attractive and as my wife and i took the heavy parts of tragedy it was a great saving to the treasury we carried off the palm from all the rival shows at country fairs and i assure you we have even drawn full houses and being applauded by the critics at bartlemy fair itself though we had astleys troupe the irish giant and the death of nelson in waxwork to contend against  i soon began to experience however the cares of command i discovered that there were cabals breaking out in the company headed by the clown who you may recollect was a terribly peevish fractious fellow and always in illhumor i had a great mind to turn him off at once but i could not do without him for there was not a droller scoundrel on the stage his very shape was comic for he had to turn his back upon the audience and all the ladies were ready to die with laughing he felt his importance and took advantage of it he would keep the audience in a continual roar and then come behind the scenes and fret and fume and play the very devil i excused a great deal in him however knowing that comic actors are a little prone to this infirmity of temper  i had another trouble of a nearer and dearer nature to struggle with which was the affection of my wife as ill luck would have it she took it into her head to be very fond of me and became intolerably jealous i could not keep a pretty girl in the company and hardly dared embrace an ugly one even when my part required it i have known her to reduce a fine lady to tatters to very rags as hamlet says in an instant and destroy one of the very best dresses in the wardrobe merely because she saw me kiss her at the side scenesthough i give you my honor it was done merely by way of rehearsal  this was doubly annoying because i have a natural liking to pretty faces and wish to have them about me and because they are indispensable to the success of a company at a fair where one has to vie with so many rival theatres but when once a jealous wife gets a freak in her head theres no use in talking of interest or anything else egad sirs i have more than once trembled when during a fit of her tantrums she was playing high tragedy and flourishing her tin dagger on the stage lest she should give way to her humor and stab some fancied rival in good earnest  i went on better however than could be expected considering the weakness of my flesh and the violence of my rib i had not a much worse time of it than old jupiter whose spouse was continually ferreting out some new intrigue and making the heavens almost too hot to hold him  at length as luck would have it we were performing at a country fair when i understood the theatre of a neighboring town to be vacant i had always been desirous to be enrolled in a settled company and the height of my desire was to get on a par with a brotherinlaw who was manager of a regular theatre and who had looked down upon me here was an opportunity not to be neglected i concluded an agreement with the proprietors and in a few days opened the theatre with great eclát  behold me now at the summit of my ambition the high topgallant of my joy as thomas says no longer a chieftain of a wandering tribe but the monarch of a legitimate throneand entitled to call even the great potentates of covent garden and drury lane cousin  you no doubt think my happiness complete alas sir i was one of the most uncomfortable dogs living no one knows who has not tried the miseries of a manager but above all of a country managementno one can conceive the contentions and quarrels within doors the oppressions and vexations from without  i was pestered with the bloods and loungers of a country town who infested my greenroom and played the mischief among my actresses but there was no shaking them off it would have been ruin to affront them for though troublesome friends they would have been dangerous enemies then there were the village critics and village amateurs who were continually tormenting me with advice and getting into a passion if i would not take itespecially the village doctor and the village attorney who had both been to london occasionally and knew what acting should be  i had also to manage as arrant a crew of scapegraces as were ever collected together within the walls of a theatre i had been obliged to combine my original troupe with some of the former troupe of the theatre who were favorites with the public here was a mixture that produced perpetual ferment they were all the time either fighting or frolicking with each other and i scarcely knew which mood was least troublesome if they quarrelled everything went wrong and if they were friends they were continually playing off some confounded prank upon each other or upon me for i had unhappily acquired among them the character of an easy good natured fellow the worst character that a manager can possess  their waggery at times drove me almost crazy for there is nothing so vexatious as the hackneyed tricks and hoaxes and pleasantries of a veteran band of theatrical vagabonds i relished them well enough it is true while i was merely one of the company but as manager i found them detestable they were incessantly bringing some disgrace upon the theatre by their tavern frolics and their pranks about the country town all my lectures upon the importance of keeping up the dignity of the profession and the respectability of the company were in vain the villains could not sympathize with the delicate feelings of a man in station they even trifled with the seriousness of stage business i have had the whole piece interrupted and a crowded audience of at least twentyfive pounds kept waiting because the actors had hid away the breeches of rosalind and have known hamlet stalk solemnly on to deliver his soliloquy with a dishclout pinned to his skirts such are the baleful consequences of a managers getting a character for good nature  i was intolerably annoyed too by the great actors who came down starring as it is called from london of all baneful influences keep me from that of a london star a firstrate actress going the rounds of the country theatres is as bad as a blazing comet whisking about the heavens and shaking fire and plagues and discords from its tail  the moment one of these heavenly bodies appeared on my horizon i was sure to be in hot water my theatre was overrun by provincial dandies copperwashed counterfeits of bond street loungers who are always proud to be in the train of an actress from town and anxious to be thought on exceeding good terms with her it was really a relief to me when some random young nobleman would come in pursuit of the bait and awe all this small fry to a distance i have always felt myself more at ease with a nobleman than with the dandy of a country town  and then the injuries i suffered in my personal dignity and my managerial authority from the visits of these great london actors sir i was no longer master of myself or my throne i was hectored and lectured in my own greenroom and made an absolute nincompoop on my own stage there is no tyrant so absolute and capricious as a london star at a country theatre  i dreaded the sight of all of them and yet if i did not engage them i was sure of having the public clamorous against me they drew full houses and appeared to be making my fortune but they swallowed up all the profits by their insatiable demands they were absolute tapeworms to my little theatre the more it took in the poorer it grew they were sure to leave me with an exhausted public empty benches and a score or two of affronts to settle among the townsfolk in consequence of misunderstandings about the taking of places  but the worst thing i had to undergo in my managerial career was patronage oh sir of all things deliver me from the patronage of the great people of a country town it was my ruin you must know that this town though small was filled with feuds and parties and great folks being a busy little trading and manufacturing town the mischief was that their greatness was of a kind not to be settled by reference to the court calendar or college of heraldry it was therefore the most quarrelsome kind of greatness in existence you smile sir but let me tell you there are no feuds more furious than the frontier feuds which take place on these debatable lands of gentility the most violent dispute that i ever knew in high life was one that occurred at a country town on a question of precedence between the ladies of a manufacturer of pins and a manufacturer of needles  at the town where i was situated there were perpetual altercations of the kind the head manufacturers lady for instance was at daggers drawings with the head shopkeepers and both were too rich and had too many friends to be treated lightly the doctors and lawyers ladies held their heads still higher but they in their turn were kept in check by the wife of a country banker who kept her own carriage while a masculine widow of cracked character and secondhand fashion who lived in a large house and was in some way related to nobility looked down upon them all she had been exiled from the great world but here she ruled absolute to be sure her manners were not overelegant nor her fortune overlarge but then sir her bloodoh her blood carried it all hollow there was no withstanding a woman with such blood in her veins  after all she had frequent battles for precedence at balls and assemblies with some of the sturdy dames of the neighborhood who stood upon their wealth and their reputations but then she had two dashing daughters who dressed as fine as dragons and had as high blood as their mother and seconded her in everything so they carried their point with high heads and every body hated abused and stood in awe of the fantadlins  such was the state of the fashionable world in this selfimportant little town unluckily i was not as well acquainted with its politics as i should have been i had found myself a stranger and in great perplexities during my first season i determined therefore to put myself under the patronage of some powerful name and thus to take the field with the prejudices of the public in my favor i cast round my thoughts for the purpose and in an evil hour they fell upon mrs fantadlin no one seemed to me to have a more absolute sway in the world of fashion i had always noticed that her party slammed the box door the loudest at the theatre had most beaux attending on them and talked and laughed loudest during the performance and then the miss fantadlins wore always more feathers and flowers than any other ladies and used quizzing glasses incessantly the first evening of my theatres reopening therefore was announced in flaring capitals on the play bills under the patronage of the honorable mrs fantadlin  sir the whole community flew to arms the bankers wife felt her dignity grievously insulted at not having the preference her husband being high bailiff and the richest man in the place she immediately issued invitations for a large party for the night of the performance and asked many a lady to it whom she never had noticed before the fashionable world had long groaned under the tyranny of the fantadlins and were glad to make a common cause against this new instance of assumptionpresume to patronize the theatre insufferable those too who had never before been noticed by the bankers lady were ready to enlist in any quarrel for the honor of her acquaintance all minor feuds were therefore forgotten the doctors lady and the lawyers lady met together and the manufacturers lady and the shopkeepers lady kissed each other and all headed by the bankers lady voted the theatre a bore and determined to encourage nothing but the indian jugglers and mr walkers eidonianeon  alas for poor pillgarlick i little knew the mischief that was brewing against me my box book remained blank the evening arrived but no audience the music struck up to a tolerable pit and gallery but no fashionables i peeped anxiously from behind the curtain but the time passed away the play was retarded until pit and gallery became furious and i had to raise the curtain and play my greatest part in tragedy to a beggarly account of empty boxes  it is true the fantadlins came late as was their custom and entered like a tempest with a flutter of feathers and red shawls but they were evidently disconcerted at finding they had no one to admire and envy them and were enraged at this glaring defection of their fashionable followers all the beaumonde were engaged at the bankers ladys rout they remained for some time in solitary and uncomfortable state and though they had the theatre almost to themselves yet for the first time they talked in whispers they left the house at the end of the first piece and i never saw them afterwards  such was the rock on which i split i never got over the patronage of the fantadlin family it became the vogue to abuse the theatre and declare the performers shocking an equestrian troupe opened a circus in the town about the same time and rose on my ruins my house was deserted my actors grew discontented because they were ill paid my door became a hammeringplace for every bailiff in the county and my wife became more and more shrewish and tormenting the more i wanted comfort  the establishment now became a scene of confusion and peculation i was considered a ruined man and of course fair game for every one to pluck at as every one plunders a sinking ship day after day some of the troupe deserted and like deserting soldiers carried off their arms and accoutrements with them in this manner my wardrobe took legs and walked away my finery strolled all over the country my swords and daggers glittered in every barn until at last my tailor made one fell swoop and carried off three dress coats half a dozen doublets and nineteen pair of fleshcolored pantaloons  this was the be all and the end all of my fortune i no longer hesitated what to do egad thought i since stealing is the order of the day ill steal too so i secretly gathered together the jewels of my wardrobe packed up a heros dress in a handkerchief slung it on the end of a tragedy sword and quietly stole off at dead of nightthe bell then beating oneleaving my queen and kingdom to the mercy of my rebellious subjects and my merciless foes the bumbailiffs  such sir was the end of all my greatness i was heartily cured of all passion for governing and returned once more into the ranks i had for some time the usual run of an actors life i played in various country theatres at fairs and in barns sometimes hard pushed sometimes flush until on one occasion i came within an ace of making my fortune and becoming one of the wonders of the age  i was playing the part of richard the third in a country barn and absolutely outheroding herod an agent of one of the great london theatres was present he was on the lookout for something that might be got up as a prodigy the theatre it seems was in desperate conditionnothing but a miracle could save it he pitched upon me for that miracle i had a remarkable bluster in my style and swagger in my gait and having taken to drink a little during my troubles my voice was somewhat cracked so that it seemed like two voices run into one the thought struck the agent to bring me out as a theatrical wonder as the restorer of natural and legitimate acting as the only one who could understand and act shakespeare rightly he waited upon me the next morning and opened his plan i shrunk from it with becoming modesty for well as i thought of myself i felt myself unworthy of such praise  sblood man said he no praise at all you dont imagine that i think you all this i only want the public to think so nothing so easy as gulling the public if you only set up a prodigy you need not try to act well you must only act furiously no matter what you do or how you act so that it be but odd and strange we will have all the pit packed and the newspapers hired whatever you do different from famous actors it shall be insisted that you are right and they were wrong if you rant it shall be pure passion if you are vulgar it shall be a touch of nature every one shall be prepared to fall into raptures and shout and yell at certain points which you shall make if you do but escape pelting the first night your fortune and the fortune of the theatre is made  i set off for london therefore full of new hopes i was to be the restorer of shakespeare and nature and the legitimate drama my very swagger was to be heroic and my cracked voice the standard of elocution alas sir my usual luck attended me before i arrived in the metropolis a rival wonder had appeared a woman who could dance the slack rope and run up a cord from the stage to the gallery with fireworks all round her she was seized on by the management with avidity she was the saving of the great national theatre for the season nothing was talked of but madame saquis fireworks and flamecolored pantaloons and nature shakespeare the legitimate drama and poor pillgarlick were completely left in the lurch  however as the manager was in honor bound to provide for me he kept his word it had been a turnup of a die whether i should be alexander the great or alexander the coppersmith the latter carried it i could not be put at the head of the drama so i was put at the tail in other words i was enrolled among the number of what are called useful men who let me tell you are the only comfortable actors on the stage we are safe from hisses and below the hope of applause we fear not the success of rivals nor dread the critics pen so long as we get the words of our parts and they are not often many it is all we care for we have our own merriment our own friends and our own admirers for every actor has his friends and admirers from the highest to the lowest the firstrate actor dines with the noble amateur and entertains a fashionable table with scraps and songs and theatrical slipslop the secondrate actors have their secondrate friends and admirers with whom they likewise spout tragedy and talk slipslop and so down even to us who have our friends and admirers among spruce clerks and aspiring apprentices who treat us to a dinner now and then and enjoy at tenth hand the same scraps and songs and slipslop that have been served up by our more fortunate brethren at the tables of the great  i now for the first time in my theatrical life knew what true pleasure is i have known enough of notoriety to pity the poor devils who are called favorites of the public i would rather be a kitten in the arms of a spoiled child to be one moment petted and pampered and the next moment thumped over the head with the spoon i smile too to see our leading actors fretting themselves with envy and jealousy about a trumpery renown questionable in its quality and uncertain in its duration i laugh too though of course in my sleeve at the bustle and importance and trouble and perplexities of our manager who is harassing himself to death in the hopeless effort to please every body  i have found among my fellow subalterns two or three quondam managers who like myself have wielded the sceptres of country theatres and we have many a sly joke together at the expense of the manager and the public sometimes too we meet like deposed and exiled kings talk over the events of our respective reigns moralize over a tankard of ale and laugh at the humbug of the great and little world which i take it is the very essence of practical philosophy  thus end the anecdotes of buckthorne and his friends a few mornings after our hearing the history of the exmanager he bounced into my room before i was out of bed  give me joy give me joy said he rubbing his hands with the utmost glee my great expectations are realized  i stared at him with a look of wonder and inquiry my booby cousin is dead cried he may he rest in peace he nearly broke his neck in a fall from his horse in a foxchase by good luck he lived long enough to make his will he has made me his heir partly out of an odd feeling of retributive justice and partly because as he says none of his own family or friends know how to enjoy such an estate im off to the country to take possession ive done with authorshipthat for the critics said he snapping his fingers come down to doubting castle when i get settled and egad ill give you a rouse so saying he shook me heartily by the hand and bounded off in high spirits  a long time elapsed before i heard from him again indeed it was but a short time since that i received a letter written in the happiest of moods he was getting the estate into fine order everything went to his wishes and what was more he was married to sacharissa who it seems had always entertained an ardent though secret attachment for him which he fortunately discovered just after coming to his estate  i find said he you are a little given to the sin of authorship which i renounce if the anecdotes i have given you of my story are of any interest you may make use of them but come down to doubting castle and see how we live and ill give you my whole london life over a social glass and a rattling history it shall be about authors and reviewers  if ever i visit doubting castle and get the history he promises the public shall be sure to hear of it     part third  the italian banditti     the inn at terracina   crack crack crack crack crack  here comes the estafette from naples said mine host of the inn at terracina bring out the relay  the estafette came as usual galloping up the road brandishing over his head a shorthandled whip with a long knotted lash every smack of which made a report like a pistol he was a tight squareset young fellow in the customary uniforma smart blue coat ornamented with facings and gold lace but so short behind as to reach scarcely below his waistband and cocked up not unlike the tail of a wren a cocked hat edged with gold lace a pair of stiff riding boots but instead of the usual leathern breeches he had a fragment of a pair of drawers that scarcely furnished an apology for modesty to hide behind  the estafette galloped up to the door and jumped from his horse  a glass of rosolio a fresh horse and a pair of breeches said he and quicklyi am behind my time and must be off  san genaro replied the host why where hast thou left thy garment  among the robbers between this and fondi  what rob an estafette i never heard of such folly what could they hope to get from thee  my leather breeches replied the estafette they were bran new and shone like gold and hit the fancy of the captain  well these fellows grow worse and worse to meddle with an estafette and that merely for the sake of a pair of leather breeches  the robbing of a government messenger seemed to strike the host with more astonishment than any other enormity that had taken place on the road and indeed it was the first time so wanton an outrage had been committed the robbers generally taking care not to meddle with any thing belonging to government  the estafette was by this time equipped for he had not lost an instant in making his preparations while talking the relay was ready the rosolio tossed off he grasped the reins and the stirrup  were there many robbers in the band said a handsome dark young man stepping forward from the door of the inn  as formidable a band as ever i saw said the estafette springing into the saddle  are they cruel to travellers said a beautiful young venetian lady who had been hanging on the gentlemans arm  cruel signora echoed the estafette giving a glance at the lady as he put spurs to his horse corpo del bacco they stiletto all the men and as to the women  crack crack crack crack crackthe last words were drowned in the smacking of the whip and away galloped the estafette along the road to the pontine marshes  holy virgin ejaculated the fair venetian what will become of us  the inn of terracina stands just outside of the walls of the old town of that name on the frontiers of the roman territory a little lazy italian town the inhabitants of which apparently heedless and listless are said to be little better than the brigands which surround them and indeed are half of them supposed to be in some way or other connected with the robbers a vast rocky height rises perpendicularly above it with the ruins of the castle of theodoric the goth crowning its summit before it spreads the wide bosom of the mediterranean that sea without flux or reflux there seems an idle pause in every thing about this place the port is without a sail excepting that once in a while a solitary felucca may be seen disgorging its holy cargo of baccala the meagre provision for the quaresima or lent the naked watch towers rising here and there along the coast speak of pirates and corsairs which hover about these shores while the low huts as stations for soldiers which dot the distant road as it winds through an olive grove intimate that in the ascent there is danger for the traveller and facility for the bandit  indeed it is between this town and fondi that the road to naples is mostly infested by banditti it winds among rocky and solitary places where the robbers are enabled to see the traveller from a distance from the brows of hills or impending precipices and to lie in wait for him at the lonely and difficult passes  at the time that the estafette made this sudden appearance almost in cuerpo the audacity of the robbers had risen to an unparalleled height they had their spies and emissaries in every town village and osteria to give them notice of the quality and movements of travellers they did not scruple to send messages into the country towns and villas demanding certain sums of money or articles of dress and luxury with menaces of vengeance in case of refusal they had plundered carriages carried people of rank and fortune into the mountains and obliged them to write for heavy ransoms and had committed outrages on females who had fallen in their power  the police exerted its rigor in vain the brigands were too numerous and powerful for a weak police they were countenanced and cherished by several of the villages and though now and then the limbs of malefactors hung blackening in the trees near which they had committed some atrocity or their heads stuck upon posts in iron cages made some dreary part of the road still more dreary still they seemed to strike dismay into no bosom but that of the traveller  the dark handsome young man and the venetian lady whom i have mentioned had arrived early that afternoon in a private carriage drawn by mules and attended by a single servant they had been recently married were spending the honeymoon in travelling through these delicious countries and were on their way to visit a rich aunt of the young ladys at naples  the lady was young and tender and timid the stories she had heard along the road had filled her with apprehension not more for herself than for her husband for though she had been married almost a month she still loved him almost to idolatry when she reached terracina the rumors of the road had increased to an alarming magnitude and the sight of two robbers skulls grinning in iron cages on each side of the old gateway of the town brought her to a pause her husband had tried in vain to reassure her they had lingered all the afternoon at the inn until it was too late to think of starting that evening and the parting words of the estafette completed her affright  let us return to rome said she putting her arm within her husbands and drawing towards him as if for protectionlet us return to rome and give up this visit to naples  and give up the visit to your aunt too said the husband  naywhat is my aunt in comparison with your safety said she looking up tenderly in his face  there was something in her tone and manner that showed she really was thinking more of her husbands safety at that moment than of her own and being recently married and a match of pure affection too it is very possible that she was at least her husband thought so indeed any one who has heard the sweet musical tone of a venetian voice and the melting tenderness of a venetian phrase and felt the soft witchery of a venetian eye would not wonder at the husbands believing whatever they professed  he clasped the white hand that had been laid within his put his arm round her slender waist and drawing her fondly to his bosomthis night at least said he well pass at terracina  crack crack crack crack crack  another apparition of the road attracted the attention of mine host and his guests from the road across the pontine marshes a carriage drawn by half a dozen horses came driving at a furious pacethe postillions smacking their whips like mad as is the case when conscious of the greatness or the munificence of their fare it was a landaulet with a servant mounted on the dickey the compact highly finished yet proudly simple construction of the carriage the quantity of neat wellarranged trunks and conveniences the loads of box coats and upper benjamins on the dickeyand the fresh burly grufflooking face at the window proclaimed at once that it was the equipage of an englishman  fresh horses to fondi said the englishman as the landlord came bowing to the carriage door  would not his excellenza alight and take some refreshment  nohe did not mean to eat until he got to fondi  but the horses will be some time in getting ready  ahthats always the casenothing but delay in this cursed country  if his excellenza would only walk into the house  no no noi tell you noi want nothing but horses and as quick as possible john see that the horses are got ready and dont let us be kept here an hour or two tell him if were delayed over the time ill lodge a complaint with the postmaster  john touched his hat and set off to obey his masters orders with the taciturn obedience of an english servant he was a ruddy roundfaced fellow with hair cropped close a short coat drab breeches and long gaiters and appeared to have almost as much contempt as his master for everything around him  in the mean time the englishman got out of the carriage and walked up and down before the inn with his hands in his pockets taking no notice of the crowd of idlers who were gazing at him and his equipage he was tall stout and well made dressed with neatness and precision wore a travellingcap of the color of gingerbread and had rather an unhappy expression about the corners of his mouth partly from not having yet made his dinner and partly from not having been able to get on at a greater rate than seven miles an hour not that he had any other cause for haste than an englishmans usual hurry to get to the end of a journey or to use the regular phrase to get on  after some time the servant returned from the stable with as sour a look as his master  are the horses ready john  no siri never saw such a place theres no getting anything done i think your honor had better step into the house and get something to eat it will be a long while before we get to fundy  dn the houseits a mere trickill not eat anything just to spite them said the englishman still more crusty at the prospect of being so long without his dinner  they say your honors very wrong said john to set off at this late hour the roads full of highwaymen  mere tales to get custom  the estafette which passed us was stopped by a whole gang said john increasing his emphasis with each additional piece of information  i dont believe a word of it  they robbed him of his breeches said john giving at the same time a hitch to his own waistband  all humbug  here the dark handsome young man stepped forward and addressing the englishman very politely in broken english invited him to partake of a repast he was about to make thankee said the englishman thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets and casting a slight side glance of suspicion at the young man as if he thought from his civility he must have a design upon his purse  we shall be most happy if you will do us that favor said the lady in her soft venetian dialect there was a sweetness in her accents that was most persuasive the englishman cast a look upon her countenance her beauty was still more eloquent his features instantly relaxed he made an attempt at a civil bow with great pleasure signora said he  in short the eagerness to get on was suddenly slackened the determination to famish himself as far as fondi by way of punishing the landlord was abandoned john chose the best apartment in the inn for his masters reception and preparations were made to remain there until morning  the carriage was unpacked of such of its contents as were indispensable for the night there was the usual parade of trunks and writingdesks and portfolios and dressingboxes and those other oppressive conveniences which burden a comfortable man the observant loiterers about the inn door wrapped up in great dirtcolored cloaks with only a hawks eye uncovered made many remarks to each other on this quantity of luggage that seemed enough for an army and the domestics of the inn talked with wonder of the splendid dressingcase with its gold and silver furniture that was spread out on the toilette table and the bag of gold that chinked as it was taken out of the trunk the strange milors wealth and the treasures he carried about him were the talk that evening over all terracina  the englishman took some time to make his ablutions and arrange his dress for table and after considerable labor and effort in putting himself at his ease made his appearance with stiff white cravat his clothes free from the least speck of dust and adjusted with precision he made a formal bow on entering which no doubt he meant to be cordial but which any one else would have considered cool and took his seat  the supper as it was termed by the italian or dinner as the englishman called it was now served heaven and earth and the waters under the earth had been moved to furnish it for there were birds of the air and beasts of the earth and fish of the sea the englishmans servant too had turned the kitchen topsyturvy in his zeal to cook his master a beefsteak and made his appearance loaded with ketchup and soy and cayenne pepper and harvey sauce and a bottle of port wine from that warehouse the carriage in which his master seemed desirous of carrying england about the world with him every thing however according to the englishman was execrable the tureen of soup was a black sea with livers and limbs and fragments of all kinds of birds and beasts floating like wrecks about it a meagre winged animal which my host called a delicate chicken was too delicate for his stomach for it had evidently died of a consumption the macaroni was smoked the beefsteak was tough buffalos flesh and the countenance of mine host confirmed the assertion nothing seemed to hit his palate but a dish of stewed eels of which he ate with great relish but had nearly refunded them when told that they were vipers caught among the rocks of terracina and esteemed a great delicacy  in short the englishman ate and growled and ate and growled like a cat eating in company pronouncing himself poisoned by every dish yet eating on in defiance of death and the doctor the venetian lady not accustomed to english travellers almost repented having persuaded him to the meal for though very gracious to her he was so crusty to all the world beside that she stood in awe of him there is nothing however that conquers john bulls crustiness sooner than eating whatever may be the cookery and nothing brings him into good humor with his company sooner than eating together the englishman therefore had not half finished his repast and his bottle before he began to think the venetian a very tolerable fellow for a foreigner and his wife almost handsome enough to be an englishwoman  in the course of the repast the tales of robbers which harassed the mind of the fair venetian were brought into discussion the landlord and the waiter served up such a number of them as they served up the dishes that they almost frightened away the poor ladys appetite among these was the story of the school of terracina still fresh in every mind where the students were carried up the mountains by the banditti in hopes of ransom and one of them massacred to bring the parents to terms for the others there was a story also of a gentleman of rome who delayed remitting the ransom demanded for his son detained by the banditti and received one of his sons ears in a letter with information that the other would be remitted to him soon if the money were not forthcoming and that in this way he would receive the boy by instalments until he came to terms  the fair venetian shuddered as she heard these tales the landlord like a true storyteller doubled the dose when he saw how it operated he was just proceeding to relate the misfortunes of a great english lord and his family when the englishman tired of his volubility testily interrupted him and pronounced these accounts mere travellers tales or the exaggerations of peasants and innkeepers the landlord was indignant at the doubt levelled at his stories and the innuendo levelled at his cloth he cited half a dozen stories still more terrible to corroborate those he had already told  i dont believe a word of them said the englishman  but the robbers had been tried and executed  all a farce  but their heads were stuck up along the road  old skulls accumulated during a century  the landlord muttered to himself as he went out at the door san genaro come sono singolari questi inglesi  a fresh hubbub outside of the inn announced the arrival of more travellers and from the variety of voices or rather clamors the clattering of horses hoofs the rattling of wheels and the general uproar both within and without the arrival seemed to be numerous it was in fact the procaccio and its convoya kind of caravan of merchandise that sets out on stated days under an escort of soldiery to protect it from the robbers travellers avail themselves of the occasion and many carriages accompany the procaccio it was a long time before either landlord or waiter returned being hurried away by the tempest of new custom when mine host appeared there was a smile of triumph on his countenanceperhaps said he as he cleared away the table perhaps the signor has not heard of what has happened  what said the englishman drily  oh the procaccio has arrived and has brought accounts of fresh exploits of the robbers signor  pish  theres more news of the english milor and his family said the host emphatically  an english lordwhat english lord  milor popkin  lord popkin i never heard of such a title  o sicuroa great nobleman that passed through here lately with his milady and daughtersa magnificoone of the grand councillors of londonun almanno  almannoalmannotut he means alderman  sicuro aldermanno popkin and the principezza popkin and the signorina popkin said mine host triumphantly he would now have entered into a full detail but was thwarted by the englishman who seemed determined not to credit or indulge him in his stories an italian tongue however is not easily checked that of mine host continued to run on with increasing volubility as he conveyed the fragments of the repast out of the room and the last that could be distinguished of his voice as it died away along the corridor was the constant recurrence of the favorite word popkinpopkinpopkinpoppoppop  the arrival of the procaccio had indeed filled the house with stories as it had with guests the englishman and his companions walked out after supper into the great hall or common room of the inn which runs through the centre building a gloomy dirtylooking apartment with tables placed in various parts of it at which some of the travellers were seated in groups while others strolled about in famished impatience for their evenings meal as the procaccio was a kind of caravan of travellers there were people of every class and country who had come in all kinds of vehicles and though they kept in some measure in separate parties yet the being united under one common escort had jumbled them into companionship on the road their formidable number and the formidable guard that accompanied them had prevented any molestation from the banditti but every carriage had its tale of wonder and one vied with another in the recital not one but had seen groups of robbers peering over the rocks or their guns peeping out from among the bushes or had been reconnoitred by some suspiciouslooking fellow with scowling eye who disappeared on seeing the guard  the fair venetian listened to all these stories with that eager curiosity with which we seek to pamper any feeling of alarm even the englishman began to feel interested in the subject and desirous of gaining more correct information than these mere flying reports  he mingled in one of the groups which appeared to be the most respectable and which was assembled round a tall thin person with long roman nose a high forehead and lively prominent eye beaming from under a green velvet travellingcap with gold tassel he was holding forth with all the fluency of a man who talks well and likes to exert his talent he was of rome a surgeon by profession a poet by choice and one who was something of an improvvisatore he soon gave the englishman abundance of information respecting the banditti  the fact is said he that many of the people in the villages among the mountains are robbers or rather the robbers find perfect asylum among them they range over a vast extent of wild impracticable country along the chain of apennines bordering on different states they know all the difficult passes the short cuts and strongholds they are secure of the goodwill of the poor and peaceful inhabitants of those regions whom they never disturb and whom they often enrich indeed they are looked upon as a sort of illegitimate heroes among the mountain villages and some of the frontier towns where they dispose of their plunder from these mountains they keep a lookout upon the plains and valleys and meditate their descents  the road to fondi which you are about to travel is one of the places most noted for their exploits it is overlooked from some distance by little hamlets perched upon heights from hence the brigands like hawks in their nests keep on the watch for such travellers as are likely to afford either booty or ransom the windings of the road enable them to see carriages long before they pass so that they have time to get to some advantageous lurkingplace from whence to pounce upon their prey  but why does not the police interfere and root them out said the englishman  the police is too weak and the banditti are too strong replied the improvvisatore to root them out would be a more difficult task than you imagine they are connected and identified with the people of the villages and the peasantry generally the numerous bands have an understanding with each other and with people of various conditions in all parts of the country they know all that is going on a gens darmes cannot stir without their being aware of it they have their spies and emissaries in every direction they lurk about towns villages innsmingle in every crowd pervade every place of resort i should not be surprised said he if some one should be supervising us at this moment  the fair venetian looked round fearfully and turned pale  one peculiarity of the italian banditti continued the improvvisatore is that they wear a kind of uniform or rather costume which designates their profession this is probably done to take away from its skulking lawless character and to give it something of a military air in the eyes of the common people or perhaps to catch by outward dash and show the fancies of the young men of the villages these dresses or costumes are often rich and fanciful some wear jackets and breeches of bright colors richly embroidered broad belts of cloth or sashes of silk net broad highcrowned hats decorated with feathers of variouslycolored ribbands and silk nets for the hair  many of the robbers are peasants who follow ordinary occupations in the villages for a part of the year and take to the mountains for the rest some only go out for a season as it were on a hunting expedition and then resume the dress and habits of common life many of the young men of the villages take to this kind of life occasionally from a mere love of adventure the wild wandering spirit of youth and the contagion of bad example but it is remarked that they can never after brook a long continuance in settled life they get fond of the unbounded freedom and rude license they enjoy and there is something in this wild mountain life checquered by adventure and peril that is wonderfully fascinating independent of the gratification of cupidity by the plunder of the wealthy traveller  here the improvvisatore was interrupted by a lively neapolitan lawyer your mention of the younger robbers said he puts me in mind of an adventure of a learned doctor a friend of mine which happened in this very neighborhood  a wish was of course expressed to hear the adventure of the doctor by all except the improvvisatore who being fond of talking and of hearing himself talk and accustomed moreover to harangue without interruption looked rather annoyed at being checked when in full career  the neapolitan however took no notice of his chagrin but related the following anecdote     the adventure of the little antiquary   my friend the doctor was a thorough antiquary a little rusty musty old fellow always groping among ruins he relished a building as you englishmen relish a cheese the more mouldy and crumbling it was the more it was to his taste a shell of an old nameless temple or the cracked walls of a brokendown amphitheatre would throw him into raptures and he took more delight in these crusts and cheese parings of antiquity than in the bestconditioned modern edifice  he had taken a maggot into his brain at one time to hunt after the ancient cities of the pelasgi which are said to exist to this day among the mountains of the abruzzi but the condition of which is strangely unknown to the antiquaries it is said that he had made a great many valuable notes and memorandums on the subject which he always carried about with him either for the purpose of frequent reference or because he feared the precious documents might fall into the hands of brother antiquaries he had therefore a large pocket behind in which he carried them banging against his rear as he walked  be this as it may happening to pass a few days at terracina in the course of his researches he one day mounted the rocky cliffs which overhang the town to visit the castle of theodoric he was groping about these ruins towards the hour of sunset buried in his reflectionshis wits no doubt woolgathering among the goths and romans when he heard footsteps behind him  he turned and beheld five or six young fellows of rough saucy demeanor clad in a singular manner half peasant half huntsman with fusils in their hands their whole appearance and carriage left him in no doubt into what company he had fallen  the doctor was a feeble little man poor in look and poorer in purse he had but little money in his pocket but he had certain valuables such as an old silver watch thick as a turnip with figures on it large enough for a clock and a set of seals at the end of a steel chain that dangled half down to his knees all which were of precious esteem being family reliques he had also a seal ring a veritable antique intaglio that covered half his knuckles but what he most valued was the precious treatise on the pelasgian cities which he would gladly have given all the money in his pocket to have had safe at the bottom of his trunk in terracina  however he plucked up a stout heart at least as stout a heart as he could seeing that he was but a puny little man at the hest of times so he wished the hunters a buon giorno they returned his salutation giving the old gentleman a sociable slap on the back that made his heart leap into his throat  they fell into conversation and walked for some time together among the heights the doctor wishing them all the while at the bottom of the crater of vesuvius at length they came to a small osteria on the mountain where they proposed to enter and have a cup of wine together the doctor consented though he would as soon have been invited to drink hemlock  one of the gang remained sentinel at the door the others swaggered into the house stood their fusils in a corner of the room and each drawing a pistol or stiletto out of his belt laid it with some emphasis on the table they now called lustily for wine drew benches round the table and hailing the doctor as though he had been a boon companion of long standing insisted upon his sitting down and making merry he complied with forced grimace but with fear and trembling sitting on the edge of his bench supping down heartburn with every drop of liquor eyeing ruefully the black muzzled pistols and cold naked stilettos they pushed the bottle bravely and plied him vigorously sang laughed told excellent stories of robberies and combats and the little doctor was fain to laugh at these cutthroat pleasantries though his heart was dying away at the very bottom of his bosom  by their own account they were young men from the villages who had recently taken up this line of life in the mere wild caprice of youth they talked of their exploits as a sportsman talks of his amusements to shoot down a traveller seemed of little more consequence to them than to shoot a hare they spoke with rapture of the glorious roving life they led free as birds here today gone tomorrow ranging the forests climbing the rocks scouring the valleys the world their own wherever they could lay hold of it full purses merry companions pretty womenthe little antiquary got fuddled with their talk and their wine for they did not spare bumpers he half forgot his fears his seal ring and his family watch even the treatise on the pelasgian cities which was warming under him for a time faded from his memory in the glowing picture which they drew he declares that he no longer wonders at the prevalence of this robber mania among the mountains for he felt at the time that had he been a young man and a strong man and had there been no danger of the galleys in the background he should have been half tempted himself to turn bandit  at length the fearful hour of separating arrived the doctor was suddenly called to himself and his fears by seeing the robbers resume their weapons he now quaked for his valuables and above all for his antiquarian treatise he endeavored however to look cool and unconcerned and drew from out of his deep pocket a long lank leathern purse far gone in consumption at the bottom of which a few coin chinked with the trembling of his hand  the chief of the party observed this movement and laying his hand upon the antiquarys shoulderharkee signor dottore said he we have drank together as friends and comrades let us part as such we understand you we know who and what you are for we know who every body is that sleeps at terracina or that puts foot upon the road you are a rich man but you carry all your wealth in your head we cant get at it and we should not know what to do with it if we could i see you are uneasy about your ring but dont worry your mind it is not worth taking you think it an antique but its a counterfeita mere sham  here the doctor would have put in a word for his antiquarian pride was touched  nay nay continued the other weve no time to dispute about it value it as you please come you are a brave little old signorone more cup of wine and well pay the reckoning no complimentsi insist on it sonow make the best of your way back to terracina its growing latebuono viaggioand harkee take care how you wander among these mountains  they shouldered their fusils sprang gaily up the rocks and the little doctor hobbled back to terracina rejoicing that the robbers had let his seal ring his watch and his treatise escape unmolested though rather nettled that they should have pronounced his veritable intaglio a counterfeit  the improvvisatore had shown many symptoms of impatience during this recital he saw his theme in danger of being taken out of his hands by a rival storyteller which to an able talker is always a serious grievance it was also in danger of being taken away by a neapolitan and that was still more vexatious as the members of the different italian states have an incessant jealousy of each other in all things great and small he took advantage of the first pause of the neapolitan to catch hold again of the thread of the conversation  as i was saying resumed he the prevalence of these banditti is so extensive their power so combined and interwoven with other ranks of society  for that matter said the neapolitan i have heard that your government has had some understanding with these gentry or at least winked at them  my government said the roman impatiently  ayethey say that cardinal gonsalvi  hush said the roman holding up his finger and rolling his large eyes about the room  nayi only repeat what i heard commonly rumored in rome replied the other sturdily it was whispered that the cardinal had been up to the mountain and had an interview with some of the chiefs and i have been told that when honest people have been kicking their heels in the cardinals antichamber waiting by the hour for admittance one of these stilettolooking fellows has elbowed his way through the crowd and entered without ceremony into the cardinals presence  i know replied the roman that there have been such reports and it is not impossible that government may have made use of these men at particular periods such as at the time of your abortive revolution when your carbonari were so busy with their machinations all over the country the information that men like these could collect who were familiar not merely with all the recesses and secret places of the mountains but also with all the dark and dangerous recesses of society and knew all that was plotting in the world of mischief the utility of such instruments in the hands of government was too obvious to be overlooked and cardinal gonsalvi as a politic statesman may perhaps have made use of them for it is well known the robbers with all their atrocities are respectful towards the church and devout in their religion  religionreligion echoed the englishman  yesreligion repeated the improvvisatore scarce one of them but will cross himself and say his prayers when he hears in his mountain fastness the matin or the ave maria bells sounding from the valleys they will often confess themselves to the village priests to obtain absolution and occasionally visit the village churches to pray at some favorite shrine i recollect an instance in point i was one evening in the village of frescati which lies below the mountains of abruzzi the people as usual in fine evenings in our italian towns and villages were standing about in groups in the public square conversing and amusing themselves i observed a tall muscular fellow wrapped in a great mantle passing across the square but skulking along in the dark as if avoiding notice the people too seemed to draw back as he passed it was whispered to me that he was a notorious bandit  but why was he not immediately seized said the englishman  because it was nobodys business because nobody wished to incur the vengeance of his comrades because there were not sufficient gens darmes near to insure security against the numbers of desperadoes he might have at hand because the gens darmes might not have received particular instructions with respect to him and might not feel disposed to engage in the hazardous conflict without compulsion in short i might give you a thousand reasons rising out of the state of our government and manners not one of which after all might appear satisfactory  the englishman shrugged his shoulders with an air of contempt  i have been told added the roman rather quickly that even in your metropolis of london notorious thieves well known to the police as such walk the streets at noonday in search of their prey and are not molested unless caught in the very act of robbery  the englishman gave another shrug but with a different expression  well sir i fixed my eye on this daring wolf thus prowling through the fold and saw him enter a church i was curious to witness his devotions you know our spacious magnificent churches the one in which he entered was vast and shrouded in the dusk of evening at the extremity of the long aisles a couple of tapers feebly glimmered on the grand altar in one of the side chapels was a votive candle placed before the image of a saint before this image the robber had prostrated himself his mantle partly falling off from his shoulders as he knelt revealed a form of herculean strength a stiletto and pistol glittered in his belt and the light falling on his countenance showed features not unhandsome but strongly and fiercely charactered as he prayed he became vehemently agitated his lips quivered sighs and murmurs almost groans burst from him he beat his breast with violence then clasped his hands and wrung them convulsively as he extended them towards the image never had i seen such a terrific picture of remorse i felt fearful of being discovered by him and withdrew shortly after i saw him issue from the church wrapped in his mantle he recrossed the square and no doubt returned to his mountain with disburthened conscience ready to incur a fresh arrear of crime  the conversation was here taken up by two other travellers recently arrived mr hobbs and mr dobbs a linendraper and a greengrocer just returning from a tour in greece and the holy land and who were full of the story of alderman popkins they were astonished that the robbers should dare to molest a man of his importance on change he being an eminent drysalter of throgmorton street and a magistrate to boot  in fact the story of the popkins family was but too true it was attested by too many present to be for a moment doubted and from the contradictory and concordant testimony of half a score all eager to relate it the company were enabled to make out all the particulars     the adventure of the popkins family   it was but a few days before that the carriage of alderman popkins had driven up to the inn of terracina those who have seen an english family carriage on the continent must know the sensation it produces it is an epitome of england a little morsel of the old island rolling about the worldevery thing so compact so snug so finished and fitting the wheels that roll on patent axles without rattling the body that hangs so well on its springs yielding to every motion yet proof against every shock the ruddy faces gaping out of the windows sometimes of a portly old citizen sometimes of a voluminous dowager and sometimes of a fine fresh hoyden just from boarding school and then the dickeys loaded with welldressed servants beeffed and bluff looking down from their heights with contempt on all the world around profoundly ignorant of the country and the people and devoutly certain that every thing not english must be wrong  such was the carriage of alderman popkins as it made its appearance at terracina the courier who had preceded it to order horses and who was a neapolitan had given a magnificent account of the riches and greatness of his master blundering with all an italians splendor of imagination about the aldermans titles and dignities the host had added his usual share of exaggeration so that by the time the alderman drove up to the door he was milormagnificoprincipethe lord knows what  the alderman was advised to take an escort to fondi and itri but he refused it was as much as a mans life was worth he said to stop him on the kings highway he would complain of it to the ambassador at naples he would make a national affair of it the principezza popkins a fresh motherly dame seemed perfectly secure in the protection of her husband so omnipotent a man in the city the signorini popkins two fine bouncing girls looked to their brother tom who had taken lessons in boxing and as to the dandy himself he was sure no scaramouch of an italian robber would dare to meddle with an englishman the landlord shrugged his shoulders and turned out the palms of his hands with a true italian grimace and the carriage of milor popkins rolled on  they passed through several very suspicious places without any molestation the misses popkins who were very romantic and had learnt to draw in water colors were enchanted with the savage scenery around it was so like what they had read in mrs radcliffes romances they should like of all things to make sketches at length the carriage arrived at a place where the road wound up a long hill mrs popkins had sunk into a sleep the young ladies were reading the last works of sir walter scott and lord byron and the dandy was hectoring the postilions from the coach box the alderman got out as he said to stretch his legs up the hill it was a long winding ascent and obliged him every now and then to stop and blow and wipe his forehead with many a pish and phew being rather pursy and short of wind as the carriage however was far behind him and toiling slowly under the weight of so many wellstuffed trunks and wellstuffed travellers he had plenty of time to walk at leisure  on a jutting point of rock that overhung the road nearly at the summit of the hill just where the route began again to descend he saw a solitary man seated who appeared to be tending goats alderman popkins was one of your shrewd travellers that always like to be picking up small information along the road so he thought hed just scramble up to the honest man and have a little talk with him by way of learning the news and getting a lesson in italian as he drew near to the peasant he did not half like his looks he was partly reclining on the rocks wrapped in the usual long mantle which with his slouched hat only left a part of a swarthy visage with a keen black eye a beetle brow and a fierce moustache to be seen he had whistled several times to his dog which was roving about the side of the hill as the alderman approached he rose and greeted him when standing erect he seemed almost gigantic at least in the eyes of alderman popkins who however being a short man might be deceived  the latter would gladly now have been back in the carriage or even on change in london for he was by no means well pleased with his company however he determined to put the best face on matters and was beginning a conversation about the state of the weather the baddishness of the crops and the price of goats in that part of the country when he heard a violent screaming he ran to the edge of the rock and looking over saw away down the road his carriage surrounded by robbers one held down the fat footman another had the dandy by his starched cravat with a pistol to his head one was rummaging a portmanteau another rummaging the principezzas pockets while the two misses popkins were screaming from each window of the carriage and their waiting maid squalling from the dickey  alderman popkins felt all the fury of the parent and the magistrate roused within him he grasped his cane and was on the point of scrambling down the rocks either to assault the robbers or to read the riot act when he was suddenly grasped by the arm it was by his friend the goatherd whose cloak falling partly off discovered a belt stuck full of pistols and stilettos in short he found himself in the clutches of the captain of the band who had stationed himself on the rock to look out for travellers and to give notice to his men  a sad ransacking took place trunks were turned inside out and all the finery and the frippery of the popkins family scattered about the road such a chaos of venice beads and roman mosaics and paris bonnets of the young ladies mingled with the aldermans nightcaps and lambs wool stockings and the dandys hairbrushes stays and starched cravats  the gentlemen were eased of their purses and their watches the ladies of their jewels and the whole party were on the point of being carried up into the mountain when fortunately the appearance of soldiery at a distance obliged the robbers to make off with the spoils they had secured and leave the popkins family to gather together the remnants of their effects and make the best of their way to fondi  when safe arrived the alderman made a terrible blustering at the inn threatened to complain to the ambassador at naples and was ready to shake his cane at the whole country the dandy had many stories to tell of his scuffles with the brigands who overpowered him merely by numbers as to the misses popkins they were quite delighted with the adventure and were occupied the whole evening in writing it in their journals they declared the captain of the band to be a most romanticlooking man they dared to say some unfortunate lover or exiled nobleman and several of the band to be very handsome young menquite picturesque  in verity said mine host of terracina they say the captain of the band is un galant uomo  a gallant man said the englishman id have your gallant man hangd like a dog  to dare to meddle with englishmen said mr hobbs  and such a family as the popkinses said mr dobbs  they ought to come upon the country for damages said mr hobbs  our ambassador should make a complaint to the government of naples said mr dobbs  they should be requested to drive these rascals out of the country said hobbs  if they did not we should declare war against them said dobbs  the englishman was a little wearied by this story and by the ultra zeal of his countrymen and was glad when a summons to their supper relieved him from a crowd of travellers he walked out with his venetian friends and a young frenchman of an interesting demeanor who had become sociable with them in the course of the conversation they directed their steps toward the sea which was lit up by the rising moon the venetian out of politeness left his beautiful wife to be escorted by the englishman the latter however either from shyness or reserve did not avail himself of the civility but walked on without offering his arm the fair venetian with all her devotion to her husband was a little nettled at a want of gallantry to which her charms had rendered her unaccustomed and took the proffered arm of the frenchman with a pretty air of pique which however was entirely lost upon the phlegmatic delinquent  not far distant from the inn they came to where there was a body of soldiers on the beach encircling and guarding a number of galley slaves who were permitted to refresh themselves in the evening breeze and to sport and roll upon the sand  it was difficult the frenchman observed to conceive a more frightful mass of crime than was here collected the parricide the fratricide the infanticide who had first fled from justice and turned mountain bandit and then by betraying his brother desperadoes had bought a commutation of punishment and the privilege of wallowing on the shore for an hour a day with this wretched crew of miscreants  the remark of the frenchman had a strong effect upon the company particularly upon the venetian lady who shuddered as she cast a timid look at this horde of wretches at their evening relaxation they seemed she said like so many serpents wreathing and twisting together  the frenchman now adverted to the stories they had been listening to at the inn adding that if they had any further curiosity on the subject he could recount an adventure which happened to himself among the robbers and which might give them some idea of the habits and manners of those beings there was an air of modesty and frankness about the frenchman which had gained the goodwill of the whole party not even excepting the englishman they all gladly accepted his proposition and as they strolled slowly up and down the seashore he related the following adventure     the painters adventure   i am an historical painter by profession and resided for some time in the family of a foreign prince at his villa about fifteen miles from rome among some of the most interesting scenery of italy it is situated on the heights of ancient tusculum in its neighborhood are the ruins of the villas of cicero sulla lucullus rufinus and other illustrious romans who sought refuge here occasionally from their toils in the bosom of a soft and luxurious repose from the midst of delightful bowers refreshed by the pure mountain breeze the eye looks over a romantic landscape full of poetical and historical associations the albanian mountains tivoli once the favorite residence of horace and maecenas the vast deserted campagna with the tiber running through it and st peters dome swelling in the midst the monumentas it were over the grave of ancient rome  i assisted the prince in the researches he was making among the classic ruins of his vicinity his exertions were highly successful many wrecks of admirable statues and fragments of exquisite sculpture were dug up monuments of the taste and magnificence that reigned in the ancient tusculan abodes he had studded his villa and its grounds with statues relievos vases and sarcophagi thus retrieved from the bosom of the earth  the mode of life pursued at the villa was delightfully serene diversified by interesting occupations and elegant leisure every one passed the day according to his pleasure or occupation and we all assembled in a cheerful dinner party at sunset it was on the fourth of november a beautiful serene day that we had assembled in the saloon at the sound of the first dinnerbell the family were surprised at the absence of the princes confessor they waited for him in vain and at length placed themselves at table they first attributed his absence to his having prolonged his customary walk and the first part of the dinner passed without any uneasiness when the dessert was served however without his making his appearance they began to feel anxious they feared he might have been taken ill in some alley of the woods or that he might have fallen into the hands of robbers at the interval of a small valley rose the mountains of the abruzzi the stronghold of banditti indeed the neighborhood had for some time been infested by them and barbone a notorious bandit chief had often been met prowling about the solitudes of tusculum the daring enterprises of these ruffians were well known the objects of their cupidity or vengeance were insecure even in palaces as yet they had respected the possessions of the prince but the idea of such dangerous spirits hovering about the neighbourhood was sufficient to occasion alarm  the fears of the company increased as evening closed in the prince ordered out forest guards and domestics with flambeaux to search for the confessor they had not departed long when a slight noise was heard in the corridor of the ground floor the family were dining on the first floor and the remaining domestics were occupied in attendance there was no one on the ground floor at this moment but the house keeper the laundress and three field laborers who were resting themselves and conversing with the women  i heard the noise from below and presuming it to be occasioned by the return of the absentee i left the table and hastened down stairs eager to gain intelligence that might relieve the anxiety of the prince and princess i had scarcely reached the last step when i beheld before me a man dressed as a bandit a carbine in his hand and a stiletto and pistols in his belt his countenance had a mingled expression of ferocity and trepidation he sprang upon me and exclaimed exultingly ecco il principe  i saw at once into what hands i had fallen but endeavored to summon up coolness and presence of mind a glance towards the lower end of the corridor showed me several ruffians clothed and armed in the same manner with the one who had seized me they were guarding the two females and the field laborers the robber who held me firmly by the collar demanded repeatedly whether or not i were the prince his object evidently was to carry off the prince and extort an immense ransom he was enraged at receiving none but vague replies for i felt the importance of misleading him  a sudden thought struck me how i might extricate myself from his clutches i was unarmed it is true but i was vigorous his companions were at a distance by a sudden exertion i might wrest myself from him and spring up the staircase whither he would not dare to follow me singly the idea was put in execution as soon as conceived the ruffians throat was bare with my right hand i seized him by it just between the mastoides with my left hand i grasped the arm which held the carbine the suddenness of my attack took him completely unawares and the strangling nature of my grasp paralyzed him he choked and faltered i felt his hand relaxing its hold and was on the point of jerking myself away and darting up the staircase before he could recover himself when i was suddenly seized by some one from behind  i had to let go my grasp the bandit once more released fell upon me with fury and gave me several blows with the butt end of his carbine one of which wounded me severely in the forehead and covered me with blood he took advantage of my being stunned to rifle me of my watch and whatever valuables i had about my person  when i recovered from the effects of the blow i heard the voice of the chief of the banditti who exclaimed quello e il principe siamo contente audiamo it is the prince enough let us be off the band immediately closed round me and dragged me out of the palace bearing off the three laborers likewise  i had no hat on and the blood was flowing from my wound i managed to staunch it however with my pockethandkerchief which i bound round my forehead the captain of the band conducted me in triumph supposing me to be the prince we had gone some distance before he learnt his mistake from one of the laborers his rage was terrible it was too late to return to the villa and endeavor to retrieve his error for by this time the alarm must have been given and every one in arms he darted at me a furious look swore i had deceived him and caused him to miss his fortune and told me to prepare for death the rest of the robbers were equally furious i saw their hands upon their poinards and i knew that death was seldom an empty menace with these ruffians  the laborers saw the peril into which their information had betrayed me and eagerly assured the captain that i was a man for whom the prince would pay a great ransom this produced a pause for my part i cannot say that i had been much dismayed by their menaces i mean not to make any boast of courage but i have been so schooled to hardship during the late revolutions and have beheld death around me in so many perilous and disastrous scenes that i have become in some measure callous to its terrors the frequent hazard of life makes a man at length as reckless of it as a gambler of his money to their threat of death i replied that the sooner it was executed the better this reply seemed to astonish the captain and the prospect of ransom held out by the laborers had no doubt a still greater effect on him he considered for a moment assumed a calmer manner and made a sign to his companions who had remained waiting for my death warrant forward said he we will see about this matter by and bye  we descended rapidly towards the road of la molara which leads to rocca priori in the midst of this road is a solitary inn the captain ordered the troop to halt at the distance of a pistol shot from it and enjoined profound silence he then approached the threshold alone with noiseless steps he examined the outside of the door very narrowly and then returning precipitately made a sign for the troop to continue its march in silence it has since been ascertained that this was one of those infamous inns which are the secret resorts of banditti the innkeeper had an understanding with the captain as he most probably had with the chiefs of the different bands when any of the patroles and gens darmes were quartered at his house the brigands were warned of it by a preconcerted signal on the door when there was no such signal they might enter with safety and be sure of welcome many an isolated inn among the lonely parts of the roman territories and especially on the skirts of the mountains have the same dangerous and suspicious character they are places where the banditti gather information where they concert their plans and where the unwary traveller remote from hearing or assistance is sometimes betrayed to the stiletto of the midnight murderer  after pursuing our road a little farther we struck off towards the woody mountains which envelope rocca priori our march was long and painful with many circuits and windings at length we clambered a steep ascent covered with a thick forest and when we had reached the centre i was told to seat myself on the earth no sooner had i done so than at a sign from their chief the robbers surrounded me and spreading their great cloaks from one to the other formed a kind of pavilion of mantles to which their bodies might be said to seem as columns the captain then struck a light and a flambeau was lit immediately the mantles were extended to prevent the light of the flambeau from being seen through the forest anxious as was my situation i could not look round upon this screen of dusky drapery relieved by the bright colors of the robbers underdresses the gleaming of their weapons and the variety of strongmarked countenances lit up by the flambeau without admiring the picturesque effect of the scene it was quite theatrical  the captain now held an inkhorn and giving me pen and paper ordered me to write what he should dictate i obeyed it was a demand couched in the style of robber eloquence that the prince should send three thousand dollars for my ransom or that my death should be the consequence of a refusal  i knew enough of the desperate character of these beings to feel assured this was not an idle menace their only mode of insuring attention to their demands is to make the infliction of the penalty inevitable i saw at once however that the demand was preposterous and made in improper language  i told the captain so and assured him that so extravagant a sum would never be granted that i was neither friend or relative of the prince but a mere artist employed to execute certain paintings that i had nothing to offer as a ransom but the price of my labors if this were not sufficient my life was at their disposal it was a thing on which i sat but little value  i was the more hardy in my reply because i saw that coolness and hardihood had an effect upon the robbers it is true as i finished speaking the captain laid his hand upon his stiletto but he restrained himself and snatching the letter folded it and ordered me in a peremptory tone to address it to the prince he then despatched one of the laborers with it to tusculum who promised to return with all possible speed  the robbers now prepared themselves for sleep and i was told that i might do the same they spread their great cloaks on the ground and lay down around me one was stationed at a little distance to keep watch and was relieved every two hours the strangeness and wildness of this mountain bivouac among lawless beings whose hands seemed ever ready to grasp the stiletto and with whom life was so trivial and insecure was enough to banish repose the coldness of the earth and of the dew however had a still greater effect than mental causes in disturbing my rest the airs wafted to these mountains from the distant mediterranean diffused a great chilliness as the night advanced an expedient suggested itself i called one of my fellow prisoners the laborers and made him lie down beside me whenever one of my limbs became chilled i approached it to the robust limb of my neighbor and borrowed some of his warmth in this way i was able to obtain a little sleep  day at length dawned and i was roused from my slumber by the voice of the chieftain he desired me to rise and follow him i obeyed on considering his physiognomy attentively it appeared a little softened he even assisted me in scrambling up the steep forest among rocks and brambles habit had made him a vigorous mountaineer but i found it excessively toilsome to climb those rugged heights we arrived at length at the summit of the mountain  here it was that i felt all the enthusiasm of my art suddenly awakened and i forgot in an instant all perils and fatigues at this magnificent view of the sunrise in the midst of the mountains of abruzzi it was on these heights that hannibal first pitched his camp and pointed out rome to his followers the eye embraces a vast extent of country the minor height of tusculum with its villas and its sacred ruins lie below the sabine hills and the albanian mountains stretch on either hand and beyond tusculum and frescati spreads out the immense campagna with its line of tombs and here and there a broken aqueduct stretching across it and the towers and domes of the eternal city in the midst  fancy this scene lit up by the glories of a rising sun and bursting upon my sight as i looked forth from among the majestic forests of the abruzzi fancy too the savage foreground made still more savage by groups of the banditti armed and dressed in their wild picturesque manner and you will not wonder that the enthusiasm of a painter for a moment overpowered all his other feelings  the banditti were astonished at my admiration of a scene which familiarity had made so common in their eyes i took advantage of their halting at this spot drew forth a quire of drawingpaper and began to sketch the features of the landscape the height on which i was seated was wild and solitary separated from the ridge of tusculum by a valley nearly three miles wide though the distance appeared less from the purity of the atmosphere this height was one of the favorite retreats of the banditti commanding a lookout over the country while at the same time it was covered with forests and distant from the populous haunts of men  while i was sketching my attention was called off for a moment by the cries of birds and the bleatings of sheep i looked around but could see nothing of the animals that uttered them they were repeated and appeared to come from the summits of the trees on looking more narrowly i perceived six of the robbers perched on the tops of oaks which grew on the breezy crest of the mountain and commanded an uninterrupted prospect from hence they were keeping a lookout like so many vultures casting their eyes into the depths of the valley below us communicating with each other by signs or holding discourse in sounds which might be mistaken by the wayfarer for the cries of hawks and crows or the bleating of the mountain flocks after they had reconnoitred the neighborhood and finished their singular discourse they descended from their airy perch and returned to their prisoners the captain posted three of them at three naked sides of the mountain while he remained to guard us with what appeared his most trusty companion  i had my book of sketches in my hand he requested to see it and after having run his eye over it expressed himself convinced of the truth of my assertion that i was a painter i thought i saw a gleam of good feeling dawning in him and determined to avail myself of it i knew that the worst of men have their good points and their accessible sides if one would but study them carefully indeed there is a singular mixture in the character of the italian robber with reckless ferocity he often mingles traits of kindness and good humor he is often not radically bad but driven to his course of life by some unpremeditated crime the effect of those sudden bursts of passion to which the italian temperament is prone this has compelled him to take to the mountains or as it is technically termed among them andare in campagna he has become a robber by profession but like a soldier when not in action he can lay aside his weapon and his fierceness and become like other men  i took occasion from the observations of the captain on my sketchings to fall into conversation with him i found him sociable and communicative by degrees i became completely at my ease with him i had fancied i perceived about him a degree of selflove which i determined to make use of i assumed an air of careless frankness and told him that as artist i pretended to the power of judging of the physiognomy that i thought i perceived something in his features and demeanor which announced him worthy of higher fortunes that he was not formed to exercise the profession to which he had abandoned himself that he had talents and qualities fitted for a nobler sphere of action that he had but to change his course of life and in a legitimate career the same courage and endowments which now made him an object of terror would ensure him the applause and admiration of society  i had not mistaken my man my discourse both touched and excited him he seized my hand pressed it and replied with strong emotion you have guessed the truth you have judged me rightly he remained for a moment silent then with a kind of effort he resumed i will tell you some particulars of my life and you will perceive that it was the oppression of others rather than my own crimes that drove me to the mountains i sought to serve my fellowmen and they have persecuted me from among them we seated ourselves on the grass and the robber gave me the following anecdotes of his history     the story of the bandit chieftain   i am a native of the village of prossedi my father was easy enough in circumstances and we lived peaceably and independently cultivating our fields all went on well with us until a new chief of the sbirri was sent to our village to take command of the police he was an arbitrary fellow prying into every thing and practising all sorts of vexations and oppressions in the discharge of his office  i was at that time eighteen years of age and had a natural love of justice and good neighborhood i had also a little education and knew something of history so as to be able to judge a little of men and their actions all this inspired me with hatred for this paltry despot my own family also became the object of his suspicion or dislike and felt more than once the arbitrary abuse of his power these things worked together on my mind and i gasped after vengeance my character was always ardent and energetic and acted upon by my love of justice determined me by one blow to rid the country of the tyrant  full of my project i rose one morning before peep of day and concealing a stiletto under my waistcoathere you see itand he drew forth a long keen poniardi lay in wait for him in the outskirts of the village i knew all his haunts and his habit of making his rounds and prowling about like a wolf in the gray of the morning at length i met him and attacked him with fury he was armed but i took him unawares and was full of youth and vigor i gave him repeated blows to make sure work and laid him lifeless at my feet  when i was satisfied that i had done for him i returned with all haste to the village but had the illluck to meet two of the sbirri as i entered it they accosted me and asked if i had seen their chief i assumed an air of tranquillity and told them i had not they continued on their way and within a few hours brought back the dead body to prossedi their suspicions of me being already awakened i was arrested and thrown into prison here i lay several weeks when the prince who was seigneur of prossedi directed judicial proceedings against me i was brought to trial and a witness was produced who pretended to have seen me not far from the bleeding body and flying with precipitation so i was condemned to the galleys for thirty years  curse on such laws vociferated the bandit foaming with rage curse on such a government and ten thousand curses on the prince who caused me to be adjudged so rigorously while so many other roman princes harbor and protect assassins a thousand times more culpable what had i done but what was inspired by a love of justice and my country why was my act more culpable than that of brutus when he sacrificed caesar to the cause of liberty and justice  there was something at once both lofty and ludicrous in the rhapsody of this robber chief thus associating himself with one of the great names of antiquity it showed however that he had at least the merit of knowing the remarkable facts in the history of his country he became more calm and resumed his narrative  i was conducted to civita vecchia in fetters my heart was burning with rage i had been married scarce six months to a woman whom i passionately loved and who was pregnant my family was in despair for a long time i made unsuccessful efforts to break my chain at length i found a morsel of iron which i hid carefully endeavored with a pointed flint to fashion it into a kind of file i occupied myself in this work during the nighttime and when it was finished i made out after a long time to sever one of the rings of my chain my flight was successful  i wandered for several weeks in the mountains which surround prossedi and found means to inform my wife of the place where i was concealed she came often to see me i had determined to put myself at the head of an armed band she endeavored for a long time to dissuade me but finding my resolution fixed she at length united in my project of vengeance and brought me herself my poniard  by her means i communicated with several brave fellows of the neighboring villages who i knew to be ready to take to the mountains and only panting for an opportunity to exercise their daring spirits we soon formed a combination procured arms and we have had ample opportunities of revenging ourselves for the wrongs and injuries which most of us have suffered every thing has succeeded with us until now and had it not been for our blunder in mistaking you for the prince our fortunes would have been made  here the robber concluded his story he had talked himself into companionship and assured me he no longer bore me any grudge for the error of which i had been the innocent cause he even professed a kindness for me and wished me to remain some time with them he promised to give me a sight of certain grottos which they occupied beyond villetri and whither they resorted during the intervals of their expeditions he assured me that they led a jovial life there had plenty of good cheer slept on beds of moss and were waited upon by young and beautiful females whom i might take for models  i confess i felt my curiosity roused by his descriptions of these grottos and their inhabitants they realized those scenes in robberstory which i had always looked upon as mere creations of the fancy i should gladly have accepted his invitation and paid a visit to those caverns could i have felt more secure in my company  i began to find my situation less painful i had evidently propitiated the goodwill of the chieftain and hoped that he might release me for a moderate ransom a new alarm however awaited me while the captain was looking out with impatience for the return of the messenger who had been sent to the prince the sentinel who had been posted on the side of the mountain facing the plain of la molara came running towards us with precipitation we are betrayed exclaimed he the police of frescati are after us a party of carabiniers have just stopped at the inn below the mountain then laying his hand on his stiletto he swore with a terrible oath that if they made the least movement towards the mountains my life and the lives of my fellowprisoners should answer for it  the chieftain resumed all his ferocity of demeanor and approved of what his companion said but when the latter had returned to his post he turned to me with a softened air i must act as chief said he and humor my dangerous subalterns it is a law with us to kill our prisoners rather than suffer them to be rescued but do not be alarmed in case we are surprised keep by me fly with us and i will consider myself responsible for your life  there was nothing very consolatory in this arrangement which would have placed me between two dangers i scarcely knew in case of flight which i should have most to apprehend from the carbines of the pursuers or the stilettos of the pursued i remained silent however and endeavored to maintain a look of tranquillity  for an hour was i kept in this state of peril and anxiety the robbers crouching among their leafy coverts kept an eagle watch upon the carabiniers below as they loitered about the inn sometimes lolling about the portal sometimes disappearing for several minutes then sallying out examining their weapons pointing in different directions and apparently asking questions about the neighborhood not a movement or gesture was last upon the keen eyes of the brigands at length we were relieved from our apprehensions the carabiniers having finished their refreshment seized their arms continued along the valley towards the great road and gradually left the mountain behind them i felt almost certain said the chief that they could not be sent after us they know too well how prisoners have fared in our hands on similar occasions our laws in this respect are inflexible and are necessary for our safety if we once flinched from them there would no longer be such thing as a ransom to be procured  there were no signs yet of the messengers return i was preparing to resume my sketching when the captain drew a quire of paper from his knapsackcome said he laughing you are a painter take my likeness the leaves of your portfolio are small draw it on this i gladly consented for it was a study that seldom presents itself to a painter i recollected that salvator rosa in his youth had voluntarily sojourned for a time among the banditti of calabria and had filled his mind with the savage scenery and savage associates by which he was surrounded i seized my pencil with enthusiasm at the thought i found the captain the most docile of subjects and after various shifting of positions i placed him in an attitude to my mind  picture to yourself a stern muscular figure in fanciful bandit costume with pistols and poniards in belt his brawny neck bare a handkerchief loosely thrown around it and the two ends in front strung with rings of all kinds the spoils of travellers reliques and medals hung on his breast his hat decorated with variouscolored ribbands his vest and short breeches of bright colors and finely embroidered his legs in buskins or leggins fancy him on a mountain height among wild rocks and rugged oaks leaning on his carbine as if meditating some exploit while far below are beheld villages and villas the scenes of his maraudings with the wide campagna dimly extending in the distance  the robber was pleased with the sketch and seemed to admire himself upon paper i had scarcely finished when the laborer arrived who had been sent for my ransom he had reached tusculum two hours after midnight he brought me a letter from the prince who was in bed at the time of his arrival as i had predicted he treated the demand as extravagant but offered five hundred dollars for my ransom having no money by him at the moment he had sent a note for the amount payable to whomever should conduct me safe and sound to rome i presented the note of hand to the chieftain he received it with a shrug of what use are notes of hand to us said he who can we send with you to rome to receive it we are all marked men known and described at every gate and military post and village churchdoor no we must have gold and silver let the sum be paid in cash and you shall be restored to liberty  the captain again placed a sheet of paper before me to communicate his determination to the prince when i had finished the letter and took the sheet from the quire i found on the opposite side of it the portrait which i had just been tracing i was about to tear it off and give it to the chief  hold said he let it go to rome let them see what kind of looking fellow i am perhaps the prince and his friends may form as good an opinion of me from my face as you have done  this was said sportively yet it was evident there was vanity lurking at the bottom even this wary distrustful chief of banditti forgot for a moment his usual foresight and precaution in the common wish to be admired he never reflected what use might be made of this portrait in his pursuit and conviction  the letter was folded and directed and the messenger departed again for tusculum it was now eleven oclock in the morning and as yet we had eaten nothing in spite of all my anxiety i began to feel a craving appetite i was glad therefore to hear the captain talk something of eating he observed that for three days and nights they had been lurking about among rocks and woods meditating their expedition to tusculum during which all their provisions had been exhausted he should now take measures to procure a supply leaving me therefore in the charge of his comrade in whom he appeared to have implicit confidence he departed assuring me that in less than two hours we should make a good dinner where it was to come from was an enigma to me though it was evident these beings had their secret friends and agents throughout the country  indeed the inhabitants of these mountains and of the valleys which they embosom are a rude half civilized set the towns and villages among the forests of the abruzzi shut up from the rest of the world are almost like savage dens it is wonderful that such rude abodes so little known and visited should be embosomed in the midst of one of the most travelled and civilized countries of europe among these regions the robber prowls unmolested not a mountaineer hesitates to give him secret harbor and assistance the shepherds however who tend their flocks among the mountains are the favorite emissaries of the robbers when they would send messages down to the valleys either for ransom or supplies the shepherds of the abruzzi are as wild as the scenes they frequent they are clad in a rude garb of black or brown sheepskin they have high conical hats and coarse sandals of cloth bound round their legs with thongs similar to those worn by the robbers they carry long staffs on which as they lean they form picturesque objects in the lonely landscape and they are followed by their everconstant companion the dog they are a curious questioning set glad at any time to relieve the monotony of their solitude by the conversation of the passerby and the dog will lend an attentive ear and put on as sagacious and inquisitive a look as his master  but i am wandering from my story i was now left alone with one of the robbers the confidential companion of the chief he was the youngest and most vigorous of the band and though his countenance had something of that dissolute fierceness which seems natural to this desperate lawless mode of life yet there were traits of manly beauty about it as an artist i could not but admire it i had remarked in him an air of abstraction and reverie and at times a movement of inward suffering and impatience he now sat on the ground his elbows on his knees his head resting between his clenched fists and his eyes fixed on the earth with an expression of sad and bitter rumination i had grown familiar with him from repeated conversations and had found him superior in mind to the rest of the band i was anxious to seize every opportunity of sounding the feelings of these singular beings i fancied i read in the countenance of this one traces of selfcondemnation and remorse and the ease with which i had drawn forth the confidence of the chieftain encouraged me to hope the same with his followers  after a little preliminary conversation i ventured to ask him if he did not feel regret at having abandoned his family and taken to this dangerous profession i feel replied he but one regret and that will end only with my life as he said this he pressed his clenched fists upon his bosom drew his breath through his set teeth and added with deep emotion i have something within here that stifles me it is like a burning iron consuming my very heart i could tell you a miserable story but not nowanother timehe relapsed into his former position and sat with his head between his hands muttering to himself in broken ejaculations and what appeared at times to be curses and maledictions i saw he was not in a mood to be disturbed so i left him to himself in a little time the exhaustion of his feelings and probably the fatigues he had undergone in this expedition began to produce drowsiness he struggled with it for a time but the warmth and sultriness of midday made it irresistible and he at length stretched himself upon the herbage and fell asleep  i now beheld a chance of escape within my reach my guard lay before me at my mercy his vigorous limbs relaxed by sleep his bosom open for the blow his carbine slipped from his nerveless grasp and lying by his side his stiletto half out of the pocket in which it was usually carried but two of his comrades were in sight and those at a considerable distance on the edge of the mountain their backs turned to us and their attention occupied in keeping a lookout upon the plain through a strip of intervening forest and at the foot of a steep descent i beheld the village of rocca priori to have secured the carbine of the sleeping brigand to have seized upon his poniard and have plunged it in his heart would have been the work of an instant should he die without noise i might dart through the forest and down to rocca priori before my flight might be discovered in case of alarm i should still have a fair start of the robbers and a chance of getting beyond the reach of their shot  here then was an opportunity for both escape and vengeance perilous indeed but powerfully tempting had my situation been more critical i could not have resisted it i reflected however for a moment the attempt if successful would be followed by the sacrifice of my two fellow prisoners who were sleeping profoundly and could not be awakened in time to escape the laborer who had gone after the ransom might also fall a victim to the rage of the robbers without the money which he brought being saved besides the conduct of the chief towards me made me feel certain of speedy deliverance these reflections overcame the first powerful impulse and i calmed the turbulent agitation which it had awakened  i again took out my materials for drawing and amused myself with sketching the magnificent prospect it was now about noon and every thing seemed sunk into repose like the bandit that lay sleeping before me the noontide stillness that reigned over these mountains the vast landscape below gleaming with distant towns and dotted with various habitations and signs of life yet all so silent had a powerful effect upon my mind the intermediate valleys too that lie among mountains have a peculiar air of solitude few sounds are heard at midday to break the quiet of the scene sometimes the whistle of a solitary muleteer lagging with his lazy animal along the road that winds through the centre of the valley sometimes the faint piping of a shepherds reed from the side of the mountain or sometimes the bell of an ass slowly pacing along followed by a monk with bare feet and bare shining head and carrying provisions to the convent  i had continued to sketch for some time among my sleeping companions when at length i saw the captain of the band approaching followed by a peasant leading a mule on which was a wellfilled sack i at first apprehended that this was some new prey fallen into the hands of the robbers but the contented look of the peasant soon relieved me and i was rejoiced to hear that it was our promised repast the brigands now came running from the three sides of the mountain having the quick scent of vultures every one busied himself in unloading the mule and relieving the sack of its contents  the first thing that made its appearance was an enormous ham of a color and plumpness that would have inspired the pencil of teniers it was followed by a large cheese a bag of boiled chestnuts a little barrel of wine and a quantity of good household bread everything was arranged on the grass with a degree of symmetry and the captain presenting me his knife requested me to help myself we all seated ourselves round the viands and nothing was heard for a time but the sound of vigorous mastication or the gurgling of the barrel of wine as it revolved briskly about the circle my long fasting and the mountain air and exercise had given me a keen appetite and never did repast appear to me more excellent or picturesque  from time to time one of the band was despatched to keep a lookout upon the plain no enemy was at hand and the dinner was undisturbed  the peasant received nearly twice the value of his provisions and set off down the mountain highly satisfied with his bargain i felt invigorated by the hearty meal i had made and notwithstanding that the wound i had received the evening before was painful yet i could not but feel extremely interested and gratified by the singular scenes continually presented to me every thing seemed pictured about these wild beings and their haunts their bivouacs their groups on guard their indolent noontide repose on the mountain brow their rude repast on the herbage among rocks and trees every thing presented a study for a painter but it was towards the approach of evening that i felt the highest enthusiasm awakened  the setting sun declining beyond the vast campagna shed its rich yellow beams on the woody summits of the abruzzi several mountains crowned with snow shone brilliantly in the distance contrasting their brightness with others which thrown into shade assumed deep tints of purple and violet as the evening advanced the landscape darkened into a sterner character the immense solitude around the wild mountains broken into rocks and precipices intermingled with vast oak cork and chestnuts and the groups of banditti in the foreground reminded me of those savage scenes of salvator rosa  to beguile the time the captain proposed to his comrades to spread before me their jewels and cameos as i must doubtless be a judge of such articles and able to inform them of their nature he set the example the others followed it and in a few moments i saw the grass before me sparkling with jewels and gems that would have delighted the eyes of an antiquary or a fine lady among them were several precious jewels and antique intaglios and cameos of great value the spoils doubtless of travellers of distinction i found that they were in the habit of selling their booty in the frontier towns as these in general were thinly and poorly peopled and little frequented by travellers they could offer no market for such valuable articles of taste and luxury i suggested to them the certainty of their readily obtaining great pieces for these gems among the rich strangers with which rome was thronged  the impression made upon their greedy minds was immediately apparent one of the band a young man and the least known requested permission of the captain to depart the following day in disguise for rome for the purpose of traffick promising on the faith of a bandit a sacred pledge amongst them to return in two days to any place he might appoint the captain consented and a curious scene took place the robbers crowded round him eagerly confiding to him such of their jewels as they wished to dispose of and giving him instructions what to demand there was bargaining and exchanging and selling of trinkets among themselves and i beheld my watch which had a chain and valuable seals purchased by the young robber merchant of the ruffian who had plundered me for sixty dollars i now conceived a faint hope that if it went to rome i might somehow or other regain possession of it  in the mean time day declined and no messenger returned from tusculum  the idea of passing another night in the woods was extremely disheartening for i began to be satisfied with what i had seen of robber life the chieftain now ordered his men to follow him that he might station them at their posts adding that if the messenger did not return before night they must shift their quarters to some other place  i was again left alone with the young bandit who had before guarded me he had the same gloomy air and haggard eye with now and then a bitter sardonic smile i was determined to probe this ulcerated heart and reminded him of a kind of promise he had given me to tell me the cause of his suffering  it seemed to me as if these troubled spirits were glad of an opportunity to disburthen themselves and of having some fresh undiseased mind with which they could communicate i had hardly made the request but he seated himself by my side and gave me his story in as nearly as i can recollect the following words     the story of the young robber   i was born at the little town of frosinone which lies at the skirts of the abruzzi my father had made a little property in trade and gave me some education as he intended me for the church but i had kept gay company too much to relish the cowl so i grew up a loiterer about the place i was a heedless fellow a little quarrelsome on occasions but goodhumored in the main so i made my way very well for a time until i fell in love there lived in our town a surveyor or land bailiff of the princes who had a young daughter a beautiful girl of sixteen she was looked upon as something better than the common run of our townsfolk and kept almost entirely at home i saw her occasionally and became madly in love with her she looked so fresh and tender and so different to the sunburnt females to whom i had been accustomed  as my father kept me in money i always dressed well and took all opportunities of showing myself to advantage in the eyes of the little beauty i used to see her at church and as i could play a little upon the guitar i gave her a tune sometimes under her window of an evening and i tried to have interviews with her in her fathers vineyard not far from the town where she sometimes walked she was evidently pleased with me but she was young and shy and her father kept a strict eye upon her and took alarm at my attentions for he had a bad opinion of me and looked for a better match for his daughter i became furious at the difficulties thrown in my way having been accustomed always to easy success among the women being considered one of the smartest young fellows of the place  her father brought home a suitor for her a rich farmer from a neighboring town the weddingday was appointed and preparations were making i got sight of her at her window and i thought she looked sadly at me i determined the match should not take place cost what it might i met her intended bridegroom in the marketplace and could not restrain the expression of my rage a few hot words passed between us when i drew my stiletto and stabbed him to the heart i fled to a neighboring church for refuge and with a little money i obtained absolution but i did not dare to venture from my asylum  at that time our captain was forming his troop he had known me from boyhood and hearing of my situation came to me in secret and made such offers that i agreed to enlist myself among his followers indeed i had more than once thought of taking to this mode of life having known several brave fellows of the mountains who used to spend their money freely among us youngsters of the town i accordingly left my asylum late one night repaired to the appointed place of meeting took the oaths prescribed and became one of the troop we were for some time in a distant part of the mountains and our wild adventurous kind of life hit my fancy wonderfully and diverted my thoughts at length they returned with all their violence to the recollection of rosetta the solitude in which i often found myself gave me time to brood over her image and as i have kept watch at night over our sleeping camp in the mountains my feelings have been roused almost to a fever  at length we shifted our ground and determined to make a descent upon the road between terracina and naples in the course of our expedition we passed a day or two in the woody mountains which rise above frosinone i cannot tell you how i felt when i looked down upon the place and distinguished the residence of rosetta i determined to have an interview with her but to what purpose i could not expect that she would quit her home and accompany me in my hazardous life among the mountains she had been brought up too tenderly for that and when i looked upon the women who were associated with some of our troop i could not have borne the thoughts of her being their companion all return to my former life was likewise hopeless for a price was set upon my head still i determined to see her the very hazard and fruitlessness of the thing made me furious to accomplish it  it is about three weeks since i persuaded our captain to draw down to the vicinity of frosinone in hopes of entrapping some of its principal inhabitants and compelling them to a ransom we were lying in ambush towards evening not far from the vineyard of rosettas father i stole quietly from my companions and drew near to reconnoitre the place of her frequent walks  how my heart beat when among the vines i beheld the gleaming of a white dress i knew it must be rosettas it being rare for any female of the place to dress in white i advanced secretly and without noise until putting aside the vines i stood suddenly before her she uttered a piercing shriek but i seized her in my arms put my hand upon her mouth and conjured her to be silent i poured out all the frenzy of my passion offered to renounce my mode of life to put my fate in her hands to fly with her where we might live in safety together all that i could say or do would not pacify her instead of love horror and affright seemed to have taken possession of her breastshe struggled partly from my grasp and filled the air with her cries in an instant the captain and the rest of my companions were around us i would have given anything at that moment had she been safe out of our hands and in her fathers house it was too late the captain pronounced her a prize and ordered that she should be borne to the mountains i represented to him that she was my prize that i had a previous claim to her and i mentioned my former attachment he sneered bitterly in reply observed that brigands had no business with village intrigues and that according to the laws of the troop all spoils of the kind were determined by lot love and jealousy were raging in my heart but i had to choose between obedience and death i surrendered her to the captain and we made for the mountains  she was overcome by affright and her steps were so feeble and faltering and it was necessary to support her i could not endure the idea that my comrades should touch her and assuming a forced tranquillity begged that she might be confided to me as one to whom she was more accustomed the captain regarded me for a moment with a searching look but i bore it without flinching and he consented i took her in my arms she was almost senseless her head rested on my shoulder her mouth was near to mine i felt her breath on my face and it seemed to fan the flame which devoured me oh god to have this glowing treasure in my arms and yet to think it was not mine  we arrived at the foot of the mountain i ascended it with difficulty particularly where the woods were thick but i would not relinquish my delicious burthen i reflected with rage however that i must soon do so the thoughts that so delicate a creature must be abandoned to my rude companions maddened me i felt tempted the stiletto in my hand to cut my way through them all and bear her off in triumph i scarcely conceived the idea before i saw its rashness but my brain was fevered with the thought that any but myself should enjoy her charms i endeavored to outstrip my companions by the quickness of my movements and to get a little distance ahead in case any favorable opportunity of escape should present vain effort the voice of the captain suddenly ordered a halt i trembled but had to obey the poor girl partly opened a languid eye but was without strength or motion i laid her upon the grass the captain darted on me a terrible look of suspicion and ordered me to scour the woods with my companions in search of some shepherd who might be sent to her fathers to demand a ransom  i saw at once the peril to resist with violence was certain death but to leave her alone in the power of the captaini spoke out then with a fervor inspired by my passion and my despair i reminded the captain that i was the first to seize her that she was my prize and that my previous attachment for her should make her sacred among my companions i insisted therefore that he should pledge me his word to respect her otherwise i should refuse obedience to his orders his only reply was to cock his carbine and at the signal my comrades did the same they laughed with cruelty at my impotent rage what could i do i felt the madness of resistance i was menaced on all hands and my companions obliged me to follow them she remained alone with the chiefyes alone and almost lifeless  here the robber paused in his recital overpowered by his emotions great drops of sweat stood on his forehead he panted rather than breathed his brawny bosom rose and fell like the waves of a troubled sea when he had become a little calm he continued his recital  i was not long in finding a shepherd said he i ran with the rapidity of a deer eager if possible to get back before what i dreaded might take place i had left my companions far behind and i rejoined them before they had reached onehalf the distance i had made i hurried them back to the place where we had left the captain as we approached i beheld him seated by the side of rosetta his triumphant look and the desolate condition of the unfortunate girl left me no doubt of her fate i know not how i restrained my fury  it was with extreme difficulty and by guiding her hand that she was made to trace a few characters requesting her father to send three hundred dollars as her ransom the letter was despatched by the shepherd when he was gone the chief turned sternly to me you have set an example said he of mutiny and selfwill which if indulged would be ruinous to the troop had i treated you as our laws require this bullet would have been driven through your brain but you are an old friend i have borne patiently with your fury and your folly i have even protected you from a foolish passion that would have unmanned you as to this girl the laws of our association must have their course so saying he gave his commands lots were drawn and the helpless girl was abandoned to the troop  here the robber paused again panting with fury and it was some moments before he could resume his story  hell said he was raging in my heart i beheld the impossibility of avenging myself and i felt that according to the articles in which we stood bound to one another the captain was in the right i rushed with frenzy from the place i threw myself upon the earth tore up the grass with my hands and beat my head and gnashed my teeth in agony and rage when at length i returned i beheld the wretched victim pale dishevelled her dress torn and disordered an emotion of pity for a moment subdued my fiercer feelings i bore her to the foot of a tree and leaned her gently against it i took my gourd which was filled with wine and applying it to her lips endeavored to make her swallow a little to what a condition was she recovered she whom i had once seen the pride of frosinone who but a short time before i had beheld sporting in her fathers vineyard so fresh and beautiful and happy her teeth were clenched her eyes fixed on the ground her form without motion and in a state of absolute insensibility i hung over her in an agony of recollection of all that she had been and of anguish at what i now beheld her i darted round a look of horror at my companions who seemed like so many fiends exulting in the downfall of an angel and i felt a horror at myself for being their accomplice  the captain always suspicious saw with his usual penetration what was passing within me and ordered me to go upon the ridge of woods to keep a lookout upon the neighborhood and await the return of the shepherd i obeyed of course stifling the fury that raged within me though i felt for the moment that he was my most deadly foe  on my way however a ray of reflection came across my mind i perceived that the captain was but following with strictness the terrible laws to which we had sworn fidelity that the passion by which i had been blinded might with justice have been fatal to me but for his forbearance that he had penetrated my soul and had taken precautions by sending me out of the way to prevent my committing any excess in my anger from that instant i felt that i was capable of pardoning him  occupied with these thoughts i arrived at the foot of the mountain the country was solitary and secure and in a short time i beheld the shepherd at a distance crossing the plain i hastened to meet him he had obtained nothing he had found the father plunged in the deepest distress he had read the letter with violent emotion and then calming himself with a sudden exertion he had replied coldly my daughter has been dishonored by those wretches let her be returned without ransom or let her die  i shuddered at this reply i knew according to the laws of our troop her death was inevitable our oaths required it i felt nevertheless that not having been able to have her to myself i could become her executioner  the robber again paused with agitation i sat musing upon his last frightful words which proved to what excess the passions may be carried when escaped from all moral restraint there was a horrible verity in this story that reminded me of some of the tragic fictions of danté  we now came to a fatal moment resumed the bandit after the report of the shepherd i returned with him and the chieftain received from his lips the refusal of the father at a signal which we all understood we followed him some distance from the victim he there pronounced her sentence of death every one stood ready to execute his order but i interfered i observed that there was something due to pity as well as to justice that i was as ready as any one to approve the implacable law which was to serve as a warning to all those who hesitated to pay the ransoms demanded for our prisoners but that though the sacrifice was proper it ought to be made without cruelty the night is approaching continued i she will soon be wrapped in sleep let her then be despatched all that i now claim on the score of former fondness for her is let me strike the blow i will do it as surely but more tenderly than another  several raised their voices against my proposition but the captain imposed silence on them he told me i might conduct her into a thicket at some distance and he relied upon my promise  i hastened to seize my prey there was a forlorn kind of triumph at having at length become her exclusive possessor i bore her off into the thickness of the forest she remained in the same state of insensibility and stupor i was thankful that she did not recollect me for had she once murmured my name i should have been overcome she slept at length in the arms of him who was to poniard her many were the conflicts i underwent before i could bring myself to strike the blow my heart had become sore by the recent conflicts it had undergone and i dreaded lest by procrastination some other should become her executioner when her repose had continued for some time i separated myself gently from her that i might not disturb her sleep and seizing suddenly my poniard plunged it into her bosom a painful and concentrated murmur but without any convulsive movement accompanied her last sigh so perished this unfortunate  he ceased to speak i sat horrorstruck covering my face with my hands seeking as it were to hide from myself the frightful images he had presented to my mind i was roused from this silence by the voice of the captain you sleep said he and it is time to be off come we must abandon this height as night is setting in and the messenger is not returned i will post some one on the mountain edge to conduct him to the place where we shall pass the night  this was no agreeable news to me i was sick at heart with the dismal story i had heard i was harassed and fatigued and the sight of the banditti began to grow insupportable to me  the captain assembled his comrades we rapidly descended the forest which we had mounted with so much difficulty in the morning and soon arrived in what appeared to be a frequented road the robbers proceeded with great caution carrying their guns cocked and looking on every side with wary and suspicious eyes they were apprehensive of encountering the civic patrole we left rocca priori behind us there was a fountain near by and as i was excessively thirsty i begged permission to stop and drink the captain himself went and brought me water in his hat we pursued our route when at the extremity of an alley which crossed the road i perceived a female on horseback dressed in white she was alone i recollected the fate of the poor girl in the story and trembled for her safety  one of the brigands saw her at the same instant and plunging into the bushes he ran precipitately in the direction towards her stopping on the border of the alley he put one knee to the ground presented his carbine ready for menace or to shoot her horse if she attempted to fly and in this way awaited her approach i kept my eyes fixed on her with intense anxiety i felt tempted to shout and warn her of her danger though my own destruction would have been the consequence it was awful to see this tiger crouching ready for a bound and the poor innocent victim wandering unconsciously near him nothing but a mere chance could save her to my joy the chance turned in her favor she seemed almost accidentally to take an opposite path which led outside of the wood where the robber dare not venture to this casual deviation she owed her safety  i could not imagine why the captain of the band had ventured to such a distance from the height on which he had placed the sentinel to watch the return of the messengers he seemed himself uneasy at the risk to which he exposed himself his movements were rapid and uneasy i could scarce keep pace with him at length after three hours of what might be termed a forced march we mounted the extremity of the same woods the summit of which we had occupied during the day and i learnt with satisfaction that we had reached our quarters for the night  you must be fatigued said the chieftain but it was necessary to survey the environs so as not to be surprised during the night had we met with the famous civic guard of rocca priori you would have seen fine sport such was the indefatigable precaution and forethought of this robber chief who really gave continual evidences of military talent  the night was magnificent the moon rising above the horizon in a cloudless sky faintly lit up the grand features of the mountains while lights twinkling here and there like terrestrial stars in the wide dusky expanse of the landscape betrayed the lonely cabins of the shepherds exhausted by fatigue and by the many agitations i had experienced i prepared to sleep soothed by the hope of approaching deliverance the captain ordered his companions to collect some dry moss he arranged with his own hands a kind of mattress and pillow of it and gave me his ample mantle as a covering i could not but feel both surprised and gratified by such unexpected attentions on the part of this benevolent cutthroat for there is nothing more striking than to find the ordinary charities which are matters of course in common life flourishing by the side of such stern and sterile crime it is like finding the tender flowers and fresh herbage of the valley growing among the rocks and cinders of the volcano  before i fell asleep i had some farther discourse with the captain who seemed to put great confidence in me he referred to our previous conversation of the morning told me he was weary of his hazardous profession that he had acquired sufficient property and was anxious to return to the world and lead a peaceful life in the bosom of his family he wished to know whether it was not in my power to procure him a passport for the united states of america i applauded his good intentions and promised to do everything in my power to promote its success we then parted for the night i stretched myself upon my couch of moss which after my fatigues felt like a bed of down and sheltered by the robbers mantle from all humidity i slept soundly without waking until the signal to arise  it was nearly six oclock and the day was just dawning as the place where we had passed the night was too much exposed we moved up into the thickness of the woods a fire was kindled while there was any flame the mantles were again extended round it but when nothing remained but glowing cinders they were lowered and the robbers seated themselves in a circle  the scene before me reminded me of some of those described by homer there wanted only the victim on the coals and the sacred knife to cut off the succulent parts and distribute them around my companions might have rivalled the grim warriors of greece in place of the noble repasts however of achilles and agamemnon i beheld displayed on the grass the remains of the ham which had sustained so vigorous an attack on the preceding evening accompanied by the reliques of the bread cheese and wine  we had scarcely commenced our frugal breakfast when i heard again an imitation of the bleating of sheep similar to what i had heard the day before the captain answered it in the same tone two men were soon after seen descending from the woody height where we had passed the preceding evening on nearer approach they proved to be the sentinel and the messenger the captain rose and went to meet them he made a signal for his comrades to join him they had a short conference and then returning to me with eagerness your ransom is paid said he you are free  though i had anticipated deliverance i cannot tell you what a rush of delight these tidings gave me i cared not to finish my repast but prepared to depart the captain took me by the hand requested permission to write to me and begged me not to forget the passport i replied that i hoped to be of effectual service to him and that i relied on his honor to return the princes note for five hundred dollars now that the cash was paid he regarded me for a moment with surprise then seeming to recollect himself e giusto said he eccoloadio1 he delivered me the note pressed my hand once more and we separated the laborers were permitted to follow me and we resumed with joy our road towards tusculum  footnote 1 it is justthere it isadieu                                       the artist ceased to speak the party continued for a few moments to pace the shore of terracina in silence the story they had heard had made a deep impression on them particularly on the fair venetian who had gradually regained her husbands arm at the part that related to the young girl of frosinone she had been violently affected sobs broke from her she clung close to her husband and as she looked up to him as if for protection the moonbeams shining on her beautifully fair countenance showed it paler than usual with terror while tears glittered in her fine dark eyes o caro mio would she murmur shuddering at every atrocious circumstance of the story  corragio mia vita was the reply as the husband gently and fondly tapped the white hand that lay upon his arm  the englishman alone preserved his usual phlegm and the fair venetian was piqued at it  she had pardoned him a want of gallantry towards herself though a sin of omission seldom met with in the gallant climate of italy but the quiet coolness which he maintained in matters which so much affected her and the slow credence which he had given to the stories which had filled her with alarm were quite vexatious  santa maria said she to husband as they retired for the night what insensible beings these english are  in the morning all was bustle at the inn at terracina  the procaccio had departed at daybreak on its route towards rome but the englishman was yet to start and the departure of an english equipage is always enough to keep an inn in a bustle on this occasion there was more than usual stir for the englishman having much property about him and having been convinced of the real danger of the road had applied to the police and obtained by dint of liberal pay an escort of eight dragoons and twelve footsoldiers as far as fondi  perhaps too there might have been a little ostentation at bottom from which with great delicacy be it spoken english travellers are not always exempt though to say the truth he had nothing of it in his manner he moved about taciturn and reserved as usual among the gaping crowd in his gingerbreadcolored travelling cap with his hands in his pockets he gave laconic orders to john as he packed away the thousand and one indispensable conveniencies of the night double loaded his pistols with great sangfroid and deposited them in the pockets of the carriage taking no notice of a pair of keen eyes gazing on him from among the herd of loitering idlers the fair venetian now came up with a request made in her dulcet tones that he would permit their carriage to proceed under protection of his escort the englishman who was busy loading another pair of pistols for his servant and held the ramrod between his teeth nodded assent as a matter of course but without lifting up his eyes the fair venetian was not accustomed to such indifference o dio ejaculated she softly as she retired como sono freddi questi inglesi at length off they set in gallant style the eight dragoons prancing in front the twelve footsoldiers marching in rear and carriages moving slowly in the centre to enable the infantry to keep pace with them they had proceeded but a few hundred yards when it was discovered that some indispensable article had been left behind  in fact the englishmans purse was missing and john was despatched to the inn to search for it  this occasioned a little delay and the carriage of the venetians drove slowly on john came back out of breath and out of humor the purse was not to be found his master was irritated he recollected the very place where it lay the cursed italian servant had pocketed it john was again sent back he returned once more without the purse but with the landlord and the whole household at his heels a thousand ejaculations and protestations accompanied by all sorts of grimaces and contortions no purse had been seenhis excellenza must be mistaken  nohis excellenza was not mistaken the purse lay on the marble table under the mirror a green purse half full of gold and silver again a thousand grimaces and contortions and vows by san genario that no purse of the kind had been seen  the englishman became furious the waiter had pocketed it the landlord was a knave the inn a den of thievesit was a dd countryhe had been cheated and plundered from one end of it to the otherbut hed have satisfactionhed drive right off to the police  he was on the point of ordering the postilions to turn back when on rising he displaced the cushion of the carriage and the purse of money fell chinking to the floor  all the blood in his body seemed to rush into his face dn the purse said he as he snatched it up he dashed a handful of money on the ground before the pale cringing waiter therebe off cried he john order the postilions to drive on  above half an hour had been exhausted in this altercation the venetian carriage had loitered along its passengers looking out from time to time and expecting the escort every moment to follow they had gradually turned an angle of the road that shut them out of sight the little army was again in motion and made a very picturesque appearance as it wound along at the bottom of the rocks the morning sunshine beaming upon the weapons of soldiery  the englishman lolled back in his carriage vexed with himself at what had passed and consequently out of humor with all the world as this however is no uncommon case with gentlemen who travel for their pleasure it is hardly worthy of remark  they had wound up from the coast among the hills and came to a part of the road that admitted of some prospect ahead  i see nothing of the ladys carriage sir said john leaning over from the coach box  hang the ladys carriage said the englishman crustily dont plague me about the ladys carriage must i be continually pestered with strangers  john said not another word for he understood his masters mood the road grew more wild and lonely they were slowly proceeding in a foot pace up a hill the dragoons were some distance ahead and had just reached the summit of the hill when they uttered an exclamation or rather shout and galloped forward the englishman was aroused from his sulky revery he stretched his head from the carriage which had attained the brow of the hill before him extended a long hollow defile commanded on one side by rugged precipitous heights covered with bushes and scanty forest trees at some distance he beheld the carriage of the venitians overturned a numerous gang of desperadoes were rifling it the young man and his servant were overpowered and partly stripped and the lady was in the hands of two of the ruffians  the englishman seized his pistols sprang from his carriage and called upon john to follow him in the meantime as the dragoons came forward the robbers who were busy with the carriage quitted their spoil formed themselves in the middle of the road and taking deliberate aim fired one of the dragoons fell another was wounded and the whole were for a moment checked and thrown in confusion the robbers loaded again in an instant the dragoons had discharged their carbines but without apparent effect they received another volley which though none fell threw them again into confusion the robbers were loading a second time when they saw the foot soldiers at handscampa via was the word they abandoned their prey and retreated up the rocks the soldiers after them they fought from cliff to cliff and bush to bush the robbers turning every now and then to fire upon their pursuers the soldiers scrambling after them and discharging their muskets whenever they could get a chance sometimes a soldier or a robber was shot down and came tumbling among the cliffs the dragoons kept firing from below whenever a robber came in sight  the englishman hastened to the scene of action and the balls discharged at the dragoons had whistled past him as he advanced one object however engrossed his attention it was the beautiful venetian lady in the hands of two of the robbers who during the confusion of the fight carried her shrieking up the mountains he saw her dress gleaming among the bushes and he sprang up the rocks to intercept the robbers as they bore off their prey the ruggedness of the steep and the entanglements of the bushes delayed and impeded him he lost sight of the lady but was still guided by her cries which grew fainter and fainter they were off to the left while the report of muskets showed that the battle was raging to the right  at length he came upon what appeared to be a rugged footpath faintly worn in a gully of the rock and beheld the ruffians at some distance hurrying the lady up the defile one of them hearing his approach let go his prey advanced towards him and levelling the carbine which had been slung on his back fired the ball whizzed through the englishmans hat and carried with it some of his hair he returned the fire with one of his pistols and the robber fell the other brigand now dropped the lady and drawing a long pistol from his belt fired on his adversary with deliberate aim the ball passed between his left arm and his side slightly wounding the arm the englishman advanced and discharged his remaining pistol which wounded the robber but not severely the brigand drew a stiletto and rushed upon his adversary who eluded the blow receiving merely a slight wound and defending himself with his pistol which had a spring bayonet they closed with one another and a desperate struggle ensued the robber was a squarebuilt thickset man powerful muscular and active the englishman though of larger frame and greater strength was less active and less accustomed to athletic exercises and feats of hardihood but he showed himself practised and skilled in the art of defence they were on a craggy height and the englishman perceived that his antagonist was striving to press him to the edge  a side glance showed him also the robber whom he had first wounded scrambling up to the assistance of his comrade stiletto in hand he had in fact attained the summit of the cliff and the englishman saw him within a few steps when he heard suddenly the report of a pistol and the ruffian fell the shot came from john who had arrived just in time to save his master  the remaining robber exhausted by loss of blood and the violence of the contest showed signs of faltering his adversary pursued his advantage pressed on him and as his strength relaxed dashed him headlong from the precipice he looked after him and saw him lying motionless among the rocks below  the englishman now sought the fair venetian he found her senseless on the ground with his servants assistance he bore her down to the road where her husband was raving like one distracted  the occasional discharge of firearms along the height showed that a retreating fight was still kept up by the robbers the carriage was righted the baggage was hastily replaced the venetian transported with joy and gratitude took his lovely and senseless burthen in his arms and the party resumed their route towards fondi escorted by the dragoons leaving the foot soldiers to ferret out the banditti while on the way john dressed his masters wounds which were found not to be serious  before arriving at fondi the fair venetian had recovered from her swoon and was made conscious of her safety and of the mode of her deliverance her transports were unbounded and mingled with them were enthusiastic ejaculations of gratitude to her deliverer a thousand times did she reproach herself for having accused him of coldness and insensibility the moment she saw him she rushed into his arms and clasped him round the neck with all the vivacity of her nation  never was man more embarrassed by the embraces of a fine woman  my deliverer my angel exclaimed she  tut tut said the englishman  you are wounded shrieked the fair venetian as she saw the blood upon his clothes  poohnothing at all  o dio exclaimed she clasping him again round the neck and sobbing on his bosom  pooh exclaimed the englishman looking somewhat foolish this is all nonsense     part fourth  the money diggers  found among the papers of the late diedrich knickerbocker    now i remember those old womens words   who in my youth would tell me winters tales   and speak of spirits and ghosts that glide by night   about the place where treasure had been hid    marlows jew of malta     hell gate   about six miles from the renowned city of the manhattoes and in that sound or arm of the sea which passes between the main land and nassau or long island there is a narrow strait where the current is violently compressed between shouldering promontories and horribly irritated and perplexed by rocks and shoals being at the best of times a very violent hasty current its takes these impediments in mighty dudgeon boiling in whirlpools brawling and fretting in ripples and breakers and in short indulging in all kinds of wrongheaded paroxysms at such times woe to any unlucky vessel that ventures within its clutches  this termagant humor is said to prevail only at half tides at low water it is as pacific as any other stream as the tide rises it begins to fret at half tide it rages and roars as if bellowing for more water but when the tide is full it relapses again into quiet and for a time seems almost to sleep as soundly as an alderman after dinner it may be compared to an inveterate hard drinker who is a peaceable fellow enough when he has no liquor at all or when he has a skin full but when half seas over plays the very devil  this mighty blustering bullying little strait was a place of great difficulty and danger to the dutch navigators of ancient days hectoring their tubbuilt barks in a most unruly style whirling them about in a manner to make any but a dutchman giddy and not unfrequently stranding them upon rocks and reefs whereupon out of sheer spleen they denominated it hellegat literally hell gut and solemnly gave it over to the devil this appellation has since been aptly rendered into english by the name of hell gate and into nonsense by the name of hurl gate according to certain foreign intruders who neither understood dutch nor english may st nicholas confound them  from this strait to the city of the manhattoes the borders of the sound are greatly diversified in one part on the eastern shore of the island of manhata and opposite blackwells island being very much broken and indented by rocky nooks overhung with trees which give them a wild and romantic look  the flux and reflux of the tide through this part of the sound is extremely rapid and the navigation troublesome by reason of the whirling eddies and counter currents i speak this from experience having been much of a navigator of these small seas in my boyhood and having more than once run the risk of shipwreck and drowning in the course of divers holiday voyages to which in common with the dutch urchins i was rather prone  in the midst of this perilous strait and hard by a group of rocks called the hen and chickens there lay in my boyish days the wreck of a vessel which had been entangled in the whirlpools and stranded during a storm there was some wild story about this being the wreck of a pirate and of some bloody murder connected with it which i cannot now recollect indeed the desolate look of this forlorn hulk and the fearful place where it lay rotting were sufficient to awaken strange notions concerning it a row of timber heads blackened by time peered above the surface at high water but at low tide a considerable part of the hull was bare and its great ribs or timbers partly stripped of their planks looked like the skeleton of some sea monster there was also the stump of a mast with a few ropes and blocks swinging about and whistling in the wind while the sea gull wheeled and screamed around this melancholy carcass  the stories connected with this wreck made it an object of great awe to my boyish fancy but in truth the whole neighborhood was full of fable and romance for me abounding with traditions about pirates hobgoblins and buried money as i grew to more mature years i made many researches after the truth of these strange traditions for i have always been a curious investigator of the valuable but obscure branches of the history of my native province i found infinite difficulty however in arriving at any precise information in seeking to dig up one fact it is incredible the number of fables which i unearthed for the whole course of the sound seemed in my younger days to be like the straits of pylorus of yore the very region of fiction i will say nothing of the devils stepping stones by which that arch fiend made his retreat from connecticut to long island seeing that the subject is likely to be learnedly treated by a worthy friend and contemporary historian2 whom i have furnished with particulars thereof neither will i say anything of the black man in a threecornered hat seated in the stern of a jolly boat who used to be seen about hell gate in stormy weather and who went by the name of the pirates spuke or pirates ghost because i never could meet with any person of stanch credibility who professed to have seen this spectrum unless it were the widow of manus conklin the blacksmith of frogs neck but then poor woman she was a little purblind and might have been mistaken though they said she saw farther than other folks in the dark all this however was but little satisfactory in regard to the tales of buried money about which i was most curious and the following was all that i could for a long time collect that had anything like an air of authenticity  footnote 2 for a very interesting account of the devil and his stepping stones see the learned memoir read before the new york historical society since the death of mr knickerbocker by his friend an eminent jurist of the place     kidd the pirate   in old times just after the territory of the new netherlands had been wrested from the hands of their high mightinesses the lords states general of holland by charles the second and while it was as yet in an unquiet state the province was a favorite resort of adventurers of all kinds and particularly of buccaneers these were piratical rovers of the deep who made sad work in times of peace among the spanish settlements and spanish merchant ships they took advantage of the easy access to the harbor of the manhattoes and of the laxity of its scarcelyorganized government to make it a kind of rendezvous where they might dispose of their illgotten spoils and concert new depredations crews of these desperadoes the runagates of every country and clime might be seen swaggering in open day about the streets of the little burgh elbowing its quiet mynheers trafficking away their rich outlandish plunder at half price to the wary merchant and then squandering their gains in taverns drinking gambling singing swearing shouting and astounding the neighborhood with sudden brawl and ruffian revelry  at length the indignation of government was aroused and it was determined to ferret out this vermin brood from the colonies great consternation took place among the pirates on finding justice in pursuit of them and their old haunts turned to places of peril they secreted their money and jewels in lonely outoftheway places buried them about the wild shores of the rivers and seacoast and dispersed themselves over the face of the country  among the agents employed to hunt them by sea was the renowned captain kidd he had long been a hardy adventurer a kind of equivocal borderer half trader half smuggler with a tolerable dash of the pickaroon he had traded for some time among the pirates lurking about the seas in a little rakish musquitobuilt vessel prying into all kinds of odd places as busy as a mother careys chicken in a gale of wind  this nondescript personage was pitched upon by government as the very man to command a vessel fitted out to cruise against the pirates since he knew all their haunts and lurkingplaces acting upon the shrewd old maxim of setting a rogue to catch a rogue kidd accordingly sailed from new york in the adventure galley gallantly armed and duly commissioned and steered his course to the madeiras to bonavista to madagascar and cruised at the entrance of the red sea instead however of making war upon the pirates he turned pirate himself captured friend or foe enriched himself with the spoils of a wealthy indiaman manned by moors though commanded by an englishman and having disposed of his prize had the hardihood to return to boston laden with wealth with a crew of his comrades at his heels  his fame had preceded him the alarm was given of the reappearance of this cutpurse of the ocean measures were taken for his arrest but he had time it is said to bury the greater part of his treasures he even attempted to draw his sword and defend himself when arrested but was secured and thrown into prison with several of his followers they were carried to england in a frigate where they were tried condemned and hanged at execution dock kidd died hard for the rope with which he was first tied up broke with his weight and he tumbled to the ground he was tied up a second time and effectually from whence arose the story of his having been twice hanged  such is the main outline of kidds history but it has given birth to an innumerable progeny of traditions the circumstance of his having buried great treasures of gold and jewels after returning from his cruising set the brains of all the good people along the coast in a ferment there were rumors on rumors of great sums found here and there sometimes in one part of the country sometimes in another of trees and rocks bearing mysterious marks doubtless indicating the spots where treasure lay hidden of coins found with moorish characters the plunder of kidds eastern prize but which the common people took for diabolical or magic inscriptions  some reported the spoils to have been buried in solitary unsettled places about plymouth and cape cod many other parts of the eastern coast also and various places in long island sound have been gilded by these rumors and have been ransacked by adventurous moneydiggers  in all the stories of these enterprises the devil played a conspicuous part either he was conciliated by ceremonies and invocations or some bargain or compact was made with him still he was sure to play the moneydiggers some slippery trick some had succeeded so far as to touch the iron chest which contained the treasure when some baffling circumstance was sure to take place either the earth would fall in and fill up the pit or some direful noise or apparition would throw the party into a panic and frighten them from the place and sometimes the devil himself would appear and bear off the prize from their very grasp and if they visited the place on the next day not a trace would be seen of their labors of the preceding night  such were the vague rumors which for a long time tantalized without gratifying my curiosity on the interesting subject of these pirate traditions there is nothing in this world so hard to get at as truth i sought among my favorite sources of authentic information the oldest inhabitants and particularly the old dutch wives of the province but though i flatter myself i am better versed than most men in the curious history of my native province yet for a long time my inquiries were unattended with any substantial result  at length it happened one calm day in the latter part of summer that i was relaxing myself from the toils of severe study by a days amusement in fishing in those waters which had been the favorite resort of my boyhood i was in company with several worthy burghers of my native city our sport was indifferent the fish did not bite freely and we had frequently changed our fishing ground without bettering our luck we at length anchored close under a ledge of rocky coast on the eastern side of the island of manhata it was a still warm day the stream whirled and dimpled by us without a wave or even a ripple and every thing was so calm and quiet that it was almost startling when the kingfisher would pitch himself from the branch of some dry tree and after suspending himself for a moment in the air to take his aim would souse into the smooth water after his prey while we were lolling in our boat half drowsy with the warm stillness of the day and the dullness of our sport one of our party a worthy alderman was overtaken by a slumber and as he dozed suffered the sinker of his dropline to lie upon the bottom of the river on waking he found he had caught something of importance from the weight on drawing it to the surface we were much surprised to find a long pistol of very curious and outlandish fashion which from its rusted condition and its stock being wormeaten and covered with barnacles appeared to have been a long time under water the unexpected appearance of this document of warfare occasioned much speculation among my pacific companions one supposed it to have fallen there during the revolutionary war another from the peculiarity of its fashion attributed it to the voyagers in the earliest days of the settlement perchance to the renowned adrian block who explored the sound and discovered block island since so noted for its cheese but a third after regarding it for some time pronounced it to be of veritable spanish workmanship  ill warrant said he if this pistol could talk it would tell strange stories of hard fights among the spanish dons ive not a doubt but its a relique of the buccaneers of old times  like enough said another of the party there was bradish the pirate who at the time lord bellamont made such a stir after the buccaneers buried money and jewels somewhere in these parts or on longisland and then there was captain kidd  ah that kidd was a daring dog said an ironfaced cape cod whaler theres a fine old song about him all to the tune of    my name is robert kidd   as i sailed as i sailed  and it tells how he gained the devils good graces by burying the bible    i had the bible in my hand   as i sailed as i sailed   and i buried it in the sand   as i sailed  egad if this pistol had belonged to him i should set some store by it out of sheer curiosity ah well theres an odd story i have heard about one tom walker who they say dug up some of kidds buried money and as the fish dont seem to bite at present ill tell it to you to pass away time     the devil and tom walker   a few miles from boston in massachusetts there is a deep inlet winding several miles into the interior of the country from charles bay and terminating in a thicklywooded swamp or morass on one side of this inlet is a beautiful dark grove on the opposite side the land rises abruptly from the waters edge into a high ridge on which grow a few scattered oaks of great age and immense size it was under one of these gigantic trees according to old stories that kidd the pirate buried his treasure the inlet allowed a facility to bring the money in a boat secretly and at night to the very foot of the hill the elevation of the place permitted a good lookout to be kept that no one was at hand while the remarkable trees formed good landmarks by which the place might easily be found again the old stories add moreover that the devil presided at the hiding of the money and took it under his guardianship but this it is wellknown he always does with buried treasure particularly when it has been ill gotten be that as it may kidd never returned to recover his wealth being shortly after seized at boston sent out to england and there hanged for a pirate  about the year 1727 just at the time when earthquakes were prevalent in new england and shook many tall sinners down upon their knees there lived near this place a meagre miserly fellow of the name of tom walker he had a wife as miserly as himself they were so miserly that they even conspired to cheat each other whatever the woman could lay hands on she hid away a hen could not cackle but she was on the alert to secure the newlaid egg her husband was continually prying about to detect her secret hoards and many and fierce were the conflicts that took place about what ought to have been common property they lived in a forlornlooking house that stood alone and had an air of starvation a few straggling savin trees emblems of sterility grew near it no smoke ever curled from its chimney no traveller stopped at its door a miserable horse whose ribs were as articulate as the bars of a gridiron stalked about a field where a thin carpet of moss scarcely covering the ragged beds of puddingstone tantalized and balked his hunger and sometimes he would lean his head over the fence looked piteously at the passerby and seem to petition deliverance from this land of famine  the house and its inmates had altogether a bad name toms wife was a tall termagant fierce of temper loud of tongue and strong of arm her voice was often heard in wordy warfare with her husband and his face sometimes showed signs that their conflicts were not confined to words no one ventured however to interfere between them the lonely wayfarer shrunk within himself at the horrid clamor and clapperclawing eyed the den of discord askance and hurried on his way rejoicing if a bachelor in his celibacy  one day that tom walker had been to a distant part of the neighborhood he took what he considered a short cut homewards through the swamp like most short cuts it was an illchosen route the swamp was thickly grown with great gloomy pines and hemlocks some of them ninety feet high which made it dark at noonday and a retreat for all the owls of the neighborhood it was full of pits and quagmires partly covered with weeds and mosses where the green surface often betrayed the traveller into a gulf of black smothering mud there were also dark and stagnant pools the abodes of the tadpole the bullfrog and the watersnake and where trunks of pines and hemlocks lay half drowned half rotting looking like alligators sleeping in the mire  tom had long been picking his way cautiously through this treacherous forest stepping from tuft to tuft of rushes and roots which afforded precarious footholds among deep sloughs or pacing carefully like a cat among the prostrate trunks of trees startled now and then by the sudden screaming of the bittern or the quacking of a wild duck rising on the wing from some solitary pool at length he arrived at a piece of firm ground which ran out like a peninsula into the deep bosom of the swamp it had been one of the strongholds of the indians during their wars with the first colonists here they had thrown up a kind of fort which they had looked upon as almost impregnable and had used as a place of refuge for their squaws and children nothing remained of the indian fort but a few embankments gradually sinking to the level of the surrounding earth and already overgrown in part by oaks and other forest trees the foliage of which formed a contrast to the dark pines and hemlocks of the swamp  it was late in the dusk of evening that tom walker reached the old fort and he paused there for a while to rest himself any one but he would have felt unwilling to linger in this lonely melancholy place for the common people had a bad opinion of it from the stories handed down from the time of the indian wars when it was asserted that the savages held incantations here and made sacrifices to the evil spirit tom walker however was not a man to be troubled with any fears of the kind  he reposed himself for some time on the trunk of a fallen hemlock listening to the boding cry of the treetoad and delving with his walkingstaff into a mound of black mould at his feet as he turned up the soil unconsciously his staff struck against something hard he raked it out of the vegetable mould and lo a cloven skull with an indian tomahawk buried deep in it lay before him the rust on the weapon showed the time that had elapsed since this death blow had been given it was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had taken place in this last foothold of the indian warriors  humph said tom walker as he gave the skull a kick to shake the dirt from it  let that skull alone said a gruff voice  tom lifted up his eyes and beheld a great black man seated directly opposite him on the stump of a tree he was exceedingly surprised having neither seen nor heard any one approach and he was still more perplexed on observing as well as the gathering gloom would permit that the stranger was neither negro nor indian it is true he was dressed in a rude half indian garb and had a red belt or sash swathed round his body but his face was neither black nor copper color but swarthy and dingy and begrimed with soot as if he had been accustomed to toil among fires and forges he had a shock of coarse black hair that stood out from his head in all directions and bore an axe on his shoulder  he scowled for a moment at tom with a pair of great red eyes  what are you doing in my grounds said the black man with a hoarse growling voice  your grounds said tom with a sneer no more your grounds than mine they belong to deacon peabody  deacon peabody be dd said the stranger as i flatter myself he will be if he does not look more to his own sins and less to his neighbors look yonder and see how deacon peabody is faring  tom looked in the direction that the stranger pointed and beheld one of the great trees fair and flourishing without but rotten at the core and saw that it had been nearly hewn through so that the first high wind was likely to blow it down on the bark of the tree was scored the name of deacon peabody he now looked round and found most of the tall trees marked with the names of some great men of the colony and all more or less scored by the axe the one on which he had been seated and which had evidently just been hewn down bore the name of crowninshield and he recollected a mighty rich man of that name who made a vulgar display of wealth which it was whispered he had acquired by buccaneering  hes just ready for burning said the black man with a growl of triumph you see i am likely to have a good stock of firewood for winter  but what right have you said tom to cut down deacon peabodys timber  the right of prior claim said the other this woodland belonged to me long before one of your whitefaced race put foot upon the soil  and pray who are you if i may be so bold said tom  oh i go by various names i am the wild huntsman in some countries the black miner in others in this neighborhood i am known by the name of the black woodsman i am he to whom the red men devoted this spot and now and then roasted a white man by way of sweetsmelling sacrifice since the red men have been exterminated by you white savages i amuse myself by presiding at the persecutions of quakers and anabaptists i am the great patron and prompter of slave dealers and the grand master of the salem witches  the upshot of all which is that if i mistake not said tom sturdily you are he commonly called old scratch  the same at your service replied the black man with a half civil nod  such was the opening of this interview according to the old story though it has almost too familiar an air to be credited one would think that to meet with such a singular personage in this wild lonely place would have shaken any mans nerves but tom was a hardminded fellow not easily daunted and he had lived so long with a termagant wife that he did not even fear the devil  it is said that after this commencement they had a long and earnest conversation together as tom returned homewards the black man told him of great sums of money which had been buried by kidd the pirate under the oak trees on the high ridge not far from the morass all these were under his command and protected by his power so that none could find them but such as propitiated his favor these he offered to place within tom walkers reach having conceived an especial kindness for him but they were to be had only on certain conditions what these conditions were may easily be surmised though tom never disclosed them publicly they must have been very hard for he required time to think of them and he was not a man to stick at trifles where money was in view when they had reached the edge of the swamp the stranger paused  what proof have i that all you have been telling me is true said tom  there is my signature said the black man pressing his finger on toms forehead so saying he turned off among the thickets of the swamp and seemed as tom said to go down down down into the earth until nothing but his head and shoulders could be seen and so on until he totally disappeared  when tom reached home he found the black print of a finger burnt as it were into his forehead which nothing could obliterate  the first news his wife had to tell him was the sudden death of absalom crowninshield the rich buccaneer it was announced in the papers with the usual flourish that a great man had fallen in israel  tom recollected the tree which his black friend had just hewn down and which was ready for burning let the freebooter roast said tom who cares he now felt convinced that all he had heard and seen was no illusion  he was not prone to let his wife into his confidence but as this was an uneasy secret he willingly shared it with her all her avarice was awakened at the mention of hidden gold and she urged her husband to comply with the black mans terms and secure what would make them wealthy for life however tom might have felt disposed to sell himself to the devil he was determined not to do so to oblige his wife so he flatly refused out of the mere spirit of contradiction many and bitter were the quarrels they had on the subject but the more she talked the more resolute was tom not to be damned to please her at length she determined to drive the bargain on her own account and if she succeeded to keep all the gain to herself  being of the same fearless temper as her husband she sat off for the old indian fort towards the close of a summers day she was many hours absent when she came back she was reserved and sullen in her replies she spoke something of a black man whom she had met about twilight hewing at the root of a tall tree he was sulky however and would not come to terms she was to go again with a propitiatory offering but what it was she forebore to say  the next evening she sat off again for the swamp with her apron heavily laden tom waited and waited for her but in vain midnight came but she did not make her appearance morning noon night returned but still she did not come tom now grew uneasy for her safety especially as he found she had carried off in her apron the silver tea pot and spoons and every portable article of value another night elapsed another morning came but no wife in a word she was ever heard of more  what was her real fate nobody knows in consequence of so many pretending to know it is one of those facts that have become confounded by a variety of historians some asserted that she lost her way among the tangled mazes of the swamp and sunk into some pit or slough others more uncharitable hinted that she had eloped with the household booty and made off to some other province while others assert that the tempter had decoyed her into a dismal quagmire on top of which her hat was found lying in confirmation of this it was said a great black man with an axe on his shoulder was seen late that very evening coming out of the swamp carrying a bundle tied in a check apron with an air of surly triumph  the most current and probable story however observes that tom walker grew so anxious about the fate of his wife and his property that he sat out at length to seek them both at the indian fort during a long summers afternoon he searched about the gloomy place but no wife was to be seen he called her name repeatedly but she was no where to be heard the bittern alone responded to his voice as he flew screaming by or the bullfrog croaked dolefully from a neighboring pool at length it is said just in the brown hour of twilight when the owls began to hoot and the bats to flit about his attention was attracted by the clamor of carrion crows that were hovering about a cypress tree he looked and beheld a bundle tied in a check apron and hanging in the branches of a tree with a great vulture perched hard by as if keeping watch upon it he leaped with joy for he recognized his wifes apron and supposed it to contain the household valuables  let us get hold of the property said he consolingly to himself and we will endeavor to do without the woman  as he scrambled up the tree the vulture spread its wide wings and sailed off screaming into the deep shadows of the forest tom seized the check apron but woful sight found nothing but a heart and liver tied up in it  such according to the most authentic old story was all that was to be found of toms wife she had probably attempted to deal with the black man as she had been accustomed to deal with her husband but though a female scold is generally considered a match for the devil yet in this instance she appears to have had the worst of it she must have died game however from the part that remained unconquered indeed it is said tom noticed many prints of cloven feet deeply stamped about the tree and several handfuls of hair that looked as if they had been plucked from the coarse black shock of the woodsman tom knew his wifes prowess by experience he shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the signs of a fierce clapperclawing egad said he to himself old scratch must have had a tough time of it  tom consoled himself for the loss of his property by the loss of his wife for he was a little of a philosopher he even felt something like gratitude towards the black woodsman who he considered had done him a kindness he sought therefore to cultivate a farther acquaintance with him but for some time without success the old black legs played shy for whatever people may think he is not always to be had for calling for he knows how to play his cards when pretty sure of his game  at length it is said when delay had whetted toms eagerness to the quick and prepared him to agree to any thing rather than not gain the promised treasure he met the black man one evening in his usual woodman dress with his axe on his shoulder sauntering along the edge of the swamp and humming a tune he affected to receive toms advance with great indifference made brief replies and went on humming his tune  by degrees however tom brought him to business and they began to haggle about the terms on which the former was to have the pirates treasure there was one condition which need not be mentioned being generally understood in all cases where the devil grants favors but there were others about which though of less importance he was inflexibly obstinate he insisted that the money found through his means should be employed in his service he proposed therefore that tom should employ it in the black traffic that is to say that he should fit out a slave ship this however tom resolutely refused he was bad enough in all conscience but the devil himself could not tempt him to turn slave dealer  finding tom so squeamish on this point he did not insist upon it but proposed instead that he should turn usurer the devil being extremely anxious for the increase of usurers looking upon them as his peculiar people  to this no objections were made for it was just to toms taste  you shall open a brokers shop in boston next month said the black man  ill do it tomorrow if you wish said tom walker  you shall lend money at two per cent a month  egad ill charge four replied tom walker  you shall extort bonds foreclose mortgages drive the merchant to bankruptcy  ill drive him to the dl cried tom walker eagerly  you are the usurer for my money said the black legs with delight when will you want the rhino  this very night  done said the devil  done said tom walkerso they shook hands and struck a bargain  a few days time saw tom walker seated behind his desk in a counting house in boston his reputation for a readymoneyed man who would lend money out for a good consideration soon spread abroad every body remembers the days of governor belcher when money was particularly scarce it was a time of paper credit the country had been deluged with government bills the famous land bank had been established there had been a rage for speculating the people had run mad with schemes for new settlements for building cities in the wilderness land jobbers went about with maps of grants and townships and eldorados lying nobody knew where but which every body was ready to purchase in a word the great speculating fever which breaks out every now and then in the country had raged to an alarming degree and body was dreaming of making sudden fortunes from nothing as usual the fever had subsided the dream had gone off and the imaginary fortunes with it the patients were left in doleful plight and the whole country resounded with the consequent cry of hard times  at this propitious time of public distress did tom walker set up as a usurer in boston his door was soon thronged by customers the needy and the adventurous the gambling speculator the dreaming land jobber the thriftless tradesman the merchant with cracked credit in short every one driven to raise money by desperate means and desperate sacrifices hurried to tom walker  thus tom was the universal friend of the needy and he acted like a friend in need that is to say he always exacted good pay and good security in proportion to the distress of the applicant was the hardness of his terms he accumulated bonds and mortgages gradually squeezed his customers closer and closer and sent them at length dry as a sponge from his door  in this way he made money hand over hand became a rich and mighty man and exalted his cocked hat upon change he built himself as usual a vast house out of ostentation but left the greater part of it unfinished and unfurnished out of parsimony he even set up a carriage in the fullness of his vainglory though he nearly starved the horses which drew it and as the ungreased wheels groaned and screeched on the axle trees you would have thought you heard the souls of the poor debtors he was squeezing  as tom waxed old however he grew thoughtful having secured the good things of this world he began to feel anxious about those of the next he thought with regret on the bargain he had made with his black friend and set his wits to work to cheat him out of the conditions he became therefore all of a sudden a violent churchgoer he prayed loudly and strenuously as if heaven were to be taken by force of lungs indeed one might always tell when he had sinned most during the week by the clamor of his sunday devotion the quiet christians who had been modestly and steadfastly travelling zionward were struck with selfreproach at seeing themselves so suddenly outstripped in their career by this newmade convert tom was as rigid in religious as in money matters he was a stern supervisor and censurer of his neighbors and seemed to think every sin entered up to their account became a credit on his own side of the page he even talked of the expediency of reviving the persecution of quakers and anabaptists in a word toms zeal became as notorious as his riches  still in spite of all this strenuous attention to forms tom had a lurking dread that the devil after all would have his due that he might not be taken unawares therefore it is said he always carried a small bible in his coat pocket he had also a great folio bible on his countinghouse desk and would frequently be found reading it when people called on business on such occasions he would lay his green spectacles on the book to mark the place while he turned round to drive some usurious bargain  some say that tom grew a little crackbrained in his old days and that fancying his end approaching he had his horse new shod saddled and bridled and buried with his feet uppermost because he supposed that at the last day the world would be turned upside down in which case he should find his horse standing ready for mounting and he was determined at the worst to give his old friend a run for it this however is probably a mere old wives fable if he really did take such a precaution it was totally superfluous at least so says the authentic old legend which closes his story in the following manner  on one hot afternoon in the dog days just as a terrible black thundergust was coming up tom sat in his countinghouse in his white linen cap and india silk morninggown he was on the point of foreclosing a mortgage by which he would complete the ruin of an unlucky land speculator for whom he had professed the greatest friendship the poor land jobber begged him to grant a few months indulgence tom had grown testy and irritated and refused another day  my family will be ruined and brought upon the parish said the land jobber  charity begins at home replied tom i must take care of myself in these hard times  you have made so much money out of me said the speculator  tom lost his patience and his pietythe devil take me said he if i have made a farthing  just then there were three loud knocks at the street door he stepped out to see who was there a black man was holding a black horse which neighed and stamped with impatience  tom youre come for said the black fellow gruffly tom shrunk back but too late he had left his little bible at the bottom of his coat pocket and his big bible on the desk buried under the mortgage he was about to foreclose never was sinner taken more unawares the black man whisked him like a child astride the horse and away he galloped in the midst of a thunderstorm the clerks stuck their pens behind their ears and stared after him from the windows away went tom walker dashing down the street his white cap bobbing up and down his morninggown fluttering in the wind and his steed striking fire out of the pavement at every bound when the clerks turned to look for the black man he had disappeared  tom walker never returned to foreclose the mortgage a countryman who lived on the borders of the swamp reported that in the height of the thundergust he had heard a great clattering of hoofs and a howling along the road and that when he ran to the window he just caught sight of a figure such as i have described on a horse that galloped like mad across the fields over the hills and down into the black hemlock swamp towards the old indian fort and that shortly after a thunderbolt fell in that direction which seemed to set the whole forest in a blaze  the good people of boston shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders but had been so much accustomed to witches and goblins and tricks of the devil in all kinds of shapes from the first settlement of the colony that they were not so much horrorstruck as might have been expected trustees were appointed to take charge of toms effects there was nothing however to administer upon on searching his coffers all his bonds and mortgages were found reduced to cinders in place of gold and silver his iron chest was filled with chips and shavings two skeletons lay in his stable instead of his halfstarved horses and the very next day his great house took fire and was burnt to the ground  such was the end of tom walker and his illgotten wealth let all griping moneybrokers lay this story to heart the truth of it is not to be doubted the very hole under the oak trees from whence he dug kidds money is to be seen to this day and the neighboring swamp and old indian fort is often haunted in stormy nights by a figure on horseback in a morninggown and white cap which is doubtless the troubled spirit of the usurer in fact the story has resolved itself into a proverb and is the origin of that popular saying prevalent throughout newengland of the devil and tom walker  such as nearly as i can recollect was the tenor of the tale told by the cape cod whaler there were divers trivial particulars which i have omitted and which wiled away the morning very pleasantly until the time of tide favorable for fishing being passed it was proposed that we should go to land and refresh ourselves under the trees until the noontide heat should have abated  we accordingly landed on a delectable part of the island of mannahatta in that shady and embowered tract formerly under dominion of the ancient family of the hardenbrooks it was a spot well known to me in the course of the aquatic expeditions of my boyhood not far from where we landed was an old dutch family vault in the side of a bank which had been an object of great awe and fable among my schoolboy associates there were several mouldering coffins within but what gave it a fearful interest with us was its being connected in our minds with the pirate wreck which lay among the rocks of hell gate there were also stories of smuggling connected with it particularly during a time that this retired spot was owned by a noted burgher called ready money prevost a man of whom it was whispered that he had many and mysterious dealings with parts beyond seas all these things however had been jumbled together in our minds in that vague way in which such things are mingled up in the tales of boyhood  while i was musing upon these matters my companions had spread a repast from the contents of our wellstored pannier and we solaced ourselves during the warm sunny hours of midday under the shade of a broad chestnut on the cool grassy carpet that swept down to the waters edge while lolling on the grass i summoned up the dusky recollections of my boyhood respecting this place and repeated them like the imperfectly remembered traces of a dream for the entertainment of my companions when i had finished a worthy old burgher john josse vandermoere the same who once related to me the adventures of dolph heyliger broke silence and observed that he recollected a story about moneydigging which occurred in this very neighborhood as we knew him to be one of the most authentic narrators of the province we begged him to let us have the particulars and accordingly while we refreshed ourselves with a clean long pipe of blase moores tobacco the authentic john josse vandermoere related the following tale     wolfert webber or golden dreams   in the year of grace one thousand seven hundred andblankfor i do not remember the precise date however it was somewhere in the early part of the last century there lived in the ancient city of the manhattoes a worthy burgher wolfert webber by name he was descended from old cobus webber of the brille in holland one of the original settlers famous for introducing the cultivation of cabbages and who came over to the province during the protectorship of oloffe van kortlandt otherwise called the dreamer the field in which cobus webber first planted himself and his cabbages had remained ever since in the family who continued in the same line of husbandry with that praiseworthy perseverance for which our dutch burghers are noted the whole family genius during several generations was devoted to the study and development of this one noble vegetable and to this concentration of intellect may doubtless be ascribed the prodigious size and renown to which the webber cabbages attained  the webber dynasty continued in uninterrupted succession and never did a line give more unquestionable proofs of legitimacy the eldest son succeeded to the looks as well as the territory of his sire and had the portraits of this line of tranquil potentates been taken they would have presented a row of heads marvellously resembling in shape and magnitude the vegetables over which they reigned  the seat of government continued unchanged in the family mansiona dutchbuilt house with a front or rather gableend of yellow brick tapering to a point with the customary iron weathercock at the top every thing about the building bore the air of longsettled ease and security flights of martins peopled the little coops nailed against the walls and swallows built their nests under the eaves and every one knows that these houseloving birds bring good luck to the dwelling where they take up their abode in a bright sunny morning in early summer it was delectable to hear their cheerful notes as they sported about in the pure sweet air chirping forth as it were the greatness and prosperity of the webbers  thus quietly and comfortably did this excellent family vegetate under the shade of a mighty buttonwood tree which by little and little grew so great as entirely to overshadow their palace the city gradually spread its suburbs round their domain houses sprung up to interrupt their prospects the rural lanes in the vicinity began to grow into the bustle and populousness of streets in short with all the habits of rustic life they began to find themselves the inhabitants of a city  still however they maintained their hereditary character and hereditary possessions with all the tenacity of petty german princes in the midst of the empire wolfert was the last of the line and succeeded to the patriarchal bench at the door under the family tree and swayed the sceptre of his fathers a kind of rural potentate in the midst of a metropolis  to share the cares and sweets of sovereignty he had taken unto himself a helpmate one of that excellent kind called stirring women that is to say she was one of those notable little housewives who are always busy when there is nothing to do her activity however took one particular direction her whole life seemed devoted to intense knitting whether at home or abroad walking or sitting her needles were continually in motion and it is even affirmed that by her unwearied industry she very nearly supplied her household with stockings throughout the year this worthy couple were blessed with one daughter who was brought up with great tenderness and care uncommon pains had been taken with her education so that she could stitch in every variety of way make all kinds of pickles and preserves and mark her own name on a sampler the influence of her taste was seen also in the family garden where the ornamental began to mingle with the useful whole rows of fiery marigolds and splendid hollyhocks bordered the cabbagebeds and gigantic sunflowers lolled their broad jolly faces over the fences seeming to ogle most affectionately the passersby  thus reigned and vegetated wolfert webber over his paternal acres peaceably and contentedly not but that like all other sovereigns he had his occasional cares and vexations the growth of his native city sometimes caused him annoyance his little territory gradually became hemmed in by streets and houses which intercepted air and sunshine he was now and then subject to the irruptions of the border population that infest the streets of a metropolis who would sometimes make midnight forays into his dominions and carry off captive whole platoons of his noblest subjects vagrant swine would make a descent too now and then when the gate was left open and lay all waste before them and mischievous urchins would often decapitate the illustrious sunflowers the glory of the garden as they lolled their heads so fondly over the walls still all these were petty grievances which might now and then ruffle the surface of his mind as a summer breeze will ruffle the surface of a millpond but they could not disturb the deepseated quiet of his soul he would seize a trusty staff that stood behind the door issue suddenly out and anoint the back of the aggressor whether pig or urchin and then return within doors marvellously refreshed and tranquillized  the chief cause of anxiety to honest wolfert however was the growing prosperity of the city the expenses of living doubled and trebled but he could not double and treble the magnitude of his cabbages and the number of competitors prevented the increase of price thus therefore while every one around him grew richer wolfert grew poorer and he could not for the life of him perceive how the evil was to be remedied  this growing care which increased from day to day had its gradual effect upon our worthy burgher insomuch that it at length implanted two or three wrinkles on his brow things unknown before in the family of the webbers and it seemed to pinch up the corners of his cocked hat into an expression of anxiety totally opposite to the tranquil broadbrimmed lowcrowned beavers of his illustrious progenitors  perhaps even this would not have materially disturbed the serenity of his mind had he had only himself and his wife to care for but there was his daughter gradually growing to maturity and all the world knows when daughters begin to ripen no fruit or flower requires so much looking after i have no talent at describing female charms else fain would i depict the progress of this little dutch beauty how her blue eyes grew deeper and deeper and her cherry lips redder and redder and how she ripened and ripened and rounded and rounded in the opening breath of sixteen summers until in her seventeenth spring she seemed ready to burst out of her bodice like a halfblown rosebud  ah welladay could i but show her as she was then tricked out on a sunday morning in the hereditary finery of the old dutch clothespress of which her mother had confided to her the key the wedding dress of her grandmother modernized for use with sundry ornaments handed down as heirlooms in the family her pale brown hair smoothed with buttermilk in flat waving lines on each side of her fair forehead the chain of yellow virgin gold that encircled her neck the little cross that just rested at the entrance of a soft valley of happiness as if it would sanctify the place thebut poohit is not for an old man like me to be prosing about female beauty suffice it to say amy had attained her seventeenth year long since had her sampler exhibited hearts in couples desperately transfixed with arrows and true lovers knots worked in deep blue silk and it was evident she began to languish for some more interesting occupation than the rearing of sunflowers or pickling of cucumbers  at this critical period of female existence when the heart within a damsels bosom like its emblem the miniature which hangs without is apt to be engrossed by a single image a new visitor began to make his appearance under the roof of wolfert webber this was dirk waldron the only son of a poor widow but who could boast of more fathers than any lad in the province for his mother had had four husbands and this only child so that though born in her last wedlock he might fairly claim to be the tardy fruit of a long course of cultivation this son of four fathers united the merits and the vigor of his sires if he had not a great family before him he seemed likely to have a great one after him for you had only to look at the fresh gamesome youth to see that he was formed to be the founder of a mighty race  this youngster gradually became an intimate visitor of the family he talked little but he sat long he filled the fathers pipe when it was empty gathered up the mothers knittingneedle or ball of worsted when it fell to the ground stroked the sleek coat of the tortoiseshell cat and replenished the teapot for the daughter from the bright copper kettle that sung before the fire all these quiet little offices may seem of trifling import but when true love is translated into low dutch it is in this way that it eloquently expresses itself they were not lost upon the webber family the winning youngster found marvellous favor in the eyes of the mother the tortoiseshell cat albeit the most staid and demure of her kind gave indubitable signs of approbation of his visits the teakettle seemed to sing out a cheering note of welcome at his approach and if the sly glances of the daughter might be rightly read as she sat bridling and dimpling and sewing by her mothers side she was not a wit behind dame webber or grimalkin or the teakettle in goodwill  wolfert alone saw nothing of what was going on profoundly wrapt up in meditation on the growth of the city and his cabbages he sat looking in the fire and puffing his pipe in silence one night however as the gentle amy according to custom lighted her lover to the outer door and he according to custom took his parting salute the smack resounded so vigorously through the long silent entry as to startle even the dull ear of wolfert he was slowly roused to a new source of anxiety it had never entered into his head that this mere child who as it seemed but the other day had been climbing about his knees and playing with dolls and babyhouses could all at once be thinking of love and matrimony he rubbed his eyes examined into the fact and really found that while he had been dreaming of other matters she had actually grown into a woman and what was more had fallen in love here were new cares for poor wolfert he was a kind father but he was a prudent man the young man was a very stirring lad but then he had neither money or land wolferts ideas all ran in one channel and he saw no alternative in case of a marriage but to portion off the young couple with a corner of his cabbage garden the whole of which was barely sufficient for the support of his family  like a prudent father therefore he determined to nip this passion in the bud and forbade the youngster the house though sorely did it go against his fatherly heart and many a silent tear did it cause in the bright eye of his daughter she showed herself however a pattern of filial piety and obedience she never pouted and sulked she never flew in the face of parental authority she never fell into a passion or fell into hysterics as many romantic novelread young ladies would do not she indeed she was none such heroical rebellious trumpery i warrant ye on the contrary she acquiesced like an obedient daughter shut the streetdoor in her lovers face and if ever she did grant him an interview it was either out of the kitchen window or over the garden fence  wolfert was deeply cogitating these things in his mind and his brow wrinkled with unusual care as he wended his way one saturday afternoon to a rural inn about two miles from the city it was a favorite resort of the dutch part of the community from being always held by a dutch line of landlords and retaining an air and relish of the good old times it was a dutchbuilt house that had probably been a country seat of some opulent burgher in the early time of the settlement it stood near a point of land called corlears hook which stretches out into the sound and against which the tide at its flux and reflux sets with extraordinary rapidity the venerable and somewhat crazy mansion was distinguished from afar by a grove of elms and sycamores that seemed to wave a hospitable invitation while a few weeping willows with their dank drooping foliage resembling falling waters gave an idea of coolness that rendered it an attractive spot during the heats of summer  here therefore as i said resorted many of the old inhabitants of the manhattoes where while some played at the shuffleboard and quoits and ninepins others smoked a deliberate pipe and talked over public affairs  it was on a blustering autumnal afternoon that wolfert made his visit to the inn the grove of elms and willows was stripped of its leaves which whirled in rustling eddies about the fields  the ninepin alley was deserted for the premature chilliness of the day had driven the company within doors as it was saturday afternoon the habitual club was in session composed principally of regular dutch burghers though mingled occasionally with persons of various character and country as is natural in a place of such motley population  beside the fireplace and in a huge leatherbottomed armchair sat the dictator of this little world the venerable rem or as it was pronounced ramm rapelye  he was a man of walloon race and illustrious for the antiquity of his line his great grandmother having been the first white child born in the province but he was still more illustrious for his wealth and dignity he had long filled the noble office of alderman and was a man to whom the governor himself took off his hat he had maintained possession of the leathernbottomed chair from time immemorial and had gradually waxed in bulk as he sat in his seat of government until in the course of years he filled its whole magnitude his word was decisive with his subjects for he was so rich a man that he was never expected to support any opinion by argument the landlord waited on him with peculiar officiousness not that he paid better than his neighbors but then the coin of a rich man seems always to be so much more acceptable the landlord had always a pleasant word and a joke to insinuate in the ear of the august ramm it is true ramm never laughed and indeed maintained a mastifflike gravity and even surliness of aspect yet he now and then rewarded mine host with a token of approbation which though nothing more nor less than a kind of grunt yet delighted the landlord more than a broad laugh from a poorer man  this will be a rough night for the moneydiggers said mine host as a gust of wind howled round the house and rattled at the windows  what are they at their works again said an english halfpay captain with one eye who was a frequent attendant at the inn  aye are they said the landlord and well may they be theyve had luck of late they say a great pot of money has been dug up in the field just behind stuyvesants orchard folks think it must have been buried there in old times by peter stuyvesant the dutch governor  fudge said the oneeyed man of war as he added a small portion of water to a bottom of brandy  well you may believe or not as you please said mine host somewhat nettled but every body knows that the old governor buried a great deal of his money at the time of the dutch troubles when the english redcoats seized on the province they say too the old gentleman walks aye and in the very same dress that he wears in the picture which hangs up in the family house  fudge said the halfpay officer  fudge if you pleasebut didnt corney van zandt see him at midnight stalking about in the meadow with his wooden leg and a drawn sword in his hand that flashed like fire and what can he be walking for but because people have been troubling the place where he buried his money in old times  here the landlord was interrupted by several guttural sounds from ramm rapelye betokening that he was laboring with the unusual production of an idea as he was too great a man to be slighted by a prudent publican mine host respectfully paused until he should deliver himself the corpulent frame of this mighty burgher now gave all the symptoms of a volcanic mountain on the point of an eruption first there was a certain heaving of the abdomen not unlike an earthquake then was emitted a cloud of tobacco smoke from that crater his mouth then there was a kind of rattle in the throat as if the idea were working its way up through a region of phlegm then there were several disjointed members of a sentence thrown out ending in a cough at length his voice forced its way in the slow but absolute tone of a man who feels the weight of his purse if not of his ideas every portion of his speech being marked by a testy puff of tobacco smoke  who talks of old peter stuyvesants walkingpuffhave people no respect for personspuffpuffpeter stuyvesant knew better what to do with his money than to bury itpuffi know the stuyvesant familypuffevery one of thempuffnot a more respectable family in the provincepuffold standerspuffwarm householderspuffnone of your upstartspuffpuffpuffdont talk to me of peter stuyvesants walkingpuffpuffpuffpuff  here the redoubtable ramm contracted his brow clasped up his mouth till it wrinkled at each corner and redoubled his smoking with such vehemence that the cloudly volumes soon wreathed round his head as the smoke envelopes the awful summit of mount etna  a general silence followed the sudden rebuke of this very rich man the subject however was too interesting to be readily abandoned the conversation soon broke forth again from the lips of peechy prauw van hook the chronicler of the club one of those narrative old men who seem to grow incontinent of words as they grow old until their talk flows from them almost involuntarily  peechy who could at any time tell as many stories in an evening as his hearers could digest in a month now resumed the conversation by affirming that to his knowledge money had at different times been dug up in various parts of the island the lucky persons who had discovered them had always dreamt of them three times beforehand and what was worthy of remark these treasures had never been found but by some descendant of the good old dutch families which clearly proved that they had been buried by dutchmen in the olden time  fiddlestick with your dutchmen cried the halfpay officer the dutch had nothing to do with them they were all buried by kidd the pirate and his crew  here a keynote was touched that roused the whole company the name of captain kidd was like a talisman in those times and was associated with a thousand marvellous stories  the halfpay officer was a man of great weight among the peaceable members of the club by reason of his military character and of the gunpowder scenes which by his own account he had witnessed  the golden stories of kidd however were resolutely rivalled by the tales of peechy prauw who rather than suffer his dutch progenitors to be eclipsed by a foreign freebooter enriched every spot in the neighborhood with the hidden wealth of peter stuyvesant and his contemporaries  not a word of this conversation was lost upon wolfert webber he returned pensively home full of magnificent ideas of buried riches the soil of his native island seemed to be turned into golddust and every field teemed with treasure his head almost reeled at the thought how often he must have heedlessly rambled over places where countless sums lay scarcely covered by the turf beneath his feet his mind was in a vertigo with this whirl of new ideas as he came in sight of the venerable mansion of his forefathers and the little realm where the webbers had so long and so contentedly flourished his gorge rose at the narrowness of his destiny  unlucky wolfert exclaimed he others can go to bed and dream themselves into whole mines of wealth they have but to seize a spade in the morning and turn up doubloons like potatoes but thou must dream of hardship and rise to povertymust dig thy field from years end to years end andand yet raise nothing but cabbages  wolfert webber went to bed with a heavy heart and it was long before the golden visions that disturbed his brain permitted him to sink into repose the same visions however extended into his sleeping thoughts and assumed a more definite form he dreamt that he had discovered an immense treasure in the centre of his garden at every stroke of the spade he laid bare a golden ingot diamond crosses sparkled out of the dust bags of money turned up their bellies corpulent with pieces of eight or venerable doubloons and chests wedged close with moidores ducats and pistareens yawned before his ravished eyes and vomited forth their glittering contents  wolfert awoke a poorer man than ever he had no heart to go about his daily concerns which appeared so paltry and profitless but sat all day long in the chimneycorner picturing to himself ingots and heaps of gold in the fire the next night his dream was repeated he was again in his garden digging and laying open stores of hidden wealth there was something very singular in this repetition he passed another day of reverie and though it was cleaningday and the house as usual in dutch households completely topsyturvy yet he sat unmoved amidst the general uproar  the third night he went to bed with a palpitating heart he put on his red nightcap wrong side outwards for good luck it was deep midnight before his anxious mind could settle itself into sleep again the golden dream was repeated and again he saw his garden teeming with ingots and moneybags  wolfert rose the next morning in complete bewilderment a dream three times repeated was never known to lie and if so his fortune was made  in his agitation he put on his waistcoat with the hind part before and this was a corroboration of good luck he no longer doubted that a huge store of money lay buried somewhere in his cabbagefield coyly waiting to be sought for and he half repined at having so long been scratching about the surface of the soil instead of digging to the centre  he took his seat at the breakfasttable full of these speculations asked his daughter to put a lump of gold in to his tea and on handing his wife a plate of slapjacks begging her to help herself to a doubloon  his grand care now was how to secure this immense treasure without it being known instead of working regularly in his grounds in the daytime he now stole from his bed at night and with spade and pickaxe went to work to rip up and dig about his paternal acres from one end to the other in a little time the whole garden which had presented such a goodly and regular appearance with its phalanx of cabbages like a vegetable army in battle array was reduced to a scene of devastation while the relentless wolfert with nightcap on head and lantern and spade in hand stalked through the slaughtered ranks the destroying angel of his own vegetable world  every morning bore testimony to the ravages of the preceding night in cabbages of all ages and conditions from the tender sprout to the fullgrown head piteously rooted from their quiet beds like worthless weeds and left to wither in the sunshine it was in vain wolferts wife remonstrated it was in vain his darling daughter wept over the destruction of some favorite marygold thou shalt have gold of another guesssort he would cry chucking her under the chin thou shalt have a string of crooked ducats for thy weddingnecklace my child his family began really to fear that the poor mans wits were diseased he muttered in his sleep at night of mines of wealth of pearls and diamonds and bars of gold in the daytime he was moody and abstracted and walked about as if in a trance dame webber held frequent councils with all the old women of the neighborhood not omitting the parish dominie scarce an hour in the day but a knot of them might be seen wagging their white caps together round her door while the poor woman made some piteous recital the daughter too was fain to seek for more frequent consolation from the stolen interviews of her favored swain dirk waldron the delectable little dutch songs with which she used to dulcify the house grew less and less frequent and she would forget her sewing and look wistfully in her fathers face as he sat pondering by the fireside  wolfert caught her eye one day fixed on him thus anxiously and for a moment was roused from his golden reveriescheer up my girl said he exultingly why dost thou droopthou shalt hold up thy head one day with theand the schenaerhorns the van hornes and the van damsthe patroon himself shall be glad to get thee for his son  amy shook her head at this vainglorious boast and was more than ever in doubt of the soundness of the good mans intellect  in the meantime wolfert went on digging but the field was extensive and as his dream had indicated no precise spot he had to dig at random the winter set in before onetenth of the scene of promise had been explored the ground became too frozen and the nights too cold for the labors of the spade no sooner however did the returning warmth of spring loosen the soil and the small frogs begin to pipe in the meadows but wolfert resumed his labors with renovated zeal still however the hours of industry were reversed instead of working cheerily all day planting and setting out his vegetables he remained thoughtfully idle until the shades of night summoned him to his secret labors in this way he continued to dig from night to night and week to week and month to month but not a stiver did he find on the contrary the more he digged the poorer he grew the rich soil of his garden was digged away and the sand and gravel from beneath were thrown to the surface until the whole field presented an aspect of sandy barrenness  in the meantime the seasons gradually rolled on the little frogs that had piped in the meadows in early spring croaked as bullfrogs in the brooks during the summer heats and then sunk into silence the peach tree budded blossomed and bore its fruit the swallows and martins came twittered about the roof built their nests reared their young held their congress along the eaves and then winged their flight in search of another spring the caterpillar spun its windingsheet dangled in it from the great buttonwood tree that shaded the house turned into a moth fluttered with the last sunshine of summer and disappeared and finally the leaves of the buttonwood tree turned yellow then brown then rustled one by one to the ground and whirling about in little eddies of wind and dust whispered that winter was at hand  wolfert gradually awoke from his dream of wealth as the year declined he had reared no crop to supply the wants of his household during the sterility of winter the season was long and severe and for the first time the family was really straightened in its comforts by degrees a revulsion of thought took place in wolferts mind common to those whose golden dreams have been disturbed by pinching realities the idea gradually stole upon him that he should come to want he already considered himself one of the most unfortunate men in the province having lost such an incalculable amount of undiscovered treasure and now when thousands of pounds had eluded his search to be perplexed for shillings and pence was cruel in the extreme  haggard care gathered about his brow he went about with a moneyseeking air his eyes bent downwards into the dust and carrying his hands in his pockets as men are apt to do when they have nothing else to put into them he could not even pass the city almshouse without giving it a rueful glance as if destined to be his future abode  the strangeness of his conduct and of his looks occasioned much speculation and remark for a long time he was suspected of being crazy and then every body pitied him at length it began to be suspected that he was poor and then every body avoided him  the rich old burghers of his acquaintance met him outside of the door when he called entertained him hospitably on the threshold pressed him warmly by the hand on parting shook their heads as he walked away with the kindhearted expression of poor wolfert and turned a corner nimbly if by chance they saw him approaching as they walked the streets even the barber and cobbler of the neighborhood and a tattered tailor in an alley hard by three of the poorest and merriest rogues in the world eyed him with that abundant sympathy which usually attends a lack of means and there is not a doubt but their pockets would have been at his command only that they happened to be empty  thus every body deserted the webber mansion as if poverty were contagious like the plague every body but honest dirk waldron who still kept up his stolen visits to the daughter and indeed seemed to wax more affectionate as the fortunes of his mistress were on the wane  many months had elapsed since wolfert had frequented his old resort the rural inn he was taking a long lonely walk one saturday afternoon musing over his wants and disappointments when his feet took instinctively their wonted direction and on awaking out of a reverie he found himself before the door of the inn for some moments he hesitated whether to enter but his heart yearned for companionship and where can a ruined man find better companionship than at a tavern where there is neither sober example nor sober advice to put him out of countenance  wolfert found several of the old frequenters of the tavern at their usual posts and seated in their usual places but one was missing the great ramm rapelye who for many years had filled the chair of state his place was supplied by a stranger who seemed however completely at home in the chair and the tavern he was rather undersize but deepchested square and muscular his broad shoulders double joints and bowknees gave tokens of prodigious strength his face was dark and weatherbeaten a deep scar as if from the slash of a cutlass had almost divided his nose and made a gash in his upper lip through which his teeth shone like a bulldogs a mass of iron gray hair gave a grizzly finish to his hardfavored visage his dress was of an amphibious character he wore an old hat edged with tarnished lace and cocked in martial style on one side of his head a rusty blue military coat with brass buttons and a wide pair of short petticoat trousers or rather breeches for they were gathered up at the knees he ordered every body about him with an authoritative air talked in a brattling voice that sounded like the crackling of thorns under a pot damned the landlord and servants with perfect impunity and was waited upon with greater obsequiousness than had ever been shown to the mighty ramm himself  wolferts curiosity was awakened to know who and what was this stranger who had thus usurped absolute sway in this ancient domain he could get nothing however but vague information peechy prauw took him aside into a remote corner of the hall and there in an undervoice and with great caution imparted to him all that he knew on the subject the inn had been aroused several months before on a dark stormy night by repeated long shouts that seemed like the howlings of a wolf they came from the waterside and at length were distinguished to be hailing the house in the seafaring manner houseahoy the landlord turned out with his headwaiter tapster hostler and errand boythat is to say with his old negro cuff on approaching the place from whence the voice proceeded they found this amphibiouslooking personage at the waters edge quite alone and seated on a great oaken seachest how he came there whether he had been set on shore from some boat or had floated to land on his chest nobody could tell for he did not seem disposed to answer questions and there was something in his looks and manners that put a stop to all questioning suffice it to say he took possession of a corner room of the inn to which his chest was removed with great difficulty here he had remained ever since keeping about the inn and its vicinity sometimes it is true he disappeared for one two or three days at a time going and returning without giving any notice or account of his movements he always appeared to have plenty of money though often of very strange outlandish coinage and he regularly paid his bill every evening before turning in  he had fitted up his room to his own fancy having slung a hammock from the ceiling instead of a bed and decorated the walls with rusty pistols and cutlasses of foreign workmanship a great part of his time was passed in this room seated by the window which commanded a wide view of the sound a short oldfashioned pipe in his mouth a glass of rum toddy at his elbow and a pocket telescope in his hand with which he reconnoitred every boat that moved upon the water large squarerigged vessels seemed to excite but little attention but the moment he descried any thing with a shoulderofmutton sail or that a barge or yawl or jolly boat hove in sight up went the telescope and he examined it with the most scrupulous attention  all this might have passed without much notice for in those times the province was so much the resort of adventurers of all characters and climes that any oddity in dress or behavior attracted but little attention but in a little while this strange sea monster thus strangely cast up on dry land began to encroach upon the longestablished customs and customers of the place to interfere in a dictatorial manner in the affairs of the ninepin alley and the barroom until in the end he usurped an absolute command over the little inn it was in vain to attempt to withstand his authority he was not exactly quarrelsome but boisterous and peremptory like one accustomed to tyrannize on a quarter deck and there was a daredevil air about every thing he said and did that inspired a wariness in all bystanders even the halfpay officer so long the hero of the club was soon silenced by him and the quiet burghers stared with wonder at seeing their inflammable man of war so readily and quietly extinguished  and then the tales that he would tell were enough to make a peaceable mans hair stand on end there was not a sea fight or marauding or freebooting adventure that had happened within the last twenty years but he seemed perfectly versed in it he delighted to talk of the exploits of the buccaneers in the westindies and on the spanish main how his eyes would glisten as he described the waylaying of treasure ships the desperate fights yard arm and yard armbroadside and broad sidethe boarding and capturing of large spanish galleons with what chuckling relish would he describe the descent upon some rich spanish colony the rifling of a church the sacking of a convent you would have thought you heard some gormandizer dilating upon the roasting a savory goose at michaelmas as he described the roasting of some spanish don to make him discover his treasurea detail given with a minuteness that made every rich old burgher present turn uncomfortably in his chair all this would be told with infinite glee as if he considered it an excellent joke and then he would give such a tyrannical leer in the face of his next neighbor that the poor man would be fain to laugh out of sheer faintheartedness if any one however pretended to contradict him in any of his stories he was on fire in an instant his very cocked hat assumed a momentary fierceness and seemed to resent the contradictionhow the devil should you know as well as i i tell you it was as i say and he would at the same time let slip a broadside of thundering oaths and tremendous sea phrases such as had never been heard before within those peaceful walls  indeed the worthy burghers began to surmise that he knew more of these stories than mere hearsay day after day their conjectures concerning him grew more and more wild and fearful the strangeness of his manners the mystery that surrounded him all made him something incomprehensible in their eyes he was a kind of monster of the deep to themhe was a mermanhe was behemothhe was leviathanin short they knew not what he was  the domineering spirit of this boisterous sea urchin at length grew quite intolerable he was no respecter of persons he contradicted the richest burghers without hesitation he took possession of the sacred elbow chair which time out of mind had been the seat of sovereignty of the illustrious ramm rapelye nay he even went so far in one of his rough jocular moods as to slap that mighty burgher on the back drink his toddy and wink in his face a thing scarcely to be believed from this time ramm rapelye appeared no more at the inn his example was followed by several of the most eminent customers who were too rich to tolerate being bullied out of their opinions or being obliged to laugh at another mans jokes the landlord was almost in despair but he knew not how to get rid of this sea monster and his seachest which seemed to have grown like fixtures or excrescences on his establishment  such was the account whispered cautiously in wolferts ear by the narrator peechy prauw as he held him by the button in a corner of the hall casting a wary glance now and then towards the door of the barroom lest he should be overheard by the terrible hero of his tale  wolfert took his seat in a remote part of the room in silence impressed with profound awe of this unknown so versed in freebooting history it was to him a wonderful instance of the revolutions of mighty empires to find the venerable ramm rapelye thus ousted from the throne a rugged tarpaulin dictating from his elbow chair hectoring the patriarchs and filling this tranquil little realm with brawl and bravado  the stranger was on this evening in a more than usually communicative mood and was narrating a number of astounding stories of plunderings and burnings upon the high seas he dwelt upon them with peculiar relish heightening the frightful particulars in proportion to their effect on his peaceful auditors he gave a long swaggering detail of the capture of a spanish merchantman she was laying becalmed during a long summers day just off from an island which was one of the lurking places of the pirates they had reconnoitred her with their spyglasses from the shore and ascertained her character and force at night a picked crew of daring fellows set off for her in a whale boat they approached with muffled oars as she lay rocking idly with the undulations of the sea and her sails flapping against the masts they were close under her stern before the guard on deck was aware of their approach the alarm was given the pirates threw hand grenades on deck and sprang up the main chains sword in hand  the crew flew to arms but in great confusion some were shot down others took refuge in the tops others were driven overboard and drowned while others fought hand to hand from the main deck to the quarter deck disputing gallantly every inch of ground there were three spanish gentlemen on board with their ladies who made the most desperate resistance they defended the companionway cut down several of their assailants and fought like very devils for they were maddened by the shrieks of the ladies from the cabin one of the dons was old and soon despatched the other two kept their ground vigorously even though the captain of the pirates was among their assailants just then there was a shout of victory from the main deck the ship is ours cried the pirates  one of the dons immediately dropped his sword and surrendered the other who was a hotheaded youngster and just married gave the captain a slash in the face that laid all open the captain just made out to articulate the words no quarter  and what did they do with their prisoners said peechy prauw eagerly  threw them all overboard said the merman  a dead pause followed this reply peechy prauw shrunk quietly back like a man who had unwarily stolen upon the lair of a sleeping lion the honest burghers cast fearful glances at the deep scar slashed across the visage of the stranger and moved their chairs a little farther off the seaman however smoked on without moving a muscle as though he either did not perceive or did not regard the unfavorable effect he had produced upon his hearers  the halfpay officer was the first to break the silence for he was continually tempted to make ineffectual head against this tyrant of the seas and to regain his lost consequence in the eyes of his ancient companions he now tried to match the gunpowder tales of the stranger by others equally tremendous kidd as usual was his hero concerning whom he had picked up many of the floating traditions of the province the seaman had always evinced a settled pique against the redfaced warrior on this occasion he listened with peculiar impatience he sat with one arm akimbo the other elbow on a table the hand holding on to the small pipe he was pettishly puffing his legs crossed drumming with one foot on the ground and casting every now and then the side glance of a basilisk at the prosing captain at length the latter spoke of kidds having ascended the hudson with some of his crew to land his plunder in secrecy  kidd up the hudson burst forth the seaman with a tremendous oath kidd never was up the hudson  i tell you he was said the other aye and they say he buried a quantity of treasure on the little flat that runs out into the river called the devils dans kammer  the devils dans kammer in your teeth cried the seaman i tell you kidd never was up the hudsonwhat the plague do you know of kidd and his haunts  what do i know echoed the halfpay officer why i was in london at the time of his trial aye and i had the pleasure of seeing him hanged at execution dock  then sir let me tell you that you saw as pretty a fellow hanged as ever trod shoe leather aye putting his face nearer to that of the officer and there was many a coward looked on that might much better have swung in his stead  the halfpay officer was silenced but the indignation thus pent up in his bosom glowed with intense vehemence in his single eye which kindled like a coal  peechy prauw who never could remain silent now took up the word and in a pacifying tone observed that the gentleman certainly was in the right kidd never did bury money up the hudson nor indeed in any of those parts though many affirm the fact it was bradish and others of the buccaneers who had buried money some said in turtle bay others on longisland others in the neighborhood of hell gate indeed added he i recollect an adventure of mud sam the negro fisherman many years ago which some think had something to do with the buccaneers as we are all friends here and as it will go no farther ill tell it to you  upon a dark night many years ago as sam was returning from fishing in hell gate  here the story was nipped in the bud by a sudden movement from the unknown who laying his iron fist on the table knuckles downward with a quiet force that indented the very boards and looking grimly over his shoulder with the grin of an angry bear hearkee neighbor said he with significant nodding of the head youd better let the buccaneers and their money alonetheyre not for old men and old women to meddle with they fought hard for their money they gave body and soul for it and wherever it lies buried depend upon it he must have a tug with the devil who gets it  this sudden explosion was succeeded by a blank silence throughout the room peechy prauw shrunk within himself and even the redfaced officer turned pale wolfert who from a dark corner of the room had listened with intense eagerness to all this talk about buried treasure looked with mingled awe and reverence on this bold buccaneer for such he really suspected him to be there was a chinking of gold and a sparkling of jewels in all his stories about the spanish main that gave a value to every period and wolfert would have given any thing for the rummaging of the ponderous seachest which his imagination crammed full of golden chalices and crucifixes and jolly round bags of doubloons  the dead stillness that had fallen upon the company was at length interrupted by the stranger who pulled out a prodigious watch of curious and ancient workmanship and which in wolferts eyes had a decidedly spanish look on touching a spring it struck ten oclock upon which the sailor called for his reckoning and having paid it out of a handful of outlandish coin he drank off the remainder of his beverage and without taking leave of any one rolled out of the room muttering to himself as he stamped upstairs to his chamber  it was some time before the company could recover from the silence into which they had been thrown the very footsteps of the stranger which were heard now and then as he traversed his chamber inspired awe  still the conversation in which they had been engaged was too interesting not to be resumed a heavy thundergust had gathered up unnoticed while they were lost in talk and the torrents of rain that fell forbade all thoughts of setting off for home until the storm should subside they drew nearer together therefore and entreated the worthy peechy prauw to continue the tale which had been so discourteously interrupted he readily complied whispering however in a tone scarcely above his breath and drowned occasionally by the rolling of the thunder and he would pause every now and then and listen with evident awe as he heard the heavy footsteps of the stranger pacing overhead  the following is the purport of his story     the adventure of sam the black fisherman  commonly denominated mud sam   every body knows mud sam the old negro fisherman who has fished about the sound for the last twenty or thirty years well it is now many years since that sam who was then a young fellow and worked on the farm of killian suydam on long island having finished his work early was fishing one still summer evening just about the neighborhood of hell gate he was in a light skiff and being well acquainted with the currents and eddies he had been able to shift his station with the shifting of the tide from the hen and chickens to the hogs back and from the hogs back to the pot and from the pot to the fryingpan but in the eagerness of his sport sam did not see that the tide was rapidly ebbing until the roaring of the whirlpools and rapids warned him of his danger and he had some difficulty in shooting his skiff from among the rocks and breakers and getting to the point of blackwells island here he cast anchor for some time waiting the turn of the tide to enable him to return homewards  as the night set in it grew blustering and gusty dark clouds came bundling up in the west and now and then a growl of thunder or a flash of lightning told that a summer storm was at hand sam pulled over therefore under the lee of manhattan island and coasting along came to a snug nook just under a steep beetling rock where he fastened his skiff to the root of a tree that shot out from a cleft and spread its broad branches like a canopy over the water the gust came scouring along the wind threw up the river in white surges the rain rattled among the leaves the thunder bellowed worse than that which is now bellowing the lightning seemed to lick up the surges of the stream but sam snugly sheltered under rock and tree lay crouched in his skiff rocking upon the billows until he fell asleep when he awoke all was quiet the gust had passed away and only now and then a faint gleam of lightning in the east showed which way it had gone the night was dark and moonless and from the state of the tide sam concluded it was near midnight he was on the point of making loose his skiff to return homewards when he saw a light gleaming along the water from a distance which seemed rapidly approaching as it drew near he perceived that it came from a lanthorn in the bow of a boat which was gliding along under shadow of the land it pulled up in a small cove close to where he was a man jumped on shore and searching about with the lanthorn exclaimed this is the placeheres the iron ring the boat was then made fast and the man returning on board assisted his comrades in conveying something heavy on shore as the light gleamed among them sam saw that they were five stout desperatelooking fellows in red woollen caps with a leader in a threecornered hat and that some of them were armed with dirks or long knives and pistols they talked low to one another and occasionally in some outlandish tongue which he could not understand  on landing they made their way among the bushes taking turns to relieve each other in lugging their burthen up the rocky bank sams curiosity was now fully aroused so leaving his skiff he clambered silently up the ridge that overlooked their path they had stopped to rest for a moment and the leader was looking about among the bushes with his lanthorn have you brought the spades said one they are here replied another who had them on his shoulder we must dig deep where there will be no risk of discovery said a third  a cold chill ran through sams veins he fancied he saw before him a gang of murderers about to bury their victim his knees smote together in his agitation he shook the branch of a tree with which he was supporting himself as he looked over the edge of the cliff  whats that cried one of the gang some one stirs among the bushes  the lanthorn was held up in the direction of the noise one of the redcaps cocked a pistol and pointed it towards the very lace where sam was standing he stood motionlessbreathless expecting the next moment to be his last fortunately his dingy complexion was in his favor and made no glare among the leaves  tis no one said the man with the lanthorn what a plague you would not fire off your pistol and alarm the country  the pistol was uncocked the burthen was resumed and the party slowly toiled up the bank sam watched them as they went the light sending back fitful gleams through the dripping bushes and it was not till they were fairly out of sight that he ventured to draw breath freely he now thought of getting back to his boat and making his escape out of the reach of such dangerous neighbors but curiosity was allpowerful with poor sam he hesitated and lingered and listened by and bye he heard the strokes of spades  they are digging the grave said he to himself the cold sweat started upon his forehead every stroke of a spade as it sounded through the silent groves went to his heart it was evident there was as little noise made as possible every thing had an air of mystery and secrecy sam had a great relish for the horriblea tale of murder was a treat for him and he was a constant attendant at executions he could not therefore resist an impulse in spite of every danger to steal nearer and overlook the villains at their work he crawled along cautiously therefore inch by inch stepping with the utmost care among the dry leaves lest their rustling should betray him he came at length to where a steep rock intervened between him and the gang he saw the light of their lanthorn shining up against the branches of the trees on the other side sam slowly and silently clambered up the surface of the rock and raising his head above its naked edge beheld the villains immediately below him and so near that though he dreaded discovery he dared not withdraw lest the least movement should be heard in this way he remained with his round black face peering over the edge of the rock like the sun just emerging above the edge of the horizon or the roundcheeked moon on the dial of a clock  the redcaps had nearly finished their work the grave was filled up and they were carefully replacing the turf this done they scattered dry leaves over the place and now said the leader i defy the devil himself to find it out  the murderers exclaimed sam involuntarily  the whole gang started and looking up beheld the round black head of sam just above them his white eyes strained half out of their orbits his white teeth chattering and his whole visage shining with cold perspiration  were discovered cried one  down with him cried another  sam heard the cocking of a pistol but did not pause for the report he scrambled over rock and stone through bush and briar rolled down banks like a hedgehog scrambled up others like a catamount in every direction he heard some one or other of the gang hemming him in at length he reached the rocky ridge along the river one of the redcaps was hard behind him a steep rock like a wall rose directly in his way it seemed to cut off all retreat when he espied the strong cordlike branch of a grapevine reaching half way down it he sprang at it with the force of a desperate man seized it with both hands and being young and agile succeeded in swinging himself to the summit of the cliff here he stood in full relief against the sky when the redcap cocked his pistol and fired the ball whistled by sams head with the lucky thought of a man in an emergency he uttered a yell fell to the ground and detached at the same time a fragment of the rock which tumbled with a loud splash into the river  ive done his business said the redcap to one or two of his comrades as they arrived panting hell tell no tales except to the fishes in the river  his pursuers now turned off to meet their companions sam sliding silently down the surface of the rock let himself quietly into his skiff cast loose the fastening and abandoned himself to the rapid current which in that place runs like a millstream and soon swept him off from the neighborhood it was not however until he had drifted a great distance that he ventured to ply his oars when he made his skiff dart like an arrow through the strait of hell gate never heeding the danger of pot fryingpan or hogsback itself nor did he feel himself thoroughly secure until safely nestled in bed in the cockloft of the ancient farmhouse of the suydams  here the worthy peechy paused to take breath and to take a sip of the gossip tankard that stood at his elbow his auditors remained with open mouths and outstretched necks gaping like a nest of swallows for an additional mouthful  and is that all exclaimed the halfpay officer  thats all that belongs to the story said peechy prauw  and did sam never find out what was buried by the redcaps said wolfert eagerly whose mind was haunted by nothing but ingots and doubloons  not that i know of he had no time to spare from his work and to tell the truth he did not like to run the risk of another race among the rocks besides how should he recollect the spot where the grave had been digged every thing would look different by daylight and then where was the use of looking for a dead body when there was no chance of hanging the murderers  aye but are you sure it was a dead body they buried said wolfert  to be sure cried peechy prauw exultingly does it not haunt in the neighborhood to this very day  haunts exclaimed several of the party opening their eyes still wider and edging their chairs still closer  aye haunts repeated peechy has none of you heard of father redcap that haunts the old burnt farmhouse in the woods on the border of the sound near hell gate  oh to be sure ive heard tell of something of the kind but then i took it for some old wives fable  old wives fable or not said peechy prauw that farmhouse stands hard by the very spot its been unoccupied time out of mind and stands in a wild lonely part of the coast but those who fish in the neighborhood have often heard strange noises there and lights have been seen about the wood at night and an old fellow in a red cap has been seen at the windows more than once which people take to be the ghost of the body that was buried there once upon a time three soldiers took shelter in the building for the night and rummaged it from top to bottom when they found old father redcap astride of a ciderbarrel in the cellar with a jug in one hand and a goblet in the other he offered them a drink out of his goblet but just as one of the soldiers was putting it to his mouthwhew a flash of fire blazed through the cellar blinded every mothers son of them for several minutes and when they recovered their eyesight jug goblet and redcap had vanished and nothing but the empty ciderbarrel remained  here the halfpay officer who was growing very muzzy and sleepy and nodding over his liquor with halfextinguished eye suddenly gleamed up like an expiring rushlight  thats all humbug said he as peechy finished his last story  well i dont vouch for the truth of it myself said peechy prauw though all the world knows that theres something strange about the house and grounds but as to the story of mud sam i believe it just as well as if it had happened to myself  the deep interest taken in this conversation by the company had made them unconscious of the uproar that prevailed abroad among the elements when suddenly they were all electrified by a tremendous clap of thunder a lumbering crash followed instantaneously that made the building shake to its foundation all started from their seats imagining it the shock of an earthquake or that old father redcap was coming among them in all his terrors they listened for a moment but only heard the rain pelting against the windows and the wind howling among the trees the explosion was soon explained by the apparition of an old negros bald head thrust in at the door his white goggle eyes contrasting with his jetty poll which was wet with rain and shone like a bottle in a jargon but half intelligible he announced that the kitchen chimney had been struck with lightning  a sullen pause of the storm which now rose and sunk in gusts produced a momentary stillness in this interval the report of a musket was heard and a long shout almost like a yell resounded from the shore every one crowded to the window another musket shot was heard and another long shout that mingled wildly with a rising blast of wind it seemed as if the cry came up from the bosom of the waters for though incessant flashes of lightning spread a light about the shore no one was to be seen  suddenly the window of the room overhead was opened and a loud halloo uttered by the mysterious stranger several hailings passed from one party to the other but in a language which none of the company in the barroom could understand and presently they heard the window closed and a great noise overhead as if all the furniture were pulled and hauled about the room the negro servant was summoned and shortly after was seen assisting the veteran to lug the ponderous seachest down stairs  the landlord was in amazement what you are not going on the water in such a storm  storm said the other scornfully do you call such a sputter of weather a storm  youll get drenched to the skinyoull catch your death said peechy prauw affectionately  thunder and lightning exclaimed the merman dont preach about weather to a man that has cruised in whirlwinds and tornadoes  the obsequious peechy was again struck dumb the voice from the water was again heard in a tone of impatience the bystanders stared with redoubled awe at this man of storms which seemed to have come up out of the deep and to be called back to it again as with the assistance of the negro he slowly bore his ponderous seachest towards the shore they eyed it with a superstitious feeling half doubting whether he were not really about to embark upon it and launch forth upon the wild waves they followed him at a distance with a lanthorn  douse the light roared the hoarse voice from the water no one wants light here  thunder and lightning exclaimed the veteran back to the house with you  wolfert and his companions shrunk back is dismay still their curiosity would not allow them entirely to withdraw a long sheet of lightning now flickered across the waves and discovered a boat filled with men just under a rocky point rising and sinking with the heavy surges and swashing the water at every heave it was with difficulty held to the rocks by a boat hook for the current rushed furiously round the point the veteran hoisted one end of the lumbering seachest on the gunwale of the boat he seized the handle at the other end to lift it in when the motion propelled the boat from the shore the chest slipped off from the gunwale sunk into the waves and pulled the veteran headlong after it a loud shriek was uttered by all on shore and a volley of execrations by those on board but boat and man were hurried away by the rushing swiftness of the tide a pitchy darkness succeeded wolfert webber indeed fancied that he distinguished a cry for help and that he beheld the drowning man beckoning for assistance but when the lightning again gleamed along the water all was drear and void neither man nor boat was to be seen nothing but the dashing and weltering of the waves as they hurried past  the company returned to the tavern for they could not leave it before the storm should subside they resumed their seats and gazed on each other with dismay the whole transaction had not occupied five minutes and not a dozen words had been spoken when they looked at the oaken chair they could scarcely realize the fact that the strange being who had so lately tenanted it full of life and herculean vigor should already be a corpse there was the very glass he had just drunk from there lay the ashes from the pipe which he had smoked as it were with his last breath as the worthy burghers pondered on these things they felt a terrible conviction of the uncertainty of human existence and each felt as if the ground on which he stood was rendered less stable by this awful example  as however the most of the company were possessed of that valuable philosophy which enables a man to bear up with fortitude against the misfortunes of his neighbors they soon managed to console themselves for the tragic end of the veteran the landlord was happy that the poor dear man had paid his reckoning before he went  he came in a storm and he went in a storm he came in the night and he went in the night he came nobody knows from whence and he has gone nobody knows where for aught i know he has gone to sea once more on his chest and may land to bother some people on the other side of the world though its a thousand pities added the landlord if he has gone to davy jones that he had not left his seachest behind him  the seachest st nicholas preserve us said peechy prauw id not have had that seachest in the house for any money ill warrant hed come racketing after it at nights and making a haunted house of the inn and as to his going to sea on his chest i recollect what happened to skipper onderdonks ship on his voyage from amsterdam  the boatswain died during a storm so they wrapped him up in a sheet and put him in his own seachest and threw him overboard but they neglected in their hurryskurry to say prayers over himand the storm raged and roared louder than ever and they saw the dead man seated in his chest with his shroud for a sail coming hard after the ship and the sea breaking before him in great sprays like fire and there they kept scudding day after day and night after night expecting every moment to go to wreck and every night they saw the dead boatswain in his seachest trying to get up with them and they heard his whistle above the blasts of wind and he seemed to send great seas mountain high after them that would have swamped the ship if they had not put up the dead lights and so it went on till they lost sight of him in the fogs of newfoundland and supposed he had veered ship and stood for dead mans isle so much for burying a man at sea without saying prayers over him  the thundergust which had hitherto detained the company was now at an end the cuckoo clock in the hall struck midnight every one pressed to depart for seldom was such a late hour trespassed on by these quiet burghers as they sallied forth they found the heavens once more serene the storm which had lately obscured them had rolled aways and lay piled up in fleecy masses on the horizon lighted up by the bright crescent of the moon which looked like a silver lamp hung up in a palace of clouds  the dismal occurrence of the night and the dismal narrations they had made had left a superstitious feeling in every mind they cast a fearful glance at the spot where the buccaneer had disappeared almost expecting to see him sailing on his chest in the cool moonshine the trembling rays glittered along the waters but all was placid and the current dimpled over the spot where he had gone down the party huddled together in a little crowd as they repaired homewards particularly when they passed a lonely field where a man had been murdered and he who had farthest to go and had to complete his journey alone though a veteran sexton and accustomed one would think to ghosts and goblins yet went a long way round rather than pass by his own churchyard  wolfert webber had now carried home a fresh stock of stories and notions to ruminate upon his mind was all of a whirl with these freebooting tales and then these accounts of pots of money and spanish treasures buried here and there and every where about the rocks and bays of this wild shore made him almost dizzy  blessed st nicholas ejaculated he half aloud is it not possible to come upon one of these golden hoards and so make ones self rich in a twinkling how hard that i must go on delving and delving day in and day out merely to make a morsel of bread when one lucky stroke of a spade might enable me to ride in my carriage for the rest of my life  as he turned over in his thoughts all that he had been told of the singular adventure of the black fisherman his imagination gave a totally different complexion to the tale he saw in the gang of redcaps nothing but a crew of pirates burying their spoils and his cupidity was once more awakened by the possibility of at length getting on the traces of some of this lurking wealth indeed his infected fancy tinged every thing with gold he felt like the greedy inhabitant of bagdad when his eye had been greased with the magic ointment of the dervise that gave him to see all the treasures of the earth caskets of buried jewels chests of ingots bags of outlandish coins seemed to court him from their concealments and supplicate him to relieve them from their untimely graves  on making private inquiries about the grounds said to be haunted by father redcap he was more and more confirmed in his surmise he learned that the place had several times been visited by experienced moneydiggers who had heard mud sams story though none of them had met with success on the contrary they had always been dogged with ill luck of some kind or other in consequence as wolfert concluded of their not going to work at the proper time and with the proper ceremonials the last attempt had been made by cobus quackenbos who dug for a whole night and met with incredible difficulty for as fast as he threw one shovel full of earth out of the hole two were thrown in by invisible hands he succeeded so far however as to uncover an iron chest when there was a terrible roaring and ramping and raging of uncouth figures about the hole and at length a shower of blows dealt by invisible cudgels that fairly belabored him off the forbidden ground this cobus quackenbos had declared on his deathbed so that there could not be any doubt of it he was a man that had devoted many years of his life to moneydigging and it was thought would have ultimately succeeded had he not died suddenly of a brain fever in the almshouse  wolfert webber was now in a worry of trepidation and impatience fearful lest some rival adventurer should get a scent of the buried gold he determined privately to seek out the negro fisherman and get him to serve as guide to the place where he had witnessed the mysterious scene of interment sam was easily found for he was one of those old habitual beings that live about a neighborhood until they wear themselves a place in the public mind and become in a manner public characters there was not an unlucky urchin about the town that did not know mud sam the fisherman and think that he had a right to play his tricks upon the old negro sam was an amphibious kind of animal something more of a fish than a man he had led the life of an otter for more than half a century about the shores of the bay and the fishing grounds of the sound he passed the greater part of his time on and in the water particularly about hell gate and might have been taken in bad weather for one of the hobgoblins that used to haunt that strait there would he be seen at all times and in all weathers sometimes in his skiff anchored among the eddies or prowling like a shark about some wreck where the fish are supposed to be most abundant sometimes seated on a rock from hour to hour looming through mist and drizzle like a solitary heron watching for its prey he was well acquainted with every hole and corner of the sound from the wallabout to hell gate and from hell gate even unto the devils stepping stones and it was even affirmed that he knew all the fish in the river by their christian names  wolfert found him at his cabin which was not much larger than a tolerable doghouse it was rudely constructed of fragments of wrecks and driftwood and built on the rocky shore at the foot of the old fort just about what at present forms the point of the battery a most ancient and fishlike smell pervaded the place oars paddles and fishingrods were leaning against the wall of the fort a net was spread on the sands to dry a skiff was drawn up on the beach and at the door of his cabin lay mud sam himself indulging in a true negros luxurysleeping in the sunshine  many years had passed away since the time of sams youthful adventure and the snows of many a winter had grizzled the knotty wool upon his head he perfectly recollected the circumstances however for he had often been called upon to relate them though in his version of the story he differed in many points from peechy prauw as is not unfrequently the case with authentic historians as to the subsequent researches of moneydiggers sam knew nothing about them they were matters quite out of his line neither did the cautious wolfert care to disturb his thoughts on that point his only wish was to secure the old fisherman as a pilot to the spot and this was readily effected the long time that had intervened since his nocturnal adventure had effaced all sams awe of the place and the promise of a trifling reward roused him at once from his sleep and his sunshine  the tide was adverse to making the expedition by water and wolfert was too impatient to get to the land of promise to wait for its turning they set off therefore by land a walk of four or five miles brought them to the edge of a wood which at that time covered the greater part of the eastern side of the island it was just beyond the pleasant region of bloomendael here they struck into a long lane straggling among trees and bushes very much overgrown with weeds and mullein stalks as if but seldom used and so completely overshadowed as to enjoy but a kind of twilight wild vines entangled the trees and flaunted in their faces brambles and briars caught their clothes as they passed the gartersnake glided across their path the spotted toad hopped and waddled before them and the restless catbird mewed at them from every thicket had wolfert webber been deeply read in romantic legend he might have fancied himself entering upon forbidden enchanted ground or that these were some of the guardians set to keep a watch upon buried treasure as it was the loneliness of the place and the wild stories connected with it had their effect upon his mind  on reaching the lower end of the lane they found themselves near the shore of the sound in a kind of amphitheatre surrounded by forest tree the area had once been a grassplot but was now shagged with briars and rank weeds at one end and just on the river bank was a ruined building little better than a heap of rubbish with a stack of chimneys rising like a solitary tower out of the centre the current of the sound rushed along just below it with wildlygrown trees drooping their branches into its waves  wolfert had not a doubt that this was the haunted house of father redcap and called to mind the story of peechy prauw the evening was approaching and the light falling dubiously among these places gave a melancholy tone to the scene well calculated to foster any lurking feeling of awe or superstition the nighthawk wheeling about in the highest regions of the air emitted his peevish boding cry the woodpecker gave a lonely tap now and then on some hollow tree and the firebird3 as he streamed by them with his deepred plumage seemed like some genius flitting about this region of mystery  footnote 3 orchard oreole  they now came to an enclosure that had once been a garden it extended along the foot of a rocky ridge but was little better than a wilderness of weeds with here and there a matted rosebush or a peach or plum tree grown wild and ragged and covered with moss at the lower end of the garden they passed a kind of vault in the side of the bank facing the water it had the look of a roothouse the door though decayed was still strong and appeared to have been recently patched up wolfert pushed it open it gave a harsh grating upon its hinges and striking against something like a box a rattling sound ensued and a skull rolled on the floor wolfert drew back shuddering but was reassured on being informed by sam that this was a family vault belonging to one of the old dutch families that owned this estate an assertion which was corroborated by the sight of coffins of various sizes piled within sam had been familiar with all these scenes when a boy and now knew that he could not be far from the place of which they were in quest  they now made their way to the waters edge scrambling along ledges of rocks and having often to hold by shrubs and grapevines to avoid slipping into the deep and hurried stream at length they came to a small cove or rather indent of the shore it was protected by steep rocks and overshadowed by a thick copse of oaks and chestnuts so as to be sheltered and almost concealed the beach sloped gradually within the cove but the current swept deep and black and rapid along its jutting points sam paused raised his remnant of a hat and scratched his grizzled poll for a moment as he regarded this nook then suddenly clapping his hands he stepped exultingly forward and pointing to a large iron ring stapled firmly in the rock just where a broad shelve of stone furnished a commodious landingplace it was the very spot where the redcaps had landed years had changed the more perishable features of the scene but rock and iron yield slowly to the influence of time on looking more narrowly wolfert remarked three crosses cut in the rock just above the ring which had no doubt some mysterious signification old sam now readily recognized the overhanging rock under which his skiff had been sheltered during the thundergust to follow up the course which the midnight gang had taken however was a harder task his mind had been so much taken up on that eventful occasion by the persons of the drama as to pay but little attention to the scenes and places looked different by night and day after wandering about for some time however they came to an opening among the trees which sam thought resembled the place there was a ledge of rock of moderate height like a wall on one side which sam thought might be the very ridge from which he overlooked the diggers wolfert examined it narrowly and at length described three crosses similar to those above the iron ring cut deeply into the face of the rock but nearly obliterated by the moss that had grown on them his heart leaped with joy for he doubted not but they were the private marks of the buccaneers to denote the places where their treasure lay buried all now that remained was to ascertain the precise spot for otherwise he might dig at random without coming upon the spoil and he has already had enough of such profitless labor here however sam was perfectly at a loss and indeed perplexed him by a variety of opinions for his recollections were all confused sometimes he declared it must have been at the foot of a mulberry tree hard by then it was just beside a great white stone then it must have been under a small green knoll a short distance from the ledge of rock until at length wolfert became as bewildered as himself  the shadows of evening were now spreading themselves over the woods and rock and tree began to mingle together it was evidently too late to attempt anything farther at present and indeed wolfert had come unprepared with implements to prosecute his researches satisfied therefore with having ascertained the place he took note of all its landmarks that he might recognize it again and set out on his return homeward resolved to prosecute this golden enterprise without delay  the leading anxiety which had hitherto absorbed every feeling being now in some measure appeased fancy began to wander and to conjure up a thousand shapes and chimeras as he returned through this haunted region pirates hanging in chains seemed to swing on every tree and he almost expected to see some spanish don with his throat cut from ear to ear rising slowly out of the ground and shaking the ghost of a moneybag  their way back lay through the desolate garden and wolferts nerves had arrived at so sensitive a state that the flitting of a bird the rustling of a leaf or the falling of a nut was enough to startle him as they entered the confines of the garden they caught sight of a figure at a distance advancing slowly up one of the walks and bending under the weight of a burthen they paused and regarded him attentively he wore what appeared to be a woollen cap and still more alarming of a most sanguinary red the figure moved slowly on ascended the bank and stopped at the very door of the sepulchral vault just before entering he looked around what was the horror of wolfert when he recognized the grizzly visage of the drowned buccaneer he uttered an ejaculation of horror the figure slowly raised his iron fist and shook it with a terrible menace wolfert did not pause to see more but hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him nor was sam slow in following at his heels having all his ancient terrors revived away then did they scramble through bush and brake horribly frightened at every bramble that tagged at their skirts nor did they pause to breathe until they had blundered their way through this perilous wood and had fairly reached the highroad to the city  several days elapsed before wolfert could summon courage enough to prosecute the enterprise so much had he been dismayed by the apparition whether living dead of the grizzly buccaneer in the meantime what a conflict of mind did he suffer he neglected all his concerns was moody and restless all day lost his appetite wandered in his thoughts and words and committed a thousand blunders his rest was broken and when he fell asleep the nightmare in shape of a huge moneybag sat squatted upon his breast he babbled about incalculable sums fancied himself engaged in money digging threw the bedclothes right and left in the idea that he was shovelling among the dirt groped under the bed in quest of the treasure and lugged forth as he supposed an inestimable pot of gold  dame webber and her daughter were in despair at what they conceived a returning touch of insanity there are two family oracles one or other of which dutch housewives consult in all cases of great doubt and perplexity the dominie and the doctor in the present instance they repaired to the doctor there was at that time a little dark mouldy man of medicine famous among the old wives of the manhattoes for his skill not only in the healing art but in all matters of strange and mysterious nature his name was dr knipperhausen but he was more commonly known by the appellation of the high german doctor4 to him did the poor women repair for counsel and assistance touching the mental vagaries of wolfert webber  footnote 4 the same no doubt of whom mention is made in the history of dolph heyliger  they found the doctor seated in his little study clad in his dark camblet robe of knowledge with his black velvet cap after the manner of boorhaave van helmont and other medical sages a pair of green spectacles set in black horn upon his clubbed nose and poring over a german folio that seemed to reflect back the darkness of his physiognomy the doctor listened to their statement of the symptoms of wolferts malady with profound attention but when they came to mention his raving about buried money the little man pricked up his ears alas poor women they little knew the aid they had called in  dr knipperhausen had been half his life engaged in seeking the short cuts to fortune in quest of which so many a long lifetime is wasted he had passed some years of his youth in the harz mountains of germany and had derived much valuable instruction from the miners touching the mode of seeking treasure buried in the earth he had prosecuted his studies also under a travelling sage who united all the mysteries of medicine with magic and legerdemain his mind therefore had become stored with all kinds of mystic lore he had dabbled a little in astrology alchemy and divination knew how to detect stolen money and to tell where springs of water lay hidden in a word by the dark nature of his knowledge he had acquired the name of the high german doctor which is pretty nearly equivalent to that of necromancer the doctor had often heard rumors of treasure being buried in various parts of the island and had long been anxious to get on the traces of it no sooner were wolferts waking and sleeping vagaries confided to him than he beheld in them the confirmed symptoms of a case of moneydigging and lost no time in probing it to the bottom wolfert had long been sorely depressed in mind by the golden secret and as a family physician is a kind of father confessor he was glad of the opportunity of unburthening himself so far from curing the doctor caught the malady from his patient the circumstances unfolded to him awakened all his cupidity he had not a doubt of money being buried somewhere in the neighborhood of the mysterious crosses and offered to join wolfert in the search he informed him that much secrecy and caution must be observed in enterprises of the kind that money is only to be digged for at night with certain forms and ceremonies the burning of drugs the repeating of mystic words and above all that the seekers must be provided with a divining rod which had the wonderful property of pointing to the very spot on the surface of the earth under which treasure lay hidden as the doctor had given much of his mind to these matters he charged himself with all the necessary preparations and as the quarter of the moon was propitious he undertook to have the divining rod ready by a certain night5  footnote 5 the following note was found appended to this paper in the handwriting of mr knickerbocker there has been much written against the divining rod by those light minds who are ever ready to scoff at the mysteries of nature but i fully join with dr knipperhausen in giving it my faith i shall not insist upon its efficacy in discovering the concealment of stolen goods the boundarystones of fields the traces of robbers and murderers or even the existence of subterraneous springs and streams of water albeit i think these properties not easily to be discredited but of its potency in discovering vein of precious metal and hidden sums of money and jewels i have not the least doubt some said that the rod turned only in the hands of persons who had been born in particular months of the year hence astrologers had recourse to planetary influence when they would procure a talisman others declared that the properties of the rod were either an effect of chance or the fraud of the holder or the work of the devil thus sayeth the reverend father gaspard schott in his treatise on magic propter haec et similia argumenta audacter ego pronuncio vim conversivam virgulae befurcatae nequaquam naturalem esse sed vel casa vel fraude virgulam tractantis vel ope diaboli etc  georgius agricula also was of opinion that it was a mere delusion of the devil to inveigle the avaricious and unwary into his clutches and in his treatise de re metallica lays particular stress on the mysterious words pronounced by those persons who employed the divining rod during his time but i make not a doubt that the divining rod is one of those secrets of natural magic the mystery of which is to be explained by the sympathies existing between physical things operated upon by the planets and rendered efficacious by the strong faith of the individual let the divining rod be properly gathered at the proper time of the moon cut into the proper form used with the necessary ceremonies and with a perfect faith in its efficacy and i can confidently recommend it to my fellowcitizens as an infallible means of discovering the various places on the island of the manhattoes where treasure hath been buried in the olden time dk  wolferts heart leaped with joy at having met with so learned and able a coadjutor every thing went on secretly but swimmingly the doctor had many consultations with his patient and the good women of the household lauded the comforting effect of his visits in the meantime the wonderful divining rod that great key to natures secrets was duly prepared the doctor had thumbed over all his books of knowledge for the occasion and mud sam was engaged to take them in his skiff to the scene of enterprise to work with spade and pickaxe in unearthing the treasure and to freight his bark with the weighty spoils they were certain of finding  at length the appointed night arrived for this perilous undertaking before wolfert left his home he counselled his wife and daughter to go to bed and feel no alarm if he should not return during the night like reasonable women on being told not to feel alarm they fell immediately into a panic they saw at once by his manner that something unusual was in agitation all their fears about the unsettled state of his mind were roused with tenfold force they hung about him entreating him not to expose himself to the night air but all in vain when wolfert was once mounted on his hobby it was no easy matter to get him out of the saddle it was a clear starlight night when he issued out of the portal of the webber palace he wore a large napped hat tied under the chin with a handkerchief of his daughters to secure him from the night damp while dame webber threw her long red cloak about his shoulders and fastened it round his neck  the doctor had been no less carefully armed and accoutred by his housekeeper the vigilant frau ilsy and sallied forth in his camblet robe by way of surtout his black velvet cap under his cocked hat a thick clasped book under his arm a basket of drugs and dried herbs in one hand and in the other the miraculous rod of divination  the great church clock struck ten as wolfert and the doctor passed by the churchyard and the watchman bawled in hoarse voice a long and doleful alls well a deep sleep had already fallen upon this primitive little burgh nothing disturbed this awful silence excepting now and then the bark of some profligate nightwalking dog or the serenade of some romantic cat it is true wolfert fancied more than once that he heard the sound of a stealthy footfall at a distance behind them but it might have been merely the echo of their own steps echoing along the quiet streets he thought also at one time that he saw a tall figure skulking after themstopping when they stopped and moving on as they proceeded but the dim and uncertain lamp light threw such vague gleams and shadows that this might all have been mere fancy  they found the negro fisherman waiting for them smoking his pipe in the stern of his skiff which was moored just in front of his little cabin a pickaxe and spade were lying in the bottom of the boat with a dark lanthorn and a stone jug of good dutch courage in which honest sam no doubt put even more faith than dr knipperhausen in his drugs  thus then did these three worthies embark in their cockleshell of a skiff upon this nocturnal expedition with a wisdom and valor equalled only by the three wise men of gotham who went to sea in a bowl the tide was rising and running rapidly up the sound the current bore them along almost without the aid of an oar the profile of the town lay all in shadow here and there a light feebly glimmered from some sick chamber or from the cabin window of some vessel at anchor in the stream not a cloud obscured the deep starry firmament the lights of which wavered on the surface of the placid river and a shooting meteor streaking its pale course in the very direction they were taking was interpreted by the doctor into a most propitious omen  in a little while they glided by the point of corlears hook with the rural inn which had been the scene of such night adventures the family had retired to rest and the house was dark and still wolfert felt a chill pass over him as they passed the point where the buccaneer had disappeared he pointed it out to dr knipperhausen while regarding it they thought they saw a boat actually lurking at the very place but the shore cast such a shadow over the border of the water that they could discern nothing distinctly they had not proceeded far when they heard the low sounds of distant oars as if cautiously pulled sam plied his oars with redoubled vigor and knowing all the eddies and currents of the stream soon left their followers if such they were far astern in a little while they stretched across turtle bay and kips bay then shrouded themselves in the deep shadows of the manhattan shore and glided swiftly along secure from observation at length sam shot his skiff into a little cove darkly embowered by trees and made it fast to the well known iron ring they now landed and lighting the lanthorn gathered their various implements and proceeded slowly through the bushes every sound startled them even that of their footsteps among the dry leaves and the hooting of a screech owl from the shattered chimney of father redcaps ruin made their blood run cold  in spite of all wolferts caution in taking note of the landmarks it was some time before they could find the open place among the trees where the treasure was supposed to be buried at length they came to the ledge of rock and on examining its surface by the aid of the lanthorn wolfert recognized the three mystic crosses their hearts beat quick for the momentous trial was at hand that was to determine their hopes  the lanthorn was now held by wolfert webber while the doctor produced the divining rod it was a forked twig one end of which was grasped firmly in each hand while the centre forming the stem pointed perpendicularly upwards the doctor moved this wand about within a certain distance of the earth from place to place but for some time without any effect while wolfert kept the light of the lanthorn turned full upon it and watched it with the most breathless interest at length the rod began slowly to turn the doctor grasped it with greater earnestness his hand trembling with the agitation of his mind the wand continued slowly to turn until at length the stem had reversed its position and pointed perpendicularly downward and remained pointing to one spot as fixedly as the needle to the pole  this is the spot said the doctor in an almost inaudible tone  wolferts heart was in his throat  shall i dig said sam grasping the spade  pots tousends no replied the little doctor hastily he now ordered his companions to keep close by him and to maintain the most inflexible silence that certain precautions must be taken and ceremonies used to prevent the evil spirits which keep about buried treasure from doing them any harm the doctor then drew a circle round the place enough to include the whole party he next gathered dry twigs and leaves and made a fire upon which he threw certain drugs and dried herbs which he had brought in his basket a thick smoke rose diffusing a potent odor savoring marvellously of brimstone and assafoetida which however grateful it might be to the olfactory nerves of spirits nearly strangled poor wolfert and produced a fit of coughing and wheezing that made the whole grove resound doctor knipperhausen then unclasped the volume which he had brought under his arm which was printed in red and black characters in german text while wolfert held the lanthorn the doctor by the aid of his spectacles read off several forms of conjuration in latin and german he then ordered sam to seize the pickaxe and proceed to work the closebound soil gave obstinate signs of not having been disturbed for many a year after having picked his way through the surface sam came to a bed of sand and gravel which he threw briskly to right and left with the spade  hark said wolfert who fancied he heard a trampling among the dry leaves and a rustling through the bushes sam paused for a moment and they listened no footstep was near the bat flitted about them in silence a bird roused from its nest by the light which glared up among the trees flew circling about the flame in the profound stillness of the woodland they could distinguish the current rippling along the rocky shore and the distant murmuring and roaring of hell gate  sam continued his labors and had already digged a considerable hole the doctor stood on the edge reading formulae every now and then from the black letter volume or throwing more drugs and herbs upon the fire while wolfert bent anxiously over the pit watching every stroke of the spade any one witnessing the scene thus strangely lighted up by fire lanthorn and the reflection of wolferts red mantle might have mistaken the little doctor for some foul magician busied in his incantations and the grizzledheaded sam as some swart goblin obedient to his commands  at length the spade of the fisherman struck upon something that sounded hollow the sound vibrated to wolferts heart he struck his spade again  tis a chest said sam  full of gold ill warrant it cried wolfert clasping his hands with rapture  scarcely had he uttered the words when a sound from overhead caught his ear he cast up his eyes and lo by the expiring light of the fire he beheld just over the disk of the rock what appeared to be the grim visage of the drowned buccaneer grinning hideously down upon him  wolfert gave a loud cry and let fall the lanthorn his panic communicated itself to his companions the negro leaped out of the hole the doctor dropped his book and basket and began to pray in german all was horror and confusion the fire was scattered about the lanthorn extinguished in their hurryskurry they ran against and confounded one another they fancied a legion of hobgoblins let loose upon them and that they saw by the fitful gleams of the scattered embers strange figures in red caps gibbering and ramping around them the doctor ran one way mud sam another and wolfert made for the water side as he plunged struggling onwards through bush and brake he heard the tread of some one in pursuit  he scrambled frantically forward the footsteps gained upon him he felt himself grasped by his cloak when suddenly his pursuer was attacked in turn a fierce fight and struggle ensueda pistol was discharged that lit up rock and bush for a period and showed two figures grappling togetherall was then darker than ever the contest continuedthe combatants clenched each other and panted and groaned and rolled among the rocks there was snarling and growling as of a cur mingled with curses in which wolfert fancied he could recognize the voice of the buccaneer he would fain have fled but he was on the brink of a precipice and could go no farther  again the parties were on their feet again there was a tugging and struggling as if strength alone could decide the combat until one was precipitated from the brow of the cliff and sent headlong into the deep stream that whirled below wolfert heard the plunge and a kind of strangling bubbling murmur but the darkness of the night hid every thing from view and the swiftness of the current swept every thing instantly out of hearing one of the combatants was disposed of but whether friend or foe wolfert could not tell nor whether they might not both be foes he heard the survivor approach and his terror revived he saw where the profile of the rocks rose against the horizon a human form advancing he could not be mistaken it must be the buccaneer whither should he fly a precipice was on one side a murderer on the other the enemy approached he was close at hand wolfert attempted to let himself down the face of the cliff his cloak caught in a thorn that grew on the edge he was jerked from off his feet and held dangling in the air half choaked by the string with which his careful wife had fastened the garment round his neck wolfert thought his last moment had arrived already had he committed his soul to st nicholas when the string broke and he tumbled down the bank bumping from rock to rock and bush to bush and leaving the red cloak fluttering like a bloody banner in the air  it was a long while before wolfert came to himself when he opened his eyes the ruddy streaks of the morning were already shooting up the sky he found himself lying in the bottom of a boat grievously battered he attempted to sit up but was too sore and stiff to move a voice requested him in friendly accents to lie still he turned his eyes toward the speaker it was dirk waldron he had dogged the party at the earnest request of dame webber and her daughter who with the laudable curiosity of their sex had pried into the secret consultations of wolfert and the doctor dirk had been completely distanced in following the light skiff of the fisherman and had just come in time to rescue the poor moneydigger from his pursuer  thus ended this perilous enterprise the doctor and mud sam severally found their way back to the manhattoes each having some dreadful tale of peril to relate as to poor wolfert instead of returning in triumph laden with bags of gold he was borne home on a shutter followed by a rabble route of curious urchins his wife and daughter saw the dismal pageant from a distance and alarmed the neighborhood with their cries they thought the poor man had suddenly settled the great debt of nature in one of his wayward moods finding him however still living they had him conveyed speedily to bed and a jury of old matrons of the neighborhood assembled to determine how he should be doctored the whole town was in a buzz with the story of the moneydiggers many repaired to the scene of the previous nights adventures but though they found the very place of the digging they discovered nothing that compensated for their trouble some say they found the fragments of an oaken chest and an iron pot lid which savored strongly of hidden money and that in the old family vault there were traces of holes and boxes but this is all very dubious  in fact the secret of all this story has never to this day been discovered whether any treasure was ever actually buried at that place whether if so it was carried off at night by those who had buried it or whether it still remains there under the guardianship of gnomes and spirits until it shall be properly sought for is all matter of conjecture for my part i incline to the latter opinion and make no doubt that great sums lie buried both there and in many other parts of this island and its neighborhood ever since the times of the buccaneers and the dutch colonists and i would earnestly recommend the search after them to such of my fellow citizens as are not engaged in any other speculations  there were many conjectures formed also as to who and what was the strange man of the seas who had domineered over the little fraternity at corlears hook for a time disappeared so strangely and reappeared so fearfully some supposed him a smuggler stationed at that place to assist his comrades in landing their goods among the rocky coves of the island others that he was a buccaneer one of the ancient comrades either of kidd or bradish returned to convey away treasures formerly hidden in the vicinity the only circumstance that throws any thing like a vague light over this mysterious matter is a report that prevailed of a strange foreignbuilt shallop with the look of a piccaroon having been seen hovering about the sound for several days without landing or reporting herself though boats were seen going to and from her at night and that she was seen standing out of the mouth of the harbor in the gray of the dawn after the catastrophe of the moneydiggers  i must not omit to mention another report also which i confess is rather apocryphal of the buccaneer who was supposed to have been drowned being seen before daybreak with a lanthorn in his hand seated astride his great seachest and sailing through hell gate which just then began to roar and bellow with redoubled fury  while all the gossip world was thus filled with talk and rumor poor wolfert lay sick and sorrowful in his bed bruised in body and sorely beaten down in mind his wife and daughter did all they could to bind up his wounds both corporal and spiritual the good old dame never stirred from his bedside where she sat knitting from morning till night while his daughter busied herself about him with the fondest care nor did they lack assistance from abroad whatever may be said of the desertions of friends in distress they had no complaint of the kind to make not an old wife of the neighborhood but abandoned her work to crowd to the mansion of wolfert webber inquire after his health and the particulars of his story not one came moreover without her little pipkin of pennyroyal sage balm or other herbtea delighted at an opportunity of signalizing her kindness and her doctorship what drenchings did not the poor wolfert undergo and all in vain it was a moving sight to behold him wasting away day by day growing thinner and thinner and ghastlier and ghastlier and staring with rueful visage from under an old patchwork counterpane upon the jury of matrons kindly assembled to sigh and groan and look unhappy around him  dirk waldron was the only being that seemed to shed a ray of sunshine into this house of mourning he came in with cheery look and manly spirit and tried to reanimate the expiring heart of the poor moneydigger but it was all in vain wolfert was completely done over if any thing was wanting to complete his despair it was a notice served upon him in the midst of his distress that the corporation were about to run a new street through the very centre of his cabbage garden he saw nothing before him but poverty and ruin his last reliance the garden of his forefathers was to be laid waste and what then was to become of his poor wife and child  his eyes filled with tears as they followed the dutiful amy out of the room one morning dirk waldron was seated beside him wolfert grasped his hand pointed after his daughter and for the first time since his illness broke the silence he had maintained  i am going said he shaking his head feebly and when i am gonemy poordaughter  leave her to me father said dirk manfullyill take care of her  wolfert looked up in the face of the cheery strapping youngster and saw there was none better able to take care of a woman  enough said he she is yoursand now fetch me a lawyerlet me make my will and die  the lawyer was broughta dapper bustling roundheaded little man roorback or rollebuck as it was pronounced by name at the sight of him the women broke into loud lamentations for they looked upon the signing of a will as the signing of a deathwarrant wolfert made a feeble motion for them to be silent poor amy buried her face and her grief in the bedcurtain dame webber resumed her knitting to hide her distress which betrayed itself however in a pellucid tear that trickled silently down and hung at the end of her peaked nose while the cat the only unconcerned member of the family played with the good dames ball of worsted as it rolled about the floor  wolfert lay on his back his nightcap drawn over his forehead his eyes closed his whole visage the picture of death he begged the lawyer to be brief for he felt his end approaching and that he had no time to lose the lawyer nibbed his pen spread out his paper and prepared to write  i give and bequeath said wolfert faintly my small farm  whatall exclaimed the lawyer  wolfert half opened his eyes and looked upon the lawyer  yesall said he  what all that great patch of land with cabbages and sunflowers which the corporation is just going to run a main street through  the same said wolfert with a heavy sigh and sinking back upon his pillow  i wish him joy that inherits it said the little lawyer chuckling and rubbing his hands involuntarily  what do you mean said wolfert again opening his eyes  that hell be one of the richest men in the place cried little rollebuck  the expiring wolfert seemed to step back from the threshold of existence his eyes again lighted up he raised himself in his bed shoved back his red worsted nightcap and stared broadly at the lawyer  you dont say so exclaimed he  faith but i do rejoined the other why when that great field and that piece of meadow come to be laid out in streets and cut up into snug building lotswhy whoever owns them need not pull off his hat to the patroon  say you so cried wolfert half thrusting one leg out of bed why then i think ill not make my will yet  to the surprise of everybody the dying man actually recovered the vital spark which had glimmered faintly in the socket received fresh fuel from the oil of gladness which the little lawyer poured into his soul it once more burnt up into a flame  give physic to the heart ye who would revive the body of a spiritbroken man in a few days wolfert left his room in a few days more his table was covered with deeds plans of streets and building lots little rollebuck was constantly with him his righthand man and adviser and instead of making his will assisted in the more agreeable task of making his fortune in fact wolfert webber was one of those worthy dutch burghers of the manhattoes whose fortunes have been made in a manner in spite of themselves who have tenaciously held on to their hereditary acres raising turnips and cabbages about the skirts of the city hardly able to make both ends meet until the corporation has cruelly driven streets through their abodes and they have suddenly awakened out of a lethargy and to their astonishment found themselves rich men  before many months had elapsed a great bustling street passed through the very centre of the webber garden just where wolfert had dreamed of finding a treasure his golden dream was accomplished he did indeed find an unlookedfor source of wealth for when his paternal lands were distributed into building lots and rented out to safe tenants instead of producing a paltry crop of cabbages they returned him an abundant crop of rents insomuch that on quarter day it was a goodly sight to see his tenants rapping at his door from morning to night each with a little roundbellied bag of money the golden produce of the soil  the ancient mansion of his forefathers was still kept up but instead of being a little yellowfronted dutch house in a garden it now stood boldly in the midst of a street the grand house of the neighborhood for wolfert enlarged it with a wing on each side and a cupola or tea room on top where he might climb up and smoke his pipe in hot weather and in the course of time the whole mansion was overrun by the chubbyfaced progeny of amy webber and dirk waldron  as wolfert waxed old and rich and corpulent he also set up a great gingerbreadcolored carriage drawn by a pair of black flanders mares with tails that swept the ground and to commemorate the origin of his greatness he had for a crest a fullblown cabbage painted on the pannels with the pithy motto alles kopf that is to say all head meaning thereby that he had risen by sheer headwork  to fill the measure of his greatness in the fullness of time the renowned ramm rapelye slept with his fathers and wolfert webber succeeded to the leathernbottomed armchair in the inn parlor at corlears hook where he long reigned greatly honored and respected insomuch that he was never known to tell a story without its being believed nor to utter a joke without its being laughed at
