20269914	babbitt  by sinclair lewis   to edith wharton     babbitt     chapter i   the towers of zenith aspired above the morning mist austere towers of steel and cement and limestone sturdy as cliffs and delicate as silver rods they were neither citadels nor churches but frankly and beautifully officebuildings  the mist took pity on the fretted structures of earlier generations the post office with its shingletortured mansard the red brick minarets of hulking old houses factories with stingy and sooted windows wooden tenements colored like mud the city was full of such grotesqueries but the clean towers were thrusting them from the business center and on the farther hills were shining new houses homesthey seemedfor laughter and tranquillity  over a concrete bridge fled a limousine of long sleek hood and noiseless engine these people in evening clothes were returning from an allnight rehearsal of a little theater play an artistic adventure considerably illuminated by champagne below the bridge curved a railroad a maze of green and crimson lights the new york flyer boomed past and twenty lines of polished steel leaped into the glare  in one of the skyscrapers the wires of the associated press were closing down the telegraph operators wearily raised their celluloid eyeshades after a night of talking with paris and peking through the building crawled the scrubwomen yawning their old shoes slapping the dawn mist spun away cues of men with lunchboxes clumped toward the immensity of new factories sheets of glass and hollow tile glittering shops where five thousand men worked beneath one roof pouring out the honest wares that would be sold up the euphrates and across the veldt the whistles rolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the april dawn the song of labor in a city builtit seemedfor giants   ii  there was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who was beginning to awaken on the sleepingporch of a dutch colonial house in that residential district of zenith known as floral heights  his name was george f babbitt he was fortysix years old now in april 1920 and he made nothing in particular neither butter nor shoes nor poetry but he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more than people could afford to pay  his large head was pink his brown hair thin and dry his face was babyish in slumber despite his wrinkles and the red spectacledents on the slopes of his nose he was not fat but he was exceedingly well fed his cheeks were pads and the unroughened hand which lay helpless upon the khakicolored blanket was slightly puffy he seemed prosperous extremely married and unromantic and altogether unromantic appeared this sleepingporch which looked on one sizable elm two respectable grassplots a cement driveway and a corrugated iron garage yet babbitt was again dreaming of the fairy child a dream more romantic than scarlet pagodas by a silver sea  for years the fairy child had come to him where others saw but georgie babbitt she discerned gallant youth she waited for him in the darkness beyond mysterious groves when at last he could slip away from the crowded house he darted to her his wife his clamoring friends sought to follow but he escaped the girl fleet beside him and they crouched together on a shadowy hillside she was so slim so white so eager she cried that he was gay and valiant that she would wait for him that they would sail  rumble and bang of the milktruck  babbitt moaned turned over struggled back toward his dream he could see only her face now beyond misty waters the furnaceman slammed the basement door a dog barked in the next yard as babbitt sank blissfully into a dim warm tide the papercarrier went by whistling and the rolledup advocate thumped the front door babbitt roused his stomach constricted with alarm as he relaxed he was pierced by the familiar and irritating rattle of some one cranking a ford snapahah snapahah snapahah himself a pious motorist babbitt cranked with the unseen driver with him waited through taut hours for the roar of the starting engine with him agonized as the roar ceased and again began the infernal patient snapahaha round flat sound a shivering coldmorning sound a sound infuriating and inescapable not till the rising voice of the motor told him that the ford was moving was he released from the panting tension he glanced once at his favorite tree elm twigs against the gold patina of sky and fumbled for sleep as for a drug he who had been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the possible and improbable adventures of each new day  he escaped from reality till the alarmclock rang at seventwenty   iii  it was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced alarmclocks with all modern attachments including cathedral chime intermittent alarm and a phosphorescent dial babbitt was proud of being awakened by such a rich device socially it was almost as creditable as buying expensive cord tires  he sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape but he lay and detested the grind of the realestate business and disliked his family and disliked himself for disliking them the evening before he had played poker at vergil gunchs till midnight and after such holidays he was irritable before breakfast it may have been the tremendous homebrewed beer of the prohibitionera and the cigars to which that beer enticed him it may have been resentment of return from this fine bold manworld to a restricted region of wives and stenographers and of suggestions not to smoke so much  from the bedroom beside the sleepingporch his wifes detestably cheerful time to get up georgie boy and the itchy sound the brisk and scratchy sound of combing hairs out of a stiff brush  he grunted he dragged his thick legs in faded babyblue pajamas from under the khaki blanket he sat on the edge of the cot running his fingers through his wild hair while his plump feet mechanically felt for his slippers he looked regretfully at the blanketforever a suggestion to him of freedom and heroism he had bought it for a camping trip which had never come off it symbolized gorgeous loafing gorgeous cursing virile flannel shirts  he creaked to his feet groaning at the waves of pain which passed behind his eyeballs though he waited for their scorching recurrence he looked blurrily out at the yard it delighted him as always it was the neat yard of a successful business man of zenith that is it was perfection and made him also perfect he regarded the corrugated iron garage for the threehundredandsixtyfifth time in a year he reflected no class to that tin shack have to build me a frame garage but by golly its the only thing on the place that isnt uptodate while he stared he thought of a community garage for his acreage development glen oriole he stopped puffing and jiggling his arms were akimbo his petulant sleepswollen face was set in harder lines he suddenly seemed capable an official a man to contrive to direct to get things done  on the vigor of his idea he was carried down the hard dean unusedlooking hall into the bathroom  though the house was not large it had like all houses on floral heights an altogether royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and metal sleek as silver the towelrack was a rod of clear glass set in nickel the tub was long enough for a prussian guard and above the set bowl was a sensational exhibit of toothbrush holder shavingbrush holder soapdish spongedish and medicinecabinet so glittering and so ingenious that they resembled an electrical instrumentboard but the babbitt whose god was modern appliances was not pleased the air of the bathroom was thick with the smell of a heathen toothpaste verona been at it again stead of sticking to lilidol like ive repeatedly asked her shes gone and gotten some confounded stinkum stuff that makes you sick  the bathmat was wrinkled and the floor was wet his daughter verona eccentrically took baths in the morning now and then he slipped on the mat and slid against the tub he said damn furiously he snatched up his tube of shavingcream furiously he lathered with a belligerent slapping of the unctuous brush furiously he raked his plump cheeks with a safetyrazor it pulled the blade was dull he said damnohohdamn it  he hunted through the medicinecabinet for a packet of new razorblades reflecting as invariably be cheaper to buy one of these dinguses and strop your own blades and when he discovered the packet behind the round box of bicarbonate of soda he thought ill of his wife for putting it there and very well of himself for not saying damn but he did say it immediately afterward when with wet and soapslippery fingers he tried to remove the horrible little envelope and crisp clinging oiled paper from the new blade then there was the problem oftpondered never solved of what to do with the old blade which might imperil the fingers of his young as usual he tossed it on top of the medicinecabinet with a mental note that some day he must remove the fifty or sixty other blades that were also temporarily piled up there he finished his shaving in a growing testiness increased by his spinning headache and by the emptiness in his stomach when he was done his round face smooth and streamy and his eyes stinging from soapy water he reached for a towel the family towels were wet wet and clammy and vile all of them wet he found as he blindly snatched themhis own facetowel his wifes veronas teds tinkas and the lone bathtowel with the huge welt of initial then george f babbitt did a dismaying thing he wiped his face on the guesttowel it was a pansyembroidered trifle which always hung there to indicate that the babbitts were in the best floral heights society no one had ever used it no guest had ever dared to guests secretively took a corner of the nearest regular towel  he was raging by golly here they go and use up all the towels every doggone one of em and they use em and get em all wet and sopping and never put out a dry one for meof course im the goatand then i want one andim the only person in the doggone house thats got the slightest doggone bit of consideration for other people and thoughtfulness and consider there may be others that may want to use the doggone bathroom after me and consider  he was pitching the chill abominations into the bathtub pleased by the vindictiveness of that desolate flapping sound and in the midst his wife serenely trotted in observed serenely why georgie dear what are you doing are you going to wash out the towels why you neednt wash out the towels oh georgie you didnt go and use the guesttowel did you  it is not recorded that he was able to answer  for the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to look at her   iv  myra babbittmrs george f babbittwas definitely mature she had creases from the corners of her mouth to the bottom of her chin and her plump neck bagged but the thing that marked her as having passed the line was that she no longer had reticences before her husband and no longer worried about not having reticences she was in a petticoat now and corsets which bulged and unaware of being seen in bulgy corsets she had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full matronliness she was as sexless as an anemic nun she was a good woman a kind woman a diligent woman but no one save perhaps tinka her tenyearold was at all interested in her or entirely aware that she was alive  after a rather thorough discussion of all the domestic and social aspects of towels she apologized to babbitt for his having an alcoholic headache and he recovered enough to endure the search for a bvd undershirt which had he pointed out malevolently been concealed among his clean pajamas  he was fairly amiable in the conference on the brown suit  what do you think myra he pawed at the clothes hunched on a chair in their bedroom while she moved about mysteriously adjusting and patting her petticoat and to his jaundiced eye never seeming to get on with her dressing how about it shall i wear the brown suit another day  well it looks awfully nice on you  i know but gosh it needs pressing  thats so perhaps it does  it certainly could stand being pressed all right  yes perhaps it wouldnt hurt it to be pressed  but gee the coat doesnt need pressing no sense in having the whole darn suit pressed when the coat doesnt need it  thats so  but the pants certainly need it all right look at themlook at those wrinklesthe pants certainly do need pressing  thats so oh georgie why couldnt you wear the brown coat with the blue trousers we were wondering what wed do with them  good lord did you ever in all my life know me to wear the coat of one suit and the pants of another what do you think i am a busted bookkeeper  well why dont you put on the dark gray suit today and stop in at the tailor and leave the brown trousers  well they certainly neednow where the devil is that gray suit oh yes here we are  he was able to get through the other crises of dressing with comparative resoluteness and calm  his first adornment was the sleeveless dimity bvd undershirt in which he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a cheesecloth tabard at a civic pageant he never put on bvds without thanking the god of progress that he didnt wear tight long oldfashioned undergarments like his fatherinlaw and partner henry thompson his second embellishment was combing and slicking back his hair it gave him a tremendous forehead arching up two inches beyond the former hairline but most wonderworking of all was the donning of his spectacles  there is character in spectaclesthe pretentious tortoiseshell the meek pincenez of the school teacher the twisted silverframed glasses of the old villager babbitts spectacles had huge circular frameless lenses of the very best glass the earpieces were thin bars of gold in them he was the modern business man one who gave orders to clerks and drove a car and played occasional golf and was scholarly in regard to salesmanship his head suddenly appeared not babyish but weighty and you noted his heavy blunt nose his straight mouth and thick long upper lip his chin overfleshy but strong with respect you beheld him put on the rest of his uniform as a solid citizen  the gray suit was well cut well made and completely undistinguished it was a standard suit white piping on the v of the vest added a flavor of law and learning his shoes were black laced boots good boots honest boots standard boots extraordinarily uninteresting boots the only frivolity was in his purple knitted scarf with considerable comment on the matter to mrs babbitt who acrobatically fastening the back of her blouse to her skirt with a safetypin did not hear a word he said he chose between the purple scarf and a tapestry effect with stringless brown harps among blown palms and into it he thrust a snakehead pin with opal eyes  a sensational event was changing from the brown suit to the gray the contents of his pockets he was earnest about these objects they were of eternal importance like baseball or the republican party they included a fountain pen and a silver pencil always lacking a supply of new leads which belonged in the righthand upper vest pocket without them he would have felt naked on his watchchain were a gold penknife silver cigarcutter seven keys the use of two of which he had forgotten and incidentally a good watch depending from the chain was a large yellowish elkstoothproclamation of his membership in the brotherly and protective order of elks most significant of all was his looseleaf pocket notebook that modern and efficient notebook which contained the addresses of people whom he had forgotten prudent memoranda of postal moneyorders which had reached their destinations months ago stamps which had lost their mucilage clippings of verses by t cholmondeley frink and of the newspaper editorials from which babbitt got his opinions and his polysyllables notes to be sure and do things which he did not intend to do and one curious inscriptiondss dmypdf  but he had no cigarettecase no one had ever happened to give him one so he hadnt the habit and people who carried cigarettecases he regarded as effeminate  last he stuck in his lapel the boosters club button with the conciseness of great art the button displayed two words boosterspep it made babbitt feel loyal and important it associated him with good fellows with men who were nice and human and important in business circles it was his vc his legion of honor ribbon his phi beta kappa key  with the subtleties of dressing ran other complex worries i feel kind of punk this morning he said i think i had too much dinner last evening you oughtnt to serve those heavy banana fritters  but you asked me to have some  i know buti tell you when a fellow gets past forty he has to look after his digestion theres a lot of fellows that dont take proper care of themselves i tell you at forty a mans a fool or his doctori mean his own doctor folks dont give enough attention to this matter of dieting now i thinkcourse a man ought to have a good meal after the days work but it would be a good thing for both of us if we took lighter lunches  but georgie here at home i always do have a light lunch  mean to imply i make a hog of myself eating downtown yes sure youd have a swell time if you had to eat the truck that new steward hands out to us at the athletic club but i certainly do feel out of sorts this morning funny got a pain down here on the left sidebut no that wouldnt be appendicitis would it last night when i was driving over to verg gunchs i felt a pain in my stomach too right here it waskind of a sharp shooting pain iwhered that dime go to why dont you serve more prunes at breakfast of course i eat an apple every eveningan apple a day keeps the doctor awaybut still you ought to have more prunes and not all these fancy doodads  the last time i had prunes you didnt eat them  well i didnt feel like eating em i suppose matter of fact i think i did eat some of em anywayi tell you its mighty important toi was saying to verg gunch just last evening most people dont take sufficient care of their diges  shall we have the gunches for our dinner next week  why sure you bet  now see here george i want you to put on your nice dinnerjacket that evening  rats the rest of em wont want to dress  of course they will you remember when you didnt dress for the littlefields supperparty and all the rest did and how embarrassed you were  embarrassed hell i wasnt embarrassed everybody knows i can put on as expensive a tux as anybody else and i should worry if i dont happen to have it on sometimes all a darn nuisance anyway all right for a woman that stays around the house all the time but when a fellows worked like the dickens all day he doesnt want to go and hustle his head off getting into the soupandfish for a lot of folks that hes seen in just reglar ordinary clothes that same day  you know you enjoy being seen in one the other evening you admitted you were glad id insisted on your dressing you said you felt a lot better for it and oh georgie i do wish you wouldnt say tux its dinnerjacket  rats whats the odds  well its what all the nice folks say suppose lucile mckelvey heard you calling it a tux  well thats all right now lucile mckelvey cant pull anything on me her folks are common as mud even if her husband and her dad are millionaires i suppose youre trying to rub in your exalted social position well let me tell you that your revered paternal ancestor henry t doesnt even call it a tux he calls it a bobtail jacket for a ringtail monkey and you couldnt get him into one unless you chloroformed him  now dont be horrid george  well i dont want to be horrid but lord youre getting as fussy as verona ever since she got out of college shes been too rambunctious to live withdoesnt know what she wantswell i know what she wantsall she wants is to marry a millionaire and live in europe and hold some preachers hand and simultaneously at the same time stay right here in zenith and be some blooming kind of a socialist agitator or boss charityworker or some damn thing lord and ted is just as bad he wants to go to college and he doesnt want to go to college only one of the three that knows her own mind is tinka simply cant understand how i ever came to have a pair of shillyshallying children like rone and ted i may not be any rockefeller or james j shakespeare but i certainly do know my own mind and i do keep right on plugging along in the office anddo you know the latest far as i can figure out teds new bee is hed like to be a movie actor andand here ive told him a hundred times if hell go to college and lawschool and make good ill set him up in business andverona just exactly as bad doesnt know what she wants well well come on arent you ready yet the girl rang the bell three minutes ago   v  before he followed his wife babbitt stood at the westernmost window of their room this residential settlement floral heights was on a rise and though the center of the city was three miles awayzenith had between three and four hundred thousand inhabitants nowhe could see the top of the second national tower an indiana limestone building of thirtyfive stories  its shining walls rose against april sky to a simple cornice like a streak of white fire integrity was in the tower and decision it bore its strength lightly as a tall soldier as babbitt stared the nervousness was soothed from his face his slack chin lifted in reverence all he articulated was thats one lovely sight but he was inspired by the rhythm of the city his love of it renewed he beheld the tower as a templespire of the religion of business a faith passionate exalted surpassing common men and as he clumped down to breakfast he whistled the ballad oh by gee by gosh by jingo as though it were a hymn melancholy and noble     chapter ii  relieved of babbitts bumbling and the soft grunts with which his wife expressed the sympathy she was too experienced to feel and much too experienced not to show their bedroom settled instantly into impersonality  it gave on the sleepingporch it served both of them as dressingroom and on the coldest nights babbitt luxuriously gave up the duty of being manly and retreated to the bed inside to curl his toes in the warmth and laugh at the january gale  the room displayed a modest and pleasant colorscheme after one of the best standard designs of the decorator who did the interiors for most of the speculativebuilders houses in zenith the walls were gray the woodwork white the rug a serene blue and very much like mahogany was the furniturethe bureau with its great clear mirror mrs babbitts dressingtable with toiletarticles of almost solid silver the plain twin beds between them a small table holding a standard electric bedside lamp a glass for water and a standard bedside book with colored illustrationswhat particular book it was cannot be ascertained since no one had ever opened it the mattresses were firm but not hard triumphant modern mattresses which had cost a great deal of money the hotwater radiator was of exactly the proper scientific surface for the cubic contents of the room the windows were large and easily opened with the best catches and cords and holland rollershades guaranteed not to crack it was a masterpiece among bedrooms right out of cheerful modern houses for medium incomes only it had nothing to do with the babbitts nor with any one else if people had ever lived and loved here read thrillers at midnight and lain in beautiful indolence on a sunday morning there were no signs of it it had the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel one expected the chambermaid to come in and make it ready for people who would stay but one night go without looking back and never think of it again  every second house in floral heights had a bedroom precisely like this  the babbitts house was five years old it was all as competent and glossy as this bedroom it had the best of taste the best of inexpensive rugs a simple and laudable architecture and the latest conveniences throughout electricity took the place of candles and slatternly hearthfires along the bedroom baseboard were three plugs for electric lamps concealed by little brass doors in the halls were plugs for the vacuum cleaner and in the livingroom plugs for the piano lamp for the electric fan the trim diningroom with its admirable oak buffet its leadedglass cupboard its creamy plaster walls its modest scene of a salmon expiring upon a pile of oysters had plugs which supplied the electric percolator and the electric toaster  in fact there was but one thing wrong with the babbitt house it was not a home   ii  often of a morning babbitt came bouncing and jesting in to breakfast but things were mysteriously awry today as he pontifically tread the upper hall he looked into veronas bedroom and protested whats the use of giving the family a highclass house when they dont appreciate it and tend to business and get down to brass tacks  he marched upon them verona a dumpy brownhaired girl of twentytwo just out of bryn mawr given to solicitudes about duty and sex and god and the unconquerable bagginess of the gray sportssuit she was now wearing tedtheodore roosevelt babbitta decorative boy of seventeen tinkakatherinestill a baby at ten with radiant red hair and a thin skin which hinted of too much candy and too many ice cream sodas babbitt did not show his vague irritation as he tramped in he really disliked being a family tyrant and his nagging was as meaningless as it was frequent he shouted at tinka well kittiedoolie it was the only pet name in his vocabulary except the dear and hon with which he recognized his wife and he flung it at tinka every morning  he gulped a cup of coffee in the hope of pacifying his stomach and his soul his stomach ceased to feel as though it did not belong to him but verona began to be conscientious and annoying and abruptly there returned to babbitt the doubts regarding life and families and business which had clawed at him when his dreamlife and the slim fairy girl had fled  verona had for six months been filingclerk at the gruensberg leather company offices with a prospect of becoming secretary to mr gruensberg and thus as babbitt defined it getting some good out of your expensive college education till youre ready to marry and settle down  but now said verona father i was talking to a classmate of mine thats working for the associated charitiesoh dad theres the sweetest little babies that come to the milkstation thereand i feel as though i ought to be doing something worth while like that  what do you mean worth while if you get to be gruensbergs secretaryand maybe you would if you kept up your shorthand and didnt go sneaking off to concerts and talkfests every eveningi guess youll find thirtyfive or forty bones a week worth while  i know butoh i want tocontributei wish i were working in a settlementhouse i wonder if i could get one of the departmentstores to let me put in a welfaredepartment with a nice restroom and chintzes and wicker chairs and so on and so forth or i could  now you look here the first thing you got to understand is that all this uplift and flipflop and settlementwork and recreation is nothing in gods world but the entering wedge for socialism the sooner a man learns he isnt going to be coddled and he neednt expect a lot of free grub and uh all these free classes and flipflop and doodads for his kids unless he earns em why the sooner hell get on the job and produceproduceproduce thats what the country needs and not all this fancy stuff that just enfeebles the willpower of the working man and gives his kids a lot of notions above their class and youif youd tend to business instead of fooling and fussingall the time when i was a young man i made up my mind what i wanted to do and stuck to it through thick and thin and thats why im where i am today andmyra what do you let the girl chop the toast up into these dinky little chunks for cant get your fist onto em half cold anyway  ted babbitt junior in the great east side high school had been making hiccuplike sounds of interruption he blurted now say rone you going to  verona whirled ted will you kindly not interrupt us when were talking about serious matters  aw punk said ted judicially ever since somebody slipped up and let you out of college ammonia you been pulling these nut conversations about whatnots and soonandsoforths are you going toi want to use the car tonight  babbitt snorted oh you do may want it myself verona protested oh you do mr smarty im going to take it myself tinka wailed oh papa you said maybe youd drive us down to rosedale and mrs babbitt careful tinka your sleeve is in the butter they glared and verona hurled ted youre a perfect pig about the car  course youre not not atall ted could be maddeningly bland you just want to grab it off right after dinner and leave it in front of some skirts house all evening while you sit and gas about liteature and the highbrows youre going to marryif they only propose  well dad oughtnt to ever let you have it you and those beastly jones boys drive like maniacs the idea of your taking the turn on chautauqua place at forty miles an hour  aw where do you get that stuff youre so darn scared of the car that you drive uphill with the emergency brake on  i do not and youalways talking about how much you know about motors and eunice littlefield told me you said the battery fed the generator  youwhy my good woman you dont know a generator from a differential not unreasonably was ted lofty with her he was a natural mechanic a maker and tinkerer of machines he lisped in blueprints for the blueprints came  thatll do now babbitt flung in mechanically as he lighted the gloriously satisfying first cigar of the day and tasted the exhilarating drug of the advocatetimes headlines  ted negotiated gee honest rone i dont want to take the old boat but i promised couple o girls in my class id drive em down to the rehearsal of the school chorus and gee i dont want to but a gentlemans got to keep his social engagements  well upon my word you and your social engagements in high school  oh aint we select since we went to that hen college let me tell you there isnt a private school in the state thats got as swell a bunch as we got in gamma digamma this year theres two fellows that their dads are millionaires say gee i ought to have a car of my own like lots of the fellows babbitt almost rose a car of your own dont you want a yacht and a house and lot that pretty nearly takes the cake a boy that cant pass his latin examinations like any other boy ought to and he expects me to give him a motorcar and i suppose a chauffeur and an areoplane maybe as a reward for the hard work he puts in going to the movies with eunice littlefield well when you see me giving you  somewhat later after diplomacies ted persuaded verona to admit that she was merely going to the armory that evening to see the dog and cat show she was then ted planned to park the car in front of the candystore across from the armory and he would pick it up there were masterly arrangements regarding leaving the key and having the gasoline tank filled and passionately devotees of the great god motor they hymned the patch on the spare innertube and the lost jackhandle   their truce dissolving ted observed that her friends were a scream of a bunchstuckup gabby fourflushers his friends she indicated were disgusting imitation sports and horrid little shrieking ignorant girls further its disgusting of you to smoke cigarettes and so on and so forth and those clothes youve got on this morning theyre too utterly ridiculoushonestly simply disgusting  ted balanced over to the low beveled mirror in the buffet regarded his charms and smirked his suit the latest thing in old eli togs was skintight with skimpy trousers to the tops of his glaring tan boots a chorusman waistline pattern of an agitated check and across the back a belt which belted nothing his scarf was an enormous black silk wad his flaxen hair was icesmooth pasted back without parting when he went to school he would add a cap with a long vizor like a shovelblade proudest of all was his waistcoat saved for begged for plotted for a real fancy vest of fawn with polka dots of a decayed red the points astoundingly long on the lower edge of it he wore a highschool button a class button and a fraternity pin  and none of it mattered he was supple and swift and flushed his eyes which he believed to be cynical were candidly eager but he was not overgentle he waved his hand at poor dumpy verona and drawled yes i guess were pretty ridiculous and disgusticulus and i rather guess our new necktie is some smear  babbitt barked it is and while youre admiring yourself let me tell you it might add to your manly beauty if you wiped some of that egg off your mouth  verona giggled momentary victor in the greatest of great wars which is the family war ted looked at her hopelessly then shrieked at tinka for the love o pete quit pouring the whole sugar bowl on your corn flakes  when verona and ted were gone and tinka upstairs babbitt groaned to his wife nice family i must say i dont pretend to be any baalamb and maybe im a little crossgrained at breakfast sometimes but the way they go on jabjabjabbering i simply cant stand it i swear i feel like going off some place where i can get a little peace i do think after a mans spent his lifetime trying to give his kids a chance and a decent education its pretty discouraging to hear them all the time scrapping like a bunch of hyenas and neverand nevercurious here in the paper it saysnever silent for one momseen the morning paper yet  no dear in twentythree years of married life mrs babbitt had seen the paper before her husband just sixtyseven times  lots of news terrible big tornado in the south hard luck all right but this say this is corking beginning of the end for those fellows new york assembly has passed some bills that ought to completely outlaw the socialists and theres an elevatorrunners strike in new york and a lot of college boys are taking their places thats the stuff and a massmeeting in birminghams demanded that this mick agitator this fellow de valera be deported dead right by golly all these agitators paid with german gold anyway and we got no business interfering with the irish or any other foreign government keep our hands strictly off and theres another wellauthenticated rumor from russia that lenin is dead thats fine its beyond me why we dont just step in there and kick those bolshevik cusses out  thats so said mrs babbitt  and it says here a fellow was inaugurated mayor in overallsa preacher too what do you think of that  humph well  he searched for an attitude but neither as a republican a presbyterian an elk nor a realestate broker did he have any doctrine about preachermayors laid down for him so he grunted and went on she looked sympathetic and did not hear a word later she would read the headlines the society columns and the departmentstore advertisements  what do you know about this charley mckelvey still doing the sassiety stunt as heavy as ever heres what that gushy woman reporter says about last night   never is society with the big big s more flattered than when they are bidden to partake of good cheer at the distinguished and hospitable residence of mr and mrs charles l mckelvey as they were last night set in its spacious lawns and landscaping one of the notable sights crowning royal ridge but merry and homelike despite its mighty stone walls and its vast rooms famed for their decoration their home was thrown open last night for a dance in honor of mrs mckelveys notable guest miss j sneeth of washington the wide hall is so generous in its proportions that it made a perfect ballroom its hardwood floor reflecting the charming pageant above its polished surface even the delights of dancing paled before the alluring opportunities for teteatetes that invited the soul to loaf in the long library before the baronial fireplace or in the drawingroom with its deep comfy armchairs its shaded lamps just made for a sly whisper of pretty nothings all a deux or even in the billiard room where one could take a cue and show a prowess at still another game than that sponsored by cupid and terpsichore   there was more a great deal more in the best urban journalistic style of miss elnora pearl bates the popular society editor of the advocatetimes but babbitt could not abide it he grunted he wrinkled the newspaper he protested can you beat it im willing to hand a lot of credit to charley mckelvey when we were in college together he was just as hard up as any of us and hes made a million good bucks out of contracting and hasnt been any dishonester or bought any more city councils than was necessary and thats a good house of histhough it aint any mighty stone walls and it aint worth the ninety thousand it cost him but when it comes to talking as though charley mckelvey and all that boozehoisting set of his are any blooming bunch of of of vanderbilts why it makes me tired  timidly from mrs babbitt i would like to see the inside of their house though it must be lovely ive never been inside  well i have lots ofcouple of times to see chaz about business deals in the evening its not so much i wouldnt want to go there to dinner with that gang of of highbinders and ill bet i make a whole lot more money than some of those tinhorns that spend all they got on dresssuits and havent got a decent suit of underwear to their name hey what do you think of this  mrs babbitt was strangely unmoved by the tidings from the real estate and building column of the advocatetimes       ashtabula street 496j k dawson to      thomas mullally april 17 157 x 1122      mtg 4000              nom  and this morning babbitt was too disquieted to entertain her with items from mechanics liens mortgages recorded and contracts awarded he rose as he looked at her his eyebrows seemed shaggier than usual suddenly  yes maybekind of shame to not keep in touch with folks like the mckelveys we might try inviting them to dinner some evening oh thunder lets not waste our good time thinking about em our little bunch has a lot liver times than all those plutes just compare a real human like you with these neurotic birds like lucile mckelveyall highbrow talk and dressed up like a plush horse youre a great old girl hon  he covered his betrayal of softness with a complaining say dont let tinka go and eat any more of that poison nutfudge for heavens sake try to keep her from ruining her digestion i tell you most folks dont appreciate how important it is to have a good digestion and regular habits be back bout usual time i guess  he kissed herhe didnt quite kiss herhe laid unmoving lips against her unflushing cheek he hurried out to the garage muttering lord what a family and now myra is going to get pathetic on me because we dont train with this millionaire outfit oh lord sometimes id like to quit the whole game and the office worry and detail just as bad and i act cranky andi dont mean to but i getso darn tired     chapter iii  to george f babbitt as to most prosperous citizens of zenith his motor car was poetry and tragedy love and heroism the office was his pirate ship but the car his perilous excursion ashore  among the tremendous crises of each day none was more dramatic than starting the engine it was slow on cold mornings there was the long anxious whirr of the starter and sometimes he had to drip ether into the cocks of the cylinders which was so very interesting that at lunch he would chronicle it drop by drop and orally calculate how much each drop had cost him  this morning he was darkly prepared to find something wrong and he felt belittled when the mixture exploded sweet and strong and the car didnt even brush the doorjamb gouged and splintery with many bruisings by fenders as he backed out of the garage he was confused he shouted morning to sam doppelbrau with more cordiality than he had intended  babbitts green and white dutch colonial house was one of three in that block on chatham road to the left of it was the residence of mr samuel doppelbrau secretary of an excellent firm of bathroomfixture jobbers his was a comfortable house with no architectural manners whatever a large wooden box with a squat tower a broad porch and glossy paint yellow as a yolk babbitt disapproved of mr and mrs doppelbrau as bohemian from their house came midnight music and obscene laughter there were neighborhood rumors of bootlegged whisky and fast motor rides they furnished babbitt with many happy evenings of discussion during which he announced firmly im not straitlaced and i dont mind seeing a fellow throw in a drink once in a while but when it comes to deliberately trying to get away with a lot of hellraising all the while like the doppelbraus do its too rich for my blood  on the other side of babbitt lived howard littlefield phd in a strictly modern house whereof the lower part was dark red tapestry brick with a leaded oriel the upper part of pale stucco like spattered clay and the roof redtiled littlefield was the great scholar of the neighborhood the authority on everything in the world except babies cooking and motors he was a bachelor of arts of blodgett college and a doctor of philosophy in economics of yale he was the employmentmanager and publicitycounsel of the zenith street traction company he could on ten hours notice appear before the board of aldermen or the state legislature and prove absolutely with figures all in rows and with precedents from poland and new zealand that the streetcar company loved the public and yearned over its employees that all its stock was owned by widows and orphans and that whatever it desired to do would benefit propertyowners by increasing rental values and help the poor by lowering rents all his acquaintances turned to littlefield when they desired to know the date of the battle of saragossa the definition of the word sabotage the future of the german mark the translation of hinc illae lachrimae or the number of products of coal tar he awed babbitt by confessing that he often sat up till midnight reading the figures and footnotes in government reports or skimming with amusement at the authors mistakes the latest volumes of chemistry archeology and ichthyology  but littlefields great value was as a spiritual example despite his strange learnings he was as strict a presbyterian and as firm a republican as george f babbitt he confirmed the business men in the faith where they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of industry and manners was perfect dr howard littlefield proved it to them out of history economics and the confessions of reformed radicals  babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a savant and in teds intimacy with eunice littlefield at sixteen eunice was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages and salaries of motionpicture stars butas babbitt definitively put itshe was her fathers daughter  the difference between a light man like sam doppelbrau and a really fine character like littlefield was revealed in their appearances doppelbrau was disturbingly young for a man of fortyeight he wore his derby on the back of his head and his red face was wrinkled with meaningless laughter but littlefield was old for a man of fortytwo he was tall broad thick his goldrimmed spectacles were engulfed in the folds of his long face his hair was a tossed mass of greasy blackness he puffed and rumbled as he talked his phi beta kappa key shone against a spotty black vest he smelled of old pipes he was altogether funereal and archidiaconal and to realestate brokerage and the jobbing of bathroomfixtures he added an aroma of sanctity  this morning he was in front of his house inspecting the grass parking between the curb and the broad cement sidewalk babbitt stopped his car and leaned out to shout mornin littlefield lumbered over and stood with one foot up on the runningboard  fine morning said babbitt lightingillegally earlyhis second cigar of the day  yes its a mighty fine morning said littlefield  spring coming along fast now  yes its real spring now all right said littlefield  still cold nights though had to have a couple blankets on the sleepingporch last night  yes it wasnt any too warm last night said littlefield  but i dont anticipate well have any more real cold weather now  no but still there was snow at tiflis montana yesterday said the scholar and you remember the blizzard they had out west three days agothirty inches of snow at greeley coloradoand two years ago we had a snowsquall right here in zenith on the twentyfifth of april  is that a fact say old man what do you think about the republican candidate wholl they nominate for president dont you think its about time we had a real business administration  in my opinion what the country needs first and foremost is a good sound businesslike conduct of its affairs what we need isa business administration said littlefield  im glad to hear you say that i certainly am glad to hear you say that i didnt know how youd feel about it with all your associations with colleges and so on and im glad you feel that way what the country needsjust at this present junctureis neither a college president nor a lot of monkeying with foreign affairs but a goodsound economicalbusinessadministration that will give us a chance to have something like a decent turnover  yes it isnt generally realized that even in china the schoolmen are giving way to more practical men and of course you can see what that implies  is that a fact well well breathed babbitt feeling much calmer and much happier about the way things were going in the world well its been nice to stop and parleyvoo a second guess ill have to get down to the office now and sting a few clients well so long old man see you tonight so long   ii  they had labored these solid citizens twenty years before the hill on which floral heights was spread with its bright roofs and immaculate turf and amazing comfort had been a wilderness of rank secondgrowth elms and oaks and maples along the precise streets were still a few wooded vacant lots and the fragment of an old orchard it was brilliant today the apple boughs were lit with fresh leaves like torches of green fire the first white of cherry blossoms flickered down a gully and robins clamored  babbitt sniffed the earth chuckled at the hysteric robins as he would have chuckled at kittens or at a comic movie he was to the eye the perfect officegoing executivea wellfed man in a correct brown soft hat and frameless spectacles smoking a large cigar driving a good motor along a semisuburban parkway but in him was some genius of authentic love for his neighborhood his city his clan the winter was over the time was come for the building the visible growth which to him was glory he lost his dawn depression he was ruddily cheerful when he stopped on smith street to leave the brown trousers and to have the gasolinetank filled  the familiarity of the rite fortified him the sight of the tall red iron gasolinepump the hollowtile and terracotta garage the window full of the most agreeable accessoriesshiny casings sparkplugs with immaculate porcelain jackets tirechains of gold and silver he was flattered by the friendliness with which sylvester moon dirtiest and most skilled of motor mechanics came out to serve him mornin mr babbitt said moon and babbitt felt himself a person of importance one whose name even busy garagemen rememberednot one of these cheapsports flying around in flivvers he admired the ingenuity of the automatic dial clicking off gallon by gallon admired the smartness of the sign a fill in time saves getting stuckgas today 31 cents admired the rhythmic gurgle of the gasoline as it flowed into the tank and the mechanical regularity with which moon turned the handle  how much we takin today asked moon in a manner which combined the independence of the great specialist the friendliness of a familiar gossip and respect for a man of weight in the community like george f babbitt  fill er up  who you rootin for for republican candidate mr babbitt  its too early to make any predictions yet after all theres still a good month and two weeksno three weeksmust be almost three weekswell theres more than six weeks in all before the republican convention and i feel a fellow ought to keep an open mind and give all the candidates a showlook em all over and size em up and then decide carefully  thats a fact mr babbitt  but ill tell youand my stand on this is just the same as it was four years ago and eight years ago and itll be my stand four years from nowyes and eight years from now what i tell everybody and it cant be too generally understood is that what we need first last and all the time is a good sound business administration  by golly thats right  how do those front tires look to you  fine fine wouldnt be much work for garages if everybody looked after their car the way you do  well i do try and have some sense about it babbitt paid his bill said adequately oh keep the change and drove off in an ecstasy of honest selfappreciation it was with the manner of a good samaritan that he shouted at a respectablelooking man who was waiting for a trolley car have a lift as the man climbed in babbitt condescended going clear downtown whenever i see a fellow waiting for a trolley i always make it a practice to give him a liftunless of course he looks like a bum  wish there were more folks that were so generous with their machines dutifully said the victim of benevolence oh no taint a question of generosity hardly fact i always feeli was saying to my son just the other nightits a fellows duty to share the good things of this world with his neighbors and it gets my goat when a fellow gets stuck on himself and goes around tooting his horn merely because hes charitable  the victim seemed unable to find the right answer babbitt boomed on  pretty punk service the company giving us on these carlines nonsense to only run the portland road cars once every seven minutes fellow gets mighty cold on a winter morning waiting on a street corner with the wind nipping at his ankles  thats right the street car company dont care a damn what kind of a deal they give us something ought to happen to em  babbitt was alarmed but still of course it wont do to just keep knocking the traction company and not realize the difficulties theyre operating under like these cranks that want municipal ownership the way these workmen hold up the company for high wages is simply a crime and of course the burden falls on you and me that have to pay a sevencent fare fact theres remarkable service on all their linesconsidering  well uneasily  darn fine morning babbitt explained spring coming along fast  yes its real spring now  the victim had no originality no wit and babbitt fell into a great silence and devoted himself to the game of beating trolley cars to the corner a spurt a tailchase nervous speeding between the huge yellow side of the trolley and the jagged row of parked motors shooting past just as the trolley stoppeda rare game and valiant  and all the while he was conscious of the loveliness of zenith for weeks together he noticed nothing but clients and the vexing to rent signs of rival brokers today in mysterious malaise he raged or rejoiced with equal nervous swiftness and today the light of spring was so winsome that he lifted his head and saw  he admired each district along his familiar route to the office the bungalows and shrubs and winding irregular drive ways of floral heights the onestory shops on smith street a glare of plateglass and new yellow brick groceries and laundries and drugstores to supply the more immediate needs of east side housewives the market gardens in dutch hollow their shanties patched with corrugated iron and stolen doors billboards with crimson goddesses nine feet tall advertising cinema films pipe tobacco and talcum powder the old mansions along ninth street s e like aged dandies in filthy linen wooden castles turned into boardinghouses with muddy walks and rusty hedges jostled by fastintruding garages cheap apartmenthouses and fruitstands conducted by bland sleek athenians across the belt of railroadtracks factories with highperched watertanks and tall stacksfactories producing condensed milk paper boxes lightingfixtures motor cars then the business center the thickening darting traffic the crammed trolleys unloading and high doorways of marble and polished granite  it was bigand babbitt respected bigness in anything in mountains jewels muscles wealth or words he was for a springenchanted moment the lyric and almost unselfish lover of zenith he thought of the outlying factory suburbs of the chaloosa river with its strangely eroded banks of the orcharddappled tonawanda hills to the north and all the fat dairy land and big barns and comfortable herds as he dropped his passenger he cried gosh i feel pretty good this morning iii  epochal as starting the car was the drama of parking it before he entered his office as he turned from oberlin avenue round the corner into third street ne he peered ahead for a space in the line of parked cars he angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it ahead another car was leaving the curb and babbitt slowed up holding out his hand to the cars pressing on him from behind agitatedly motioning an old woman to go ahead avoiding a truck which bore down on him from one side with front wheels nicking the wroughtsteel bumper of the car in front he stopped feverishly cramped his steeringwheel slid back into the vacant space and with eighteen inches of room manoeuvered to bring the car level with the curb it was a virile adventure masterfully executed with satisfaction he locked a thiefproof steel wedge on the front wheel and crossed the street to his realestate office on the ground floor of the reeves building  the reeves building was as fireproof as a rock and as efficient as a typewriter fourteen stories of yellow pressed brick with clean upright unornamented lines it was filled with the offices of lawyers doctors agents for machinery for emery wheels for wire fencing for miningstock their gold signs shone on the windows the entrance was too modern to be flamboyant with pillars it was quiet shrewd neat along the third street side were a western union telegraph office the blue delft candy shop shotwells stationery shop and the babbittthompson realty company  babbitt could have entered his office from the street as customers did but it made him feel an insider to go through the corridor of the building and enter by the back door thus he was greeted by the villagers  the little unknown people who inhabited the reeves building corridorselevatorrunners starter engineers superintendent and the doubtfullooking lame man who conducted the news and cigar standwere in no way citydwellers they were rustics living in a constricted valley interested only in one another and in the building their main street was the entrance hall with its stone floor severe marble ceiling and the inner windows of the shops the liveliest place on the street was the reeves building barber shop but this was also babbitts one embarrassment himself he patronized the glittering pompeian barber shop in the hotel thornleigh and every time he passed the reeves shopten times a day a hundred timeshe felt untrue to his own village  now as one of the squirearchy greeted with honorable salutations by the villagers he marched into his office and peace and dignity were upon him and the mornings dissonances all unheard  they were heard again immediately  stanley graff the outside salesman was talking on the telephone with tragic lack of that firm manner which disciplines clients say uh i think i got just the house that would suit youthe percival house in linton oh youve seen it well howd it strike you huh oh irresolutely oh i see  as babbitt marched into his private room a coop with semipartition of oak and frosted glass at the back of the office he reflected how hard it was to find employees who had his own faith that he was going to make sales  there were nine members of the staff besides babbitt and his partner and fatherinlaw henry thompson who rarely came to the office the nine were stanley graff the outside salesmana youngish man given to cigarettes and the playing of pool old mat penniman general utility man collector of rents and salesman of insurancebroken silent gray a mystery reputed to have been a crack realestate man with a firm of his own in haughty brooklyn chester kirby laylock resident salesman out at the glen oriole acreage developmentan enthusiastic person with a silky mustache and much family miss theresa mcgoun the swift and rather pretty stenographer miss wilberta bannigan the thick slow laborious accountant and fileclerk and four freelance parttime commission salesmen  as he looked from his own cage into the main room babbitt mourned mcgouns a good stenog smarts a whip but stan graff and all those bums the zest of the spring morning was smothered in the stale office air  normally he admired the office with a pleased surprise that he should have created this sure lovely thing normally he was stimulated by the clean newness of it and the air of bustle but today it seemed flatthe tiled floor like a bathroom the ochercolored metal ceiling the faded maps on the hard plaster walls the chairs of varnished pale oak the desks and filingcabinets of steel painted in olive drab it was a vault a steel chapel where loafing and laughter were raw sin  he hadnt even any satisfaction in the new watercooler and it was the very best of watercoolers uptodate scientific and rightthinking it had cost a great deal of money in itself a virtue it possessed a nonconducting fiber icecontainer a porcelain waterjar guaranteed hygienic a dripless nonclogging sanitary faucet and machinepainted decorations in two tones of gold he looked down the relentless stretch of tiled floor at the watercooler and assured himself that no tenant of the reeves building had a more expensive one but he could not recapture the feeling of social superiority it had given him he astoundingly grunted id like to beat it off to the woods right now and loaf all day and go to gunchs again tonight and play poker and cuss as much as i feel like and drink a hundred and ninethousand bottles of beer  he sighed he read through his mail he shouted msgoun which meant miss mcgoun and began to dictate  this was his own version of his first letter  omar gribble send it to his office miss mcgoun yours of twentieth to hand and in reply would say look here gribble im awfully afraid if we go on shillyshallying like this well just naturally lose the allen sale i had allen up on carpet day before yesterday and got right down to cases and think i can assure youuh uh no change that all my experience indicates he is all right means to do business looked into his financial record which is finethat sentence

title insurance  so lets go yours sincerely  as he read and signed it in his correct flowing businesscollege hand babbitt reflected now thats a good strong letter and clears a bell now what thei never told mcgoun to make a third paragraph there wish shed quit trying to improve on my dictation but what i cant understand is why cant stan graff or chet laylock write a letter like that with punch with a kick  the most important thing he dictated that morning was the fortnightly formletter to be mimeographed and sent out to a thousand prospects it was diligently imitative of the best literary models of the day of hearttohearttalk advertisements salespulling letters discourses on the development of willpower and handshaking houseorgans as richly poured forth by the new school of poets of business he had painfully written out a first draft and he intoned it now like a poet delicate and distrait  say old man i just want to know can i do you a whaleuva favor honest no kidding i know youre interested in getting a house not merely a place where you hang up the old bonnet but a lovenest for the wife and kiddiesand maybe for the flivver out beyant be sure and spell that beyant miss mcgoun

allweather garage a bargain at 11250   dictation over with its need of sitting and thinking instead of bustling around and making a noise and really doing something babbitt sat creakily back in his revolving deskchair and beamed on miss mcgoun he was conscious of her as a girl of black bobbed hair against demure cheeks a longing which was indistinguishable from loneliness enfeebled him while she waited tapping a long precise pencilpoint on the desktablet he half identified her with the fairy girl of his dreams he imagined their eyes meeting with terrifying recognition imagined touching her lips with frightened reverence andshe was chirping any more mist babbitt he grunted that winds it up i guess and turned heavily away  for all his wandering thoughts they had never been more intimate than this he often reflected nev forget how old jake offutt said a wise bird never goes lovemaking in his own office or his own home start trouble sure but  in twentythree years of married life he had peered uneasily at every graceful ankle every soft shoulder in thought he had treasured them but not once had he hazarded respectability by adventuring now as he calculated the cost of repapering the styles house he was restless again discontented about nothing and everything ashamed of his discontentment and lonely for the fairy girl     chapter iv  it was a morning of artistic creation fifteen minutes after the purple prose of babbitts formletter chester kirby laylock the resident salesman at glen oriole came in to report a sale and submit an advertisement babbitt disapproved of laylock who sang in choirs and was merry at home over games of hearts and old maid he had a tenor voice wavy chestnut hair and a mustache like a camelshair brush babbitt considered it excusable in a familyman to growl seen this new picture of the kidhusky little devil eh but laylocks domestic confidences were as bubbling as a girls  say i think i got a peach of an ad for the glen mr babbitt why dont we try something in poetry honest itd have wonderful pullingpower listen       mid pleasures and palaces      wherever you may roam      you just provide the little bride      and well provide the home  do you get it seelike home sweet home dont you  yes yes yes hell yes of course i get it butoh i think wed better use something more dignified and forceful like we lead others follow or eventually why not now course i believe in using poetry and humor and all that junk when it turns the trick but with a highclass restricted development like the glen we better stick to the more dignified approach see how i mean well i guess thats all this morning chet   ii  by a tragedy familiar to the world of art the april enthusiasm of chet laylock served only to stimulate the talent of the older craftsman george f babbitt he grumbled to stanley graff that tancolored voice of chets gets on my nerves yet he was aroused and in one swoop he wrote  do you respect your loved ones  when the last sad rites of bereavement are over do you know for certain that you have done your best for the departed you havent unless they lie in the cemetery beautiful  linden lane  the only strictly uptodate burial place in or near zenith where exquisitely gardened plots look from daisydotted hillslopes across the smiling fields of dorchester       sole agents      babbittthompson realty company      reeves building  he rejoiced i guess thatll show chan mott and his weedy old wildwood cemetery something about modern merchandizing   iii  he sent mat penniman to the recorders office to dig out the names of the owners of houses which were displaying for rent signs of other brokers he talked to a man who desired to lease a storebuilding for a poolroom he ran over the list of homeleases which were about to expire he sent thomas bywaters a streetcar conductor who played at real estate in spare time to call on sidestreet prospects who were unworthy the strategies of stanley graff but he had spent his credulous excitement of creation and these routine details annoyed him one moment of heroism he had in discovering a new way of stopping smoking  he stopped smoking at least once a month he went through with it like the solid citizen he was admitted the evils of tobacco courageously made resolves laid out plans to check the vice tapered off his allowance of cigars and expounded the pleasures of virtuousness to every one he met he did everything in fact except stop smoking  two months before by ruling out a schedule noting down the hour and minute of each smoke and ecstatically increasing the intervals between smokes he had brought himself down to three cigars a day then he had lost the schedule  a week ago he had invented a system of leaving his cigarcase and cigarettebox in an unused drawer at the bottom of the correspondencefile in the outer office ill just naturally be ashamed to go poking in there all day long making a fool of myself before my own employees he reasoned by the end of three days he was trained to leave his desk walk to the file take out and light a cigar without knowing that he was doing it  this morning it was revealed to him that it had been too easy to open the file lock it that was the thing inspired he rushed out and locked up his cigars his cigarettes and even his box of safety matches and the key to the file drawer he hid in his desk but the crusading passion of it made him so tobaccohungry that he immediately recovered the key walked with forbidding dignity to the file took out a cigar and a matchbut only one match if ole cigar goes out itll by golly have to stay out later when the cigar did go out he took one more match from the file and when a buyer and a seller came in for a conference at eleventhirty naturally he had to offer them cigars his conscience protested why youre smoking with them but he bullied it oh shut up im busy now of course byandby there was no byandby yet his belief that he had crushed the unclean habit made him feel noble and very happy when he called up paul riesling he was in his moral splendor unusually eager  he was fonder of paul riesling than of any one on earth except himself and his daughter tinka they had been classmates roommates in the state university but always he thought of paul riesling with his dark slimness his precisely parted hair his noseglasses his hesitant speech his moodiness his love of music as a younger brother to be petted and protected paul had gone into his fathers business after graduation he was now a wholesaler and small manufacturer of preparedpaper roofing but babbitt strenuously believed and lengthily announced to the world of good fellows that paul could have been a great violinist or painter or writer why say the letters that boy sent me on his trip to the canadian rockies they just absolutely make you see the place as if you were standing there believe me he could have given any of these bloomin authors a whale of a run for their money  yet on the telephone they said only  south 343 no no no i said southsouth 343 say operator what the dickens is the trouble cant you get me south 343 why certainly theyll answer oh hello 343 wanta speak mist riesling mist babbitt talking   lo paul  yuh  s george speaking  yuh  hows old socks  fair to middlin how re you  fine paulibus well what do you know  oh nothing much  where you been keepin yourself  oh just stickin round whats up georgie  how bout lil lunch s noon  be all right with me i guess club  yuh meet you there twelvethirty  a right twelvethirty s long georgie   iv  his morning was not sharply marked into divisions interwoven with correspondence and advertisementwriting were a thousand nervous details calls from clerks who were incessantly and hopefully seeking five furnished rooms and bath at sixty dollars a month advice to mat penniman on getting money out of tenants who had no money  babbitts virtues as a realestate brokeras the servant of society in the department of finding homes for families and shops for distributors of foodwere steadiness and diligence he was conventionally honest he kept his records of buyers and sellers complete he had experience with leases and titles and an excellent memory for prices his shoulders were broad enough his voice deep enough his relish of hearty humor strong enough to establish him as one of the ruling caste of good fellows yet his eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and complacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned out by speculative builders all landscape gardening save the use of curving roads grass and six ordinary shrubs and all the commonest axioms of economics he serenely believed that the one purpose of the realestate business was to make money for george f babbitt true it was a good advertisement at boosters club lunches and all the varieties of annual banquets to which good fellows were invited to speak sonorously of unselfish public service the brokers obligation to keep inviolate the trust of his clients and a thing called ethics whose nature was confusing but if you had it you were a highclass realtor and if you hadnt you were a shyster a piker and a flybynight these virtues awakened confidence and enabled you to handle bigger propositions but they didnt imply that you were to be impractical and refuse to take twice the value of a house if a buyer was such an idiot that he didnt jew you down on the askingprice  babbitt spoke welland oftenat these orgies of commercial righteousness about the realtors function as a seer of the future development of the community and as a prophetic engineer clearing the pathway for inevitable changeswhich meant that a realestate broker could make money by guessing which way the town would grow this guessing he called vision  in an address at the boosters club he had admitted it is at once the duty and the privilege of the realtor to know everything about his own city and its environs where a surgeon is a specialist on every vein and mysterious cell of the human body and the engineer upon electricity in all its phases or every bolt of some great bridge majestically arching oer a mighty flood the realtor must know his city inch by inch and all its faults and virtues  though he did know the marketprice inch by inch of certain districts of zenith he did not know whether the police force was too large or too small or whether it was in alliance with gambling and prostitution he knew the means of fireproofing buildings and the relation of insurancerates to fireproofing but he did not know how many firemen there were in the city how they were trained and paid or how complete their apparatus he sang eloquently the advantages of proximity of schoolbuildings to rentable homes but he did not knowhe did not know that it was worth while to knowwhether the city schoolrooms were properly heated lighted ventilated furnished he did not know how the teachers were chosen and though he chanted one of the boasts of zenith is that we pay our teachers adequately that was because he had read the statement in the advocatetimes himself he could not have given the average salary of teachers in zenith or anywhere else  he had heard it said that conditions in the county jail and the zenith city prison were not very scientific he had with indignation at the criticism of zenith skimmed through a report in which the notorious pessimist seneca doane the radical lawyer asserted that to throw boys and young girls into a bullpen crammed with men suffering from syphilis delirium tremens and insanity was not the perfect way of educating them he had controverted the report by growling folks that think a jail ought to be a bloomin hotel thornleigh make me sick if people dont like a jail let em behave emselves and keep out of it besides these reform cranks always exaggerate that was the beginning and quite completely the end of his investigations into zeniths charities and corrections and as to the vice districts he brightly expressed it those are things that no decent man monkeys with besides smatter fact ill tell you confidentially its a protection to our daughters and to decent women to have a district where tough nuts can raise cain keeps em away from our own homes  as to industrial conditions however babbitt had thought a great deal and his opinions may be coordinated as follows  a good labor union is of value because it keeps out radical unions which would destroy property no one ought to be forced to belong to a union however all labor agitators who try to force men to join a union should be hanged in fact just between ourselves there oughtnt to be any unions allowed at all and as its the best way of fighting the unions every business man ought to belong to an employersassociation and to the chamber of commerce in union there is strength so any selfish hog who doesnt join the chamber of commerce ought to be forced to  in nothingas the expert on whose advice families moved to new neighborhoods to live there for a generationwas babbitt more splendidly innocent than in the science of sanitation he did not know a malariabearing mosquito from a bat he knew nothing about tests of drinking water and in the matters of plumbing and sewage he was as unlearned as he was voluble he often referred to the excellence of the bathrooms in the houses he sold he was fond of explaining why it was that no european ever bathed some one had told him when he was twentytwo that all cesspools were unhealthy and he still denounced them if a client impertinently wanted him to sell a house which had a cesspool babbitt always spoke about itbefore accepting the house and selling it  when he laid out the glen oriole acreage development when he ironed woodland and dipping meadow into a glenless orioleless sunburnt flat prickly with small boards displaying the names of imaginary streets he righteously put in a complete sewagesystem it made him feel superior it enabled him to sneer privily at the martin lumsen development avonlea which had a cesspool and it provided a chorus for the fullpage advertisements in which he announced the beauty convenience cheapness and supererogatory healthfulness of glen oriole the only flaw was that the glen oriole sewers had insufficient outlet so that waste remained in them not very agreeably while the avonlea cesspool was a waring septic tank  the whole of the glen oriole project was a suggestion that babbitt though he really did hate men recognized as swindlers was not too unreasonably honest operators and buyers prefer that brokers should not be in competition with them as operators and buyers themselves but attend to their clients interests only it was supposed that the babbittthompson company were merely agents for glen oriole serving the real owner jake offutt but the fact was that babbitt and thompson owned sixtytwo per cent of the glen the president and purchasing agent of the zenith street traction company owned twentyeight per cent and jake offutt a gangpolitician a small manufacturer a tobaccochewing old farceur who enjoyed dirty politics business diplomacy and cheating at poker had only ten per cent which babbitt and the traction officials had given to him for fixing health inspectors and fire inspectors and a member of the state transportation commission  but babbitt was virtuous he advocated though he did not practise the prohibition of alcohol he praised though he did not obey the laws against motorspeeding he paid his debts he contributed to the church the red cross and the y m c a he followed the custom of his clan and cheated only as it was sanctified by precedent and he never descended to trickerythough as he explained to paul riesling  course i dont mean to say that every ad i write is literally true or that i always believe everything i say when i give some buyer a good strong sellingspiel you seeyou see its like this in the first place maybe the owner of the property exaggerated when he put it into my hands and it certainly isnt my place to go proving my principal a liar and then most folks are so darn crooked themselves that they expect a fellow to do a little lying so if i was fool enough to never whoop the ante id get the credit for lying anyway in selfdefense i got to toot my own horn like a lawyer defending a clienthis bounden duty aint it to bring out the poor dubs good points why the judge himself would bawl out a lawyer that didnt even if they both knew the guy was guilty but even so i dont pad out the truth like cecil rountree or thayer or the rest of these realtors fact i think a fellow thats willing to deliberately up and profit by lying ought to be shot  babbitts value to his clients was rarely better shown than this morning in the conference at eleventhirty between himself conrad lyte and archibald purdy   v  conrad lyte was a realestate speculator he was a nervous speculator before he gambled he consulted bankers lawyers architects contracting builders and all of their clerks and stenographers who were willing to be cornered and give him advice he was a bold entrepreneur and he desired nothing more than complete safety in his investments freedom from attention to details and the thirty or forty per cent profit which according to all authorities a pioneer deserves for his risks and foresight he was a stubby man with a caplike mass of short gray curls and clothes which no matter how well cut seemed shaggy below his eyes were semicircular hollows as though silver dollars had been pressed against them and had left an imprint  particularly and always lyte consulted babbitt and trusted in his slow cautiousness  six months ago babbitt had learned that one archibald purdy a grocer in the indecisive residential district known as linton was talking of opening a butcher shop beside his grocery looking up the ownership of adjoining parcels of land babbitt found that purdy owned his present shop but did not own the one available lot adjoining he advised conrad lyte to purchase this lot for eleven thousand dollars though an appraisal on a basis of rents did not indicate its value as above nine thousand the rents declared babbitt were too low and by waiting they could make purdy come to their price this was vision he had to bully lyte into buying his first act as agent for lyte was to increase the rent of the battered storebuilding on the lot the tenant said a number of rude things but he paid  now purdy seemed ready to buy and his delay was going to cost him ten thousand extra dollarsthe reward paid by the community to mr conrad lyte for the virtue of employing a broker who had vision and who understood talking points strategic values key situations underappraisals and the psychology of salesmanship  lyte came to the conference exultantly he was fond of babbitt this morning and called him old hoss purdy the grocer a longnosed man and solemn seemed to care less for babbitt and for vision but babbitt met him at the street door of the office and guided him toward the private room with affectionate little cries of this way brother purdy he took from the correspondencefile the entire box of cigars and forced them on his guests he pushed their chairs two inches forward and three inches back which gave an hospitable note then leaned back in his deskchair and looked plump and jolly but he spoke to the weakling grocer with firmness  well brother purdy we been having some pretty tempting offers from butchers and a slew of other folks for that lot next to your store but i persuaded brother lyte that we ought to give you a shot at the property first i said to lyte itd be a rotten shame i said if somebody went and opened a combination grocery and meat market right next door and ruined purdys nice little business especially babbitt leaned forward and his voice was harsh it would be hard luck if one of these cashandcarry chainstores got in there and started cutting prices below cost till they got rid of competition and forced you to the wall  purdy snatched his thin hands from his pockets pulled up his trousers thrust his hands back into his pockets tilted in the heavy oak chair and tried to look amused as he struggled  yes theyre bad competition but i guess you dont realize the pulling power that personality has in a neighborhood business  the great babbitt smiled thats so just as you feel old man we thought wed give you first chance all right then  now look here purdy wailed i know fr a fact that a piece of property bout same size right near sold for less n eightyfive hundred twant two years ago and here you fellows are asking me twentyfour thousand dollars why id have to mortgagei wouldnt mind so much paying twelve thousand butwhy good god mr babbitt youre asking more n twice its value and threatening to ruin me if i dont take it  purdy i dont like your way of talking i dont like it one little bit supposing lyte and i were stinking enough to want to ruin any fellow human dont you suppose we know its to our own selfish interest to have everybody in zenith prosperous but all this is beside the point tell you what well do well come down to twentythree thousandfive thousand down and the rest on mortgageand if you want to wreck the old shack and rebuild i guess i can get lyte here to loosen up for a buildingmortgage on good liberal terms heavens man wed be glad to oblige you we dont like these foreign grocery trusts any better n you do but it isnt reasonable to expect us to sacrifice eleven thousand or more just for neighborliness is it how about it lyte you willing to come down  by warmly taking purdys part babbitt persuaded the benevolent mr lyte to reduce his price to twentyone thousand dollars at the right moment babbitt snatched from a drawer the agreement he had had miss mcgoun type out a week ago and thrust it into purdys hands he genially shook his fountain pen to make certain that it was flowing handed it to purdy and approvingly watched him sign  the work of the world was being done lyte had made something over nine thousand dollars babbitt had made a fourhundredandfifty dollar commission purdy had by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance been provided with a businessbuilding and soon the happy inhabitants of linton would have meat lavished upon them at prices only a little higher than those downtown  it had been a manly battle but after it babbitt drooped this was the only really amusing contest he had been planning there was nothing ahead save details of leases appraisals mortgages  he muttered makes me sick to think of lyte carrying off most of the profit when i did all the work the old skinflint andwhat else have i got to do today like to take a good long vacation motor trip something he sprang up rekindled by the thought of lunching with paul riesling     chapter v  babbitts preparations for leaving the office to its feeble self during the hour and a half of his lunchperiod were somewhat less elaborate than the plans for a general european war  he fretted to miss mcgoun what time you going to lunch well make sure miss bannigan is in then explain to her that if wiedenfeldt calls up shes to tell him im already having the title traced and oh b the way remind me tomorrow to have penniman trace it now if anybody comes in looking for a cheap house remember we got to shove that bangor road place off onto somebody if you need me ill be at the athletic club anduhanduhill be back by two  he dusted the cigarashes off his vest he placed a difficult unanswered letter on the pile of unfinished work that he might not fail to attend to it that afternoon for three noons now he had placed the same letter on the unfinished pile he scrawled on a sheet of yellow backingpaper the memorandum see abt apt h drs which gave him an agreeable feeling of having already seen about the apartmenthouse doors  he discovered that he was smoking another cigar he threw it away protesting darn it i thought youd quit this darn smoking he courageously returned the cigarbox to the correspondencefile locked it up hid the key in a more difficult place and raged ought to take care of myself and need more exercisewalk to the club every single noonjust what ill doevery nooncut out this motoring all the time  the resolution made him feel exemplary immediately after it he decided that this noon it was too late to walk  it took but little more time to start his car and edge it into the traffic than it would have taken to walk the three and a half blocks to the club   ii  as he drove he glanced with the fondness of familiarity at the buildings  a stranger suddenly dropped into the businesscenter of zenith could not have told whether he was in a city of oregon or georgia ohio or maine oklahoma or manitoba but to babbitt every inch was individual and stirring as always he noted that the california building across the way was three stories lower therefore three stories less beautiful than his own reeves building as always when he passed the parthenon shoe shine parlor a onestory hut which beside the granite and redbrick ponderousness of the old california building resembled a bathhouse under a cliff he commented gosh ought to get my shoes shined this afternoon keep forgetting it at the simplex office furniture shop the national cash register agency he yearned for a dictaphone for a typewriter which would add and multiply as a poet yearns for quartos or a physician for radium  at the nobby mens wear shop he took his left hand off the steeringwheel to touch his scarf and thought well of himself as one who bought expensive ties and could pay cash for em too by golly and at the united cigar store with its crimson and gold alertness he reflected wonder if i need some cigarsidiotplumb forgotgoing t cut down my fool smoking he looked at his bank the miners and drovers national and considered how clever and solid he was to bank with so marbled an establishment his high moment came in the clash of traffic when he was halted at the corner beneath the lofty second national tower his car was banked with four others in a line of steel restless as cavalry while the cross town traffic limousines and enormous movingvans and insistent motorcycles poured by on the farther corner pneumatic riveters rang on the sunplated skeleton of a new building and out of this tornado flashed the inspiration of a familiar face and a fellow booster shouted h are you george babbitt waved in neighborly affection and slid on with the traffic as the policeman lifted his hand he noted how quickly his car picked up he felt superior and powerful like a shuttle of polished steel darting in a vast machine  as always he ignored the next two blocks decayed blocks not yet reclaimed from the grime and shabbiness of the zenith of 1885 while he was passing the fiveandtencent store the dakota lodging house concordia hall with its lodgerooms and the offices of fortunetellers and chiropractors he thought of how much money he made and he boasted a little and worried a little and did old familiar sums  four hundred fifty plunks this morning from the lyte deal but taxes due lets see i ought to pull out eight thousand net this year and save fifteen hundred of thatno not if i put up garage andlets see six hundred and forty clear last month and twelve times sixforty makesmakeslet see six times twelve is seventytwo hundred andoh rats anyway ill make eight thousandgee now thats not so bad mighty few fellows pulling down eight thousand dollars a yeareight thousand good hard iron dollarsbet there isnt more than five per cent of the people in the whole united states that make more than uncle george does by golly right up at the top of the heap butway expenses arefamily wasting gasoline and always dressed like millionaires and sending that eighty a month to motherand all these stenographers and salesmen gouging me for every cent they can get  the effect of his scientific budgetplanning was that he felt at once triumphantly wealthy and perilously poor and in the midst of these dissertations he stopped his car rushed into a small newsandmiscellany shop and bought the electric cigarlighter which he had coveted for a week he dodged his conscience by being jerky and noisy and by shouting at the clerk guess this will prett near pay for itself in matches eh  it was a pretty thing a nickeled cylinder with an almost silvery socket to be attached to the dashboard of his car it was not only as the placard on the counter observed a dandy little refinement lending the last touch of class to a gentlemans auto but a priceless timesaver by freeing him from halting the car to light a match it would in a month or two easily save ten minutes  as he drove on he glanced at it pretty nice always wanted one he said wistfully the one thing a smoker needs too  then he remembered that he had given up smoking  darn it he mourned oh well i suppose ill hit a cigar once in a while andbe a great convenience for other folks might make just the difference in getting chummy with some fellow that would put over a sale andcertainly looks nice there certainly is a mighty clever little jigger gives the last touch of refinement and class iby golly i guess i can afford it if i want to not going to be the only member of this family that never has a single doggone luxury  thus laden with treasure after three and a half blocks of romantic adventure he drove up to the club   iii  the zenith athletic club is not athletic and it isnt exactly a club but it is zenith in perfection it has an active and smokemisted billiard room it is represented by baseball and football teams and in the pool and the gymnasium a tenth of the members sporadically try to reduce but most of its three thousand members use it as a cafe in which to lunch play cards tell stories meet customers and entertain outof town uncles at dinner it is the largest club in the city and its chief hatred is the conservative union club which all sound members of the athletic call a rotten snobbish dull expensive old holenot one good mixer in the placeyou couldnt hire me to join statistics show that no member of the athletic has ever refused election to the union and of those who are elected sixtyseven per cent resign from the athletic and are thereafter heard to say in the drowsy sanctity of the union lounge the athletic would be a pretty good hotel if it were more exclusive  the athletic club building is nine stories high yellow brick with glassy roofgarden above and portico of huge limestone columns below the lobby with its thick pillars of porous caen stone its pointed vaulting and a brown glazedtile floor like wellbaked breadcrust is a combination of cathedralcrypt and rathskellar the members rush into the lobby as though they were shopping and hadnt much time for it thus did babbitt enter and to the group standing by the cigarcounter he whooped hows the boys hows the boys well well fine day  jovially they whooped backvergil gunch the coaldealer sidney finkelstein the ladiesreadytowear buyer for parcher  steins departmentstore and professor joseph k pumphrey owner of the riteway business college and instructor in public speaking business english scenario writing and commercial law though babbitt admired this savant and appreciated sidney finkelstein as a mighty smart buyer and a good liberal spender it was to vergil gunch that he turned with enthusiasm mr gunch was president of the boosters club a weekly lunchclub local chapter of a national organization which promoted sound business and friendliness among regular fellows he was also no less an official than esteemed leading knight in the benevolent and protective order of elks and it was rumored that at the next election he would be a candidate for exalted ruler he was a jolly man given to oratory and to chumminess with the arts he called on the famous actors and vaudeville artists when they came to town gave them cigars addressed them by their first names andsometimessucceeded in bringing them to the boosters lunches to give the boys a free entertainment he was a large man with hair en brosse and he knew the latest jokes but he played poker close to the chest it was at his party that babbitt had sucked in the virus of todays restlessness  gunch shouted hows the old bolsheviki how do you feel the morning after the night before  oh boy some head that was a regular party you threw verg hope you havent forgotten i took that last cute little jackpot babbitt bellowed he was three feet from gunch  thats all right now what ill hand you next time georgie say juh notice in the paper the way the new york assembly stood up to the reds  you bet i did that was fine eh nice day today  yes its one mighty fine spring day but nights still cold  yeh youre right they are had to have coupla blankets last night out on the sleepingporch say sid babbitt turned to finkelstein the buyer got something wanta ask you about i went out and bought me an electric cigarlighter for the car this noon and  good hunch said finkelstein while even the learned professor pumphrey a bulbous man with a pepperandsalt cutaway and a pipeorgan voice commented that makes a dandy accessory cigarlighter gives tone to the dashboard  yep finally decided id buy me one got the best on the market the clerk said it was paid five bucks for it just wondering if i got stuck what do they charge for em at the store sid  finkelstein asserted that five dollars was not too great a sum not for a really highclass lighter which was suitably nickeled and provided with connections of the very best quality i always sayand believe me i base it on a pretty fairly extensive mercantile experiencethe best is the cheapest in the long run of course if a fellow wants to be a jew about it he can get cheap junk but in the long run the cheapest thing isthe best you can get now you take here just th other day i got a new top for my old boat and some upholstery and i paid out a hundred and twentysix fifty and of course a lot of fellows would say that was too muchlord if the old folksthey live in one of these hick towns upstate and they simply cant get onto the way a city fellows mind works and then of course theyre jews and theyd lie right down and die if they knew sid had anted up a hundred and twentysix bones but i dont figure i was stuck george not a bit machine looks brand new nownot that its so darned old of course had it less n three years but i give it hard service never drive less n a hundred miles on sunday and uhoh i dont really think you got stuck george in the long run the best is you might say its unquestionably the cheapest  thats right said vergil gunch thats the way i look at it if a fellow is keyed up to what you might call intensive living the way you get it here in zenithall the hustle and mental activity thats going on with a bunch of livewires like the boosters and here in the zac why hes got to save his nerves by having the best  babbitt nodded his head at every fifth word in the roaring rhythm and by the conclusion in gunchs renowned humorous vein he was enchanted  still at that george dont knows you can afford it ive heard your business has been kind of under the eye of the govment since you stole the tail of eathorne park and sold it  oh youre a great little josher verg but when it comes to kidding how about this report that you stole the black marble steps off the postoffice and sold em for highgrade coal in delight babbitt patted gunchs back stroked his arm  thats all right but what i want to know is whos the realestate shark that bought that coal for his apartmenthouses   i guess thatll hold you for a while george said finkelstein ill tell you though boys what i did hear georges missus went into the gents wear department at parchers to buy him some collars and before she could give his necksize the clerk slips her some thirteens how juh know the size says mrs babbitt and the clerk says men that let their wives buy collars for em always wear thirteen madam hows that thats pretty good eh hows that eh i guess thatll about fix you george  ii babbitt sought for amiable insults in answer he stopped stared at the door paul riesling was coming in babbitt cried see you later boys and hastened across the lobby he was just then neither the sulky child of the sleepingporch the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table the crafty moneychanger of the lytepurdy conference nor the blaring good fellow the josher and regular guy of the athletic club he was an older brother to paul riesling swift to defend him admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women paul and he shook hands solemnly they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years not three daysand they said  hows the old horsethief  all right i guess howre you you poor shrimp  im firstrate you secondhand hunk o cheese  reassured thus of their high fondness babbitt grunted youre a fine guy you are ten minutes late riesling snapped well youre lucky to have a chance to lunch with a gentleman they grinned and went into the neronian washroom where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own images in the massy mirror voices thick satisfied authoritative hurtled along the marble walls bounded from the ceiling of lavenderbordered milky tiles while the lords of the city the barons of insurance and law and fertilizers and motor tires laid down the law for zenith announced that the day was warmindeed indisputably of spring that wages were too high and the interest on mortgages too low that babe ruth the eminent player of baseball was a noble man and that those two nuts at the climax vaudeville theater this week certainly are a slick pair of actors babbitt though ordinarily his voice was the surest and most episcopal of all was silent in the presence of the slight dark reticence of paul riesling he was awkward he desired to be quiet and firm and deft  the entrance lobby of the athletic club was gothic the washroom roman imperial the lounge spanish mission and the readingroom in chinese chippendale but the gem of the club was the diningroom the masterpiece of ferdinand reitman zeniths busiest architect it was lofty and halftimbered with tudor leaded casements an oriel a somewhat musicianless musiciansgallery and tapestries believed to illustrate the granting of magna charta the open beams had been handadzed at jake offutts carbody works the hinge were of handwrought iron the wainscot studded with handmade wooden pegs and at one end of the room was a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which the clubs advertisingpamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any of the fireplaces in european castles but of a draught incomparably more scientific it was also much cleaner as no fire had ever been built in it  half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men babbitt usually sat at the one near the door with a group including gunch finkelstein professor pumphrey howard littlefield his neighbor t cholmondeley frink the poet and advertisingagent and orville jones whose laundry was in many ways the best in zenith they composed a club within the club and merrily called themselves the roughnecks today as he passed their table the roughnecks greeted him come on sit in you n paul too proud to feed with poor folks afraid somebody might stick you for a bottle of bevo george strikes me you swells are getting awful darn exclusive  he thundered you bet we cant afford to have our reps ruined by being seen with you tightwads and guided paul to one of the small tables beneath the musiciansgallery he felt guilty at the zenith athletic club privacy was very bad form but he wanted paul to himself  that morning he had advocated lighter lunches and now he ordered nothing but english mutton chop radishes peas deepdish apple pie a bit of cheese and a pot of coffee with cream adding as he did invariably and uhoh and you might give me an order of french fried potatoes when the chop came he vigorously peppered it and salted it he always peppered and salted his meat and vigorously before tasting it  paul and he took up the springlike quality of the spring the virtues of the electric cigarlighter and the action of the new york state assembly it was not till babbitt was thick and disconsolate with mutton grease that he flung out  i wound up a nice little deal with conrad lyte this morning that put five hundred good round plunks in my pocket pretty nicepretty nice and yeti dont know whats the matter with me today maybe its an attack of spring fever or staying up too late at verg gunchs or maybe its just the winters work piling up but ive felt kind of down in the mouth all day long course i wouldnt beef about it to the fellows at the roughnecks table there but youever feel that way paul kind of comes over me here ive pretty much done all the things i ought to supported my family and got a good house and a sixcylinder car and built up a nice little business and i havent any vices specially except smokingand im practically cutting that out by the way and i belong to the church and play enough golf to keep in trim and i only associate with good decent fellows and yet even so i dont know that im entirely satisfied  it was drawled out broken by shouts from the neighboring tables by mechanical lovemaking to the waitress by stertorous grunts as the coffee filled him with dizziness and indigestion he was apologetic and doubtful and it was paul with his thin voice who pierced the fog  good lord george you dont suppose its any novelty to me to find that we hustlers that think were so allfired successful arent getting much out of it you look as if you expected me to report you as seditious you know what my own lifes been  i know old man  i ought to have been a fiddler and im a pedler of tarroofing and zillaoh i dont want to squeal but you know as well as i do about how inspiring a wife she is typical instance last evening we went to the movies there was a big crowd waiting in the lobby us at the tailend she began to push right through it with her sir how dare you mannerhonestly sometimes when i look at her and see how shes always so made up and stinking of perfume and looking for trouble and kind of always yelping i tell yuh im a lady damn yuhwhy i want to kill her well she keeps elbowing through the crowd me after her feeling good and ashamed till shes almost up to the velvet rope and ready to be the next let in but there was a little squirt of a man thereprobably been waiting half an houri kind of admired the little cussand he turns on zilla and says perfectly polite madam why are you trying to push past me and she simplygod i was so ashamedshe rips out at him youre no gentleman and she drags me into it and hollers paul this person insulted me and the poor skate he got ready to fight  i made out i hadnt heard themsure same as you wouldnt hear a boilerfactoryand i tried to look awayi can tell you exactly how every tile looks in the ceiling of that lobby theres one with brown spots on it like the face of the deviland all the time the people therethey were packed in like sardinesthey kept making remarks about us and zilla went right on talking about the little chap and screeching that folks like him oughtnt to be admitted in a place thats supposed to be for ladies and gentlemen and paul will you kindly call the manager so i can report this dirty rat andoof maybe i wasnt glad when i could sneak inside and hide in the dark  after twentyfour years of that kind of thing you dont expect me to fall down and foam at the mouth when you hint that this sweet clean respectable moral life isnt all its cracked up to be do you i cant even talk about it except to you because anybody else would think i was yellow maybe i am dont care any longer gosh youve had to stand a lot of whining from me first and last georgie  rats now paul youve never really what you could call whined sometimesim always blowing to myra and the kids about what a whale of a realtor i am and yet sometimes i get a sneaking idea im not such a pierpont morgan as i let on to be but if i ever do help by jollying you along old paulski i guess maybe saint pete may let me in after all  yuh youre an old blowhard georgie you cheerful cutthroat but youve certainly kept me going  why dont you divorce zilla  why dont i if i only could if shed just give me the chance you couldnt hire her to divorce me no nor desert me shes too fond of her three squares and a few pounds of nutcenter chocolates in between if shed only be what they call unfaithful to me george i dont want to be too much of a stinker back in college id ve thought a man who could say that ought to be shot at sunrise but honestly id be tickled to death if shed really go making love with somebody fat chance of course shell flirt with anythingyou know how she holds hands and laughsthat laughthat horrible brassy laughthe way she yaps you naughty man you better be careful or my big husband will be after youand the guy looking me over and thinking why you cute little thing you run away now or ill spank you and shell let him go just far enough so she gets some excitement out of it and then shell begin to do the injured innocent and have a beautiful time wailing i didnt think you were that kind of a person they talk about these demivierges in stories  these whats  but the wise hard corseted old married women like zilla are worse than any bobbedhaired girl that ever went boldly out into thishere storm of lifeand kept her umbrella slid up her sleeve but rats you know what zilla is how she nagsnagsnags how she wants everything i can buy her and a lot that i cant and how absolutely unreasonable she is and when i get sore and try to have it out with her she plays the perfect lady so well that even i get fooled and get all tangled up in a lot of why did you says and i didnt means ill tell you georgie you know my tastes are pretty fairly simplein the matter of food at least course as youre always complaining i do like decent cigarsnot those flor de cabagos youre smoking  thats all right now thats a good twofor by the way paul did i tell you i decided to practically cut out smok  yes youat the same time if i cant get what i like why i can do without it i dont mind sitting down to burnt steak with canned peaches and store cake for a thrilling little dessert afterwards but i do draw the line at having to sympathize with zilla because shes so rotten badtempered that the cook has quit and shes been so busy sitting in a dirty lace negligee all afternoon reading about some brave manly western hero that she hasnt had time to do any cooking youre always talking about moralsmeaning monogamy i suppose youve been the rock of ages to me all right but youre essentially a simp you  where d you get that simp little man let me tell you  love to look earnest and inform the world that its the duty of responsible business men to be strictly moral as an example to the community in fact youre so earnest about morality old georgie that i hate to think how essentially immoral you must be underneath all right you can  wait wait now whats  talk about morals all you want to old thing but believe me if it hadnt been for you and an occasional evening playing the violin to terrill ofarrells cello and three or four darling girls that let me forget this beastly joke they call respectable life id ve killed myself years ago  and business the roofing business roofs for cowsheds oh i dont mean i havent had a lot of fun out of the game out of putting it over on the labor unions and seeing a big check coming in and the business increasing but whats the use of it you know my business isnt distributing roofingits principally keeping my competitors from distributing roofing same with you all we do is cut each others throats and make the public pay for it  look here now paul youre pretty darn near talking socialism  oh yes of course i dont really exactly mean thati spose coursecompetitionbrings out the bestsurvival of the fittestbutbut i mean take all these fellows we know the kind right here in the club now that seem to be perfectly content with their homelife and their businesses and that boost zenith and the chamber of commerce and holler for a million population i bet if you could cut into their heads youd find that onethird of em are sureenough satisfied with their wives and kids and friends and their offices and onethird feel kind of restless but wont admit it and onethird are miserable and know it they hate the whole peppy boosting goahead game and theyre bored by their wives and think their families are foolsat least when they come to forty or fortyfive theyre boredand they hate business and theyd gowhy do you suppose theres so many mysterious suicides why do you suppose so many substantial citizens jumped right into the war think it was all patriotism  babbitt snorted what do you expect think we were sent into the world to have a soft time andwhat is itfloat on flowery beds of ease think man was just made to be happy  why not though ive never discovered anybody that knew what the deuce man really was made for  well we knownot just in the bible alone but it stands to reasona man who doesnt buckle down and do his duty even if it does bore him sometimes is nothing but awell hes simply a weakling mollycoddle in fact and what do you advocate come down to cases if a man is bored by his wife do you seriously mean he has a right to chuck her and take a sneak or even kill himself  good lord i dont know what rights a man has and i dont know the solution of boredom if i did id be the one philosopher that had the cure for living but i do know that about ten times as many people find their lives dull and unnecessarily dull as ever admit it and i do believe that if we busted out and admitted it sometimes instead of being nice and patient and loyal for sixty years and then nice and patient and dead for the rest of eternity why maybe possibly we might make life more fun  they drifted into a maze of speculation babbitt was elephantishly uneasy paul was bold but not quite sure about what he was being bold now and then babbitt suddenly agreed with paul in an admission which contradicted all his defense of duty and christian patience and at each admission he had a curious reckless joy he said at last  look here old paul you do a lot of talking about kicking things in the face but you never kick why dont you  nobody does habit too strong butgeorgie ive been thinking of one mild batoh dont worry old pillar of monogamy its highly proper it seems to be settled now isnt itthough of course zilla keeps rooting for a nice expensive vacation in new york and atlantic city with the bright lights and the bootlegged cocktails and a bunch of loungelizards to dance withbut the babbitts and the rieslings are sureenough going to lake sunasquam arent we why couldnt you and i make some excusesay business in new yorkand get up to maine four or five days before they do and just loaf by ourselves and smoke and cuss and be natural  great great idea babbitt admired  not for fourteen years had he taken a holiday without his wife and neither of them quite believed they could commit this audacity many members of the athletic club did go camping without their wives but they were officially dedicated to fishing and hunting whereas the sacred and unchangeable sports of babbitt and paul riesling were golfing motoring and bridge for either the fishermen or the golfers to have changed their habits would have been an infraction of their selfimposed discipline which would have shocked all rightthinking and regularized citizens  babbitt blustered why dont we just put our foot down and say were going on ahead of you and thats all there is to it nothing criminal in it simply say to zilla  you dont say anything to zilla simply why georgie shes almost as much of a moralist as you are and if i told her the truth shed believe we were going to meet some dames in new york and even myrashe never nags you the way zilla does but shed worry shed say dont you want me to go to maine with you i shouldnt dream of going unless you wanted me and youd give in to save her feelings oh the devil lets have a shot at duckpins  during the game of duckpins a juvenile form of bowling paul was silent as they came down the steps of the club not more than half an hour after the time at which babbitt had sternly told miss mcgoun he would be back paul sighed look here old man oughtnt to talked about zilla way i did  rats old man it lets off steam  oh i know after spending all noon sneering at the conventional stuff im conventional enough to be ashamed of saving my life by busting out with my fool troubles  old paul your nerves are kind of on the bum im going to take you away im going to rig this thing im going to have an important deal in new york andand sure of courseill need you to advise me on the roof of the building and the ole deal will fall through and therell be nothing for us but to go on ahead to maine ipaul when it comes right down to it i dont care whether you bust loose or not i do like having a rep for being one of the bunch but if you ever needed me id chuck it and come out for you every time not of course but what yourecourse i dont mean youd ever do anything that would putthat would put a decent position on the fritz butsee how i mean im kind of a clumsy old codger and i need your fine eyetalian hand weoh hell i cant stand here gassing all day on the job s long dont take any wooden money paulibus see you soon s long     chapter vi  i  he forgot paul riesling in an afternoon of not unagreeable details after a return to his office which seemed to have staggered on without him he drove a prospect out to view a fourflat tenement in the linton district he was inspired by the customers admiration of the new cigarlighter thrice its novelty made him use it and thrice he hurled halfsmoked cigarettes from the car protesting i got to quit smoking so blame much  their ample discussion of every detail of the cigarlighter led them to speak of electric flatirons and bedwarmers babbitt apologized for being so shabbily oldfashioned as still to use a hotwater bottle and he announced that he would have the sleepingporch wired at once he had enormous and poetic admiration though very little understanding of all mechanical devices they were his symbols of truth and beauty regarding each new intricate mechanismmetal lathe twojet carburetor machine gun oxyacetylene welderhe learned one good realisticsounding phrase and used it over and over with a delightful feeling of being technical and initiated  the customer joined him in the worship of machinery and they came buoyantly up to the tenement and began that examination of plastic slate roof kalamein doors and seveneighthsinch blindnailed flooring began those diplomacies of hurt surprise and readiness to be persuaded to do something they had already decided to do which would some day result in a sale  on the way back babbitt picked up his partner and fatherinlaw henry t thompson at his kitchencabinet works and they drove through south zenith a highcolored banging exciting region new factories of hollow tile with gigantic wireglass windows surly old redbrick factories stained with tar highperched watertanks big red trucks like locomotives and on a score of hectic sidetracks farwandering freightcars from the new york central and apple orchards the great northern and wheatplateaus the southern pacific and orange groves  they talked to the secretary of the zenith foundry company about an interesting artistic projecta castiron fence for linden lane cemetery they drove on to the zeeco motor company and interviewed the salesmanager noel ryland about a discount on a zeeco car for thompson babbitt and ryland were fellowmembers of the boosters club and no booster felt right if he bought anything from another booster without receiving a discount but henry thompson growled oh t hell with em im not going to crawl around mooching discounts not from nobody it was one of the differences between thompson the oldfashioned lean yankee rugged traditional stage type of american business man and babbitt the plump smooth efficient uptotheminute and otherwise perfected modern whenever thompson twanged put your john hancock on that line babbitt was as much amused by the antiquated provincialism as any proper englishman by any american he knew himself to be of a breeding altogether more esthetic and sensitive than thompsons he was a college graduate he played golf he often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars and when he went to chicago he took a room with a private bath the whole thing is he explained to paul riesling these old codgers lack the subtlety that you got to have today  this advance in civilization could be carried too far babbitt perceived noel ryland salesmanager of the zeeco was a frivolous graduate of princeton while babbitt was a sound and standard ware from that great departmentstore the state university ryland wore spats he wrote long letters about city planning and community singing and though he was a booster he was known to carry in his pocket small volumes of poetry in a foreign language all this was going too far henry thompson was the extreme of insularity and noel ryland the extreme of frothiness while between them supporting the state defending the evangelical churches and domestic brightness and sound business were babbitt and his friends  with this just estimate of himselfand with the promise of a discount on thompsons carhe returned to his office in triumph  but as he went through the corridor of the reeves building he sighed poor old paul i got tooh damn noel ryland damn charley mckelvey just because they make more money than i do they think theyre so superior i wouldnt be found dead in their stuffy old union club isomehow today i dont feel like going back to work oh well   ii  he answered telephone calls he read the four oclock mail he signed his mornings letters he talked to a tenant about repairs he fought with stanley graff  young graff the outside salesman was always hinting that he deserved an increase of commission and today he complained i think i ought to get a bonus if i put through the heiler sale im chasing around and working on it every single evening almost  babbitt frequently remarked to his wife that it was better to con your officehelp along and keep em happy stead of jumping on em and poking em upget more work out of em that way but this unexampled lack of appreciation hurt him and he turned on graff  look here stan lets get this clear youve got an idea somehow that its you that do all the selling where d you get that stuff where d you think youd be if it wasnt for our capital behind you and our lists of properties and all the prospects we find for you all you got to do is follow up our tips and close the deal the hallporter could sell babbittthompson listings you say youre engaged to a girl but have to put in your evenings chasing after buyers well why the devil shouldnt you what do you want to do sit around holding her hand let me tell you stan if your girl is worth her salt shell be glad to know youre out hustling making some money to furnish the homenest instead of doing the loveydovey the kind of fellow that kicks about working overtime that wants to spend his evenings reading trashy novels or spooning and exchanging a lot of nonsense and foolishness with some girl he aint the kind of upstanding energetic young man with a futureand with visionthat we want here how about it whats your ideal anyway do you want to make money and be a responsible member of the community or do you want to be a loafer with no inspiration or pep  graff was not so amenable to vision and ideals as usual you bet i want to make money thats why i want that bonus honest mr babbitt i dont want to get fresh but this heiler house is a terror nobodyll fall for it the flooring is rotten and the walls are full of cracks  thats exactly what i mean to a salesman with a love for his profession its hard problems like that that inspire him to do his best besides stanmatter o fact thompson and i are against bonuses as a matter of principle we like you and we want to help you so you can get married but we cant be unfair to the others on the staff if we start giving you bonuses dont you see were going to hurt the feeling and be unjust to penniman and laylock rights right and discrimination is unfair and there aint going to be any of it in this office dont get the idea stan that because during the war salesmen were hard to hire now when theres a lot of men out of work there arent a slew of bright young fellows that would be glad to step in and enjoy your opportunities and not act as if thompson and i were his enemies and not do any work except for bonuses how about it heh how about it  ohwellgeeof course sighed graff as he went out crabwise  babbitt did not often squabble with his employees he liked to like the people about him he was dismayed when they did not like him it was only when they attacked the sacred purse that he was frightened into fury but then being a man given to oratory and high principles he enjoyed the sound of his own vocabulary and the warmth of his own virtue today he had so passionately indulged in selfapproval that he wondered whether he had been entirely just  after all stan isnt a boy any more oughtnt to call him so hard but rats got to haul folks over the coals now and then for their own good unpleasant duty buti wonder if stan is sore whats he saying to mcgoun out there  so chill a wind of hatred blew from the outer office that the normal comfort of his evening homegoing was ruined he was distressed by losing that approval of his employees to which an executive is always slave ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy directions to the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks tomorrow and miss mcgoun and miss bannigan would do well to be there early and for heavens sake remind him to call up conrad lyte soon s he came in tonight he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness he was as afraid of his stillfaced clerksof the eyes focused on him miss mcgoun staring with head lifted from her typing miss bannigan looking over her ledger mat penniman craning around at his desk in the dark alcove stanley graff sullenly expressionlessas a parvenu before the bleak propriety of his butler he hated to expose his back to their laughter and in his effort to be casually merry he stammered and was raucously friendly and oozed wretchedly out of the door  but he forgot his misery when he saw from smith street the charms of floral heights the roofs of red tile and green slate the shining new sunparlors and the stainless walls   iii  he stopped to inform howard littlefield his scholarly neighbor that though the day had been springlike the evening might be cold he went in to shout where are you at his wife with no very definite desire to know where she was he examined the lawn to see whether the furnaceman had raked it properly with some satisfaction and a good deal of discussion of the matter with mrs babbitt ted and howard littlefield he concluded that the furnaceman had not raked it properly he cut two tufts of wild grass with his wifes largest dressmakingscissors he informed ted that it was all nonsense having a furnacemanbig husky fellow like you ought to do all the work around the house and privately he meditated that it was agreeable to have it known throughout the neighborhood that he was so prosperous that his son never worked around the house  he stood on the sleepingporch and did his days exercises arms out sidewise for two minutes up for two minutes while he muttered ought take more exercise keep in shape then went in to see whether his collar needed changing before dinner as usual it apparently did not  the lettishcroat maid a powerful woman beat the dinnergong   the roast of beef roasted potatoes and string beans were excellent this evening and after an adequate sketch of the days progressive weatherstates his fourhundredandfiftydollar fee his lunch with paul riesling and the proven merits of the new cigarlighter he was moved to a benign sort o thinking about buyin a new car dont believe well get one till next year but still we might  verona the older daughter cried oh dad if you do why dont you get a sedan that would be perfectly slick a closed car is so much more comfy than an open one  well now i dont know about that i kind of like an open car you get more fresh air that way  oh shoot thats just because you never tried a sedan lets get one its got a lot more class said ted  a closed car does keep the clothes nicer from mrs babbitt you dont get your hair blown all to pieces from verona its a lot sportier from ted and from tinka the youngest oh lets have a sedan mary ellens father has got one ted wound up oh everybodys got a closed car now except us  babbitt faced them i guess you got nothing very terrible to complain about anyway i dont keep a car just to enable you children to look like millionaires and i like an open car so you can put the top down on summer evenings and go out for a drive and get some good fresh air besidesa closed car costs more money  aw gee whiz if the doppelbraus can afford a closed car i guess we can prodded ted  humph i make eight thousand a year to his seven but i dont blow it all in and waste it and throw it around the way he does dont believe in this business of going and spending a whole lot of money to show off and  they went with ardor and some thoroughness into the matters of streamline bodies hillclimbing power wire wheels chrome steel ignition systems and body colors it was much more than a study of transportation it was an aspiration for knightly rank in the city of zenith in the barbarous twentieth century a familys motor indicated its social rank as precisely as the grades of the peerage determined the rank of an english familyindeed more precisely considering the opinion of old county families upon newly created brewery barons and woolenmill viscounts the details of precedence were never officially determined there was no court to decide whether the second son of a pierce arrow limousine should go in to dinner before the first son of a buick roadster but of their respective social importance there was no doubt and where babbitt as a boy had aspired to the presidency his son ted aspired to a packard twinsix and an established position in the motored gentry  the favor which babbitt had won from his family by speaking of a new car evaporated as they realized that he didnt intend to buy one this year ted lamented oh punk the old boat looks as if itd had fleas and been scratching its varnish off mrs babbitt said abstractedly snoway talkcher father babbitt raged if youre too much of a highclass gentleman and you belong to the bon ton and so on why you neednt take the car out this evening ted explained i didnt mean and dinner dragged on with normal domestic delight to the inevitable point at which babbitt protested come come now we cant sit here all evening give the girl a chance to clear away the table  he was fretting what a family i dont know how we all get to scrapping this way like to go off some place and be able to hear myself think paul  maine  wear old pants and loaf and cuss he said cautiously to his wife ive been in correspondence with a man in new yorkwants me to see him about a realestate trademay not come off till summer hope it doesnt break just when we and the rieslings get ready to go to maine be a shame if we couldnt make the trip there together well no use worrying now  verona escaped immediately after dinner with no discussion save an automatic why dont you ever stay home from babbitt  in the livingroom in a corner of the davenport ted settled down to his home study plain geometry cicero and the agonizing metaphors of comus  i dont see why they give us this oldfashioned junk by milton and shakespeare and wordsworth and all these hasbeens he protested oh i guess i could stand it to see a show by shakespeare if they had swell scenery and put on a lot of dog but to sit down in cold blood and read emthese teachershow do they get that way  mrs babbitt darning socks speculated yes i wonder why of course i dont want to fly in the face of the professors and everybody but i do think theres things in shakespearenot that i read him much but when i was young the girls used to show me passages that werent really they werent at all nice  babbitt looked up irritably from the comic strips in the evening advocate they composed his favorite literature and art these illustrated chronicles in which mr mutt hit mr jeff with a rotten egg and mother corrected fathers vulgarisms by means of a rollingpin with the solemn face of a devotee breathing heavily through his open mouth he plodded nightly through every picture and during the rite he detested interruptions furthermore he felt that on the subject of shakespeare he wasnt really an authority neither the advocatetimes the evening advocate nor the bulletin of the zenith chamber of commerce had ever had an editorial on the matter and until one of them had spoken he found it hard to form an original opinion but even at risk of floundering in strange bogs he could not keep out of an open controversy  ill tell you why you have to study shakespeare and those its because theyre required for college entrance and thats all there is to it personally i dont see myself why they stuck em into an uptodate highschool system like we have in this state be a good deal better if you took business english and learned how to write an ad or letters that would pull but there it is and theres no tall argument or discussion about it trouble with you ted is you always want to do something different if youre going to lawschooland you arei never had a chance to but ill see that you dowhy youll want to lay in all the english and latin you can get  oh punk i dont see whats the use of lawschoolor even finishing high school i dont want to go to college specially honest theres lot of fellows that have graduated from colleges that dont begin to make as much money as fellows that went to work early old shimmy peters that teaches latin in the high hes a whatisit from columbia and he sits up all night reading a lot of greasy books and hes always spieling about the value of languages and the poor soak doesnt make but eighteen hundred a year and no traveling salesman would think of working for that i know what id like to do id like to be an aviator or own a corking big garage or elsea fellow was telling me about it yesterdayid like to be one of these fellows that the standard oil company sends out to china and you live in a compound and dont have to do any work and you get to see the world and pagodas and the ocean and everything and then i could take up correspondencecourses thats the real stuff you dont have to recite to some frostyfaced old dame thats trying to show off to the principal and you can study any subject you want to just listen to these i clipped out the ads of some swell courses  he snatched from the back of his geometry half a hundred advertisements of those homestudy courses which the energy and foresight of american commerce have contributed to the science of education the first displayed the portrait of a young man with a pure brow an iron jaw silk socks and hair like patent leather standing with one hand in his trouserspocket and the other extended with chiding forefinger he was bewitching an audience of men with gray beards paunches bald heads and every other sign of wisdom and prosperity above the picture was an inspiring educational symbolno antiquated lamp or torch or owl of minerva but a row of dollar signs the text ran                                     power and prosperity in public speaking       a yarn told at the club  who do you think i ran into the other evening at the de luxe restaurant why old freddy durkee that used to be a dead oralive shipping clerk in my old placemr mouseman we used to laughingly call the dear fellow one time he was so timid he was plumb scared of the super and never got credit for the dandy work he did him at the de luxe and if he wasnt ordering a tony feed with all the fixings from celery to nuts and instead of being embarrassed by the waiters like he used to be at the little dump where we lunched in old lang syne he was bossing them around like he was a millionaire  i cautiously asked him what he was doing freddy laughed and said say old chum i guess youre wondering whats come over me youll be glad to know im now assistant super at the old shop and right on the high road to prosperity and domination and i look forward with confidence to a twelvecylinder car and the wife is making things hum in the best society and the kiddies getting a firstclass education   what we teach you  how to address your lodge  how to give toasts  how to tell dialect stories  how to propose to a lady  how to entertain banquets  how to make convincing sellingtalks  how to build big vocabulary  how to create a strong personality  how to become a rational powerful and original thinker  how to be a master man    prof w f peet  author of the shortcut course in publicspeaking is easily the foremost figure in practical literature psychology  oratory a graduate of some of our leading universities lecturer extensive traveler author of books poetry etc a man with the unique personality of the master minds he is ready to give you all the secrets of his culture and hammering force in a few easy lessons that will not interfere with other occupations   heres how it happened i ran across an ad of a course that claimed to teach people how to talk easily and on their feet how to answer complaints how to lay a proposition before the boss how to hit a bank for a loan how to hold a big audience spellbound with wit humor anecdote inspiration etc it was compiled by the master orator prof waldo f peet i was skeptical too but i wrote just on a postcard with name and address to the publisher for the lessonssent on trial money back if you are not absolutely satisfied there were eight simple lessons in plain language anybody could understand and i studied them just a few hours a night then started practising on the wife soon found i could talk right up to the super and get due credit for all the good work i did they began to appreciate me and advance me fast and say old doggo what do you think theyre paying me now 6500 per year and say i find i can keep a big audience fascinated speaking on any topic as a friend old boy i advise you to send for circular no obligation and valuable free art picture to       shortcut educational pub co      desk wa        sandpit iowa       are you a 100 percenter or a 10 percenter  babbitt was again without a canon which would enable him to speak with authority nothing in motoring or real estate had indicated what a solid citizen and regular fellow ought to think about culture by mail he began with hesitation  wellsounds as if it covered the ground it certainly is a fine thing to be able to orate ive sometimes thought i had a little talent that way myself and i know darn well that one reason why a fourflushing old backnumber like chan mott can get away with it in real estate is just because he can make a good talk even when he hasnt got a doggone thing to say and it certainly is pretty cute the way they get out all these courses on various topics and subjects nowadays ill tell you though no need to blow in a lot of good money on this stuff when you can get a firstrate course in eloquence and english and all that right in your own schooland one of the biggest school buildings in the entire country  thats so said mrs babbitt comfortably while ted complained  yuh but dad they just teach a lot of old junk that isnt any practical useexcept the manual training and typewriting and basketball and dancingand in these correspondencecourses gee you can get all kinds of stuff that would come in handy say listen to this one  can you play a mans part  if you are walking with your mother sister or best girl and some one passes a slighting remark or uses improper language wont you be ashamed if you cant take her part well can you  we teach boxing and selfdefense by mail many pupils have written saying that after a few lessons theyve outboxed bigger and heavier opponents the lessons start with simple movements practised before your mirrorholding out your hand for a coin the breaststroke in swimming etc before you realize it you are striking scientifically ducking guarding and feinting just as if you had a real opponent before you   oh baby maybe i wouldnt like that ted chanted ill tell the world gosh id like to take one fellow i know in school thats always shooting off his mouth and catch him alone  nonsense the idea most useless thing i ever heard of babbitt fulminated  well just suppose i was walking with mama or rone and somebody passed a slighting remark or used improper language what would i do  why youd probably bust the record for the hundredyard dash  i would not id stand right up to any mucker that passed a slighting remark on my sister and id show him  look here young dempsey if i ever catch you fighting ill whale the everlasting daylights out of youand ill do it without practising holding out my hand for a coin before the mirror too  why ted dear mrs babbitt said placidly its not at all nice your talking of fighting this way  well gosh almighty thats a fine way to appreciateand then suppose i was walking with you ma and somebody passed a slighting remark  nobodys going to pass no slighting remarks on nobody babbitt observed not if they stay home and study their geometry and mind their own affairs instead of hanging around a lot of poolrooms and sodafountains and places where nobodys got any business to be  but gooooooosh dad if they did  mrs babbitt chirped well if they did i wouldnt do them the honor of paying any attention to them besides they never do you always hear about these women that get followed and insulted and all but i dont believe a word of it or its their own fault the way some women look at a person i certainly never ve been insulted by  aw shoot mother just suppose you were sometime just suppose cant you suppose something cant you imagine things  certainly i can imagine things the idea  certainly your mother can imagine thingsand suppose things think youre the only member of this household thats got an imagination babbitt demanded but whats the use of a lot of supposing supposing never gets you anywhere no sense supposing when theres a lot of real facts to take into considera  look here dad supposei mean justjust suppose you were in your office and some rival realestate man  realtor  some realtor that you hated came in  i dont hate any realtor  but suppose you did  i dont intend to suppose anything of the kind theres plenty of fellows in my profession that stoop and hate their competitors but if you were a little older and understood business instead of always going to the movies and running around with a lot of fool girls with their dresses up to their knees and powdered and painted and rouged and god knows what all as if they were chorusgirls then youd knowand youd supposethat if theres any one thing that i stand for in the realestate circles of zenith it is that we ought to always speak of each other only in the friendliest terms and institute a spirit of brotherhood and cooperation and so i certainly cant suppose and i cant imagine my hating any realtor not even that dirty fourflushing society sneak cecil rountree  but  and theres no if and or but about it but if i were going to lambaste somebody i wouldnt require any fancy ducks or swimmingstrokes before a mirror or any of these doodads and flipflops suppose you were out some place and a fellow called you vile names think youd want to box and jump around like a dancingmaster youd just lay him out cold at least i certainly hope any son of mine would and then youd dust off your hands and go on about your business and thats all there is to it and you arent going to have any boxinglessons by mail either  well butyesi just wanted to show how many different kinds of correspondencecourses there are instead of all the camembert they teach us in the high  but i thought they taught boxing in the school gymnasium  thats different they stick you up there and some big stiff amuses himself pounding the stuffins out of you before you have a chance to learn hunka not any but anywaylisten to some of these others  the advertisements were truly philanthropic one of them bore the rousing headline money money money the second announced that mr p r formerly making only eighteen a week in a barber shop writes to us that since taking our course he is now pulling down 5000 as an osteovitalic physician and the third that miss j l recently a wrapper in a store is now getting ten real dollars a day teaching our hindu system of vibratory breathing and mental control  ted had collected fifty or sixty announcements from annual referencebooks from sunday school periodicals fictionmagazines and journals of discussion one benefactor implored dont be a wallflowerbe more popular and make more moneyyou can ukulele or sing yourself into society by the secret principles of a newly discovered system of music teaching any oneman lady or childcan without tiresome exercises

wistful appeal finger print detectives wantedbig incomes confided you redblooded men and womenthis is the profession you have been looking for theres money in it big money and that rapid change of scene that entrancing and compelling interest and fascination which your active mind and adventurous spirit crave think of being the chief figure and directing factor in solving strange mysteries and baffling crimes this wonderful profession brings you into contact with influential men on the basis of equality and often calls upon you to travel everywhere maybe to distant landsall expenses paid no special education required  oh boy i guess that wins the firebrick necklace wouldnt it be swell to travel everywhere and nab some famous crook whooped ted  well i dont think much of that doggone likely to get hurt still that musicstudy stunt might be pretty fair though theres no reason why if efficiencyexperts put their minds to it the way they have to routing products in a factory they couldnt figure out some scheme so a person wouldnt have to monkey with all this practising and exercises that you get in music babbitt was impressed and he had a delightful parental feeling that they two the men of the family understood each other  he listened to the notices of mailbox universities which taught shortstory writing and improving the memory motionpictureacting and developing the soulpower banking and spanish chiropody and photography electrical engineering and windowtrimming poultryraising and chemistry  wellwell babbitt sought for adequate expression of his admiration im a son of a gun i knew this correspondenceschool business had become a mighty profitable gamemakes suburban realestate look like two centsbut i didnt realize itd got to be such a reglar keyindustry must rank right up with groceries and movies always figured somebodyd come along with the brains to not leave education to a lot of bookworms and impractical theorists but make a big thing out of it yes i can see how a lot of these courses might interest you i must ask the fellows at the athletic if they ever realizedbut same time ted you know how advertisers i means some advertisers exaggerate i dont know as theyd be able to jam you through these courses as fast as they claim they can  oh sure dad of course ted had the immense and joyful maturity of a boy who is respectfully listened to by his elders babbitt concentrated on him with grateful affection  i can see what an influence these courses might have on the whole educational works course id never admit it publiclyfellow like myself a state u graduate its only decent and patriotic for him to blow his horn and boost the alma materbut smatter of fact theres a whole lot of valuable time lost even at the u studying poetry and french and subjects that never brought in anybody a cent i dont know but what maybe these correspondencecourses might prove to be one of the most important american inventions  trouble with a lot of folks is theyre so blame material they dont see the spiritual and mental side of american supremacy they think that inventions like the telephone and the areoplane and wirelessno that was a wop invention but anyway they think these mechanical improvements are all that we stand for whereas to a real thinker he sees that spiritual and uh dominating movements like efficiency and rotarianism and prohibition and democracy are what compose our deepest and truest wealth and maybe this new principle in educationathome may be anothermay be another factor i tell you ted weve got to have vision  i think those correspondencecourses are terrible  the philosophers gasped it was mrs babbitt who had made this discord in their spiritual harmony and one of mrs babbitts virtues was that except during dinnerparties when she was transformed into a raging hostess she took care of the house and didnt bother the males by thinking she went on firmly  it sounds awful to me the way they coax those poor young folks to think theyre learning something and nobody round to help them andyou two learn so quick but me i always was slow but just the same  babbitt attended to her nonsense get just as much studying at home you dont think a fellow learns any more because he blows in his fathers hardearned money and sits around in morris chairs in a swell harvard dormitory with pictures and shields and tablecovers and those doodads do you i tell you im a college mani know there is one objection you might make though i certainly do protest against any effort to get a lot of fellows out of barber shops and factories into the professions theyre too crowded already and whatll we do for workmen if all those fellows go and get educated  ted was leaning back smoking a cigarette without reproof he was for the moment sharing the high thin air of babbitts speculation as though he were paul riesling or even dr howard littlefield he hinted  well what do you think then dad wouldnt it be a good idea if i could go off to china or some peppy place and study engineering or something by mail  no and ill tell you why son ive found out its a mighty nice thing to be able to say youre a ba some client that doesnt know what you are and thinks youre just a plug business man he gets to shooting off his mouth about economics or literature or foreign trade conditions and you just ease in something like when i was in collegecourse i got my ba in sociology and all that junk oh it puts an awful crimp in their style but there wouldnt be any class to saying i got the degree of stamplicker from the bezuzus mailorder university you seemy dad was a pretty good old coot but he never had much style to him and i had to work darn hard to earn my way through college well its been worth it to be able to associate with the finest gentlemen in zenith at the clubs and so on and i wouldnt want you to drop out of the gentlemen classthe class that are just as redblooded as the common people but still have power and personality it would kind of hurt me if you did that old man  i know dad sure all right ill stick to it say gosh gee whiz i forgot all about those kids i was going to take to the chorus rehearsal ill have to duck  but you havent done all your homework  do it first thing in the morning  well  six times in the past sixty days babbitt had stormed you will not do it first thing in the morning youll do it right now but tonight he said well better hustle and his smile was the rare shy radiance he kept for paul riesling   iv  teds a good boy he said to mrs babbitt  oh he is  whos these girls hes going to pick up are they nice decent girls  i dont know oh dear ted never tells me anything any more i dont understand whats come over the children of this generation i used to have to tell papa and mama everything but seems like the children today have just slipped away from all control  i hope theyre decent girls course teds no longer a kid and i wouldnt want him to uh get mixed up and everything  george i wonder if you oughtnt to take him aside and tell him aboutthings she blushed and lowered her eyes  well i dont know way i figure it myra no sense suggesting a lot of things to a boys mind think up enough devilment by himself but i wonderits kind of a hard question wonder what littlefield thinks about it  course papa agrees with you he says all thisinstruction ishe says tisnt decent  oh he does does he well let me tell you that whatever henry t thompson thinksabout morals i mean though course you cant beat the old duffer  why what a way to talk of papa  simply cant beat him at getting in on the ground floor of a deal but let me tell you whenever he springs any ideas about higher things and education then i know i think just the opposite you may not regard me as any great brainshark but believe me im a regular college president compared with henry t yes sir by golly im going to take ted aside and tell him why i lead a strictly moral life  oh will you when  when when whats the use of trying to pin me down to when and why and where and how and when thats the trouble with women thats why they dont make highclass executives they havent any sense of diplomacy when the proper opportunity and occasion arises so it just comes in natural why then ill have a friendly little talk with him andandwas that tinka hollering upstairs she ought to been asleep long ago  he prowled through the livingroom and stood in the sunparlor that glasswalled room of wicker chairs and swinging couch in which they loafed on sunday afternoons outside only the lights of doppelbraus house and the dim presence of babbitts favorite elm broke the softness of april night  good visit with the boy getting over feeling cranky way i did this morning and restless though by golly i will have a few days alone with paul in maine    that devil zilla    but    teds all right whole family all right and good business not many fellows make four hundred and fifty bucks practically half of a thousand dollars easy as i did today maybe when we all get to rowing its just as much my fault as it is theirs oughtnt to get grouchy like i do butwish id been a pioneer same as my granddad but then wouldnt have a house like this ioh gosh i dont know  he thought moodily of paul riesling of their youth together of the girls they had known  when babbitt had graduated from the state university twentyfour years ago he had intended to be a lawyer he had been a ponderous debater in college he felt that he was an orator he saw himself becoming governor of the state while he read law he worked as a realestate salesman he saved money lived in a boardinghouse supped on poached egg on hash the lively paul riesling who was certainly going off to europe to study violin next month or next year was his refuge till paul was bespelled by zilla colbeck who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump and gaily wagging finger  babbitts evenings were barren then and he found comfort only in pauls second cousin myra thompson a sleek and gentle girl who showed her capacity by agreeing with the ardent young babbitt that of course he was going to be governor some day where zilla mocked him as a country boy myra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young dandies who had been born in the great city of zenithan ancient settlement in 1897 one hundred and five years old with two hundred thousand population the queen and wonder of all the state and to the catawba boy george babbitt so vast and thunderous and luxurious that he was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in zenith  of love there was no talk between them he knew that if he was to study law he could not marry for years and myra was distinctly a nice girlone didnt kiss her one didnt think about her that way at all unless one was going to marry her but she was a dependable companion she was always ready to go skating walking always content to hear his discourses on the great things he was going to do the distressed poor whom he would defend against the unjust rich the speeches he would make at banquets the inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct  one evening when he was weary and softminded he saw that she had been weeping she had been left out of a party given by zilla somehow her head was on his shoulder and he was kissing away the tearsand she raised her head to say trustingly now that were engaged shall we be married soon or shall we wait  engaged it was his first hint of it his affection for this brown tender woman thing went cold and fearful but he could not hurt her could not abuse her trust he mumbled something about waiting and escaped he walked for an hour trying to find a way of telling her that it was a mistake often in the month after he got near to telling her but it was pleasant to have a girl in his arms and less and less could he insult her by blurting that he didnt love her he himself had no doubt the evening before his marriage was an agony and the morning wild with the desire to flee  she made him what is known as a good wife she was loyal industrious and at rare times merry she passed from a feeble disgust at their closer relations into what promised to be ardent affection but it drooped into bored routine yet she existed only for him and for the children and she was as sorry as worried as himself when he gave up the law and trudged on in a rut of listing real estate  poor kid she hasnt had much better time than i have babbitt reflected standing in the dark sunparlor buti wish i could ve had a whirl at law and politics seen what i could do wellmaybe ive made more money as it is  he returned to the livingroom but before he settled down he smoothed his wifes hair and she glanced up happy and somewhat surprised     chapter vii  i  he solemnly finished the last copy of the american magazine while his wife sighed laid away her darning and looked enviously at the lingerie designs in a womens magazine the room was very still  it was a room which observed the best floral heights standards the gray walls were divided into artificial paneling by strips of whiteenameled pine from the babbitts former house had come two muchcarved rockingchairs but the other chairs were new very deep and restful upholstered in blue and goldstriped velvet a blue velvet davenport faced the fireplace and behind it was a cherrywood table and a tall pianolamp with a shade of golden silk two out of every three houses in floral heights had before the fireplace a davenport a mahogany table real or imitation and a pianolamp or a readinglamp with a shade of yellow or rose silk  on the table was a runner of goldthreaded chinese fabric four magazines a silver box containing cigarettecrumbs and three giftbookslarge expensive editions of fairytales illustrated by english artists and as yet unread by any babbitt save tinka  in a corner by the front windows was a large cabinet victrola eight out of every nine floral heights houses had a cabinet phonograph  among the pictures hung in the exact center of each gray panel were a red and black imitation english huntingprint an anemic imitation boudoirprint with a french caption of whose morality babbitt had always been rather suspicious and a handcolored photograph of a colonial roomrag rug maiden spinning cat demure before a white fireplace nineteen out of every twenty houses in floral heights had either a huntingprint a madame feit la toilette print a colored photograph of a new england house a photograph of a rocky mountain or all four  it was a room as superior in comfort to the parlor of babbitts boyhood as his motor was superior to his fathers buggy though there was nothing in the room that was interesting there was nothing that was offensive it was as neat and as negative as a block of artificial ice the fireplace was unsoftened by downy ashes or by sooty brick the brass fireirons were of immaculate polish and the grenadier andirons were like samples in a shop desolate unwanted lifeless things of commerce  against the wall was a piano with another pianolamp but no one used it save tinka the hard briskness of the phonograph contented them their store of jazz records made them feel wealthy and cultured and all they knew of creating music was the nice adjustment of a bamboo needle the books on the table were unspotted and laid in rigid parallels not one corner of the carpetrug was curled and nowhere was there a hockeystick a torn picturebook an old cap or a gregarious and disorganizing dog   ii  at home babbitt never read with absorption he was concentrated enough at the office but here he crossed his legs and fidgeted when his story was interesting he read the best that is the funniest paragraphs to his wife when it did not hold him he coughed scratched his ankles and his right ear thrust his left thumb into his vest pocket jingled his silver whirled the cigarcutter and the keys on one end of his watch chain yawned rubbed his nose and found errands to do he went upstairs to put on his slippershis elegant slippers of sealbrown shaped like medieval shoes he brought up an apple from the barrel which stood by the trunkcloset in the basement  an apple a day keeps the doctor away he enlightened mrs babbitt for quite the first time in fourteen hours  thats so  an apple is natures best regulator  yes it  trouble with women is they never have sense enough to form regular habits  well i  always nibbling and eating between meals  george she looked up from her reading did you have a light lunch today like you were going to i did  this malicious and unprovoked attack astounded him well maybe it wasnt as light aswent to lunch with paul and didnt have much chance to diet oh you neednt to grin like a chessy cat if it wasnt for me watching out and keeping an eye on our dietim the only member of this family that appreciates the value of oatmeal for breakfast i  she stooped over her story while he piously sliced and gulped down the apple discoursing  one thing ive done cut down my smoking  had kind of a runin with graff in the office hes getting too darn fresh ill stand for a good deal but once in a while i got to assert my authority and i jumped him stan i saidwell i told him just exactly where he got off  funny kind of a day makes you feel restless  wellllllllll uh that sleepiest sound in the world the terminal yawn mrs babbitt yawned with it and looked grateful as he droned how about going to bed eh dont suppose rone and ted will be in till all hours yep funny kind of a day not terribly warm but yetgosh id likesome day im going to take a long motor trip  yes wed enjoy that she yawned  he looked away from her as he realized that he did not wish to have her go with him as he locked doors and tried windows and set the heat regulator so that the furnacedrafts would open automatically in the morning he sighed a little heavy with a lonely feeling which perplexed and frightened him so absentminded was he that he could not remember which windowcatches he had inspected and through the darkness fumbling at unseen perilous chairs he crept back to try them all over again his feet were loud on the steps as he clumped upstairs at the end of this great and treacherous day of veiled rebellions   iii  before breakfast he always reverted to upstate village boyhood and shrank from the complex urban demands of shaving bathing deciding whether the current shirt was clean enough for another day whenever he stayed home in the evening he went to bed early and thriftily got ahead in those dismal duties it was his luxurious custom to shave while sitting snugly in a tubful of hot water he may be viewed tonight as a plump smooth pink baldish podgy goodman robbed of the importance of spectacles squatting in breasthigh water scraping his lathersmeared cheeks with a safetyrazor like a tiny lawnmower and with melancholy dignity clawing through the water to recover a slippery and active piece of soap  he was lulled to dreaming by the caressing warmth the light fell on the inner surface of the tub in a pattern of delicate wrinkled lines which slipped with a green sparkle over the curving porcelain as the clear water trembled babbitt lazily watched it noted that along the silhouette of his legs against the radiance on the bottom of the tub the shadows of the airbubbles clinging to the hairs were reproduced as strange jungle mosses he patted the water and the reflected light capsized and leaped and volleyed he was content and childish he played he shaved a swath down the calf of one plump leg  the drainpipe was dripping a dulcet and lively song drippety drip drip dribble drippety drip drip drip he was enchanted by it he looked at the solid tub the beautiful nickel taps the tiled walls of the room and felt virtuous in the possession of this splendor  he roused himself and spoke gruffly to his baththings come here youve done enough fooling he reproved the treacherous soap and defied the scratchy nailbrush with oh you would would you he soaped himself and rinsed himself and austerely rubbed himself he noted a hole in the turkish towel and meditatively thrust a finger through it and marched back to the bedroom a grave and unbending citizen  there was a moment of gorgeous abandon a flash of melodrama such as he found in trafficdriving when he laid out a clean collar discovered that it was frayed in front and tore it up with a magnificent yeeeeeing sound  most important of all was the preparation of his bed and the sleepingporch  it is not known whether he enjoyed his sleepingporch because of the fresh air or because it was the standard thing to have a sleepingporch  just as he was an elk a booster and a member of the chamber of commerce just as the priests of the presbyterian church determined his every religious belief and the senators who controlled the republican party decided in little smoky rooms in washington what he should think about disarmament tariff and germany so did the large national advertisers fix the surface of his life fix what he believed to be his individuality these standard advertised warestoothpastes socks tires cameras instantaneous hotwater heaterswere his symbols and proofs of excellence at first the signs then the substitutes for joy and passion and wisdom  but none of these advertised tokens of financial and social success was more significant than a sleepingporch with a sunparlor below  the rites of preparing for bed were elaborate and unchanging the blankets had to be tucked in at the foot of his cot also the reason why the maid hadnt tucked in the blankets had to be discussed with mrs babbitt the rag rug was adjusted so that his bare feet would strike it when he arose in the morning the alarm clock was wound the hotwater bottle was filled and placed precisely two feet from the bottom of the cot  these tremendous undertakings yielded to his determination one by one they were announced to mrs babbitt and smashed through to accomplishment at last his brow cleared and in his gnight rang virile power but there was yet need of courage as he sank into sleep just at the first exquisite relaxation the doppelbrau car came home he bounced into wakefulness lamenting why the devil cant some people never get to bed at a reasonable hour so familiar was he with the process of putting up his own car that he awaited each step like an able executioner condemned to his own rack  the car insultingly cheerful on the driveway the car door opened and banged shut then the garage door slid open grating on the sill and the car door again the motor raced for the climb up into the garage and raced once more explosively before it was shut off a final opening and slamming of the car door silence then a horrible silence filled with waiting till the leisurely mr doppelbrau had examined the state of his tires and had at last shut the garage door instantly for babbitt a blessed state of oblivion   iv  at that moment in the city of zenith horace updike was making love to lucile mckelvey in her mauve drawingroom on royal ridge after their return from a lecture by an eminent english novelist updike was zeniths professional bachelor a slimwaisted man of fortysix with an effeminate voice and taste in flowers cretonnes and flappers mrs mckelvey was redhaired creamy discontented exquisite rude and honest updike tried his invariable first maneuvertouching her nervous wrist  dont be an idiot she said  do you mind awfully  no thats what i mind  he changed to conversation he was famous at conversation he spoke reasonably of psychoanalysis long island polo and the ming platter he had found in vancouver she promised to meet him in deauville the coming summer though she sighed its becoming too dreadfully banal nothing but americans and frowsy english baronesses  and at that moment in zenith a cocainerunner and a prostitute were drinking cocktails in healey hansons saloon on front street since national prohibition was now in force and since zenith was notoriously lawabiding they were compelled to keep the cocktails innocent by drinking them out of teacups the lady threw her cup at the cocainerunners head he worked his revolver out of the pocket in his sleeve and casually murdered her  at that moment in zenith two men sat in a laboratory for thirtyseven hours now they had been working on a report of their investigations of synthetic rubber  at that moment in zenith there was a conference of four union officials as to whether the twelve thousand coalminers within a hundred miles of the city should strike of these men one resembled a testy and prosperous grocer one a yankee carpenter one a sodaclerk and one a russian jewish actor the russian jew quoted kautsky gene debs and abraham lincoln  at that moment a g a r veteran was dying he had come from the civil war straight to a farm which though it was officially within the citylimits of zenith was primitive as the backwoods he had never ridden in a motor car never seen a bathtub never read any book save the bible mcguffeys readers and religious tracts and he believed that the earth is flat that the english are the lost ten tribes of israel and that the united states is a democracy  at that moment the steel and cement town which composed the factory of the pullmore tractor company of zenith was running on night shift to fill an order of tractors for the polish army it hummed like a million bees glared through its wide windows like a volcano along the high wire fences searchlights played on cinderlined yards switchtracks and armed guards on patrol  at that moment mike monday was finishing a meeting mr monday the distinguished evangelist the bestknown protestant pontiff in america had once been a prizefighter satan had not dealt justly with him as a prizefighter he gained nothing but his crooked nose his celebrated vocabulary and his stagepresence the service of the lord had been more profitable he was about to retire with a fortune it had been well earned for to quote his last report rev mr monday the prophet with a punch has shown that he is the worlds greatest salesman of salvation and that by efficient organization the overhead of spiritual regeneration may be kept down to an unprecedented rockbottom basis he has converted over two hundred thousand lost and priceless souls at an average cost of less than ten dollars a head  of the larger cities of the land only zenith had hesitated to submit its vices to mike monday and his expert reclamation corps the more enterprising organizations of the city had voted to invite himmr george f babbitt had once praised him in a speech at the boosters club but there was opposition from certain episcopalian and congregationalist ministers those renegades whom mr monday so finely called a bunch of gospelpushers with dishwater instead of blood a gang of squealers that need more dust on the knees of their pants and more hair on their skinny old chests this opposition had been crushed when the secretary of the chamber of commerce had reported to a committee of manufacturers that in every city where he had appeared mr monday had turned the minds of workmen from wages and hours to higher things and thus averted strikes he was immediately invited  an expense fund of forty thousand dollars had been underwritten out on the county fair grounds a mike monday tabernacle had been erected to seat fifteen thousand people in it the prophet was at this moment concluding his message  theres a lot of smart college professors and teaguzzling slobs in this burg that say im a roughneck and a neverwuzzer and my knowledge of history is notyet oh theres a gang of woollywhiskered booklice that think they know more than almighty god and prefer a lot of hun science and smutty german criticism to the straight and simple word of god oh theres a swell bunch of lizzie boys and lemonsuckers and piefaces and infidels and beerbloated scribblers that love to fire off their filthy mouths and yip that mike monday is vulgar and full of mush those pups are saying now that i hog the gospelshow that im in it for the coin well now listen folks im going to give those birds a chance they can stand right up here and tell me to my face that im a galoot and a liar and a hick only if they doif they dodont faint with surprise if some of those rumdumm liars get one good swift poke from mike with all the kick of gods flaming righteousness behind the wallop well come on folks who says it who says mike monday is a fourflush and a yahoo huh dont i see anybody standing up well there you are now i guess the folks in this mans town will quit listening to all this kyoodling from behind the fence i guess youll quit listening to the guys that pan and roast and kick and beef and vomit out filthy atheism and all of you ll come in with every grain of pep and reverence you got and boost all together for jesus christ and his everlasting mercy and tenderness  at that moment seneca doane the radical lawyer and dr kurt yavitch the histologist whose report on the destruction of epithelial cells under radium had made the name of zenith known in munich prague and rome were talking in doanes library  zeniths a city with gigantic powergigantic buildings gigantic machines gigantic transportation meditated doane  i hate your city it has standardized all the beauty out of life it is one big railroad stationwith all the people taking tickets for the best cemeteries dr yavitch said placidly  doane roused im hanged if it is you make me sick kurt with your perpetual whine about standardization dont you suppose any other nation is standardized is anything more standardized than england with every house that can afford it having the same muffins at the same teahour and every retired general going to exactly the same evensong at the same gray stone church with a square tower and every golfing prig in harris tweeds saying right you are to every other prosperous ass yet i love england and for standardizationjust look at the sidewalk cafes in france and the lovemaking in italy  standardization is excellent per se when i buy an ingersoll watch or a ford i get a better tool for less money and i know precisely what im getting and that leaves me more time and energy to be individual in andi remember once in london i saw a picture of an american suburb in a toothpaste ad on the back of the saturday evening postan elmlined snowy street of these new houses georgian some of em or with low raking roofs andthe kind of street youd find here in zenith say in floral heights open trees grass and i was homesick theres no other country in the world that has such pleasant houses and i dont care if they are standardized its a corking standard  no what i fight in zenith is standardization of thought and of course the traditions of competition the real villains of the piece are the clean kind industrious family men who use every known brand of trickery and cruelty to insure the prosperity of their cubs the worst thing about these fellows is that theyre so good and in their work at least so intelligent you cant hate them properly and yet their standardized minds are the enemy  then this boostingsneakingly i have a notion that zenith is a better place to live in than manchester or glasgow or lyons or berlin or turin  it is not and i have lift in most of them murmured dr yavitch  well matter of taste personally i prefer a city with a future so unknown that it excites my imagination but what i particularly want  you said dr yavitch are a middleroad liberal and you havent the slightest idea what you want i being a revolutionist know exactly what i wantand what i want now is a drink   vi  at that moment in zenith jake offutt the politician and henry t thompson were in conference offutt suggested the thing to do is to get your fool soninlaw babbitt to put it over hes one of these patriotic guys when he grabs a piece of property for the gang he makes it look like we were dyin of love for the dear peepul and i do love to buy respectabilityreasonable wonder how long we can keep it up hank were safe as long as the good little boys like george babbitt and all the nice respectable laborleaders think you and me are rugged patriots theres swell pickings for an honest politician here hank a whole city working to provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us and rallying to our banner with indignation oh fierce indignation whenever some squealer like this fellow seneca doane comes along honest hank a smart codger like me ought to be ashamed of himself if he didnt milk cattle like them when they come around mooing for it but the traction gang cant get away with grand larceny like it used to i wonder whenhank i wish we could fix some way to run this fellow seneca doane out of town its him or us  at that moment in zenith three hundred and forty or fifty thousand ordinary people were asleep a vast unpenetrated shadow in the slum beyond the railroad tracks a young man who for six months had sought work turned on the gas and killed himself and his wife  at that moment lloyd mallam the poet owner of the hafiz book shop was finishing a rondeau to show how diverting was life amid the feuds of medieval florence but how dull it was in so obvious a place as zenith  and at that moment george f babbitt turned ponderously in bedthe last turn signifying that hed had enough of this worried business of falling asleep and was about it in earnest  instantly he was in the magic dream he was somewhere among unknown people who laughed at him he slipped away ran down the paths of a midnight garden and at the gate the fairy child was waiting her dear and tranquil hand caressed his cheek he was gallant and wise and wellbeloved warm ivory were her arms and beyond perilous moors the brave sea glittered     chapter viii  i  the great events of babbitts spring were the secret buying of realestate options in linton for certain streettraction officials before the public announcement that the linton avenue car line would be extended and a dinner which was as he rejoiced to his wife not only a regular society spread but a real sureenough highbrow affair with some of the keenest intellects and the brightest bunch of little women in town it was so absorbing an occasion that he almost forgot his desire to run off to maine with paul riesling  though he had been born in the village of catawba babbitt had risen to that metropolitan social plane on which hosts have as many as four people at dinner without planning it for more than an evening or two but a dinner of twelve with flowers from the florists and all the cutglass out staggered even the babbitts  for two weeks they studied debated and arbitrated the list of guests  babbitt marveled of course were uptodate ourselves but still think of us entertaining a famous poet like chum frink a fellow that on nothing but a poem or so every day and just writing a few advertisements pulls down fifteen thousand berries a year  yes and howard littlefield do you know the other evening eunice told me her papa speaks three languages said mrs babbitt  huh thats nothing so do iamerican baseball and poker  i dont think its nice to be funny about a matter like that think how wonderful it must be to speak three languages and so useful andand with people like that i dont see why we invite the orville joneses  well now orville is a mighty upandcoming fellow  yes i know buta laundry  ill admit a laundry hasnt got the class of poetry or real estate but just the same orvy is mighty deep ever start him spieling about gardening say that fellow can tell you the name of every kind of tree and some of their greek and latin names too besides we owe the joneses a dinner besides gosh we got to have some boob for audience when a bunch of hotair artists like frink and littlefield get going  well deari meant to speak of thisi do think that as host you ought to sit back and listen and let your guests have a chance to talk once in a while  oh you do do you sure i talk all the time and im just a business manoh sureim no phd like littlefield and no poet and i havent anything to spring well let me tell you just the other day your darn chum frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what i thought about the springfield schoolbond issue and who told him i did you bet your life i told him little me i certainly did he came up and asked me and i told him all about it you bet and he was darn glad to listen to me andduty as a host i guess i know my duty as a host and let me tell you  in fact the orville joneses were invited   ii  on the morning of the dinner mrs babbitt was restive  now george i want you to be sure and be home early tonight remember you have to dress  uhhuh i see by the advocate that the presbyterian general assembly has voted to quit the interchurch world movement that  george did you hear what i said you must be home in time to dress tonight  dress hell im dressed now think im going down to the office in my bvds  i will not have you talking indecently before the children and you do have to put on your dinnerjacket  i guess you mean my tux i tell you of all the doggone nonsensical nuisances that was ever invented  three minutes later after babbitt had wailed well i dont know whether im going to dress or not in a manner which showed that he was going to dress the discussion moved on  now george you mustnt forget to call in at vecchias on the way home and get the ice cream their deliverywagon is broken down and i dont want to trust them to send it by  all right you told me that before breakfast  well i dont want you to forget ill be working my head off all day long training the girl thats to help with the dinner  all nonsense anyway hiring an extra girl for the feed matilda could perfectly well  and i have to go out and buy the flowers and fix them and set the table and order the salted almonds and look at the chickens and arrange for the children to have their supper upstairs andand i simply must depend on you to go to vecchias for the ice cream  all riiiiiight gosh im going to get it  all you have to do is to go in and say you want the ice cream that mrs babbitt ordered yesterday by phone and it will be all ready for you  at tenthirty she telephoned to him not to forget the ice cream from vecchias  he was surprised and blasted then by a thought he wondered whether floral heights dinners were worth the hideous toil involved but he repented the sacrilege in the excitement of buying the materials for cocktails  now this was the manner of obtaining alcohol under the reign of righteousness and prohibition  he drove from the severe rectangular streets of the modern business center into the tangled byways of old townjagged blocks filled with sooty warehouses and lofts on into the arbor once a pleasant orchard but now a morass of lodginghouses tenements and brothels exquisite shivers chilled his spine and stomach and he looked at every policeman with intense innocence as one who loved the law and admired the force and longed to stop and play with them he parked his car a block from healey hansons saloon worrying well rats if anybody did see me theyd think i was here on business  he entered a place curiously like the saloons of anteprohibition days with a long greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind a pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of something which resembled whisky and with two men at the bar drinking something which resembled beer and giving that impression of forming a large crowd which two men always give in a saloon the bartender a tall pale swede with a diamond in his lilac scarf stared at babbitt as he stalked plumply up to the bar and whispered id uhfriend of hansons sent me here like to get some gin  the bartender gazed down on him in the manner of an outraged bishop i guess you got the wrong place my friend we sell nothing but soft drinks here he cleaned the bar with a rag which would itself have done with a little cleaning and glared across his mechanically moving elbow  the old dreamer at the table petitioned the bartender say oscar listen  oscar did not listen  aw say oscar listen will yuh say lissen  the decayed and drowsy voice of the loafer the agreeable stink of beerdregs threw a spell of inanition over babbitt the bartender moved grimly toward the crowd of two men babbitt followed him as delicately as a cat and wheedled say oscar i want to speak to mr hanson  whajuh wanta see him for  i just want to talk to him heres my card  it was a beautiful card an engraved card a card in the blackest black and the sharpest red announcing that mr george f babbitt was estates insurance rents the bartender held it as though it weighed ten pounds and read it as though it were a hundred words long he did not bend from his episcopal dignity but he growled ill see if hes around  from the back room he brought an immensely old young man a quiet sharpeyed man in tan silk shirt checked vest hanging open and burning brown trousersmr healey hanson mr hanson said only yuh but his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried babbitts soul and he seemed not at all impressed by the new darkgray suit for which as he had admitted to every acquaintance at the athletic club babbitt had paid a hundred and twentyfive dollars  glad meet you mr hanson say uhim george babbitt of the babbittthompson realty company im a great friend of jake offutts  well what of it  say uh im going to have a party and jake told me youd be able to fix me up with a little gin in alarm in obsequiousness as hansons eyes grew more bored you telephone to jake about me if you want to  hanson answered by jerking his head to indicate the entrance to the back room and strolled away babbitt melodramatically crept into an apartment containing four round tables eleven chairs a brewery calendar and a smell he waited thrice he saw healey hanson saunter through humming hands in pockets ignoring him  by this time babbitt had modified his valiant morning vow i wont pay one cent over seven dollars a quart to i might pay ten on hansons next weary entrance he besought could you fix that up hanson scowled and grated just a minutepetes sakejust a minute in growing meekness babbitt went on waiting till hanson casually reappeared with a quart of ginwhat is euphemistically known as a quartin his disdainful long white hands  twelve bucks he snapped  say uh but say capn jake thought youd be able to fix me up for eight or nine a bottle  nup twelve this is the real stuff smuggled from canada this is none o your neutral spirits with a drop of juniper extract the honest merchant said virtuously twelve bonesif you want it course y understand im just doing this anyway as a friend of jakes  sure sure i understand babbitt gratefully held out twelve dollars he felt honored by contact with greatness as hanson yawned stuffed the bills uncounted into his radiant vest and swaggered away  he had a number of titillations out of concealing the ginbottle under his coat and out of hiding it in his desk all afternoon he snorted and chuckled and gurgled over his ability to give the boys a real shot in the arm tonight he was in fact so exhilarated that he was within a block of his house before he remembered that there was a certain matter mentioned by his wife of fetching ice cream from vecchias he explained well darn it and drove back  vecchia was not a caterer he was the caterer of zenith most comingout parties were held in the white and gold ballroom of the maison vecchia at all nice teas the guests recognized the five kinds of vecchia sandwiches and the seven kinds of vecchia cakes and all really smart dinners ended as on a resolving chord in vecchia neapolitan ice cream in one of the three reliable moldsthe melon mold the round mold like a layer cake and the long brick  vecchias shop had pale blue woodwork tracery of plaster roses attendants in frilled aprons and glass shelves of kisses with all the refinement that inheres in whites of eggs babbitt felt heavy and thick amid this professional daintiness and as he waited for the ice cream he decided with hot prickles at the back of his neck that a girl customer was giggling at him he went home in a touchy temper the first thing he heard was his wifes agitated  george did you remember to go to vecchias and get the ice cream  say look here do i ever forget to do things  yes often  well now its darn seldom i do and it certainly makes me tired after going into a pinktea joint like vecchias and having to stand around looking at a lot of halfnaked young girls all rouged up like they were sixty and eating a lot of stuff that simply ruins their stomachs  oh its too bad about you ive noticed how you hate to look at pretty girls  with a jar babbitt realized that his wife was too busy to be impressed by that moral indignation with which males rule the world and he went humbly upstairs to dress he had an impression of a glorified diningroom of cutglass candles polished wood lace silver roses with the awed swelling of the heart suitable to so grave a business as giving a dinner he slew the temptation to wear his plaited dressshirt for a fourth time took out an entirely fresh one tightened his black bow and rubbed his patentleather pumps with a handkerchief he glanced with pleasure at his garnet and silver studs he smoothed and patted his ankles transformed by silk socks from the sturdy shanks of george babbitt to the elegant limbs of what is called a clubman he stood before the pierglass viewing his trim dinnercoat his beautiful triplebraided trousers and murmured in lyric beatitude by golly i dont look so bad i certainly dont look like catawba if the hicks back home could see me in this rig theyd have a fit  he moved majestically down to mix the cocktails as he chipped ice as he squeezed oranges as he collected vast stores of bottles glasses and spoons at the sink in the pantry he felt as authoritative as the bartender at healey hansons saloon true mrs babbitt said he was under foot and matilda and the maid hired for the evening brushed by him elbowed him shrieked pleasopn door as they tottered through with trays but in this high moment he ignored them  besides the new bottle of gin his cellar consisted of one halfbottle of bourbon whisky a quarter of a bottle of italian vermouth and approximately one hundred drops of orange bitters he did not possess a cocktailshaker a shaker was proof of dissipation the symbol of a drinker and babbitt disliked being known as a drinker even more than he liked a drink he mixed by pouring from an ancient gravyboat into a handleless pitcher he poured with a noble dignity holding his alembics high beneath the powerful mazda globe his face hot his shirtfront a glaring white the copper sink a scoured redgold  he tasted the sacred essence now by golly if that isnt pretty near one fine old cocktail kind of a bronx and yet like a manhattan ummmmmm hey myra want a little nip before the folks come  bustling into the diningroom moving each glass a quarter of an inch rushing back with resolution implacable on her face her gray and silverlace party frock protected by a denim towel mrs babbitt glared at him and rebuked him certainly not  well in a loose jocose manner i think the old man will  the cocktail filled him with a whirling exhilaration behind which he was aware of devastating desiresto rush places in fast motors to kiss girls to sing to be witty he sought to regain his lost dignity by announcing to matilda  im going to stick this pitcher of cocktails in the refrigerator be sure you dont upset any of em  yeh  well be sure now dont go putting anything on this top shelf  yeh  well be he was dizzy his voice was thin and distant whee with enormous impressiveness he commanded well be sure now and minced into the safety of the livingroom he wondered whether he could persuade as slow a bunch as myra and the littlefields to go some place aft dinner and raise cain and maybe dig up smore booze he perceived that he had gifts of profligacy which had been neglected  by the time the guests had come including the inevitable late couple for whom the others waited with painful amiability a great gray emptiness had replaced the purple swirling in babbitts head and he had to force the tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on floral heights  the guests were howard littlefield the doctor of philosophy who furnished publicity and comforting economics to the street traction company vergil gunch the coaldealer equally powerful in the elks and in the boosters club eddie swanson the agent for the javelin motor car who lived across the street and orville jones owner of the lily white laundry which justly announced itself the biggest busiest bulliest cleanerie shoppe in zenith but naturally the most distinguished of all was t cholmondeley frink who was not only the author of poemulations which syndicated daily in sixtyseven leading newspapers gave him one of the largest audiences of any poet in the world but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator of ads that add despite the searching philosophy and high morality of his verses they were humorous and easily understood by any child of twelve and it added a neat air of pleasantry to them that they were set not as verse but as prose mr frink was known from coast to coast as chum  with them were six wives more or lessit was hard to tell so early in the evening as at first glance they all looked alike and as they all said oh isnt this nice in the same tone of determined liveliness to the eye the men were less similar littlefield a hedgescholar tall and horsefaced chum frink a trifle of a man with soft and mouselike hair advertising his profession as poet by a silk cord on his eyeglasses vergil gunch broad with coarse black hair en brosse eddie swanson a bald and bouncing young man who showed his taste for elegance by an evening waistcoat of figured black silk with glass buttons orville jones a steadylooking stubby not very memorable person with a hempcolored toothbrush mustache yet they were all so well fed and clean they all shouted evenin georgie with such robustness that they seemed to be cousins and the strange thing is that the longer one knew the women the less alike they seemed while the longer one knew the men the more alike their bold patterns appeared  the drinking of the cocktails was as canonical a rite as the mixing the company waited uneasily hopefully agreeing in a strained manner that the weather had been rather warm and slightly cold but still babbitt said nothing about drinks they became despondent but when the late couple the swansons had arrived babbitt hinted well folks do you think you could stand breaking the law a little  they looked at chum frink the recognized lord of language frink pulled at his eyeglass cord as at a bellrope he cleared his throat and said that which was the custom  ill tell you george im a lawabiding man but they do say verg gunch is a regular yegg and of course hes bigger n i am and i just cant figure out what id do if he tried to force me into anything criminal  gunch was roaring well ill take a chance when frink held up his hand and went on so if verg and you insist georgie ill park my car on the wrong side of the street because i take it for granted thats the crime youre hinting at  there was a great deal of laughter mrs jones asserted mr frink is simply too killing youd think he was so innocent  babbitt clamored how did you guess it chum well youall just wait a moment while i go out and get thekeys to your cars through a froth of merriment he brought the shining promise the mighty tray of glasses with the cloudy yellow cocktails in the glass pitcher in the center the men babbled oh gosh have a look and this gets me right where i live and let me at it but chum frink a traveled man and not unused to woes was stricken by the thought that the potion might be merely fruitjuice with a little neutral spirits he looked timorous as babbitt a moist and ecstatic almoner held out a glass but as he tasted it he piped oh man let me dream on it aint true but dont waken me jus lemme slumber  two hours before frink had completed a newspaper lyric beginning  i sat alone and groused and thunk and scratched my head and sighed and wunk and groaned there still are boobs alack whod like the oldtime ginmill back that den that makes a sage a loon the vile and smelly old saloon ill never miss their poison booze whilst i the bubbling spring can use that leaves my head at merry morn as clear as any babe newborn  babbitt drank with the others his moments depression was gone he perceived that these were the best fellows in the world he wanted to give them a thousand cocktails think you could stand another he cried the wives refused with giggles but the men speaking in a wide elaborate enjoyable manner gloated well sooner than have you get sore at me georgie  you got a little dividend coming said babbitt to each of them and each intoned squeeze it georgie squeeze it  when beyond hope the pitcher was empty they stood and talked about prohibition the men leaned back on their heels put their hands in their trouserspockets and proclaimed their views with the booming profundity of a prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed statement about a matter of which he knows nothing whatever  now ill tell you said vergil gunch way i figure it is this and i can speak by the book because ive talked to a lot of doctors and fellows that ought to know and the way i see it is that its a good thing to get rid of the saloon but they ought to let a fellow have beer and light wines  howard littlefield observed what isnt generally realized is that its a dangerous propsition to invade the rights of personal liberty now take this for instance the king ofbavaria i think it was bavariayes bavaria it wasin 1862 march 1862 he issued a proclamation against public grazing of livestock the peasantry had stood for overtaxation without the slightest complaint but when this proclamation came out they rebelled or it may have been saxony but it just goes to show the dangers of invading the rights of personal liberty  thats itno one got a right to invade personal liberty said orville jones  just the same you dont want to forget prohibition is a mighty good thing for the workingclasses keeps em from wasting their money and lowering their productiveness said vergil gunch  yes thats so but the trouble is the manner of enforcement insisted howard littlefield congress didnt understand the right system now if id been running the thing id have arranged it so that the drinker himself was licensed and then we could have taken care of the shiftless workmankept him from drinkingand yet not ve interfered with the rightswith the personal libertyof fellows like ourselves  they bobbed their heads looked admiringly at one another and stated thats so that would be the stunt  the thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will take to cocaine sighed eddie swanson  they bobbed more violently and groaned thats so there is a danger of that  chum frink chanted oh say i got hold of a swell new receipt for homemade beer the other day you take  gunch interrupted wait let me tell you mine littlefield snorted beer rats thing to do is to ferment cider jones insisted ive got the receipt that does the business swanson begged oh say lemme tell you the story but frink went on resolutely you take and save the shells from peas and pour six gallons of water on a bushel of shells and boil the mixture till  mrs babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness frink hastened to finish even his best beerrecipe and she said gaily dinner is served  there was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which should go in last and while they were crossing the hall from the livingroom to the diningroom vergil gunch made them laugh by thundering if i cant sit next to myra babbitt and hold her hand under the table i wont playim goin home in the diningroom they stood embarrassed while mrs babbitt fluttered now let me seeoh i was going to have some nice handpainted placecards for you butoh let me see mr frink you sit there  the dinner was in the best style of womensmagazine art whereby the salad was served in hollowed apples and everything but the invincible fried chicken resembled something else ordinarily the men found it hard to talk to the women flirtation was an art unknown on floral heights and the realms of offices and of kitchens had no alliances but under the inspiration of the cocktails conversation was violent each of the men still had a number of important things to say about prohibition and now that each had a loyal listener in his dinnerpartner he burst out  i found a place where i can get all the hootch i want at eight a quart  did you read about this fellow that went and paid a thousand dollars for ten cases of redeye that proved to be nothing but water seems this fellow was standing on the corner and fellow comes up to him  they say theres a whole raft of stuff being smuggled across at detroit  what i always say iswhat a lot of folks dont realize about prohibition  and then you get all this awful poison stuffwood alcohol and everything  course i believe in it on principle but i dont propose to have anybody telling me what i got to think and do no american ll ever stand for that  but they all felt that it was rather in bad taste for orville jonesand he not recognized as one of the wits of the occasion anywayto say in fact the whole thing about prohibition is this it isnt the initial cost its the humidity  not till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation become general  it was often and admiringly said of vergil gunch gee that fellow can get away with murder why he can pull a raw one in mixed company and all the ladies ll laugh their heads off but me gosh if i crack anything thats just the least bit off color i get the razz for fair now gunch delighted them by crying to mrs eddie swanson youngest of the women louetta i managed to pinch eddies doorkey out of his pocket and what say you and me sneak across the street when the folks arent looking got something with a gorgeous leer awful important to tell you  the women wriggled and babbitt was stirred to like naughtiness say folks i wished i dared show you a book i borrowed from doc patten  now george the idea mrs babbitt warned him  this bookracy isnt the word its some kind of an anthropological report aboutabout customs in the south seas and what it doesnt say its a book you cant buy verg ill lend it to you  me first insisted eddie swanson sounds spicy  orville jones announced say i heard a good one the other day about a coupla swedes and their wives and in the best jewish accent he resolutely carried the good one to a slightly disinfected ending gunch capped it but the cocktails waned the seekers dropped back into cautious reality  chum frink had recently been on a lecturetour among the small towns and he chuckled awful good to get back to civilization i certainly been seeing some hick towns i meancourse the folks there are the best on earth but gee whiz those main street burgs are slow and you fellows cant hardly appreciate what it means to be here with a bunch of live ones  you bet exulted orville jones theyre the best folks on earth those smalltown folks but oh mama what conversation why say they cant talk about anything but the weather and the neoo ford by heckalorum  thats right they all talk about just the same things said eddie swanson  dont they though they just say the same things over and over said vergil gunch  yes its really remarkable they seem to lack all power of looking at things impersonally they simply go over and over the same talk about fords and the weather and so on said howard littlefield  still at that you cant blame em they havent got any intellectual stimulus such as you get up here in the city said chum frink  gosh thats right said babbitt i dont want you highbrows to get stuck on yourselves but i must say it keeps a fellow right up on his toes to sit in with a poet and with howard the guy that put the con in economics but these smalltown boobs with nobody but each other to talk to no wonder they get so sloppy and uncultured in their speech and so balledup in their thinking  orville jones commented and then take our other advantagesthe movies frinstance these yapville sports think theyre allgetout if they have one change of bill a week where here in the city you got your choice of a dozen diffrent movies any evening you want to name  sure and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against highclass hustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger said eddie swanson  same time said babbitt no sense excusing these rube burgs too easy fellows own fault if he doesnt show the initiative to up and beat it to the city like we donedid and just speaking in confidence among friends theyre jealous as the devil of a city man every time i go up to catawba i have to go around apologizing to the fellows i was brought up with because ive more or less succeeded and they havent and if you talk natural to em way we do here and show finesse and what you might call a broad point of view why they think youre putting on side theres my own halfbrother martinruns the little ole general store my dad used to keep say ill bet he dont know there is such a thing as a tuxas a dinnerjacket if he was to come in here now hed think we were a bunch ofofwhy gosh i swear he wouldnt know what to think yes sir theyre jealous  chum frink agreed thats so but what i mind is their lack of culture and appreciation of the beautifulif youll excuse me for being highbrow now i like to give a highclass lecture and read some of my best poetrynot the newspaper stuff but the magazine things but say when i get out in the tall grass theres nothing will take but a lot of cheesy old stories and slang and junk that if any of us were to indulge in it here hed get the gate so fast it would make his head swim  vergil gunch summed it up fact is were mighty lucky to be living among a bunch of cityfolks that recognize artistic things and businesspunch equally wed feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some main street burg and tried to wise up the old codgers to the kind of life were used to here but by golly theres this you got to say for em every small american town is trying to get population and modern ideals and darn if a lot of em dont put it across somebody starts panning a rube crossroads telling how he was there in 1900 and it consisted of one muddy street count em one and nine hundred human clams well you go back there in 1920 and you find pavements and a swell little hotel and a firstclass ladies readytowear shopreal perfection in fact you dont want to just look at what these small towns are you want to look at what theyre aiming to become and they all got an ambition that in the long run is going to make em the finest spots on earththey all want to be just like zenith   iii  however intimate they might be with t cholmondeley frink as a neighbor as a borrower of lawnmowers and monkeywrenches they knew that he was also a famous poet and a distinguished advertisingagent that behind his easiness were sultry literary mysteries which they could not penetrate but tonight in the ginevolved confidence he admitted them to the arcanum  ive got a literary problem thats worrying me to death im doing a series of ads for the zeeco car and i want to make each of em a real little gemreglar stylistic stuff im all for this theory that perfection is the stunt or nothing at all and these are as tough things as i ever tackled you might think itd be harder to do my poemsall these heart topics home and fireside and happinessbut theyre cinches you cant go wrong on em you know what sentiments any decent goahead fellow must have if he plays the game and you stick right to em but the poetry of industrialism now theres a literary line where you got to open up new territory do you know the fellow whos really the american genius the fellow who you dont know his name and i dont either but his work ought to be preserved sos future generations can judge our american thought and originality today why the fellow that writes the prince albert tobacco ads just listen to this  its pa that jams such joy in jimmy pipes saybet youve often bentanear to that spillofspeech about hopping from five to fifty per by stepping on her a bit guess thats going some all rightbut just among ourselves you better start a rapidwhiz system to keep tabs as to how fast youll buzz from low smoke spirits to tiptophighonce you line up behind a jimmy pipe thats all aglow with that peachofapal prince albert  prince albert is johnonthejobalways joyusly moreish in flavor always delightfully cool and fragrant for a fact you never hooked such doubledecked copperriveted twofisted smoke enjoyment  go to a pipespeedoquick like you light on a good thing whypacked with prince albert you can play a joyus jimmy straight across the boards and you know what that means   now that caroled the motor agent eddie swanson thats what i call heliterature that prince albert fellowthough gosh there cant be just one fellow that writes em must be a big board of classy inkslingers in conference but anyway now him he doesnt write for longhaired pikers he writes for regular guys he writes for me and i tip my benny to him the only thing is i wonder if it sells the goods course like all these poets this prince albert fellow lets his idea run away with him it makes elegant reading but it dont say nothing id never go out and buy prince albert tobacco after reading it because it doesnt tell me anything about the stuff its just a bunch of fluff  frink faced him oh youre crazy have i got to sell you the idea of style anyway thats the kind of stuff id like to do for the zeeco but i simply cant so i decided to stick to the straight poetic and i took a shot at a highbrow ad for the zeeco how do you like this  the long white trail is callingcallingand its over the hills and far away for every man or woman that has red blood in his veins and on his lips the ancient song of the buccaneers its away with dull drudging and a fig for care speedglorious speedits more than just a moments exhilarationits life for you and me this great new truth the makers of the zeeco car have considered as much as price and style its fleet as the antelope smooth as the glide of a swallow yet powerful as the charge of a bullelephant class breathes in every line listen brother youll never know what the high art of hiking is till you try lifes zippingest zestthe zeeco   yes frink mused thats got an elegant color to it if i do say so but it aint got the originality of spillofspeech the whole company sighed with sympathy and admiration     chapter ix  i  babbitt was fond of his friends he loved the importance of being host and shouting certainly youre going to have smore chickenthe idea and he appreciated the genius of t cholmondeley frink but the vigor of the cocktails was gone and the more he ate the less joyful he felt then the amity of the dinner was destroyed by the nagging of the swansons  in floral heights and the other prosperous sections of zenith especially in the young married set there were many women who had nothing to do though they had few servants yet with gas stoves electric ranges and dishwashers and vacuum cleaners and tiled kitchen walls their houses were so convenient that they had little housework and much of their food came from bakeries and delicatessens they had but two one or no children and despite the myth that the great war had made work respectable their husbands objected to their wasting time and getting a lot of crank ideas in unpaid social work and still more to their causing a rumor by earning money that they were not adequately supported they worked perhaps two hours a day and the rest of the time they ate chocolates went to the motionpictures went windowshopping went in gossiping twos and threes to cardparties read magazines thought timorously of the lovers who never appeared and accumulated a splendid restlessness which they got rid of by nagging their husbands the husbands nagged back  of these naggers the swansons were perfect specimens  throughout the dinner eddie swanson had been complaining publicly about his wifes new frock it was he submitted too short too low too immodestly thin and much too expensive he appealed to babbitt  honest george what do you think of that rag louetta went and bought dont you think its the limit  whats eating you eddie i call it a swell little dress  oh it is mr swanson its a sweet frock mrs babbitt protested  there now do you see smarty youre such an authority on clothes louetta raged while the guests ruminated and peeped at her shoulders  thats all right now said swanson im authority enough so i know it was a waste of money and it makes me tired to see you not wearing out a whole closetful of clothes you got already ive expressed my idea about this before and you know good and well you didnt pay the least bit of attention i have to camp on your trail to get you to do anything  there was much more of it and they all assisted all but babbitt everything about him was dim except his stomach and that was a bright scarlet disturbance had too much grub oughtnt to eat this stuff he groanedwhile he went on eating while he gulped down a chill and glutinous slice of the icecream brick and cocoanut cake as oozy as shavingcream he felt as though he had been stuffed with clay his body was bursting his throat was bursting his brain was hot mud and only with agony did he continue to smile and shout as became a host on floral heights  he would except for his guests have fled outdoors and walked off the intoxication of food but in the haze which filled the room they sat forever talking talking while he agonized darn fool to be eating all thisnot nother mouthful and discovered that he was again tasting the sickly welter of melted ice cream on his plate there was no magic in his friends he was not uplifted when howard littlefield produced from his treasurehouse of scholarship the information that the chemical symbol for raw rubber is c10h16 which turns into isoprene or 2c5h8 suddenly without precedent babbitt was not merely bored but admitting that he was bored it was ecstasy to escape from the table from the torture of a straight chair and loll on the davenport in the livingroom  the others from their fitful unconvincing talk their expressions of being slowly and painfully smothered seemed to be suffering from the toil of social life and the horror of good food as much as himself all of them accepted with relief the suggestion of bridge  babbitt recovered from the feeling of being boiled he won at bridge he was again able to endure vergil gunchs inexorable heartiness but he pictured loafing with paul riesling beside a lake in maine it was as overpowering and imaginative as homesickness he had never seen maine yet he beheld the shrouded mountains the tranquil lake of evening that boy pauls worth all these ballyhooing highbrows put together he muttered and id like to get away fromeverything  even louetta swanson did not rouse him  mrs swanson was pretty and pliant babbitt was not an analyst of women except as to their tastes in furnished houses to rent he divided them into real ladies working women old cranks and fly chickens he mooned over their charms but he was of opinion that all of them save the women of his own family were different and mysterious yet he had known by instinct that louetta swanson could be approached her eyes and lips were moist her face tapered from a broad forehead to a pointed chin her mouth was thin but strong and avid and between her brows were two outcurving and passionate wrinkles she was thirty perhaps or younger gossip had never touched her but every man naturally and instantly rose to flirtatiousness when he spoke to her and every woman watched her with stilled blankness  between games sitting on the davenport babbitt spoke to her with the requisite gallantry that sonorous floral heights gallantry which is not flirtation but a terrified flight from it youre looking like a new sodafountain to night louetta  am i  ole eddie kind of on the rampage  yes i get so sick of it  well when you get tired of hubby you can run off with uncle george  if i ran awayoh well  anybody ever tell you your hands are awful pretty  she looked down at them she pulled the lace of her sleeves over them but otherwise she did not heed him she was lost in unexpressed imaginings  babbitt was too languid this evening to pursue his duty of being a captivating though strictly moral male he ambled back to the bridgetables he was not much thrilled when mrs frink a small twittering woman proposed that they try and do some spiritualism and tabletippingyou know chum can make the spirits comehonest he just scares me  the ladies of the party had not emerged all evening but now as the sex given to things of the spirit while the men warred against base things material they took command and cried oh lets in the dimness the men were rather solemn and foolish but the goodwives quivered and adored as they sat about the table they laughed now you be good or ill tell when the men took their hands in the circle  babbitt tingled with a slight return of interest in life as louetta swansons hand closed on his with quiet firmness  all of them hunched over intent they startled as some one drew a strained breath in the dusty light from the hall they looked unreal they felt disembodied mrs gunch squeaked and they jumped with unnatural jocularity but at frinks hiss they sank into subdued awe suddenly incredibly they heard a knocking they stared at frinks halfrevealed hands and found them lying still they wriggled and pretended not to be impressed  frink spoke with gravity is some one there a thud is one knock to be the sign for yes a thud and two for no a thud  now ladies and gentlemen shall we ask the guide to put us into communication with the spirit of some great one passed over frink mumbled  mrs orville jones begged oh lets talk to dante we studied him at the reading circle you know who he was orvy  certainly i know who he was the wop poet where do you think i was raised from her insulted husband  surethe fellow that took the cooks tour to hell ive never waded through his potry but we learned about him in the u said babbitt  page mr dannnnnty intoned eddie swanson  you ought to get him easy mr frink you and he being fellowpoets said louetta swanson  fellowpoets rats where d you get that stuff protested vergil gunch i suppose dante showed a lot of speed for an oldtimernot that ive actually read him of coursebut to come right down to hard facts he wouldnt stand onetwothree if he had to buckle down to practical literature and turn out a poem for the newspapersyndicate every day like chum does  thats so from eddie swanson those old birds could take their time judas priest i could write poetry myself if i had a whole year for it and just wrote about that oldfashioned junk like dante wrote about  frink demanded hush now ill call him   o laughing eyes emerge forth into the uh the ultimates and bring hither the spirit of dante that we mortals may list to his words of wisdom  you forgot to give um the address 1658 brimstone avenue fiery heights hell gunch chuckled but the others felt that this was irreligious and besidesprobably it was just chum making the knocks but still if there did happen to be something to all this be exciting to talk to an old fellow belonging toway back in early times  a thud the spirit of dante had come to the parlor of george f babbitt  he was it seemed quite ready to answer their questions he was glad to be with them this evening  frink spelled out the messages by running through the alphabet till the spirit interpreter knocked at the right letter  littlefield asked in a learned tone do you like it in the paradiso messire  we are very happy on the higher plane signor we are glad that you are studying this great truth of spiritualism dante replied  the circle moved with an awed creaking of stays and shirtfronts supposesuppose there were something to this  babbitt had a different worry suppose chum frink was really one of these spiritualists chum had for a literary fellow always seemed to be a regular guy he belonged to the chatham road presbyterian church and went to the boosters lunches and liked cigars and motors and racy stories but suppose that secretlyafter all you never could tell about these darn highbrows and to be an outandout spiritualist would be almost like being a socialist  no one could long be serious in the presence of vergil gunch ask dant how jack shakespeare and old vergthe guy they named after meare gettin along and dont they wish they could get into the movie game he blared and instantly all was mirth mrs jones shrieked and eddie swanson desired to know whether dante didnt catch cold with nothing on but his wreath  the pleased dante made humble answer  but babbittthe curst discontent was torturing him again and heavily in the impersonal darkness he pondered i dontwere all so flip and think were so smart thered bea fellow like dantei wish id read some of his pieces i dont suppose i ever will now  he had without explanation the impression of a slaggy cliff and on it in silhouette against menacing clouds a lone and austere figure he was dismayed by a sudden contempt for his surest friends he grasped louetta swansons hand and found the comfort of human warmth habit came a veteran warrior and he shook himself what the deuce is the matter with me this evening  he patted louettas hand to indicate that he hadnt meant anything improper by squeezing it and demanded of frink say see if you can get old dant to spiel us some of his poetry talk up to him tell him buena giorna senor com sa va wie gehts keskersaykersa a little pome senor   ii  the lights were switched on the women sat on the fronts of their chairs in that determined suspense whereby a wife indicates that as soon as the present speaker has finished she is going to remark brightly to her husband well dear i think perhaps its about time for us to be saying goodnight for once babbitt did not break out in blustering efforts to keep the party going he hadthere was something he wished to think outbut the psychical research had started them off again why didnt they go home why didnt they go home though he was impressed by the profundity of the statement he was only halfenthusiastic when howard littlefield lectured the united states is the only nation in which the government is a moral ideal and not just a social arrangement truetruewerent they ever going home he was usually delighted to have an inside view of the momentous world of motors but tonight he scarcely listened to eddie swansons revelation if you want to go above the javelin class the zeeco is a mighty good buy couple weeks ago and mind you this was a fair square test they took a zeeco stock touringcar and they slid up the tonawanda hill on high and fellow told me zeeco good boat butwere they planning to stay all night  they really were going with a flutter of we did have the best time  most aggressively friendly of all was babbitt yet as he burbled he was reflecting i got through it but for a while there i didnt hardly think id last out he prepared to taste that most delicate pleasure of the host making fun of his guests in the relaxation of midnight as the door closed he yawned voluptuously chest out shoulders wriggling and turned cynically to his wife  she was beaming oh it was nice wasnt it i know they enjoyed every minute of it dont you think so  he couldnt do it he couldnt mock it would have been like sneering at a happy child he lied ponderously you bet best party this year by a long shot  wasnt the dinner good and honestly i thought the fried chicken was delicious  you bet fried to the queens taste best fried chicken ive tasted for a coons age  didnt matilda fry it beautifully and dont you think the soup was simply delicious  it certainly was it was corking best soup ive tasted since heck was a pup but his voice was seeping away they stood in the hall under the electric light in its square boxlike shade of red glass bound with nickel she stared at him  why george you dont soundyou sound as if you hadnt really enjoyed it  sure i did course i did  george what is it  oh im kind of tired i guess been pounding pretty hard at the office need to get away and rest up a little  well were going to maine in just a few weeks now dear yuh then he was pouring it out nakedly robbed of reticence myra i think itd be a good thing for me to get up there early  but you have this man you have to meet in new york about business  what man oh sure him oh thats all off but i want to hit maine earlyget in a little fishing catch me a big trout by golly a nervous artificial laugh  well why dont we do it verona and matilda can run the house between them and you and i can go any time if you think we can afford it  but thatsive been feeling so jumpy lately i thought maybe it might be a good thing if i kind of got off by myself and sweat it out of me  george dont you want me to go along she was too wretchedly in earnest to be tragic or gloriously insulted or anything save dumpy and defenseless and flushed to the red steaminess of a boiled beet  of course i do i just meant remembering that paul riesling had predicted this he was as desperate as she i mean sometimes its a good thing for an old grouch like me to go off and get it out of his system he tried to sound paternal then when you and the kids arrivei figured maybe i might skip up to maine just a few days ahead of youid be ready for a real bat see how i mean he coaxed her with large booming sounds with affable smiles like a popular preacher blessing an easter congregation like a humorous lecturer completing his stint of eloquence like all perpetrators of masculine wiles  she stared at him the joy of festival drained from her face do i bother you when we go on vacations dont i add anything to your fun  he broke suddenly dreadfully he was hysterical he was a yelping baby yes yes yes hell yes but cant you understand im shot to pieces im all in i got to take care of myself i tell you i got toim sick of everything and everybody i got to  it was she who was mature and protective now why of course you shall run off by yourself why dont you get paul to go along and you boys just fish and have a good time she patted his shoulderreaching up to itwhile he shook with palsied helplessness and in that moment was not merely by habit fond of her but clung to her strength  she cried cheerily now upstairs you go and pop into bed well fix it all up ill see to the doors now skip  for many minutes for many hours for a bleak eternity he lay awake shivering reduced to primitive terror comprehending that he had won freedom and wondering what he could do with anything so unknown and so embarrassing as freedom     chapter x  no apartmenthouse in zenith had more resolutely experimented in condensation than the revelstoke arms in which paul and zilla riesling had a flat by sliding the beds into low closets the bedrooms were converted into livingrooms the kitchens were cupboards each containing an electric range a copper sink a glass refrigerator and very intermittently a balkan maid everything about the arms was excessively modern and everything was compressedexcept the garages  the babbitts were calling on the rieslings at the arms it was a speculative venture to call on the rieslings interesting and sometimes disconcerting zilla was an active strident fullblown highbosomed blonde when she condescended to be goodhumored she was nervously amusing her comments on people were saltily satiric and penetrative of accepted hypocrisies thats so you said and looked sheepish she danced wildly and called on the world to be merry but in the midst of it she would turn indignant she was always becoming indignant life was a plot against her and she exposed it furiously  she was affable tonight she merely hinted that orville jones wore a toupe that mrs t cholmondeley frinks singing resembled a ford going into high and that the hon otis deeble mayor of zenith and candidate for congress was a flatulent fool which was quite true the babbitts and rieslings sat doubtfully on stonehard brocade chairs in the small livingroom of the flat with its mantel unprovided with a fireplace and its strip of heavy gilt fabric upon a glaring new playerpiano till mrs riesling shrieked come on lets put some pep in it get out your fiddle paul and ill try to make georgie dance decently  the babbitts were in earnest they were plotting for the escape to maine but when mrs babbitt hinted with plump smilingness does paul get as tired after the winters work as georgie does then zilla remembered an injury and when zilla riesling remembered an injury the world stopped till something had been done about it  does he get tired no he doesnt get tired he just goes crazy thats all you think paul is so reasonable oh yes and he loves to make out hes a little lamb but hes stubborn as a mule oh if you had to live with him youd find out how sweet he is he just pretends to be meek so he can have his own way and me i get the credit for being a terrible old crank but if i didnt blow up once in a while and get something started wed die of dryrot he never wants to go any place andwhy last evening just because the car was out of orderand that was his fault too because he ought to have taken it to the servicestation and had the battery looked atand he didnt want to go down to the movies on the trolley but we went and then there was one of those impudent conductors and paul wouldnt do a thing  i was standing on the platform waiting for the people to let me into the car and this beast this conductor hollered at me come on you move up why ive never had anybody speak to me that way in all my life i was so astonished i just turned to him and saidi thought there must be some mistake and so i said to him perfectly pleasant were you speaking to me and he went on and bellowed at me yes i was youre keeping the whole car from starting he said and then i saw he was one of these dirty illbred hogs that kindness is wasted on and so i stopped and looked right at him and i said ibegyourpardon i am not doing anything of the kind i said its the people ahead of me who wont move up i said and furthermore let me tell you young man that youre a lowdown foulmouthed impertinent skunk i said and youre no gentleman i certainly intend to report you and well see i said whether a lady is to be insulted by any drunken bum that chooses to put on a ragged uniform and id thank you i said to keep your filthy abuse to yourself and then i waited for paul to show he was half a man and come to my defense and he just stood there and pretended he hadnt heard a word and so i said to him well i said  oh cut it cut it zill paul groaned we all know im a mollycoddle and youre a tender bud and lets let it go at that  let it go zillas face was wrinkled like the medusa her voice was a dagger of corroded brass she was full of the joy of righteousness and bad temper she was a crusader and like every crusader she exulted in the opportunity to be vicious in the name of virtue let it go if people knew how many things ive let go  oh quit being such a bully  yes a fine figure youd cut if i didnt bully you youd lie abed till noon and play your idiotic fiddle till midnight youre born lazy and youre born shiftless and youre born cowardly paul riesling  oh now dont say that zilla you dont mean a word of it protested mrs babbitt  i will say that and i mean every single last word of it  oh now zilla the idea mrs babbitt was maternal and fussy she was no older than zilla but she seemed soat first she was placid and puffy and mature where zilla at fortyfive was so bleached and tightcorseted that you knew only that she was older than she looked the idea of talking to poor paul like that  poor paul is right wed both be poor wed be in the poorhouse if i didnt jazz him up  why now zilla georgie and i were just saying how hard pauls been working all year and we were thinking it would be lovely if the boys could run off by themselves ive been coaxing george to go up to maine ahead of the rest of us and get the tired out of his system before we come and i think it would be lovely if paul could manage to get away and join him  at this exposure of his plot to escape paul was startled out of impassivity he rubbed his fingers his hands twitched  zilla bayed yes youre lucky you can let george go and not have to watch him fat old georgie never peeps at another woman hasnt got the spunk  the hell i havent babbitt was fervently defending his priceless immorality when paul interrupted himand paul looked dangerous he rose quickly he said gently to zilla  i suppose you imply i have a lot of sweethearts  yes i do  well then my dear since you ask for itthere hasnt been a time in the last ten years when i havent found some nice little girl to comfort me and as long as you continue your amiability i shall probably continue to deceive you it isnt hard youre so stupid  zilla gibbered she howled words could not be distinguished in her slaver of abuse  then the bland george f babbitt was transformed if paul was dangerous if zilla was a snakelocked fury if the neat emotions suitable to the revelstoke arms had been slashed into raw hatreds it was babbitt who was the most formidable he leaped up he seemed very large he seized zillas shoulder the cautions of the broker were wiped from his face and his voice was cruel  ive had enough of all this damn nonsense ive known you for twentyfive years zil and i never knew you to miss a chance to take your disappointments out on paul youre not wicked youre worse youre a fool and let me tell you that paul is the finest boy god ever made every decent person is sick and tired of your taking advantage of being a woman and springing every mean innuendo you can think of who the hell are you that a person like paul should have to ask your permission to go with me you act like you were a combination of queen victoria and cleopatra you fool cant you see how people snicker at you and sneer at you  zilla was sobbing ive neverive nevernobody ever talked to me like this in all my life  no but thats the way they talk behind your back always they say youre a scolding old woman old by god  that cowardly attack broke her her eyes were blank she wept but babbitt glared stolidly he felt that he was the allpowerful official in charge that paul and mrs babbitt looked on him with awe that he alone could handle this case  zilla writhed she begged oh they dont  they certainly do  ive been a bad woman im terribly sorry ill kill myself ill do anything oh illwhat do you want  she abased herself completely also she enjoyed it to the connoisseur of scenes nothing is more enjoyable than a thorough melodramatic egoistic humility  i want you to let paul beat it off to maine with me babbitt demanded  how can i help his going youve just said i was an idiot and nobody paid any attention to me  oh you can help it all right all right what you got to do is to cut out hinting that the minute he gets out of your sight hell go chasing after some petticoat matter fact thats the way you start the boy off wrong you ought to have more sense  oh i will honestly i will george i know i was bad oh forgive me all of you forgive me  she enjoyed it  so did babbitt he condemned magnificently and forgave piously and as he went parading out with his wife he was grandly explanatory to her  kind of a shame to bully zilla but course it was the only way to handle her gosh i certainly did have her crawling  she said calmly yes you were horrid you were showing off you were having a lovely time thinking what a great fine person you were  well by golly can you beat it of course i might of expected you to not stand by me i might of expected youd stick up for your own sex  yes poor zilla shes so unhappy she takes it out on paul she hasnt a single thing to do in that little flat and she broods too much and she used to be so pretty and gay and she resents losing it and you were just as nasty and mean as you could be im not a bit proud of youor of paul boasting about his horrid loveaffairs  he was sulkily silent he maintained his bad temper at a high level of outraged nobility all the four blocks home at the door he left her in selfapproving haughtiness and tramped the lawn  with a shock it was revealed to him gosh i wonder if she was rightif she was partly right overwork must have flayed him to abnormal sensitiveness it was one of the few times in his life when he had queried his eternal excellence and he perceived the summer night smelled the wet grass then i dont care ive pulled it off were going to have our spree and for paul id do anything   ii  they were buying their maine tackle at ijams brothers the sporting goods mart with the help of willis ijams fellow member of the boosters club babbitt was completely mad he trumpeted and danced he muttered to paul say this is pretty good eh to be buying the stuff eh and good old willis ijams himself coming down on the floor to wait on us say if those fellows that are getting their kit for the north lakes knew we were going clear up to maine theyd have a fit eh    well come on brother ijamswillis i mean heres your chance were a couple of easy marks whee let me at it im going to buy out the store  he gloated on flyrods and gorgeous rubber hipboots on tents with celluloid windows and folding chairs and iceboxes he simpleheartedly wanted to buy all of them it was the paul whom he was always vaguely protecting who kept him from his drunken desires  but even paul lightened when willis ijams a salesman with poetry and diplomacy discussed flies now of course you boys know he said the great scrap is between dry flies and wet flies personally im for dry flies more sporting  thats so lots more sporting fulminated babbitt who knew very little about flies either wet or dry  now if youll take my advice georgie youll stock up well on these pale evening dims and silver sedges and red ants oh boy theres a fly that red ant  you bet thats what it isa fly rejoiced babbitt  yes sir that red ant said ijams is a real honesttogod fly  oh i guess ole mr trout wont come ahustling when i drop one of those red ants on the water asserted babbitt and his thick wrists made a rapturous motion of casting  yes and the landlocked salmon will take it too said ijams who had never seen a landlocked salmon  salmon trout say paul can you see uncle george with his khaki pants on haulin em in some morning bout seven whee   iii  they were on the new york express incredibly bound for maine incredibly without their families they were free in a mans world in the smokingcompartment of the pullman  outside the car window was a glaze of darkness stippled with the gold of infrequent mysterious lights babbitt was immensely conscious in the sway and authoritative clatter of the train of going of going on leaning toward paul he grunted gosh pretty nice to be hiking eh  the small room with its walls of ochercolored steel was filled mostly with the sort of men he classified as the best fellows youll ever meetreal good mixers there were four of them on the long seat a fat man with a shrewd fat face a knifeedged man in a green velour hat a very young young man with an imitation amber cigaretteholder and babbitt facing them on two movable leather chairs were paul and a lanky oldfashioned man very cunning with wrinkles bracketing his mouth they all read newspapers or trade journals bootandshoe journals crockery journals and waited for the joys of conversation it was the very young man now making his first journey by pullman who began it  say gee i had a wild old time in zenith he gloried say if a fellow knows the ropes there he can have as wild a time as he can in new york  yuh i bet you simply raised the old ned i figured you were a bad man when i saw you get on the train chuckled the fat one  the others delightedly laid down their papers  well thats all right now i guess i seen some things in the arbor you never seen complained the boy  oh ill bet you did i bet you lapped up the malted milk like a reglar little devil  then the boy having served as introduction they ignored him and charged into real talk only paul sitting by himself reading at a serial story in a newspaper failed to join them and all but babbitt regarded him as a snob an eccentric a person of no spirit  which of them said which has never been determined and does not matter since they all had the same ideas and expressed them always with the same ponderous and brassy assurance if it was not babbitt who was delivering any given verdict at least he was beaming on the chancellor who did deliver it  at that though announced the first theyre selling quite some booze in zenith guess they are everywhere i dont know how you fellows feel about prohibition but the way it strikes me is that its a mighty beneficial thing for the poor zob that hasnt got any willpower but for fellows like us its an infringement of personal liberty  thats a fact congress has got no right to interfere with a fellows personal liberty contended the second  a man came in from the car but as all the seats were full he stood up while he smoked his cigarette he was an outsider he was not one of the old families of the smokingcompartment they looked upon him bleakly and after trying to appear at ease by examining his chin in the mirror he gave it up and went out in silence  just been making a trip through the south business conditions not very good down there said one of the council  is that a fact not very good eh  no didnt strike me they were up to normal  not up to normal eh  no i wouldnt hardly say they were  the whole council nodded sagely and decided yump not hardly up to snuff  well business conditions aint what they ought to be out west neither not by a long shot  thats a fact and i guess the hotel business feels it thats one good thing though these hotels thatve been charging five bucks a dayyes and maybe sixsevenfor a rotten room are going to be darn glad to get four and maybe give you a little service  thats a fact say uh speaknubout hotels i hit the st francis at san francisco for the first time the other day and say it certainly is a firstclass place  youre right brother the st francis is a swell placeabsolutely a1  thats a fact im right with you its a firstclass place  yuh but say any of you fellows ever stay at the rippleton in chicago i dont want to knocki believe in boosting wherever you canbut say of all the rotten dumps that pass emselves off as firstclass hotels thats the worst im going to get those guys one of these days and i told em so you know how i amwell maybe you dont know but im accustomed to firstclass accommodations and im perfectly willing to pay a reasonable price i got into chicago late the other night and the rippletons near the stationid never been there before but i says to the taxidriveri always believe in taking a taxi when you get in late may cost a little more money but gosh its worth it when you got to be up early next morning and out selling a lot of crabsand i said to him oh just drive me over to the rippleton  well we got there and i breezed up to the desk and said to the clerk well brother got a nice room with bath for cousin bill saaaay youd a thought id sold him a second or asked him to work on yom kippur he hands me the coldboiled stare and yaps i dunno friend ill see and he ducks behind the rigamajig they keep track of the rooms on well i guess he called up the credit association and the american security league to see if i was all righthe certainly took long enoughor maybe he just went to sleep but finally he comes out and looks at me like it hurts him and croaks i think i can let you have a room with bath well thats awful nice of yousorry to trouble youhow much ll it set me back i says real sweet itll cost you seven bucks a day friend he says  well it was late and anyway it went down on my expenseaccountgosh if id been paying it instead of the firm id a tramped the streets all night before id a let any hick tavern stick me seven great big round dollars believe me so i lets it go at that well the clerk wakes a nice young bell hopfine ladnot a day over seventynine years oldfought at the battle of gettysburg and doesnt know its over yetthought i was one of the confederates i guess from the way he looked at meand rip van winkle took me up to somethingi found out afterwards they called it a room but first i thought thered been some mistakei thought they were putting me in the salvation army collectionbox at seven per each and every diem gosh  yuh ive heard the rippleton was pretty cheesy now when i go to chicago i always stay at the blackstone or the la sallefirstclass places  say any of you fellows ever stay at the birchdale at terre haute how is it  oh the birchdale is a firstclass hotel  twelve minutes of conference on the state of hotels in south bend flint dayton tulsa wichita fort worth winona erie fargo and moose jaw  speaknubout prices the man in the velour hat observed fingering the elktooth on his heavy watchchain id like to know where they get this stuff about clothes coming down now you take this suit i got on he pinched his trousersleg four years ago i paid fortytwo fifty for it and it was real surenough value well here the other day i went into a store back home and asked to see a suit and the fellow yanks out some handmedowns that honest i wouldnt put on a hired man just out of curiosity i asks him what you charging for that junk junk he says what d you mean junk thats a swell piece of goods all wool like hell it was nice vegetable wool right off the ole plantation its all wool he says and we get sixtyseven ninety for it oh you do do you i says not from me you dont i says and i walks right out on him you bet i says to the wife well i said as long as your strength holds out and you can go on putting a few more patches on papas pants well just pass up buying clothes  thats right brother and just look at collars frinstance  hey wait the fat man protested whats the matter with collars im selling collars d you realize the cost of labor on collars is still two hundred and seven per cent above  they voted that if their old friend the fat man sold collars then the price of collars was exactly what it should be but all other clothing was tragically too expensive they admired and loved one another now they went profoundly into the science of business and indicated that the purpose of manufacturing a plow or a brick was so that it might be sold to them the romantic hero was no longer the knight the wandering poet the cowpuncher the aviator nor the brave young district attorney but the great salesmanager who had an analysis of merchandizing problems on his glasstopped desk whose title of nobility was gogetter and who devoted himself and all his young samurai to the cosmic purpose of sellingnot of selling anything in particular for or to anybody in particular but pure selling  the shoptalk roused paul riesling though he was a player of violins and an interestingly unhappy husband he was also a very able salesman of tarroofing he listened to the fat mans remarks on the value of houseorgans and bulletins as a method of jazzingup the boys out on the road and he himself offered one or two excellent thoughts on the use of twocent stamps on circulars then he committed an offense against the holy law of the clan of good fellows he became highbrow  they were entering a city on the outskirts they passed a steelmill which flared in scarlet and orange flame that licked at the cadaverous stacks at the ironsheathed walls and sullen converters  my lord look at thatbeautiful said paul  you bet its beautiful friend thats the shellinghorton steel plant and they tell me old john shelling made a good three million bones out of munitions during the war the man with the velour hat said reverently  i didnt meani mean its lovely the way the light pulls that picturesque yard all littered with junk right out of the darkness said paul  they stared at him while babbitt crowed paul there has certainly got one great little eye for picturesque places and quaint sights and all that stuff d of been an author or something if he hadnt gone into the roofing line  paul looked annoyed babbitt sometimes wondered if paul appreciated his loyal boosting the man in the velour hat grunted well personally i think shellinghorton keep their works awful dirty bum routing but i dont suppose theres any law against calling em picturesque if it gets you that way  paul sulkily returned to his newspaper and the conversation logically moved on to trains  what time do we get into pittsburg asked babbitt  pittsburg i think we get in atno that was last years schedulewait a minutelets seegot a timetable right here  i wonder if were on time  yuh sure we must be just about on time  no we arentwe were seven minutes late last station  were we straight why gosh i thought we were right on time  no were about seven minutes late  yuh thats right seven minutes late  the porter entereda negro in white jacket with brass buttons  how late are we george growled the fat man  deed i dont know sir i think were about on time said the porter folding towels and deftly tossing them up on the rack above the washbowls the council stared at him gloomily and when he was gone they wailed  i dont know whats come over these niggers nowadays they never give you a civil answer  thats a fact theyre getting so they dont have a single bit of respect for you the oldfashioned coon was a fine old cusshe knew his placebut these young dinges dont want to be porters or cottonpickers oh no they got to be lawyers and professors and lord knows what all i tell you its becoming a pretty serious problem we ought to get together and show the black man yes and the yellow man his place now i havent got one particle of raceprejudice im the first to be glad when a nigger succeedsso long as he stays where he belongs and doesnt try to usurp the rightful authority and business ability of the white man  thats the i and another thing we got to do said the man with the velour hat whose name was koplinsky is to keep these damn foreigners out of the country thank the lord were putting a limit on immigration these dagoes and hunkies have got to learn that this is a white mans country and they aint wanted here when weve assimilated the foreigners we got here now and learned em the principles of americanism and turned em into regular folks why then maybe well let in a few more  you bet thats a fact they observed and passed on to lighter topics they rapidly reviewed motorcar prices tiremileage oilstocks fishing and the prospects for the wheatcrop in dakota  but the fat man was impatient at this waste of time he was a veteran traveler and free of illusions already he had asserted that he was an old heone he leaned forward gathered in their attention by his expression of sly humor and grumbled oh hell boys lets cut out the formality and get down to the stories  they became very lively and intimate  paul and the boy vanished the others slid forward on the long seat unbuttoned their vests thrust their feet up on the chairs pulled the stately brass cuspidors nearer and ran the green windowshade down on its little trolley to shut them in from the uncomfortable strangeness of night after each bark of laughter they cried say jever hear the one about babbitt was expansive and virile when the train stopped at an important station the four men walked up and down the cement platform under the vast smoky trainshed roof like a stormy sky under the elevated footways beside crates of ducks and sides of beef in the mystery of an unknown city they strolled abreast old friends and well content at the longdrawn alllll aboarrrrrdlike a mountain call at duskthey hastened back into the smokingcompartment and till two of the morning continued the droll tales their eyes damp with cigarsmoke and laughter when they parted they shook hands and chuckled well sir its been a great session sorry to bust it up mighty glad to met you  babbitt lay awake in the close hot tomb of his pullman berth shaking with remembrance of the fat mans limerick about the lady who wished to be wild he raised the shade he lay with a puffy arm tucked between his head and the skimpy pillow looking out on the sliding silhouettes of trees and village lamps like exclamationpoints he was very happy     chapter xi  i  they had four hours in new york between trains the one thing babbitt wished to see was the pennsylvania hotel which had been built since his last visit he stared up at it muttering twentytwo hundred rooms and twentytwo hundred baths thats got everything in the world beat lord their turnover must bewell suppose price of rooms is four to eight dollars a day and i suppose maybe some ten andfour times twentytwo hundredsay six times twentytwo hundredwell anyway with restaurants and everything say summers between eight and fifteen thousand a day every day i never thought id see a thing like that some town of course the average fellow in zenith has got more individual initiative than the fourflushers here but i got to hand it to new york yes sir town youre all rightsome ways well old paulski i guess weve seen everything thats worth while howll we kill the rest of the time movie  but paul desired to see a liner always wanted to go to europeand by thunder i will too some day before i past out he sighed  from a rough wharf on the north river they stared at the stern of the aquitania and her stacks and wireless antenna lifted above the dockhouse which shut her in  by golly babbitt droned wouldnt be so bad to go over to the old country and take a squint at all these ruins and the place where shakespeare was born and think of being able to order a drink whenever you wanted one just range up to a bar and holler out loud gimme a cocktail and darn the police not bad at all what juh like to see over there paulibus  paul did not answer babbitt turned paul was standing with clenched fists head drooping staring at the liner as in terror his thin body seen against the summerglaring planks of the wharf was childishly meager  again what would you hit for on the other side paul  scowling at the steamer his breast heaving paul whispered oh my god while babbitt watched him anxiously he snapped come on lets get out of this and hastened down the wharf not looking back  thats funny considered babbitt the boy didnt care for seeing the ocean boats after all i thought hed be interested in em   ii  though he exulted and made sage speculations about locomotive horsepower as their train climbed the maine mountainridge and from the summit he looked down the shining way among the pines though he remarked well by golly when he discovered that the station at katadumcook the end of the line was an aged freightcar babbitts moment of impassioned release came when they sat on a tiny wharf on lake sunasquam awaiting the launch from the hotel a raft had floated down the lake between the logs and the shore the water was transparent thinlooking flashing with minnows a guide in black felt hat with troutflies in the band and flannel shirt of a peculiarly daring blue sat on a log and whittled and was silent a dog a good country dog black and woolly gray a dog rich in leisure and in meditation scratched and grunted and slept the thick sunlight was lavish on the bright water on the rim of goldgreen balsam boughs the silver birches and tropic ferns and across the lake it burned on the sturdy shoulders of the mountains over everything was a holy peace  silent they loafed on the edge of the wharf swinging their legs above the water the immense tenderness of the place sank into babbitt and he murmured id just like to sit herethe rest of my lifeand whittleand sit and never hear a typewriter or stan graff fussing in the phone or rone and ted scrapping just sit gosh  he patted pauls shoulder how does it strike you old snoozer  oh its darn good georgie theres something sort of eternal about it  for once babbitt understood him   iii  their launch rounded the bend at the head of the lake under a mountain slope they saw the little central diningshack of their hotel and the crescent of squat log cottages which served as bedrooms they landed and endured the critical examination of the habitues who had been at the hotel for a whole week in their cottage with its high stone fireplace they hastened as babbitt expressed it to get into some regular hetogs they came out paul in an old gray suit and soft white shirt babbitt in khaki shirt and vast and flapping khaki trousers it was excessively new khaki his rimless spectacles belonged to a city office and his face was not tanned but a city pink he made a discordant noise in the place but with infinite satisfaction he slapped his legs and crowed say this is getting back home eh  they stood on the wharf before the hotel he winked at paul and drew from his back pocket a plug of chewingtobacco a vulgarism forbidden in the babbitt home he took a chew beaming and wagging his head as he tugged at it um um maybe i havent been hungry for a wad of eatingtobacco have some  they looked at each other in a grin of understanding paul took the plug gnawed at it they stood quiet their jaws working they solemnly spat one after the other into the placid water they stretched voluptuously with lifted arms and arched backs from beyond the mountains came the shuffling sound of a faroff train a trout leaped and fell back in a silver circle they sighed together   iv  they had a week before their families came each evening they planned to get up early and fish before breakfast each morning they lay abed till the breakfastbell pleasantly conscious that there were no efficient wives to rouse them the mornings were cold the fire was kindly as they dressed  paul was distressingly clean but babbitt reveled in a good sound dirtiness in not having to shave till his spirit was moved to it he treasured every grease spot and fishscale on his new khaki trousers  all morning they fished unenergetically or tramped the dim and aqueouslighted trails among rank ferns and moss sprinkled with crimson bells they slept all afternoon and till midnight played studpoker with the guides poker was a serious business to the guides they did not gossip they shuffled the thick greasy cards with a deft ferocity menacing to the sports and joe paradise king of guides was sarcastic to loiterers who halted the game even to scratch  at midnight as paul and he blundered to their cottage over the pungent wet grass and pineroots confusing in the darkness babbitt rejoiced that he did not have to explain to his wife where he had been all evening  they did not talk much the nervous loquacity and opinionation of the zenith athletic club dropped from them but when they did talk they slipped into the naive intimacy of college days once they drew their canoe up to the bank of sunasquam water a stream walled in by the dense green of the hardhack the sun roared on the green jungle but in the shade was sleepy peace and the water was golden and rippling babbitt drew his hand through the cool flood and mused  we never thought wed come to maine together  no weve never done anything the way we thought we would i expected to live in germany with my granddads people and study the fiddle  thats so and remember how i wanted to be a lawyer and go into politics i still think i might have made a go of it ive kind of got the gift of the gabanyway i can think on my feet and make some kind of a spiel on most anything and of course thats the thing you need in politics by golly teds going to lawschool even if i didnt welli guess its worked out all right myras been a fine wife and zilla means well paulibus  yes up here i figure out all sorts of plans to keep her amused i kind of feel life is going to be different now that were getting a good rest and can go back and start over again  i hope so old boy shyly say gosh its been awful nice to sit around and loaf and gamble and act regular with you along you old horsethief  well you know what it means to me georgie saved my life  the shame of emotion overpowered them they cursed a little to prove they were good rough fellows and in a mellow silence babbitt whistling while paul hummed they paddled back to the hotel   v  though it was paul who had seemed overwrought babbitt who had been the protecting big brother paul became cleareyed and merry while babbitt sank into irritability he uncovered layer on layer of hidden weariness at first he had played nimble jester to paul and for him sought amusements by the end of the week paul was nurse and babbitt accepted favors with the condescension one always shows a patient nurse  the day before their families arrived the women guests at the hotel bubbled oh isnt it nice you must be so excited and the proprieties compelled babbitt and paul to look excited but they went to bed early and grumpy  when myra appeared she said at once now we want you boys to go on playing around just as if we werent here  the first evening he stayed out for poker with the guides and she said in placid merriment my youre a regular bad one the second evening she groaned sleepily good heavens are you going to be out every single night the third evening he didnt play poker  he was tired now in every cell funny vacation doesnt seem to have done me a bit of good he lamented pauls frisky as a colt but i swear im crankier and nervouser than when i came up here  he had three weeks of maine at the end of the second week he began to feel calm and interested in life he planned an expedition to climb sachem mountain and wanted to camp overnight at box car pond he was curiously weak yet cheerful as though he had cleansed his veins of poisonous energy and was filling them with wholesome blood  he ceased to be irritated by teds infatuation with a waitress his seventh tragic affair this year he played catch with ted and with pride taught him to cast a fly in the pineshadowed silence of skowtuit pond  at the end he sighed hang it im just beginning to enjoy my vacation but well i feel a lot better and its going to be one great year maybe the real estate board will elect me president instead of some fuzzy oldfashioned faker like chan mott  on the way home whenever he went into the smokingcompartment he felt guilty at deserting his wife and angry at being expected to feel guilty but each time he triumphed oh this is going to be a great year a great old year     chapter xii  i  all the way home from maine babbitt was certain that he was a changed man he was converted to serenity he was going to cease worrying about business he was going to have more intereststheaters public affairs reading and suddenly as he finished an especially heavy cigar he was going to stop smoking  he invented a new and perfect method he would buy no tobacco he would depend on borrowing it and of course he would be ashamed to borrow often in a spasm of righteousness he flung his cigarcase out of the smokingcompartment window he went back and was kind to his wife about nothing in particular he admired his own purity and decided absolutely simple just a matter of willpower he started a magazine serial about a scientific detective ten miles on he was conscious that he desired to smoke he ducked his head like a turtle going into its shell he appeared uneasy he skipped two pages in his story and didnt know it five miles later he leaped up and sought the porter say uh george have you got a the porter looked patient have you got a timetable babbitt finished at the next stop he went out and bought a cigar since it was to be his last before he reached zenith he finished it down to an inch stub  four days later he again remembered that he had stopped smoking but he was too busy catching up with his officework to keep it remembered   ii  baseball he determined would be an excellent hobby no sense a mans working his fool head off im going out to the game three times a week besides fellow ought to support the home team  he did go and support the team and enhance the glory of zenith by yelling attaboy and rotten he performed the rite scrupulously he wore a cotton handkerchief about his collar he became sweaty he opened his mouth in a wide loose grin and drank lemon soda out of a bottle he went to the game three times a week for one week then he compromised on watching the advocatetimes bulletinboard he stood in the thickest and steamiest of the crowd and as the boy up on the lofty platform recorded the achievements of big bill bostwick the pitcher babbitt remarked to complete strangers pretty nice good work and hastened back to the office  he honestly believed that he loved baseball it is true that he hadnt in twentyfive years himself played any baseball except backlot catch with tedvery gentle and strictly limited to ten minutes but the game was a custom of his clan and it gave outlet for the homicidal and sidestaking instincts which babbitt called patriotism and love of sport  as he approached the office he walked faster and faster muttering guess better hustle all about him the city was hustling for hustlings sake men in motors were hustling to pass one another in the hustling traffic men were hustling to catch trolleys with another trolley a minute behind and to leap from the trolleys to gallop across the sidewalk to hurl themselves into buildings into hustling express elevators men in dairy lunches were hustling to gulp down the food which cooks had hustled to fry men in barber shops were snapping jus shave me once over gotta hustle men were feverishly getting rid of visitors in offices adorned with the signs this is my busy day and the lord created the world in six daysyou can spiel all you got to say in six minutes men who had made five thousand year before last and ten thousand last year were urging on nerveyelping bodies and parched brains so that they might make twenty thousand this year and the men who had broken down immediately after making their twenty thousand dollars were hustling to catch trains to hustle through the vacations which the hustling doctors had ordered  among them babbitt hustled back to his office to sit down with nothing much to do except see that the staff looked as though they were hustling   iii  every saturday afternoon he hustled out to his country club and hustled through nine holes of golf as a rest after the weeks hustle  in zenith it was as necessary for a successful man to belong to a country club as it was to wear a linen collar babbitts was the outing golf and country club a pleasant grayshingled building with a broad porch on a daisystarred cliff above lake kennepoose there was another the tonawanda country club to which belonged charles mckelvey horace updike and the other rich men who lunched not at the athletic but at the union club babbitt explained with frequency you couldnt hire me to join the tonawanda even if i did have a hundred and eighty bucks to throw away on the initiation fee at the outing weve got a bunch of real human fellows and the finest lot of little women in townjust as good at joshing as the menbut at the tonawanda theres nothing but these wouldbes in new york getups drinking tea too much dog altogether why i wouldnt join the tonawanda even if theyi wouldnt join it on a bet  when he had played four or five holes he relaxed a bit his tobaccofluttering heart beat more normally and his voice slowed to the drawling of his hundred generations of peasant ancestors   iv  at least once a week mr and mrs babbitt and tinka went to the movies their favorite motionpicture theater was the chateau which held three thousand spectators and had an orchestra of fifty pieces which played arrangements from the operas and suites portraying a day on the farm or a fouralarm fire in the stone rotunda decorated with crownembroidered velvet chairs and almost medieval tapestries parrakeets sat on gilded lotos columns  with exclamations of well by golly and you got to go some to beat this dump babbitt admired the chateau as he stared across the thousands of heads a gray plain in the dimness as he smelled good clothes and mild perfume and chewinggum he felt as when he had first seen a mountain and realized how very very much earth and rock there was in it  he liked three kinds of films pretty bathing girls with bare legs policemen or cowboys and an industrious shooting of revolvers and funny fat men who ate spaghetti he chuckled with immense moisteyed sentimentality at interludes portraying puppies kittens and chubby babies and he wept at deathbeds and old mothers being patient in mortgaged cottages mrs babbitt preferred the pictures in which handsome young women in elaborate frocks moved through sets ticketed as the drawingrooms of new york millionaires as for tinka she preferred or was believed to prefer whatever her parents told her to  all his relaxationsbaseball golf movies bridge motoring long talks with paul at the athletic club or at the good red beef and old english chop housewere necessary to babbitt for he was entering a year of such activity as he had never known     chapter xiii  i  it was by accident that babbitt had his opportunity to address the s a r e b  the s a r e b as its members called it with the universal passion for mysterious and importantsounding initials was the state association of real estate boards the organization of brokers and operators it was to hold its annual convention at monarch zeniths chief rival among the cities of the state babbitt was an official delegate another was cecil rountree whom babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building and hated for his social position for being present at the smartest dances on royal ridge rountree was chairman of the convention programcommittee  babbitt had growled to him makes me tired the way these doctors and profs and preachers put on lugs about being professional men a good realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of em  right you are i say why dont you put that into a paper and give it at the s a r e b suggested rountree  well if it would help you in making up the programtell you the way i look at it is this first place we ought to insist that folks call us realtors and not realestate men sounds more like a reglar profession second placewhat is it distinguishes a profession from a mere trade business or occupation what is it why its the public service and the skill the trained skill and the knowledge and uh all that whereas a fellow that merely goes out for the jack he never considers thepublic service and trained skill and so on now as a professional  rather thats perfectly bully perfectly corking now you write it in a paper said rountree as he rapidly and firmly moved away   ii  however accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements and correspondence babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to prepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read  he laid out a new fifteencent school exercisebook on his wifes collapsible sewingtable set up for the event in the livingroom the household had been bullied into silence verona and ted requested to disappear and tinka threatened with if i hear one sound out of youif you holler for a glass of water one single solitary timeyou better not thats all mrs babbitt sat over by the piano making a nightgown and gazing with respect while babbitt wrote in the exercisebook to the rhythmical wiggling and squeaking of the sewingtable  when he rose damp and jumpy and his throat dusty from cigarettes she marveled i dont see how you can just sit down and make up things right out of your own head  oh its the training in constructive imagination that a fellow gets in modern business life  he had written seven pages whereof the first page set forth   illustration omitted consists of several doodles and 1 a profession 2 not just a trade crossed out 3 skill  vision 3 shd be called realtor  not just real est man   the other six pages were rather like the first  for a week he went about looking important every morning as he dressed he thought aloud jever stop to consider myra that before a town can have buildings or prosperity or any of those things some realtor has got to sell em the land all civilization starts with him jever realize that at the athletic club he led unwilling men aside to inquire say if you had to read a paper before a big convention would you start in with the funny stories or just kind of scatter em all through he asked howard littlefield for a set of statistics about realestate sales something good and impressive and littlefield provided something exceedingly good and impressive  but it was to t cholmondeley frink that babbitt most often turned he caught frink at the club every noon and demanded while frink looked hunted and evasive say chumyoure a shark on this writing stuffhow would you put this sentence see here in my manuscriptmanuscript now where the deuce is thatoh yes here would you say we ought not also to alone think or we ought also not to think alone or  one evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress babbitt forgot about style order and the other mysteries and scrawled off what he really thought about the realestate business and about himself and he found the paper written when he read it to his wife she yearned why dear its splendid beautifully written and so clear and interesting and such splendid ideas why its justits just splendid  next day he cornered chum frink and crowed well old son i finished it last evening just lammed it out i used to think you writingguys must have a hard job making up pieces but lord its a cinch pretty soft for you fellows you certainly earn your money easy some day when i get ready to retire guess ill take to writing and show you boys how to do it i always used to think i could write better stuff and more punch and originality than all this stuff you see printed and now im doggone sure of it  he had four copies of the paper typed in black with a gorgeous red title had them bound in pale blue manilla and affably presented one to old ira runyon the managing editor of the advocatetimes who said yes indeed yes he was very glad to have it and he certainly would read it all throughas soon as he could find time  mrs babbitt could not go to monarch she had a womensclub meeting babbitt said that he was very sorry   iii  besides the five official delegates to the conventionbabbitt rountree w a rogers alvin thayer and elbert wingthere were fifty unofficial delegates most of them with their wives  they met at the union station for the midnight train to monarch all of them save cecil rountree who was such a snob that he never wore badges displayed celluloid buttons the size of dollars and lettered we zoom for zenith the official delegates were magnificent with silver and magenta ribbons martin lumsens little boy willy carried a tasseled banner inscribed zenith the zip cityzeal zest and zowie1000000 in 1935 as the delegates arrived not in taxicabs but in the family automobile driven by the oldest son or by cousin fred they formed impromptu processions through the station waitingroom  it was a new and enormous waitingroom with marble pilasters and frescoes depicting the exploration of the chaloosa river valley by pere emile fauthoux in 1740 the benches were shelves of ponderous mahogany the newsstand a marble kiosk with a brass grill down the echoing spaces of the hall the delegates paraded after willy lumsens banner the men waving their cigars the women conscious of their new frocks and strings of beads all singing to the tune of auld lang syne the official city song written by chum frink       good old zenith      our kin and kith      wherever we may be      hats in the ring      we blithely sing      of thy prosperity  warren whitby the broker who had a gift of verse for banquets and birthdays had added to frinks city song a special verse for the realtors convention       oh here we come      the fellows from      zenith the zip citee      we wish to state      in real estate      theres none so live as we  babbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism he leaped on a bench shouting to the crowd  whats the matter with zenith  shes all right  whats best ole town in the u s a  zeeeeeenith  the patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in unenvious wonderitalian women with shawls old weary men with broken shoes roving roadwise boys in suits which had been flashy when they were new but which were faded now and wrinkled  babbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more dignified with wing and rogers he tramped up and down the cement platform beside the waiting pullmans motordriven baggagetrucks and redcapped porters carrying bags sped down the platform with an agreeable effect of activity arclights glared and stammered overhead the glossy yellow sleepingcars shone impressively babbitt made his voice to be measured and lordly he thrust out his abdomen and rumbled we got to see to it that the convention lets the legislature understand just where they get off in this matter of taxing realty transfers wing uttered approving grunts and babbitt swelledgloated  the blind of a pullman compartment was raised and babbitt looked into an unfamiliar world the occupant of the compartment was lucile mckelvey the pretty wife of the millionaire contractor possibly babbitt thrilled she was going to europe on the seat beside her was a bunch of orchids and violets and a yellow paperbound book which seemed foreign while he stared she picked up the book then glanced out of the window as though she was bored she must have looked straight at him and he had met her but she gave no sign she languidly pulled down the blind and he stood still a cold feeling of insignificance in his heart  but on the train his pride was restored by meeting delegates from sparta pioneer and other smaller cities of the state who listened respectfully when as a magnifico from the metropolis of zenith he explained politics and the value of a good sound business administration they fell joyfully into shoptalk the purest and most rapturous form of conversation  howd this fellow rountree make out with this big apartmenthotel he was going to put up whadde do get out bonds to finance it asked a sparta broker  well ill tell you said babbitt now if id been handling it  so elbert wing was droning i hired this shopwindow for a week and put up a big sign toy town for tiny tots and stuck in a lot of doll houses and some dinky little trees and then down at the bottom baby likes this dollydale but papa and mama will prefer our beautiful bungalows and you know that certainly got folks talking and first week we sold  the trucks sang licketylick licketylick as the train ran through the factory district furnaces spurted flame and powerhammers were clanging red lights green lights furious white lights rushed past and babbitt was important again and eager   iv  he did a voluptuous thing he had his clothes pressed on the train in the morning half an hour before they reached monarch the porter came to his berth and whispered theres a drawingroom vacant sir i put your suit in there in tan autumn overcoat over his pajamas babbitt slipped down the greencurtainlined aisle to the glory of his first private compartment the porter indicated that he knew babbitt was used to a manservant he held the ends of babbitts trousers that the beautifully sponged garment might not be soiled filled the bowl in the private washroom and waited with a towel  to have a private washroom was luxurious however enlivening a pullman smokingcompartment was by night even to babbitt it was depressing in the morning when it was jammed with fat men in woolen undershirts every hook filled with wrinkled cottony shirts the leather seat piled with dingy toiletkits and the air nauseating with the smell of soap and toothpaste babbitt did not ordinarily think much of privacy but now he reveled in it reveled in his valet and purred with pleasure as he gave the man a tip of a dollar and a half  he rather hoped that he was being noticed as in his newly pressed clothes with the adoring porter carrying his suitcase he disembarked at monarch  he was to share a room at the hotel sedgwick with w a rogers that shrewd rusticlooking zenith dealer in farmlands together they had a noble breakfast with waffles and coffee not in exiguous cups but in large pots babbitt grew expansive and told rogers about the art of writing he gave a bellboy a quarter to fetch a morning newspaper from the lobby and sent to tinka a postcard papa wishes you were here to bat round with him   v  the meetings of the convention were held in the ballroom of the allen house in an anteroom was the office of the chairman of the executive committee he was the busiest man in the convention he was so busy that he got nothing done whatever he sat at a marquetry table in a room littered with crumpled paper and all day long townboosters and lobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to him whereupon he looked vague and said rapidly yes yes thats a fine idea well do that and instantly forgot all about it lighted a cigar and forgot that too while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him men kept beseeching say mr chairmansay mr chairman without penetrating his exhausted hearing  in the exhibitroom were plans of the new suburbs of sparta pictures of the new state capitol at galop de vache and large ears of corn with the label natures gold from shelby county the garden spot of gods own country  the real convention consisted of men muttering in hotel bedrooms or in groups amid the badgespotted crowd in the hotellobby but there was a show of public meetings  the first of them opened with a welcome by the mayor of monarch the pastor of the first christian church of monarch a large man with a long damp frontal lock informed god that the realestate men were here now  the venerable minnemagantic realtor major carlton tuke read a paper in which he denounced cooperative stores william a larkin of eureka gave a comforting prognosis of the prospects for increased construction and reminded them that plateglass prices were two points lower  the convention was on  the delegates were entertained incessantly and firmly the monarch chamber of commerce gave them a banquet and the manufacturers association an afternoon reception at which a chrysanthemum was presented to each of the ladies and to each of the men a leather billfold inscribed from monarch the mighty motor mart  mrs crosby knowlton wife of the manufacturer of fleetwing automobiles opened her celebrated italian garden and served tea six hundred realestate men and wives ambled down the autumnal paths perhaps three hundred of them were quietly inconspicuous perhaps three hundred vigorously exclaimed this is pretty slick eh surreptitiously picked the late asters and concealed them in their pockets and tried to get near enough to mrs knowlton to shake her lovely hand without request the zenith delegates except rountree gathered round a marble dancing nymph and sang here we come the fellows from zenith the zip citee  it chanced that all the delegates from pioneer belonged to the brotherly and protective order of elks and they produced an enormous banner lettered b p o ebest people on earthboost pioneer oh eddie nor was galop de vache the state capital to be slighted the leader of the galop de vache delegation was a large reddish roundish man but active he took off his coat hurled his broad black felt hat on the ground rolled up his sleeves climbed upon the sundial spat and bellowed  well tell the world and the good lady whos giving the show this afternoon that the bonniest burg in this mans state is galop de vache you boys can talk about your zip but jus lemme murmur that old galop has the largest proportion of homeowning citizens in the state and when folks own their homes they aint starting labortroubles and theyre raising kids instead of raising hell galop de vache the town for homey folks the town that eats em alive oh bosco welltelltheworld  the guests drove off the garden shivered into quiet but mrs crosby knowlton sighed as she looked at a marble seat warm from five hundred summers of amalfi on the face of a winged sphinx which supported it some one had drawn a mustache in leadpencil crumpled paper napkins were dumped among the michaelmas daisies on the walk like shredded lovely flesh were the petals of the last gallant rose cigarette stubs floated in the goldfish pool trailing an evil stain as they swelled and disintegrated and beneath the marble seat the fragments carefully put together was a smashed teacup   vi  as he rode back to the hotel babbitt reflected myra would have enjoyed all this social agony for himself he cared less for the garden party than for the motor tours which the monarch chamber of commerce had arranged indefatigably he viewed waterreservoirs suburban trolleystations and tanneries he devoured the statistics which were given to him and marveled to his roommate w a rogers of course this town isnt a patch on zenith it hasnt got our outlook and natural resources but did you knowi nev did till todaythat they manufactured seven hundred and sixtythree million feet of lumber last year what d you think of that  he was nervous as the time for reading his paper approached when he stood on the low platform before the convention he trembled and saw only a purple haze but he was in earnest and when he had finished the formal paper he talked to them his hands in his pockets his spectacled face a flashing disk like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight they shouted thats the stuff and in the discussion afterward they referred with impressiveness to our friend and brother mr george f babbitt he had in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as well known as that diplomat of business cecil rountree after the meeting delegates from all over the state said hower you brother babbitt sixteen complete strangers called him george and three men took him into corners to confide mighty glad you had the courage to stand up and give the profession a real boost now ive always maintained  next morning with tremendous casualness babbitt asked the girl at the hotel newsstand for the newspapers from zenith there was nothing in the press but in the advocatetimes on the third pagehe gasped they had printed his picture and a halfcolumn account the heading was sensation at annual landmens convention g f babbitt prominent ziptown realtor keynoter in fine address  he murmured reverently i guess some of the folks on floral heights will sit up and take notice now and pay a little attention to old georgie   vii  it was the last meeting the delegations were presenting the claims of their several cities to the next years convention orators were announcing that galop de vache the capital city the site of kremer college and of the upholtz knitting works is the recognized center of culture and highclass enterprise and that hamburg the big little city with the logical location where every man is openhanded and every woman a heavenborn hostess throws wide to you her hospitable gates  in the midst of these more diffident invitations the golden doors of the ballroom opened with a blatting of trumpets and a circus parade rolled in it was composed of the zenith brokers dressed as cowpunchers bareback riders japanese jugglers at the head was big warren whitby in the bearskin and goldandcrimson coat of a drummajor behind him as a clown beating a bass drum extraordinarily happy and noisy was babbitt  warren whitby leaped on the platform made merry play with his baton and observed boyses and girlses the time has came to get down to cases a dyedinthewool zenithite sure loves his neighbors but weve made up our minds to grab this convention off our neighbor burgs like weve grabbed the condensedmilk business and the paperbox business and  j harry barmhill the convention chairman hinted were grateful to you mr uh but you must give the other boys a chance to hand in their bids now  a foghorn voice blared in eureka well promise free motor rides through the prettiest country  running down the aisle clapping his hands a lean bald young man cried im from sparta our chamber of commerce has wired me theyve set aside eight thousand dollars in real money for the entertainment of the convention  a clericallooking man rose to clamor money talks move we accept the bid from sparta  it was accepted   viii  the committee on resolutions was reporting they said that whereas almighty god in his beneficent mercy had seen fit to remove to a sphere of higher usefulness some thirtysix realtors of the state the past year therefore it was the sentiment of this convention assembled that they were sorry god had done it and the secretary should be and hereby was instructed to spread these resolutions on the minutes and to console the bereaved families by sending them each a copy  a second resolution authorized the president of the sareb to spend fifteen thousand dollars in lobbying for sane tax measures in the state legislature this resolution had a good deal to say about menaces to sound business and clearing the wheels of progress from illadvised and shortsighted obstacles  the committee on committees reported and with startled awe babbitt learned that he had been appointed a member of the committee on torrens titles  he rejoiced i said it was going to be a great year georgie old son you got big things ahead of you youre a naturalborn orator and a good mixer andzowie   ix  there was no formal entertainment provided for the last evening babbitt had planned to go home but that afternoon the jered sassburgers of pioneer suggested that babbitt and w a rogers have tea with them at the catalpa inn  teas were not unknown to babbitthis wife and he earnestly attended them at least twice a yearbut they were sufficiently exotic to make him feel important he sat at a glasscovered table in the art room of the inn with its painted rabbits mottoes lettered on birch bark and waitresses being artistic in dutch caps he ate insufficient lettuce sandwiches and was lively and naughty with mrs sassburger who was as smooth and largeeyed as a cloakmodel sassburger and he had met two days before so they were calling each other georgie and sassy  sassburger said prayerfully say boys before you go seeing this is the last chance ive got it up in my room and miriam here is the best little mixelogist in the stati unidos like us italians say  with wide flowing gestures babbitt and rogers followed the sassburgers to their room mrs sassburger shrieked oh how terrible when she saw that she had left a chemise of sheer lavender crepe on the bed she tucked it into a bag while babbitt giggled dont mind us were a couple o little divvils  sassburger telephoned for ice and the bellboy who brought it said prosaically and unprompted highball glasses or cocktail miriam sassburger mixed the cocktails in one of those dismal nakedly white waterpitchers which exist only in hotels when they had finished the first round she proved by intoning think you boys could stand anotheryou got a dividend coming that though she was but a woman she knew the complete and perfect rite of cocktaildrinking  outside babbitt hinted to rogers say w a old rooster it comes over me that i could stand it if we didnt go back to the lovin wives this handsome abend but just kind of stayed in monarch and threw a party heh  george you speak with the tongue of wisdom and sagashiteriferousness el wings wife has gone on to pittsburg lets see if we cant gather him in  at halfpast seven they sat in their room with elbert wing and two upstate delegates their coats were off their vests open their faces red their voices emphatic they were finishing a bottle of corrosive bootlegged whisky and imploring the bellboy say son can you get us some more of this embalming fluid they were smoking large cigars and dropping ashes and stubs on the carpet with windy guffaws they were telling stories they were in fact males in a happy state of nature  babbitt sighed i dont know how it strikes you hellions but personally i like this busting loose for a change and kicking over a couple of mountains and climbing up on the north pole and waving the aurora borealis around  the man from sparta a grave intense youngster babbled say i guess im as good a husband as the run of the mill but god i do get so tired of going home every evening and nothing to see but the movies thats why i go out and drill with the national guard i guess i got the nicest little wife in my burg butsay know what i wanted to do as a kid know what i wanted to do wanted to be a big chemist thas what i wanted to do but dad chased me out on the road selling kitchenware and

they all drank whisky from teacups and they were humorous and never listened to one another except when w a rogers kidded the italian waiter  say gooseppy he said innocently i want a couple o fried elephants ears  sorry sir we havent any  huh no elephants ears what do you know about that rogers turned to babbitt pedro says the elephants ears are all out  well ill be switched said the man from sparta with difficulty hiding his laughter  well in that case carlo just bring me a hunk o steak and a couple o bushels o french fried potatoes and some peas rogers went on i suppose back in dear old

printersreams of french fried spuds on the promenade deck comprehenezvous michelovitch angeloni  afterward elbert wing admired gee you certainly did have that poor dago going w a he couldnt make you out at all  in the monarch herald babbitt found an advertisement which he read aloud to applause and laughter  old colony theatre  shake the old dogs to the wrollicking wrens the bonniest bevy of

long as they could they were safe while they sat here legs firmly crossed under the table but they felt unsteady they were afraid of navigating the long and slippery floor of the grillroom under the eyes of the other guests and the tooattentive waiters  when they did venture tables got in their way and they sought to cover embarrassment by heavy jocularity at the coatroom as the girl handed out their hats they smiled at her and hoped that she a cool and expert judge would feel that they were gentlemen they croaked at one another who owns the bum lid and you take a good one george ill take whats left and to the checkgirl they stammered better come along sister high wide and fancy evening ahead all of them tried to tip her urging one another no wait here i got it right here among them they gave her three dollars   xi  flamboyantly smoking cigars they sat in a box at the burlesque show their feet up on the rail while a chorus of twenty daubed worried and inextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the more elementary chorusevolutions and a jewish comedian made vicious fun of jews in the entractes they met other lone delegates a dozen of them went in taxicabs out to bright blossom inn where the blossoms were made of dusty paper festooned along a room low and stinking like a cowstable no longer wisely used  here whisky was served openly in glasses two or three clerks who on payday longed to be taken for millionaires sheepishly danced with telephonegirls and manicuregirls in the narrow space between the tables fantastically whirled the professionals a young man in sleek eveningclothes and a slim mad girl in emerald silk with amber hair flung up as jaggedly as flames babbitt tried to dance with her he shuffled along the floor too bulky to be guided his steps unrelated to the rhythm of the jungle music and in his staggering he would have fallen had she not held him with supple kindly strength he was blind and deaf from prohibitionera alcohol he could not see the tables the faces but he was overwhelmed by the girl and her young pliant warmth  when she had firmly returned him to his group he remembered by a connection quite untraceable that his mothers mother had been scotch and with head thrown back eyes closed wide mouth indicating ecstasy he sang very slowly and richly loch lomond  but that was the last of his mellowness and jolly companionship the man from sparta said he was a bum singer and for ten minutes babbitt quarreled with him in a loud unsteady heroic indignation they called for drinks till the manager insisted that the place was closed all the while babbitt felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements when w a rogers drawled what say we go down the line and look over the girls he agreed savagely before they went three of them secretly made appointments with the professional dancing girl who agreed yes yes sure darling to everything they said and amiably forgot them  as they drove back through the outskirts of monarch down streets of small brown wooden cottages of workmen characterless as cells as they rattled across warehousedistricts which by drunken night seemed vast and perilous as they were borne toward the red lights and violent automatic pianos and the stocky women who simpered babbitt was frightened he wanted to leap from the taxicab but all his body was a murky fire and he groaned too late to quit now and knew that he did not want to quit  there was they felt one very humorous incident on the way a broker from minnemagantic said monarch is a lot sportier than zenith you zenith tightwads havent got any joints like these here babbitt raged thats a dirty lie snothin you cant find in zenith believe me we got more houses and hootchparlors an all kinds o dives than any burg in the state  he realized they were laughing at him he desired to fight and forgot it in such musty unsatisfying experiments as he had not known since college  in the morning when he returned to zenith his desire for rebellion was partly satisfied he had retrograded to a shamefaced contentment he was irritable he did not smile when w a rogers complained ow what a head i certainly do feel like the wrath of god this morning say i know what was the trouble somebody went and put alcohol in my booze last night  babbitts excursion was never known to his family nor to any one in zenith save rogers and wing it was not officially recognized even by himself if it had any consequences they have not been discovered     chapter xiv  this autumn a mr w g harding of marion ohio was appointed president of the united states but zenith was less interested in the national campaign than in the local election seneca doane though he was a lawyer and a graduate of the state university was candidate for mayor of zenith on an alarming labor ticket to oppose him the democrats and republicans united on lucas prout a mattressmanufacturer with a perfect record for sanity mr prout was supported by the banks the chamber of commerce all the decent newspapers and george f babbitt  babbitt was precinctleader on floral heights but his district was safe and he longed for stouter battling his convention paper had given him the beginning of a reputation for oratory so the republicandemocratic central committee sent him to the seventh ward and south zenith to address small audiences of workmen and clerks and wives uneasy with their new votes he acquired a fame enduring for weeks now and then a reporter was present at one of his meetings and the headlines though they were not very large indicated that george f babbitt had addressed cheering throng and distinguished man of affairs had pointed out the fallacies of doane once in the rotogravure section of the sunday advocatetimes there was a photograph of babbitt and a dozen other business men with the caption leaders of zenith finance and commerce who back prout  he deserved his glory he was an excellent campaigner he had faith he was certain that if lincoln were alive he would be electioneering for mr w g hardingunless he came to zenith and electioneered for lucas prout he did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties prout represented honest industry seneca doane represented whining laziness and you could take your choice with his broad shoulders and vigorous voice he was obviously a good fellow and rarest of all he really liked people he almost liked common workmen he wanted them to be well paid and able to afford high rentsthough naturally they must not interfere with the reasonable profits of stockholders thus nobly endowed and keyed high by the discovery that he was a natural orator he was popular with audiences and he raged through the campaign renowned not only in the seventh and eighth wards but even in parts of the sixteenth   ii  crowded in his car they came driving up to turnverein hall south zenithbabbitt his wife verona ted and paul and zilla riesling the hall was over a delicatessen shop in a street banging with trolleys and smelling of onions and gasoline and fried fish a new appreciation of babbitt filled all of them including babbitt  dont know how you keep it up talking to three bunches in one evening wish i had your strength said paul and ted exclaimed to verona the old man certainly does know how to kid these roughnecks along  men in black sateen shirts their faces newwashed but with a hint of grime under their eyes were loitering on the broad stairs up to the hall babbitts party politely edged through them and into the whitewashed room at the front of which was a dais with a redplush throne and a pine altar painted watery blue as used nightly by the grand masters and supreme potentates of innumerable lodges the hall was full as babbitt pushed through the fringe standing at the back he heard the precious tribute thats him the chairman bustled down the center aisle with an impressive the speaker all ready sir uhlets seewhat was the name sir  then babbitt slid into a sea of eloquence  ladies and gentlemen of the sixteenth ward there is one who cannot be with us here tonight a man than whom there is no more stalwart trojan in all the political arenai refer to our leader the honorable lucas prout standardbearer of the city and county of zenith since he is not here i trust that you will bear with me if as a friend and neighbor as one who is proud to share with you the common blessing of being a resident of the great city of zenith i tell you in all candor honesty and sincerity how the issues of this critical campaign appear to one plain man of businessto one who brought up to the blessings of poverty and of manual labor has even when fate condemned him to sit at a desk yet never forgotten how it feels by heck to be up at fivethirty and at the factory with the ole dinnerpail in his hardened mitt when the whistle blew at seven unless the owner sneaked in ten minutes on us and blew it early laughter to come down to the basic and fundamental issues of this campaign the great error insincerely promulgated by seneca doane  there were workmen who jeeredyoung cynical workmen for the most part foreigners jews swedes irishmen italiansbut the older men the patient bleached stooped carpenters and mechanics cheered him and when he worked up to his anecdote of lincoln their eyes were wet  modestly busily he hurried out of the hall on delicious applause and sped off to his third audience of the evening ted you better drive he said kind of all in after that spiel well paul howd it go did i get em  bully corking you had a lot of pep  mrs babbitt worshiped oh it was fine so clear and interesting and such nice ideas when i hear you orating i realize i dont appreciate how profoundly you think and what a splendid brain and vocabulary you have justsplendid but verona was irritating dad she worried how do you know that public ownership of utilities and so on and so forth will always be a failure  mrs babbitt reproved rone i should think you could see and realize that when your fathers all worn out with orating its no time to expect him to explain these complicated subjects im sure when hes rested hell be glad to explain it to you now lets all be quiet and give papa a chance to get ready for his next speech just think right now theyre gathering in maccabee temple and waiting for us   iii  mr lucas prout and sound business defeated mr seneca doane and class rule and zenith was again saved babbitt was offered several minor appointments to distribute among poor relations but he preferred advance information about the extension of paved highways and this a grateful administration gave to him also he was one of only nineteen speakers at the dinner with which the chamber of commerce celebrated the victory of righteousness  his reputation for oratory established at the dinner of the zenith real estate board he made the annual address the advocatetimes reported this speech with unusual fullness  one of the livest banquets that has recently been pulled off occurred last night in the annual gettogether fest of the zenith real estate board held in the venetian ball room of the ohearn house mine host gil ohearn had as usual done himself proud and those assembled feasted on such an assemblage of plates as could be rivaled nowhere west of new york if there and washed down the plenteous feed with the cup which inspired but did not inebriate in the shape of cider from the farm of chandler mott president of the board and who acted as witty and efficient chairman  as mr mott was suffering from slight infection and sore throat g f babbitt made the principal talk besides outlining the progress of torrensing real estate titles mr babbitt spoke in part as follows  in rising to address you with my impromptu speech carefully tucked into my vest pocket i am reminded of the story of the two irishmen mike and pat who were riding on the pullman both of them i forgot to say were sailors in the navy it seems mike had the lower berth and by and by he heard a terrible racket from the upper and when he yelled up to find out what the trouble was pat answered shure an bedad an how can i ever get a nights sleep at all at all i been trying to get into this darned little hammock ever since eight bells  now gentlemen standing up here before you i feel a good deal like pat and maybe after ive spieled along for a while i may feel so darn small that ill be able to crawl into a pullman hammock with no trouble at all at all  gentlemen it strikes me that each year at this annual occasion when friend and foe get together and lay down the battleax and let the waves of goodfellowship waft them up the flowery slopes of amity it behooves us standing together eye to eye and shoulder to shoulder as fellowcitizens of the best city in the world to consider where we are both as regards ourselves and the common weal  it is true that even with our 361000 or practically 362000 population there are by the last census almost a score of larger cities in the united states but gentlemen if by the next census we do not stand at least tenth then ill be the first to request any knocker to remove my shirt and to eat the same with the compliments of g f babbitt esquire it may be true that new york chicago and philadelphia will continue to keep ahead of us in size but aside from these three cities which are notoriously so overgrown that no decent white man nobody who loves his wife and kiddies and gods good outodoors and likes to shake the hand of his neighbor in greeting would want to live in themand let me tell you right here and now i wouldnt trade a highclass zenith acreage development for the whole length and breadth of broadway or state streetaside from these three its evident to any one with a head for facts that zenith is the finest example of american life and prosperity to be found anywhere  i dont mean to say were perfect weve got a lot to do in the way of extending the paving of motor boulevards for believe me its the fellow with four to ten thousand a year say and an automobile and a nice little family in a bungalow on the edge of town that makes the wheels of progress go round  thats the type of fellow thats ruling america today in fact its the ideal type to which the entire world must tend if theres to be a decent wellbalanced christian goahead future for this little old planet once in a while i just naturally sit back and size up this solid american citizen with a whale of a lot of satisfaction  our ideal citizeni picture him first and foremost as being busier than a birddog not wasting a lot of good time in daydreaming or going to sassiety teas or kicking about things that are none of his business but putting the zip into some store or profession or art at night he lights up a good cigar and climbs into the little old bus and maybe cusses the carburetor and shoots out home he mows the lawn or sneaks in some practice putting and then hes ready for dinner after dinner he tells the kiddies a story or takes the family to the movies or plays a few fists of bridge or reads the evening paper and a chapter or two of some good lively western novel if he has a taste for literature and maybe the folks nextdoor drop in and they sit and visit about their friends and the topics of the day then he goes happily to bed his conscience clear having contributed his mite to the prosperity of the city and to his own bankaccount  in politics and religion this sane citizen is the canniest man on earth and in the arts he invariably has a natural taste which makes him pick out the best every time in no country in the world will you find so many reproductions of the old masters and of wellknown paintings on parlor walls as in these united states no country has anything like our number of phonographs with not only dance records and comic but also the best operas such as verdi rendered by the worlds highestpaid singers  in other countries art and literature are left to a lot of shabby bums living in attics and feeding on booze and spaghetti but in america the successful writer or picturepainter is indistinguishable from any other decent business man and i for one am only too glad that the man who has the rare skill to season his message with interesting reading matter and who shows both purpose and pep in handling his literary wares has a chance to drag down his fifty thousand bucks a year to mingle with the biggest executives on terms of perfect equality and to show as big a house and as swell a car as any captain of industry but mind you its the appreciation of the regular guy who i have been depicting which has made this possible and you got to hand as much credit to him as to the authors themselves  finally but most important our standardized citizen even if he is a bachelor is a lover of the little ones a supporter of the hearthstone which is the basic foundation of our civilization first last and all the time and the thing that most distinguishes us from the decayed nations of europe  i have never yet toured europeand as a matter of fact i dont know that i care to such an awful lot as long as theres our own mighty cities and mountains to be seenbut the way i figure it out there must be a good many of our own sort of folks abroad indeed one of the most enthusiastic rotarians i ever met boosted the tenets of onehundredpercent pep in a burr that smacked o bonny scutlond and all ye bonny braes o bobby burns but same time one thing that distinguishes us from our good brothers the hustlers over there is that theyre willing to take a lot off the snobs and journalists and politicians while the modern american business man knows how to talk right up for himself knows how to make it good and plenty clear that he intends to run the works he doesnt have to call in some highbrow hiredman when its necessary for him to answer the crooked critics of the sane and efficient life hes not dumb like the oldfashioned merchant hes got a vocabulary and a punch  with all modesty i want to stand up here as a representative business man and gently whisper heres our kind of folks heres the specifications of the standardized american citizen heres the new generation of americans fellows with hair on their chests and smiles in their eyes and addingmachines in their offices were not doing any boasting but we like ourselves firstrate and if you dont like us look outbetter get under cover before the cyclone hits town  so in my clumsy way i have tried to sketch the real heman the fellow with zip and bang and its because zenith has so large a proportion of such men that its the most stable the greatest of our cities new york also has its thousands of real folks but new york is cursed with unnumbered foreigners so are chicago and san francisco oh we have a golden roster of citiesdetroit and cleveland with their renowned factories cincinnati with its great machinetool and soap products pittsburg and birmingham with their steel kansas city and minneapolis and omaha that open their bountiful gates on the bosom of the oceanlike wheatlands and countless other magnificent sistercities for by the last census there were no less than sixtyeight glorious american burgs with a population of over one hundred thousand and all these cities stand together for power and purity and against foreign ideas and communismatlanta with hartford rochester with denver milwaukee with indianapolis los angeles with scranton portland maine with portland oregon a good live wire from baltimore or seattle or duluth is the twinbrother of every like fellow booster from buffalo or akron fort worth or oskaloosa  but its here in zenith the home for manly men and womanly women and bright kids that you find the largest proportion of these regular guys and thats what sets it in a class by itself thats why zenith will be remembered in history as having set the pace for a civilization that shall endure when the old timekilling ways are gone forever and the day of earnest efficient endeavor shall have dawned all round the world  some time i hope folks will quit handing all the credit to a lot of motheaten mildewed outofdate old european dumps and give proper credit to the famous zenith spirit that clean fighting determination to win success that has made the little old zip city celebrated in every land and clime wherever condensed milk and pasteboard cartons are known believe me the world has fallen too long for these wornout countries that arent producing anything but bootblacks and scenery and booze that havent got one bathroom per hundred people and that dont know a looseleaf ledger from a slipcover and its just about time for some zenithite to get his back up and holler for a showdown  i tell you zenith and her sistercities are producing a new type of civilization there are many resemblances between zenith and these other burgs and im darn glad of it the extraordinary growing and sane standardization of stores offices streets hotels clothes and newspapers throughout the united states shows how strong and enduring a type is ours  i always like to remember a piece that chum frink wrote for the newspapers about his lecturetours it is doubtless familiar to many of you but if you will permit me ill take a chance and read it its one of the classic poems like if by kipling or ella wheeler wilcoxs the man worth while and i always carry this clipping of it in my notebook   when i am out upon the road a poet with a pedlers load i mostly sing a hearty song and take a chew and hike along ahanding out my samples fine of cheero brand of sweet sunshine and peddling optimistic pokes and stable lines of japes and jokes to lyceums and other folks to rotarys kiwanis clubs and feel i aint like other dubs and then old major silas satan a brainy cuss whos always waitin he gives his tail a lively quirk and gets in quick his dirty work he fills me up with mullygrubs my hair the backward way he rubs he makes me lonelier than a hound on sunday when the folks aint round and then b gosh i would prefer to never be a lecturer aridin round in classy cars and smoking fiftycent cigars and never more i want to roam i simply want to be back home aeatin flap jacks hash and ham with folks who savvy whom i am  but when i get that lonely spell i simply seek the best hotel no matter in what town i best paul toledo or kc in washington schenectady in louisville or albany and at that inn it hits my dome that i again am right at home if i should stand a lengthy spell in front of that firstclass hotel that to the drummers loves to cater across from some big film theayter if i should look around and buzz and wonder in what town i was i swear that i could never tell for all the crowd would be so swell in just the same fine sort of jeans they wear at home and all the queens with spiffy bonnets on their beans and all the fellows standing round atalkin always ill be bound the same good jolly kind of guff bout autos politics and stuff and baseball players of renown that nice guys talk in my home town  then when i entered that hotel id look around and say well well for there would be the same newsstand same magazines and candies grand same smokes of famous standard brand id find at home ill tell and when i saw the jolly bunch come waltzing in for eats at lunch and squaring up in natty duds to platters large of french fried spuds why then id stand right up and bawl ive never left my home at all and all replete id sit me down beside some guy in derby brown upon a lobby chair of plush and murmur to him in a rush hello bill tell me good old scout how is your stock aholdin out then wed be off two solid pals achatterin like giddy gals of flivvers weather home and wives lodgebrothers then for all our lives so when sam satan makes you blue good friend thats what id up and do for in these states whereer you roam you never leave your home sweet home   yes sir these other burgs are our true partners in the great game of vital living but lets not have any mistake about this i claim that zenith is the best partner and the fastestgrowing partner of the whole caboodle i trust i may be pardoned if i give a few statistics to back up my claims if they are old stuff to any of you yet the tidings of prosperity like the good news of the bible never become tedious to the ears of a real hustler no matter how oft the sweet story is told every intelligent person knows that zenith manufactures more condensed milk and evaporated cream more paper boxes and more lightingfixtures than any other city in the united states if not in the world but it is not so universally known that we also stand second in the manufacture of packagebutter sixth in the giant realm of motors and automobiles and somewhere about third in cheese leather findings tar roofing breakfast food and overalls  our greatness however lies not alone in punchful prosperity but equally in that public spirit that forwardlooking idealism and brotherhood which has marked zenith ever since its foundation by the fathers we have a right indeed we have a duty toward our fair city to announce broadcast the facts about our high schools characterized by their complete plants and the finest schoolventilating systems in the country bar none our magnificent new hotels and banks and the paintings and carved marble in their lobbies and the second national tower the second highest business building in any inland city in the entire country when i add that we have an unparalleled number of miles of paved streets bathrooms vacuum cleaners and all the other signs of civilization that our library and art museum are well supported and housed in convenient and roomy buildings that our parksystem is more than up to par with its handsome driveways adorned with grass shrubs and statuary then i give but a hint of the all round unlimited greatness of zenith  i believe however in keeping the best to the last when i remind you that we have one motor car for every five and seveneighths persons in the city then i give a rockribbed practical indication of the kind of progress and braininess which is synonymous with the name zenith  but the way of the righteous is not all roses before i close i must call your attention to a problem we have to face this coming year the worst menace to sound government is not the avowed socialists but a lot of cowards who work under coverthe longhaired gentry who call themselves liberals and radicals and nonpartisan and intelligentsia and god only knows how many other trick names irresponsible teachers and professors constitute the worst of this whole gang and i am ashamed to say that several of them are on the faculty of our great state university the u is my own alma mater and i am proud to be known as an alumni but there are certain instructors there who seem to think we ought to turn the conduct of the nation over to hoboes and roustabouts  those profs are the snakes to be scotchedthey and all their milkandwater ilk the american business man is generous to a fault but one thing he does demand of all teachers and lecturers and journalists if were going to pay them our good money theyve got to help us by selling efficiency and whooping it up for rational prosperity and when it comes to these blabmouth faultfinding pessimistic cynical university teachers let me tell you that during this golden coming year its just as much our duty to bring influence to have those cusses fired as it is to sell all the real estate and gather in all the good shekels we can  not till that is done will our sons and daughters see that the ideal of american manhood and culture isnt a lot of cranks sitting around chewing the rag about their rights and their wrongs but a godfearing hustling successful twofisted regular guy who belongs to some church with pep and piety to it who belongs to the boosters or the rotarians or the kiwanis to the elks or moose or red men or knights of columbus or any one of a score of organizations of good jolly kidding laughing sweating upstanding lendahanding royal good fellows who plays hard and works hard and whose answer to his critics is a squaretoed boot thatll teach the grouches and smart alecks to respect the heman and get out and root for uncle samuel usa   iv  babbitt promised to become a recognized orator he entertained a smoker of the mens club of the chatham road presbyterian church with irish jewish and chinese dialect stories  but in nothing was he more clearly revealed as the prominent citizen than in his lecture on brass tacks facts on real estate as delivered before the class in sales methods at the zenith ymca  the advocatetimes reported the lecture so fully that vergil gunch said to babbitt youre getting to be one of the classiest spellbinders in town seems s if i couldnt pick up a paper without reading about your wellknown eloquence all this guff ought to bring a lot of business into your office good work keep it up  go on quit your kidding said babbitt feebly but at this tribute from gunch himself a man of no mean oratorical fame he expanded with delight and wondered how before his vacation he could have questioned the joys of being a solid citizen     chapter xv  his march to greatness was not without disastrous stumbling  fame did not bring the social advancement which the babbitts deserved they were not asked to join the tonawanda country club nor invited to the dances at the union himself babbitt fretted he didnt care a fat hoot for all these highrollers but the wife would kind of like to be among those present he nervously awaited his university classdinner and an evening of furious intimacy with such social leaders as charles mckelvey the millionaire contractor max kruger the banker irving tate the toolmanufacturer and adelbert dobson the fashionable interior decorator theoretically he was their friend as he had been in college and when he encountered them they still called him georgie but he didnt seem to encounter them often and they never invited him to dinner with champagne and a butler at their houses on royal ridge  all the week before the classdinner he thought of them no reason why we shouldnt become real chummy now   ii  like all true american diversions and spiritual outpourings the dinner of the men of the class of 1896 was thoroughly organized the dinnercommittee hammered like a salescorporation once a week they sent out reminders  tickler no 3  old man are you going to be with us at the livest friendship feed the alumni of the good old u have ever known the alumnae of 08 turned out 60 strong are we boys going to be beaten by a bunch of skirts come on fellows lets work up some real genuine enthusiasm and all boost together for the snappiest dinner yet elegant eats short gingertalks and memories shared together of the brightest gladdest days of life   the dinner was held in a private room at the union club the club was a dingy building three pretentious old dwellings knocked together and the entrancehall resembled a potato cellar yet the babbitt who was free of the magnificence of the athletic club entered with embarrassment he nodded to the doorman an ancient proud negro with brass buttons and a blue tailcoat and paraded through the hall trying to look like a member  sixty men had come to the dinner they made islands and eddies in the hall they packed the elevator and the corners of the private diningroom they tried to be intimate and enthusiastic they appeared to one another exactly as they had in collegeas raw youngsters whose present mustaches baldnesses paunches and wrinkles were but jovial disguises put on for the evening you havent changed a particle they marveled the men whom they could not recall they addressed well well great to see you again old man what are youstill doing the same thing  some one was always starting a cheer or a college song and it was always thinning into silence despite their resolution to be democratic they divided into two sets the men with dressclothes and the men without babbitt extremely in dressclothes went from one group to the other though he was almost frankly out for social conquest he sought paul riesling first he found him alone neat and silent  paul sighed im no good at this handshaking and well look whos here bunk  rats now paulibus loosen up and be a mixer finest bunch of boys on earth say you seem kind of glum whats matter  oh the usual runin with zilla  come on lets wade in and forget our troubles  he kept paul beside him but worked toward the spot where charles mckelvey stood warming his admirers like a furnace  mckelvey had been the hero of the class of 96 not only football captain and hammerthrower but debater and passable in what the state university considered scholarship he had gone on had captured the constructioncompany once owned by the dodsworths bestknown pioneer family of zenith he built state capitols skyscrapers railway terminals he was a heavyshouldered bigchested man but not sluggish there was a quiet humor in his eyes a syrupsmooth quickness in his speech which intimidated politicians and warned reporters and in his presence the most intelligent scientist or the most sensitive artist felt thinblooded unworldly and a little shabby he was particularly when he was influencing legislatures or hiring laborspies very easy and lovable and gorgeous he was baronial he was a peer in the rapidly crystallizing american aristocracy inferior only to the haughty old families in zenith an old family is one which came to town before 1840 his power was the greater because he was not hindered by scruples by either the vice or the virtue of the older puritan tradition  mckelvey was being placidly merry now with the great the manufacturers and bankers the landowners and lawyers and surgeons who had chauffeurs and went to europe babbitt squeezed among them he liked mckelveys smile as much as the social advancement to be had from his favor if in pauls company he felt ponderous and protective with mckelvey he felt slight and adoring  he heard mckelvey say to max kruger the banker yes well put up sir gerald doak babbitts democratic love for titles became a rich relish you know hes one of the biggest ironmen in england max horribly welloff why hello old georgie say max george babbitt is getting fatter than i am  the chairman shouted take your seats fellows  shall we make a move charley babbitt said casually to mckelvey  right hello paul hows the old fiddler planning to sit anywhere special george come on lets grab some seats come on max georgie i read about your speeches in the campaign bully work  after that babbitt would have followed him through fire he was enormously busy during the dinner now bumblingly cheering paul now approaching mckelvey with hear youre going to build some piers in brooklyn now noting how enviously the failures of the class sitting by themselves in a weedy group looked up to him in his association with the nobility now warming himself in the society talk of mckelvey and max kruger they spoke of a jungle dance for which mona dodsworth had decorated her house with thousands of orchids they spoke with an excellent imitation of casualness of a dinner in washington at which mckelvey had met a senator a balkan princess and an english majorgeneral mckelvey called the princess jenny and let it be known that he had danced with her  babbitt was thrilled but not so weighted with awe as to be silent if he was not invited by them to dinner he was yet accustomed to talking with bankpresidents congressmen and clubwomen who entertained poets he was bright and referential with mckelvey  say charley juh remember in junior year how we chartered a seagoing hack and chased down to riverdale to the big show madame brown used to put on remember how you beat up that hick constabule that tried to run us in and we pinched the pantspressing sign and took and hung it on prof morrisons door oh gosh those were the days  those mckelvey agreed were the days  babbitt had reached it isnt the books you study in college but the friendships you make that counts when the men at head of the table broke into song he attacked mckelvey  its a shame uh shame to drift apart because our uh business activities lie in different fields ive enjoyed talking over the good old days you and mrs mckelvey must come to dinner some night  vaguely yes indeed  like to talk to you about the growth of real estate out beyond your grantsville warehouse i might be able to tip you off to a thing or two possibly  splendid we must have dinner together georgie just let me know and it will be a great pleasure to have your wife and you at the house said mckelvey much less vaguely  then the chairmans voice that prodigious voice which once had roused them to cheer defiance at rooters from ohio or michigan or indiana whooped come on you wombats all together in the long yell babbitt felt that life would never be sweeter than now when he joined with paul riesling and the newly recovered hero mckelvey in  baaaaaattleax get an ax balax getnax who who the u hooroo   iii  the babbitts invited the mckelveys to dinner in early december and the mckelveys not only accepted but after changing the date once or twice actually came  the babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner from the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted almonds to be placed before each person especially did they mention the matter of the other guests to the last babbitt held out for giving paul riesling the benefit of being with the mckelveys good old charley would like paul and verg gunch better than some highfalutin willy boy he insisted but mrs babbitt interrupted his observations with yesperhapsi think ill try to get some lynnhaven oysters and when she was quite ready she invited dr j t angus the oculist and a dismally respectable lawyer named maxwell with their glittering wives  neither angus nor maxwell belonged to the elks or to the athletic club neither of them had ever called babbitt brother or asked his opinions on carburetors the only human people whom she invited babbitt raged were the littlefields and howard littlefield at times became so statistical that babbitt longed for the refreshment of gunchs well old lemonpieface whats the good word  immediately after lunch mrs babbitt began to set the table for the seventhirty dinner to the mckelveys and babbitt was by order home at four but they didnt find anything for him to do and three times mrs babbitt scolded do please try to keep out of the way he stood in the door of the garage his lips drooping and wished that littlefield or sam doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him he saw ted sneaking about the corner of the house  whats the matter old man said babbitt  is that you thin owld one gee ma certainly is on the warpath i told her rone and i would jus soon not be let in on the fiesta tonight and she bit me she says i got to take a bath too but say the babbitt men will be some lookers tonight little theodore in a dresssuit  the babbitt men babbitt liked the sound of it he put his arm about the boys shoulder he wished that paul riesling had a daughter so that ted might marry her yes your mother is kind of rouncing round all right he said and they laughed together and sighed together and dutifully went in to dress  the mckelveys were less than fifteen minutes late  babbitt hoped that the doppelbraus would see the mckelveys limousine and their uniformed chauffeur waiting in front  the dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful and mrs babbitt had brought out her grandmothers silver candlesticks babbitt worked hard he was good he told none of the jokes he wanted to tell he listened to the others he started maxwell off with a resounding lets hear about your trip to the yellowstone he was laudatory extremely laudatory he found opportunities to remark that dr angus was a benefactor to humanity maxwell and howard littlefield profound scholars charles mckelvey an inspiration to ambitious youth and mrs mckelvey an adornment to the social circles of zenith washington new york paris and numbers of other places  but he could not stir them it was a dinner without a soul for no reason that was clear to babbitt heaviness was over them and they spoke laboriously and unwillingly  he concentrated on lucille mckelvey carefully not looking at her blanched lovely shoulder and the tawny silken bared which supported her frock  i suppose youll be going to europe pretty soon again wont you he invited  id like awfully to run over to rome for a few weeks  i suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything there  no what i really go for is theres a little trattoria on the via della scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world  oh iyes that must be nice to try that yes  at a quarter to ten mckelvey discovered with profound regret that his wife had a headache he said blithely as babbitt helped him with his coat we must lunch together some time and talk over the old days  when the others had labored out at halfpast ten babbitt turned to his wife pleading charley said he had a corking time and we must lunchsaid they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before long  she achieved oh its just been one of those quiet evenings that are often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at once and doesnt really settle down tonice quiet enjoyment  but from his cot on the sleepingporch he heard her weeping slowly without hope   iv  for a month they watched the social columns and waited for a return dinnerinvitation  as the hosts of sir gerald doak the mckelveys were headlined all the week after the babbitts dinner zenith ardently received sir gerald who had come to america to buy coal the newspapers interviewed him on prohibition ireland unemployment naval aviation the rate of exchange teadrinking versus whiskydrinking the psychology of american women and daily life as lived by english county families sir gerald seemed to have heard of all those topics the mckelveys gave him a singhalese dinner and miss elnora pearl bates society editor of the advocatetimes rose to her highest larknote babbitt read aloud at breakfasttable   twixt the original and oriental decorations the strange and delicious food and the personalities both of the distinguished guests the charming hostess and the noted host never has zenith seen a more recherche affair than the ceylon dinnerdance given last evening by mr and mrs charles mckelvey to sir gerald doak methought as wefortunate onewere privileged to view that fairy and foreign scene nothing at monte carlo or the choicest ambassadorial sets of foreign capitals could be more lovely it is not for nothing that zenith is in matters social rapidly becoming known as the choosiest inland city in the country  though he is too modest to admit it lord doak gives a cachet to our smart quartier such as it has not received since the evermemorable visit of the earl of sittingbourne not only is he of the british peerage but he is also on dit a leader of the british metal industries as he comes from nottingham a favorite haunt of robin hood though now we are informed by lord doak a live modern city of 275573 inhabitants and important lace as well as other industries we like to think that perhaps through his veins runs some of the blood both virile red and bonny blue of that earlier lord o the good greenwood the roguish robin  the lovely mrs mckelvey never was more fascinating than last evening in her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and at her exquisite waist a glowing cluster of aaron ward roses   babbitt said bravely i hope they dont invite us to meet this lord doak guy darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with charley and the missus  at the zenith athletic club they discussed it amply i spose well have to call mckelvey lord chaz from now on said sidney finkelstein  it beats all getout meditated that man of data howard littlefield how hard it is for some people to get things straight here they call this fellow lord doak when it ought to be sir gerald  babbitt marvelled is that a fact well well sir gerald eh thats what you call um eh well sir im glad to know that  later he informed his salesmen its funnier n a goat the way some folks that just because they happen to lay up a big wad go entertaining famous foreigners dont have any more idea n a rabbit how to address em sos to make em feel at home  that evening as he was driving home he passed mckelveys limousine and saw sir gerald a large ruddy popeyed teutonic englishman whose dribble of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful babbitt drove on slowly oppressed by futility he had a sudden unexplained and horrible conviction that the mckelveys were laughing at him  he betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his wife folks that really tend to business havent got the time to waste on a bunch like the mckelveys this society stuff is like any other hobby if you devote yourself to it you get on but i like to have a chance to visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic chasing round  they did not speak of the mckelveys again   v  it was a shame at this worried time to have to think about the overbrooks  ed overbrook was a classmate of babbitt who had been a failure he had a large family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of dorchester he was gray and thin and unimportant he had always been gray and thin and unimportant he was the person whom in any group you forgot to introduce then introduced with extra enthusiasm he had admired babbitts goodfellowship in college had admired ever since his power in real estate his beautiful house and wonderful clothes it pleased babbitt though it bothered him with a sense of responsibility at the classdinner he had seen poor overbrook in a shiny blue serge businesssuit being diffident in a corner with three other failures he had gone over and been cordial why hello young ed i hear youre writing all the insurance in dorchester now bully work  they recalled the good old days when overbrook used to write poetry overbrook embarrassed him by blurting say georgie i hate to think of how we been drifting apart i wish you and mrs babbitt would come to dinner some night  babbitt boomed fine sure just let me know and the wife and i want to have you at the house he forgot it but unfortunately ed overbrook did not repeatedly he telephoned to babbitt inviting him to dinner might as well go and get it over babbitt groaned to his wife but dont it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesnt know the first thing about social etiquette think of him phoning me instead of his wife sitting down and writing us a regular bid well i guess were stuck for it thats the trouble with all this classbrother hooptedoodle  he accepted overbrooks next plaintive invitation for an evening two weeks off a dinner two weeks off even a family dinner never seems so appalling till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour they had to change the date because of their own dinner to the mckelveys but at last they gloomily drove out to the overbrooks house in dorchester  it was miserable from the beginning the overbrooks had dinner at sixthirty while the babbitts never dined before seven babbitt permitted himself to be ten minutes late lets make it as short as possible i think well duck out quick ill say i have to be at the office extra early tomorrow he planned  the overbrook house was depressing it was the second story of a wooden twofamily dwelling a place of babycarriages old hats hung in the hall cabbagesmell and a family bible on the parlor table ed overbrook and his wife were as awkward and threadbare as usual and the other guests were two dreadful families whose names babbitt never caught and never desired to catch but he was touched and disconcerted by the tactless way in which overbrook praised him were mighty proud to have old george here tonight of course youve all read about his speeches and oratory in the papersand the boys goodlooking too ehbut what i always think of is back in college and what a great old mixer he was and one of the best swimmers in the class  babbitt tried to be jovial he worked at it but he could find nothing to interest him in overbrooks timorousness the blankness of the other guests or the drained stupidity of mrs overbrook with her spectacles drab skin and tightdrawn hair he told his best irish story but it sank like soggy cake most bleary moment of all was when mrs overbrook peering out of her fog of nursing eight children and cooking and scrubbing tried to be conversational  i suppose you go to chicago and new york right along mr babbitt she prodded  well i get to chicago fairly often  it must be awfully interesting i suppose you take in all the theaters  well to tell the truth mrs overbrook thing that hits me best is a great big beefsteak at a dutch restaurant in the loop  they had nothing more to say babbitt was sorry but there was no hope the dinner was a failure at ten rousing out of the stupor of meaningless talk he said as cheerily as he could fraid we got to be starting ed ive got a fellow coming to see me early tomorrow as overbrook helped him with his coat babbitt said nice to rub up on the old days we must have lunch together pdq  mrs babbitt sighed on their drive home it was pretty terrible but how mr overbrook does admire you  yep poor cuss seems to think im a little tin archangel and the bestlooking man in zenith  well youre certainly not that butoh georgie you dont suppose we have to invite them to dinner at our house now do we  ouch gaw i hope not  see here now george you didnt say anything about it to mr overbrook did you  no gee no honest i didnt just made a bluff about having him to lunch some time  well oh dear i dont want to hurt their feelings but i dont see how i could stand another evening like this one and suppose somebody like dr and mrs angus came in when we had the overbrooks there and thought they were friends of ours  for a week they worried we really ought to invite ed and his wife poor devils but as they never saw the overbrooks they forgot them and after a month or two they said that really was the best way just to let it slide it wouldnt be kind to them to have them here theyd feel so out of place and hardup in our home  they did not speak of the overbrooks again     chapter xvi  the certainty that he was not going to be accepted by the mckelveys made babbitt feel guilty and a little absurd but he went more regularly to the elks at a chamber of commerce luncheon he was oratorical regarding the wickedness of strikes and again he saw himself as a prominent citizen  his clubs and associations were food comfortable to his spirit  of a decent man in zenith it was required that he should belong to one preferably two or three of the innumerous lodges and prosperityboosting lunchclubs to the rotarians the kiwanis or the boosters to the oddfellows moose masons red men woodmen owls eagles maccabees knights of pythias knights of columbus and other secret orders characterized by a high degree of heartiness sound morals and reverence for the constitution there were four reasons for joining these orders it was the thing to do it was good for business since lodgebrothers frequently became customers it gave to americans unable to become geheimrate or commendatori such unctuous honorifics as high worthy recording scribe and grand hoogow to add to the commonplace distinctions of colonel judge and professor and it permitted the swaddled american husband to stay away from home for one evening a week the lodge was his piazza his pavement cafe he could shoot pool and talk mantalk and be obscene and valiant  babbitt was what he called a joiner for all these reasons  behind the gold and scarlet banner of his public achievements was the dun background of officeroutine leases salescontracts lists of properties to rent the evenings of oratory and committees and lodges stimulated him like brandy but every morning he was sandytongued week by week he accumulated nervousness he was in open disagreement with his outside salesman stanley graff and once though her charms had always kept him nickeringly polite to her he snarled at miss mcgoun for changing his letters  but in the presence of paul riesling he relaxed at least once a week they fled from maturity on saturday they played golf jeering as a golfer youre a fine tennisplayer or they motored all sunday afternoon stopping at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a counter and drink coffee from thick cups sometimes paul came over in the evening with his violin and even zilla was silent as the lonely man who had lost his way and forever crept down unfamiliar roads spun out his dark soul in music   ii  nothing gave babbitt more purification and publicity than his labors for the sunday school  his church the chatham road presbyterian was one of the largest and richest one of the most oaken and velvety in zenith the pastor was the reverend john jennison drew ma dd lld the ma and the dd were from elbert university nebraska the lld from waterbury college oklahoma he was eloquent efficient and versatile he presided at meetings for the denunciation of unions or the elevation of domestic service and confided to the audiences that as a poor boy he had carried newspapers for the saturday edition of the evening advocate he wrote editorials on the manly mans religion and the dollars and sense value of christianity which were printed in bold type surrounded by a wiggly border he often said that he was proud to be known as primarily a business man and that he certainly was not going to permit the old satan to monopolize all the pep and punch he was a thin rusticfaced young man with gold spectacles and a bang of dull brown hair but when he hurled himself into oratory he glowed with power he admitted that he was too much the scholar and poet to imitate the evangelist mike monday yet he had once awakened his fold to new life and to larger collections by the challenge my brethren the real cheap skate is the man who wont lend to the lord  he had made his church a true community center it contained everything but a bar it had a nursery a thursday evening supper with a short bright missionary lecture afterward a gymnasium a fortnightly motionpicture show a library of technical books for young workmenthough unfortunately no young workman ever entered the church except to wash the windows or repair the furnaceand a sewingcircle which made short little pants for the children of the poor while mrs drew read aloud from earnest novels  though dr drews theology was presbyterian his churchbuilding was gracefully episcopalian as he said it had the most perdurable features of those noble ecclesiastical monuments of grand old england which stand as symbols of the eternity of faith religious and civil it was built of cheery ironspot brick in an improved gothic style and the main auditorium had indirect lighting from electric globes in lavish alabaster bowls  on a december morning when the babbitts went to church dr john jennison drew was unusually eloquent the crowd was immense ten brisk young ushers in morning coats with white roses were bringing folding chairs up from the basement there was an impressive musical program conducted by sheldon smeeth educational director of the ymca who also sang the offertory babbitt cared less for this because some misguided person had taught young mr smeeth to smile smile smile while he was singing but with all the appreciation of a felloworator he admired dr drews sermon it had the intellectual quality which distinguished the chatham road congregation from the grubby chapels on smith street  at this abundant harvesttime of all the year dr drew chanted when though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging wayfarer yet the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back oer all the labors and desires of the past twelve months oh then it seems to me there sounds behind all our apparent failures the golden chorus of greeting from those passed happily on and lo on the dim horizon we see behind dolorous clouds the mighty mass of mountainsmountains of melody mountains of mirth mountains of might  i certainly do like a sermon with culture and thought in it meditated babbitt  at the end of the service he was delighted when the pastor actively shaking hands at the door twittered oh brother babbitt can you wait a jiffy want your advice  sure doctor you bet  drop into my office i think youll like the cigars there babbitt did like the cigars he also liked the office which was distinguished from other offices only by the spirited change of the familiar wallplacard to this is the lords busy day chum frink came in then william w eathorne  mr eathorne was the seventyyearold president of the first state bank of zenith he still wore the delicate patches of sidewhiskers which had been the uniform of bankers in 1870 if babbitt was envious of the smart set of the mckelveys before william washington eathorne he was reverent mr eathorne had nothing to do with the smart set he was above it he was the greatgrandson of one of the five men who founded zenith in 1792 and he was of the third generation of bankers he could examine credits make loans promote or injure a mans business in his presence babbitt breathed quickly and felt young  the reverend dr drew bounced into the room and flowered into speech  ive asked you gentlemen to stay so i can put a proposition before you the sunday school needs bucking up its the fourth largest in zenith but theres no reason why we should take anybodys dust we ought to be first i want to request you if you will to form a committee of advice and publicity for the sunday school look it over and make any suggestions for its betterment and then perhaps see that the press gives us some attentiongive the public some really helpful and constructive news instead of all these murders and divorces  excellent said the banker  babbitt and frink were enchanted to join him   iii  if you had asked babbitt what his religion was he would have answered in sonorous boostersclub rhetoric my religion is to serve my fellow men to honor my brother as myself and to do my bit to make life happier for one and all if you had pressed him for more detail he would have announced im a member of the presbyterian church and naturally i accept its doctrines if you had been so brutal as to go on he would have protested theres no use discussing and arguing about religion it just stirs up bad feeling  actually the content of his theology was that there was a supreme being who had tried to make us perfect but presumably had failed that if one was a good man he would go to a place called heaven babbitt unconsciously pictured it as rather like an excellent hotel with a private garden but if one was a bad man that is if he murdered or committed burglary or used cocaine or had mistresses or sold nonexistent real estate he would be punished babbitt was uncertain however about what he called this business of hell he explained to ted of course im pretty liberal i dont exactly believe in a fireandbrimstone hell stands to reason though that a fellow cant get away with all sorts of vice and not get nicked for it see how i mean  upon this theology he rarely pondered the kernel of his practical religion was that it was respectable and beneficial to ones business to be seen going to services that the church kept the worst elements from being still worse and that the pastors sermons however dull they might seem at the time of taking yet had a voodooistic power which did a fellow goodkept him in touch with higher things  his first investigations for the sunday school advisory committee did not inspire him  he liked the busy folks bible class composed of mature men and women and addressed by the oldschool physician dr t atkins jordan in a sparkling style comparable to that of the more refined humorous afterdinner speakers but when he went down to the junior classes he was disconcerted he heard sheldon smeeth educational director of the ymca and leader of the churchchoir a pale but strenuous young man with curly hair and a smile teaching a class of sixteenyearold boys smeeth lovingly admonished them now fellows im going to have a heart to heart talk evening at my house next thursday well get off by ourselves and be frank about our secret worries you can just tell old sheldy anything like all the fellows do at the y im going to explain frankly about the horrible practises a kiddy falls into unless hes guided by a big brother and about the perils and glory of sex old sheldy beamed damply the boys looked ashamed and babbitt didnt know which way to turn his embarrassed eyes  less annoying but also much duller were the minor classes which were being instructed in philosophy and oriental ethnology by earnest spinsters most of them met in the highly varnished sunday school room but there was an overflow to the basement which was decorated with varicose waterpipes and lighted by small windows high up in the oozing wall what babbitt saw however was the first congregational church of catawba he was back in the sunday school of his boyhood he smelled again that polite stuffiness to be found only in church parlors he recalled the case of drab sunday school books hetty a humble heroine and josephus a lad of palestine he thumbed once more the highcolored textcards which no boy wanted but no boy liked to throw away because they were somehow sacred he was tortured by the stumbling rote of thirtyfive years ago as in the vast zenith church he listened to  now edgar you read the next verse what does it mean when it says its easier for a camel to go through a needles eye what does this teach us clarence please dont wiggle so if you had studied your lesson you wouldnt be so fidgety now earl what is the lesson jesus was trying to teach his disciples the one thing i want you to especially remember boys is the words with god all things are possible just think of that alwaysclarence please pay attentionjust say with god all things are possible whenever you feel discouraged and alec will you read the next verse if youd pay attention you wouldnt lose your place  dronedronedronegigantic bees that boomed in a cavern of drowsiness  babbitt started from his openeyed nap thanked the teacher for the privilege of listening to her splendid teaching and staggered on to the next circle  after two weeks of this he had no suggestions whatever for the reverend dr drew  then he discovered a world of sunday school journals an enormous and busy domain of weeklies and monthlies which were as technical as practical and forwardlooking as the realestate columns or the shoetrade magazines he bought half a dozen of them at a religious bookshop and till after midnight he read them and admired  he found many lucrative tips on focusing appeals scouting for new members and getting prospects to sign up with the sunday school he particularly liked the word prospects and he was moved by the rubric  the moral springs of the communitys life lie deep in its sunday schoolsits schools of religious instruction and inspiration neglect now means loss of spiritual vigor and moral power in years to come facts like the above followed by a straightarm appeal will reach folks who can never be laughed or jollied into doing their part  babbitt admitted thats so i used to skin out of the ole sunday school at catawba every chance i got but same time i wouldnt be where i am today maybe if it hadnt been for its training inin moral power and all about the bible great literature have to read some of it again one of these days  how scientifically the sunday school could be organized he learned from an article in the westminster adult bible class  the second vicepresident looks after the fellowship of the class she chooses a group to help her these become ushers every one who comes gets a glad hand no one goes away a stranger one member of the group stands on the doorstep and invites passersby to come in  perhaps most of all babbitt appreciated the remarks by william h ridgway in the sunday school times  if you have a sunday school class without any pep and getupandgo in it that is without interest that is uncertain in attendance that acts like a fellow with the spring fever let old dr ridgway write you a prescription rx invite the bunch for supper  the sunday school journals were as well rounded as they were practical they neglected none of the arts as to music the sunday school times advertised that c harold lowden known to thousands through his sacred compositions had written a new masterpiece entitled yearning for you the poem by harry d kerr is one of the daintiest you could imagine and the music is indescribably beautiful critics are agreed that it will sweep the country may be made into a charming sacred song by substituting the hymn words i heard the voice of jesus say  even manual training was adequately considered babbitt noted an ingenious way of illustrating the resurrection of jesus christ  model for pupils to make tomb with rolling dooruse a square covered box turned upside down pull the cover forward a little to form a groove at the bottom cut a square door also cut a circle of cardboard to more than cover the door cover the circular door and the tomb thickly with stiff mixture of sand flour and water and let it dry it was the heavy circular stone over the door the women found rolled away on easter morning this is the story we are to gotell  in their advertisements the sunday school journals were thoroughly efficient babbitt was interested in a preparation which takes the place of exercise for sedentary men by building up depleted nerve tissue nourishing the brain and the digestive system he was edified to learn that the selling of bibles was a hustling and strictly competitive industry and as an expert on hygiene he was pleased by the sanitary communion outfit companys announcement of an improved and satisfactory outfit throughout including highly polished beautiful mahogany tray this tray eliminates all noise is lighter and more easily handled than others and is more in keeping with the furniture of the church than a tray of any other material   iv  he dropped the pile of sunday school journals  he pondered now theres a real heworld corking  ashamed i havent sat in more fellow thats an influence in the communityshame if he doesnt take part in a real virile hustling religion sort of christianity incorporated you might say  but with all reverence  some folks might claim these sunday school fans are undignified and unspiritual and so on sure always some skunk to spring things like that knocking and sneering and tearingdownso much easier than building up but me i certainly hand it to these magazines theyve brought ole george f babbitt into camp and thats the answer to the critics  the more manly and practical a fellow is the more he ought to lead the enterprising christian life me for it cut out this carelessness and boozing androne where the devil you been this is a fine time o night to be coming in     chapter xvii  i  there are but three or four old houses in floral heights and in floral heights an old house is one which was built before 1880 the largest of these is the residence of william washington eathorne president of the first state bank  the eathorne mansion preserves the memory of the nice parts of zenith as they appeared from 1860 to 1900 it is a red brick immensity with gray sandstone lintels and a roof of slate in courses of red green and dyspeptic yellow there are two anemic towers one roofed with copper the other crowned with castiron ferns the porch is like an open tomb it is supported by squat granite pillars above which hang frozen cascades of brick at one side of the house is a huge stainedglass window in the shape of a keyhole  but the house has an effect not at all humorous it embodies the heavy dignity of those victorian financiers who ruled the generation between the pioneers and the brisk salesengineers and created a somber oligarchy by gaining control of banks mills land railroads mines out of the dozen contradictory zeniths which together make up the true and complete zenith none is so powerful and enduring yet none so unfamiliar to the citizens as the small still dry polite cruel zenith of the william eathornes and for that tiny hierarchy the other zeniths unwittingly labor and insignificantly die  most of the castles of the testy victorian tetrarchs are gone now or decayed into boardinghouses but the eathorne mansion remains virtuous and aloof reminiscent of london back bay rittenhouse square its marble steps are scrubbed daily the brass plate is reverently polished and the lace curtains are as prim and superior as william washington eathorne himself  with a certain awe babbitt and chum frink called on eathorne for a meeting of the sunday school advisory committee with uneasy stillness they followed a uniformed maid through catacombs of receptionrooms to the library it was as unmistakably the library of a solid old banker as eathornes sidewhiskers were the sidewhiskers of a solid old banker the books were most of them standard sets with the correct and traditional touch of dim blue dim gold and glossy calfskin the fire was exactly correct and traditional a small quiet steady fire reflected by polished fireirons the oak desk was dark and old and altogether perfect the chairs were gently supercilious  eathornes inquiries as to the healths of mrs babbitt miss babbitt and the other children were softly paternal but babbitt had nothing with which to answer him it was indecent to think of using the hows tricks ole socks which gratified vergil gunch and frink and howard littlefieldmen who till now had seemed successful and urbane babbitt and frink sat politely and politely did eathorne observe opening his thin lips just wide enough to dismiss the words gentlemen before we begin our conferenceyou may have felt the cold in coming hereso good of you to save an old man the journeyshall we perhaps have a whisky toddy  so well trained was babbitt in all the conversation that befits a good fellow that he almost disgraced himself with rather than make trouble and always providin there aint any enforcement officers hiding in the wastebasket the words died choking in his throat he bowed in flustered obedience so did chum frink  eathorne rang for the maid  the modern and luxurious babbitt had never seen any one ring for a servant in a private house except during meals himself in hotels had rung for bellboys but in the house you didnt hurt matildas feelings you went out in the hall and shouted for her nor had he since prohibition known any one to be casual about drinking it was extraordinary merely to sip his toddy and not cry oh maaaaan this hits me right where i live and always with the ecstasy of youth meeting greatness he marveled that little fuzzyface there why he could make me or break me if he told my banker to call my loans gosh that quartersized squirt and looking like he hadnt got a single bit of hustle to him i wonderdo we boosters throw too many fits about pep  from this thought he shuddered away and listened devoutly to eathornes ideas on the advancement of the sunday school which were very clear and very bad  diffidently babbitt outlined his own suggestions  i think if you analyze the needs of the school in fact going right at it as if it was a merchandizing problem of course the one basic and fundamental need is growth i presume were all agreed we wont be satisfied till we build up the biggest darn sunday school in the whole state so the chatham road presbyterian wont have to take anything off anybody now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects theyve already used contesting teams and given prizes to the kids that bring in the most members and they made a mistake there the prizes were a lot of folderols and doodads like poetry books and illustrated testaments instead of something a real live kid would want to work for like real cash or a speedometer for his motor cycle course i suppose its all fine and dandy to illustrate the lessons with these decorated bookmarks and blackboard drawings and so on but when it comes down to real hehustling getting out and drumming up customersor members i mean why you got to make it worth a fellows while  now i want to propose two stunts first divide the sunday school into four armies depending on age everybody gets a military rank in his own army according to how many members he brings in and the duffers that lie down on us and dont bring in any they remain privates the pastor and superintendent rank as generals and everybody has got to give salutes and all the rest of that junk just like a regular army to make em feel its worth while to get rank  then second course the school has its advertising committee but lord nobody ever really works goodnobody works well just for the love of it the thing to do is to be practical and uptodate and hire a real paid pressagent for the sunday schoolsome newspaper fellow who can give part of his time  sure you bet said chum frink  think of the nice juicy bits he could get in babbitt crowed not only the big salient vital facts about how fast the sunday schooland the collectionis growing but a lot of humorous gossip and kidding about how some blowhard fell down on his pledge to get new members or the good time the sacred trinity class of girls had at their wieniewurst party and on the side if he had time the pressagent might even boost the lessons themselvesdo a little advertising for all the sunday schools in town in fact no use being hoggish toward the rest of em providing we can keep the bulge on em in membership frinstance he might get the papers tocourse i havent got a literary training like frink here and im just guessing how the pieces ought to be written but take frinstance suppose the weeks lesson is about jacob well the pressagent might get in something that would have a fine moral and yet with a trick headline thatd get folks to read itsay like jake fools the old man makes getaway with girl and bankroll see how i mean thatd get their interest now course mr eathorne youre conservative and maybe you feel these stunts would be undignified but honestly i believe theyd bring home the bacon  eathorne folded his hands on his comfortable little belly and purred like an aged pussy  may i say first that i have been very much pleased by your analysis of the situation mr babbitt as you surmise its necessary in my position to be conservative and perhaps endeavor to maintain a certain standard of dignity yet i think youll find me somewhat progressive in our bank for example i hope i may say that we have as modern a method of publicity and advertising as any in the city yes i fancy youll find us oldsters quite cognizant of the shifting spiritual values of the age yes oh yes and so in fact it pleases me to be able to say that though personally i might prefer the sterner presbyterianism of an earlier era  babbitt finally gathered that eathorne was willing  chum frink suggested as parttime pressagent one kenneth escott reporter on the advocatetimes  they parted on a high plane of amity and christian helpfulness  babbitt did not drive home but toward the center of the city he wished to be by himself and exult over the beauty of intimacy with william washington eathorne   ii  a snowblanched evening of ringing pavements and eager lights  great golden lights of trolleycars sliding along the packed snow of the roadway demure lights of little houses the belching glare of a distant foundry wiping out the sharpedged stars lights of neighborhood drug stores where friends gossiped well pleased after the days work  the green light of a policestation and greener radiance on the snow the drama of a patrolwagongong beating like a terrified heart headlights scorching the crystalsparkling street driver not a chauffeur but a policeman proud in uniform another policeman perilously dangling on the step at the back and a glimpse of the prisoner a murderer a burglar a coiner cleverly trapped  an enormous graystone church with a rigid spire dim light in the parlors and cheerful droning of choirpractise the quivering green mercuryvapor light of a photoengravers loft then the storming lights of downtown parked cars with ruby taillights white arched entrances to movie theaters like frosty mouths of winter caves electric signsserpents and little dancing men of fire pinkshaded globes and scarlet jazz music in a cheap upstairs dancehall lights of chinese restaurants lanterns painted with cherryblossoms and with pagodas hung against lattices of lustrous gold and black small dirty lamps in small stinking lunchrooms the smart shoppingdistrict with rich and quiet light on crystal pendants and furs and suave surfaces of polished wood in velvethung reticent windows high above the street an unexpected square hanging in the darkness the window of an office where some one was working late for a reason unknown and stimulating a man meshed in bankruptcy an ambitious boy an oilman suddenly become rich  the air was shrewd the snow was deep in uncleared alleys and beyond the city babbitt knew were hillsides of snowdrift among wintry oaks and the curving iceenchanted river  he loved his city with passionate wonder he lost the accumulated weariness of businessworry and expansive oratory he felt young and potential he was ambitious it was not enough to be a vergil gunch an orville jones no theyre bully fellows simply lovely but they havent got any finesse no he was going to be an eathorne delicately rigorous coldly powerful  thats the stuff the wallop in the velvet mitt not let anybody get fresh with you been getting careless about my diction slang colloquial cut it out i was firstrate at rhetoric in college themes onanyway not bad had too much of this hooptedoodle and goodfellow stuff iwhy couldnt i organize a bank of my own some day and ted succeed me  he drove happily home and to mrs babbitt he was a william washington eathorne but she did not notice it   iii  young kenneth escott reporter on the advocatetimes was appointed pressagent of the chatham road presbyterian sunday school he gave six hours a week to it at least he was paid for giving six hours a week he had friends on the press and the gazette and he was not officially known as a pressagent he procured a trickle of insinuating items about neighborliness and the bible about classsuppers jolly but educational and the value of the prayerlife in attaining financial success  the sunday school adopted babbitts system of military ranks quickened by this spiritual refreshment it had a boom it did not become the largest school in zeniththe central methodist church kept ahead of it by methods which dr drew scored as unfair undignified unamerican ungentlemanly and unchristianbut it climbed from fourth place to second and there was rejoicing in heaven or at least in that portion of heaven included in the parsonage of dr drew while babbitt had much praise and good repute  he had received the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school he was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys his ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called colonel and if he did not attend sunday school merely to be thus exalted certainly he thought about it all the way there  he was particularly pleasant to the pressagent kenneth escott he took him to lunch at the athletic club and had him at the house for dinner  like many of the cocksure young men who forage about cities in apparent contentment and who express their cynicism in supercilious slang escott was shy and lonely his shrewd starveling face broadened with joy at dinner and he blurted gee whillikins mrs babbitt if you knew how good it is to have home eats again  escott and verona liked each other all evening they talked about ideas they discovered that they were radicals true they were sensible about it they agreed that all communists were criminals that this vers libre was tommyrot and that while there ought to be universal disarmament of course great britain and the united states must on behalf of oppressed small nations keep a navy equal to the tonnage of all the rest of the world but they were so revolutionary that they predicted to babbitts irritation that there would some day be a third party which would give trouble to the republicans and democrats  escott shook hands with babbitt three times at parting  babbitt mentioned his extreme fondness for eathorne  within a week three newspapers presented accounts of babbitts sterling labors for religion and all of them tactfully mentioned william washington eathorne as his collaborator  nothing had brought babbitt quite so much credit at the elks the athletic club and the boosters his friends had always congratulated him on his oratory but in their praise was doubt for even in speeches advertising the city there was something highbrow and degenerate like writing poetry but now orville jones shouted across the athletic diningroom heres the new director of the first state bank grover butterbaugh the eminent wholesaler of plumbers supplies chuckled wonder you mix with common folks after holding eathornes hand and emil wengert the jeweler was at last willing to discuss buying a house in dorchester   iv  when the sunday school campaign was finished babbitt suggested to kenneth escott say how about doing a little boosting for doc drew personally  escott grinned you trust the doc to do a little boosting for himself mr babbitt theres hardly a week goes by without his ringing up the paper to say if well chase a reporter up to his study hell let us in on the story about the swell sermon hes going to preach on the wickedness of short skirts or the authorship of the pentateuch dont you worry about him theres just one better publicitygrabber in town and thats this dora gibson tucker that runs the child welfare and the americanization league and the only reason shes got drew beaten is because she has got some brains  well now kenneth i dont think you ought to talk that way about the doctor a preacher has to watch his interests hasnt he you remember that in the bible aboutabout being diligent in the lords business or something  all right ill get something in if you want me to mr babbitt but ill have to wait till the managing editor is out of town and then blackjack the city editor  thus it came to pass that in the sunday advocatetimes under a picture of dr drew at his earnestest with eyes alert jaw as granite and rustic lock flamboyant appeared an inscriptiona woodpulp tablet conferring twentyfour hours immortality   the rev dr john jennison drew ma pastor of the beautiful chatham road presbyterian church in lovely floral heights is a wizard soulwinner he holds the local record for conversions during his shepherdhood an average of almost a hundred sinweary persons per year have declared their resolve to lead a new life and have found a harbor of refuge and peace  everything zips at the chatham road church the subsidiary organizations are keyed to the topnotch of efficiency dr drew is especially keen on good congregational singing bright cheerful hymns are used at every meeting and the special sing services attract lovers of music and professionals from all parts of the city  on the popular lecture platform as well as in the pulpit dr drew is a renowned wordpainter and during the course of the year he receives literally scores of invitations to speak at varied functions both here and elsewhere   v  babbitt let dr drew know that he was responsible for this tribute dr drew called him brother and shook his hand a great many times  during the meetings of the advisory committee babbitt had hinted that he would be charmed to invite eathorne to dinner but eathorne had murmured so nice of youold man nowalmost never go out surely eathorne would not refuse his own pastor babbitt said boyishly to drew  say doctor now weve put this thing over strikes me its up to the dominie to blow the three of us to a dinner  bully you bet delighted cried dr drew in his manliest way some one had once told him that he talked like the late president roosevelt  and uh say doctor be sure and get mr eathorne to come insist on it its uhi think he sticks around home too much for his own health  eathorne came  it was a friendly dinner babbitt spoke gracefully of the stabilizing and educational value of bankers to the community they were he said the pastors of the fold of commerce for the first time eathorne departed from the topic of sunday schools and asked babbitt about the progress of his business babbitt answered modestly almost filially  a few months later when he had a chance to take part in the street traction companys terminal deal babbitt did not care to go to his own bank for a loan it was rather a quiet sort of deal and if it had come out the public might not have understood he went to his friend mr eathorne he was welcomed and received the loan as a private venture and they both profited in their pleasant new association  after that babbitt went to church regularly except on spring sunday mornings which were obviously meant for motoring he announced to ted i tell you boy theres no stronger bulwark of sound conservatism than the evangelical church and no better place to make friends wholl help you to gain your rightful place in the community than in your own churchhome     chapter xviii  i  though he saw them twice daily though he knew and amply discussed every detail of their expenditures yet for weeks together babbitt was no more conscious of his children than of the buttons on his coatsleeves  the admiration of kenneth escott made him aware of verona  she had become secretary to mr gruensberg of the gruensberg leather company she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres details and never quite understands them but she was one of the people who give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing something desperateof leaving a job or a husbandwithout ever doing it babbitt was so hopeful about escotts hesitant ardors that he became the playful parent when he returned from the elks he peered coyly into the livingroom and gurgled has our kenny been here tonight he never credited veronas protest why ken and i are just good friends and we only talk about ideas i wont have all this sentimental nonsense that would spoil everything  it was ted who most worried babbitt  with conditions in latin and english but with a triumphant record in manual training basketball and the organization of dances ted was struggling through his senior year in the east side high school at home he was interested only when he was asked to trace some subtle ill in the ignition system of the car he repeated to his tuttutting father that he did not wish to go to college or lawschool and babbitt was equally disturbed by this shiftlessness and by teds relations with eunice littlefield next door  though she was the daughter of howard littlefield that wroughtiron factmill that horsefaced priest of private ownership eunice was a midge in the sun she danced into the house she flung herself into babbitts lap when he was reading she crumpled his paper and laughed at him when he adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper as he hated a broken salescontract she was seventeen now her ambition was to be a cinema actress she did not merely attend the showing of every feature film she also read the motionpicture magazines those extraordinary symptoms of the age of pepmonthlies and weeklies gorgeously illustrated with portraits of young women who had recently been manicure girls not very skilful manicure girls and who unless their every grimace had been arranged by a director could not have acted in the easter cantata of the central methodist church magazines reporting quite seriously in interviews plastered with pictures of ridingbreeches and california bungalows the views on sculpture and international politics of blankly beautiful suspiciously beautiful young men outlining the plots of films about pure prostitutes and kindhearted trainrobbers and giving directions for making bootblacks into celebrated scenario authors overnight  these authorities eunice studied she could she frequently did tell whether it was in november or december 1905 that mack harker the renowned screen cowpuncher and badman began his public career as chorus man in oh you naughty girlie on the wall of her room her father reported she had pinned up twentyone photographs of actors but the signed portrait of the most graceful of the movie heroes she carried in her young bosom  babbitt was bewildered by this worship of new gods and he suspected that eunice smoked cigarettes he smelled the cloying reek from upstairs and heard her giggling with ted he never inquired the agreeable child dismayed him her thin and charming face was sharpened by bobbed hair her skirts were short her stockings were rolled and as she flew after ted above the caressing silk were glimpses of soft knees which made babbitt uneasy and wretched that she should consider him old sometimes in the veiled life of his dreams when the fairy child came running to him she took on the semblance of eunice littlefield  ted was motormad as eunice was moviemad  a thousand sarcastic refusals did not check his teasing for a car of his own however lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of vergil he was tireless in tinkering with three other boys he bought a rheumatic ford chassis built an amazing racerbody out of tin and pine went skidding round corners in the perilous craft and sold it at a profit babbitt gave him a motorcycle and every saturday afternoon with seven sandwiches and a bottle of cocacola in his pockets and eunice perched eerily on the rumble seat he went roaring off to distant towns  usually eunice and he were merely neighborhood chums and quarreled with a wholesome and violent lack of delicacy but now and then after the color and scent of a dance they were silent together and a little furtive and babbitt was worried  babbitt was an average father he was affectionate bullying opinionated ignorant and rather wistful like most parents he enjoyed the game of waiting till the victim was clearly wrong then virtuously pouncing he justified himself by croaking well teds mother spoils him got to be somebody who tells him whats what and me im elected the goat because i try to bring him up to be a real decent human being and not one of these sapheads and loungelizards of course they all call me a grouch  throughout with the eternal human genius for arriving by the worst possible routes at surprisingly tolerable goals babbitt loved his son and warmed to his companionship and would have sacrificed everything for himif he could have been sure of proper credit   ii  ted was planning a party for his set in the senior class  babbitt meant to be helpful and jolly about it from his memory of highschool pleasures back in catawba he suggested the nicest games going to boston and charades with stewpans for helmets and wordgames in which you were an adjective or a quality when he was most enthusiastic he discovered that they werent paying attention they were only tolerating him as for the party it was as fixed and standardized as a union club hop there was to be dancing in the livingroom a noble collation in the diningroom and in the hall two tables of bridge for what ted called the poor old dumbbells that you cant get to dance hardly more n half the time  every breakfast was monopolized by conferences on the affair no one listened to babbitts bulletins about the february weather or to his throatclearing comments on the headlines he said furiously if i may be permitted to interrupt your engrossing private conversationjuh hear what i said  oh dont be a spoiled baby ted and i have just as much right to talk as you have flared mrs babbitt  on the night of the party he was permitted to look on when he was not helping matilda with the vecchia ice cream and the petits fours he was deeply disquieted eight years ago when verona had given a highschool party the children had been featureless gabies now they were men and women of the world very supercilious men and women the boys condescended to babbitt they wore eveningclothes and with hauteur they accepted cigarettes from silver cases babbitt had heard stories of what the athletic club called goings on at young parties of girls parking their corsets in the dressingroom of cuddling and petting and a presumable increase in what was known as immorality tonight he believed the stories these children seemed bold to him and cold the girls wore misty chiffon coral velvet or cloth of gold and around their dipping bobbed hair were shining wreaths he had it upon urgent and secret inquiry that no corsets were known to be parked upstairs but certainly these eager bodies were not stiff with steel their stockings were of lustrous silk their slippers costly and unnatural their lips carmined and their eyebrows penciled they danced cheek to cheek with the boys and babbitt sickened with apprehension and unconscious envy  worst of them all was eunice littlefield and maddest of all the boys was ted eunice was a flying demon she slid the length of the room her tender shoulders swayed her feet were deft as a weavers shuttle she laughed and enticed babbitt to dance with her  then he discovered the annex to the party  the boys and girls disappeared occasionally and he remembered rumors of their drinking together from hippocket flasks he tiptoed round the house and in each of the dozen cars waiting in the street he saw the points of light from cigarettes from each of them heard high giggles he wanted to denounce them but standing in the snow peering round the dark corner he did not dare he tried to be tactful when he had returned to the front hall he coaxed the boys say if any of you fellows are thirsty theres some dandy ginger ale  oh thanks they condescended  he sought his wife in the pantry and exploded id like to go in there and throw some of those young pups out of the house they talk down to me like i was the butler id like to  i know she sighed only everybody says all the mothers tell me unless you stand for them if you get angry because they go out to their cars to have a drink they wont come to your house any more and we wouldnt want ted left out of things would we  he announced that he would be enchanted to have ted left out of things and hurried in to be polite lest ted be left out of things  but he resolved if he found that the boys were drinking he wouldwell hed hand em something that would surprise em while he was trying to be agreeable to largeshouldered young bullies he was earnestly sniffing at them twice he caught the reek of prohibitiontime whisky but then it was only twice  dr howard littlefield lumbered in  he had come in a mood of solemn parental patronage to look on ted and eunice were dancing moving together like one body littlefield gasped he called eunice there was a whispered duologue and littlefield explained to babbitt that eunices mother had a headache and needed her she went off in tears babbitt looked after them furiously that little devil getting ted into trouble and littlefield the conceited old gasbag acting like it was ted that was the bad influence  later he smelled whisky on teds breath  after the civil farewell to the guests the row was terrific a thorough family scene like an avalanche devastating and without reticences babbitt thundered mrs babbitt wept ted was unconvincingly defiant and verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking  for several months there was coolness between the babbitts and the littlefields each family sheltering their lamb from the wolfcub next door babbitt and littlefield still spoke in pontifical periods about motors and the senate but they kept bleakly away from mention of their families whenever eunice came to the house she discussed with pleasant intimacy the fact that she had been forbidden to come to the house and babbitt tried with no success whatever to be fatherly and advisory with her   iii  gosh all fishhooks ted wailed to eunice as they wolfed hot chocolate lumps of nougat and an assortment of glace nuts in the mosaic splendor of the royal drug store it gets me why dad doesnt just pass out from being so poky every evening he sits there about halfasleep and if rone or i say oh come on lets do something he doesnt even take the trouble to think about it he just yawns and says naw this suits me right here he doesnt know theres any fun going on anywhere i suppose he must do some thinking same as you and i do but gosh theres no way of telling it i dont believe that outside of the office and playing a little bum golf on saturday he knows theres anything in the world to do except just keep sitting theresitting there every nightnot wanting to go anywherenot wanting to do anythingthinking us kids are crazysitting therelord   iv  if he was frightened by teds slackness babbitt was not sufficiently frightened by verona she was too safe she lived too much in the neat little airless room of her mind kenneth escott and she were always under foot when they were not at home conducting their cautiously radical courtship over sheets of statistics they were trudging off to lectures by authors and hindu philosophers and swedish lieutenants  gosh babbitt wailed to his wife as they walked home from the fogartys bridgeparty it gets me how rone and that fellow can be so poky they sit there night after night whenever he isnt working and they dont know theres any fun in the world all talk and discussionlord sitting theresitting therenight after nightnot wanting to do anythingthinking im crazy because i like to go out and play a fist of cardssitting theregosh  then round the swimmer bored by struggling through the perpetual surf of family life new combers swelled   v  babbitts father and motherinlaw mr and mrs henry t thompson rented their old house in the bellevue district and moved to the hotel hatton that glorified boardinghouse filled with widows redplush furniture and the sound of icewater pitchers they were lonely there and every other sunday evening the babbitts had to dine with them on fricasseed chicken discouraged celery and cornstarch ice cream and afterward sit polite and restrained in the hotel lounge while a young woman violinist played songs from the german via broadway  then babbitts own mother came down from catawba to spend three weeks  she was a kind woman and magnificently uncomprehending she congratulated the conventiondefying verona on being a nice loyal homebody without all these ideas that so many girls seem to have nowadays and when ted filled the differential with grease out of pure love of mechanics and filthiness she rejoiced that he was so handy around the houseand helping his father and all and not going out with the girls all the time and trying to pretend he was a society fellow  babbitt loved his mother and sometimes he rather liked her but he was annoyed by her christian patience and he was reduced to pulpiness when she discoursed about a quite mythical hero called your father  you wont remember it georgie you were such a little fellow at the timemy i remember just how you looked that day with your goldy brown curls and your lace collar you always were such a dainty child and kind of puny and sickly and you loved pretty things so much and the red tassels on your little bootees and alland your father was taking us to church and a man stopped us and said majorso many of the neighbors used to call your father major of course he was only a private in the war but everybody knew that was because of the jealousy of his captain and he ought to have been a highranking officer he had that natural ability to command that so very very few men haveand this man came out into the road and held up his hand and stopped the buggy and said major he said theres a lot of the folks around here that have decided to support colonel scanell for congress and we want you to join us meeting people the way you do in the store you could help us a lot  well your father just looked at him and said i certainly shall do nothing of the sort i dont like his politics he said well the mancaptain smith they used to call him and heaven only knows why because he hadnt the shadow or vestige of a right to be called captain or any other titlethis captain smith said well make it hot for you if you dont stick by your friends major well you know how your father was and this smith knew it too he knew what a real man he was and he knew your father knew the political situation from a to z and he ought to have seen that here was one man he couldnt impose on but he went on trying to and hinting and trying till your father spoke up and said to him captain smith he said i have a reputation around these parts for being one who is amply qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs and with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log  babbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the children he had it seemed been fond of barleysugar had worn the loveliest little pink bow in his curls and corrupted his own name to googoo he heard though he did not officially hear ted admonishing tinka come on now kid stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and beat it down to breakfast or googoo will jaw your head off  babbitts halfbrother martin with his wife and youngest baby came down from catawba for two days martin bred cattle and ran the dusty generalstore he was proud of being a freeborn independent american of the good old yankee stock he was proud of being honest blunt ugly and disagreeable his favorite remark was how much did you pay for that he regarded veronas books babbitts silver pencil and flowers on the table as citified extravagances and said so babbitt would have quarreled with him but for his gawky wife and the baby whom babbitt teased and poked fingers at and addressed  i think this babys a bum yes sir i think this little babys a bum hes a bum yes sir hes a bum thats what he is hes a bum this babys a bum hes nothing but an old bum thats what he isa bum  all the while verona and kenneth escott held long inquiries into epistemology ted was a disgraced rebel and tinka aged eleven was demanding that she be allowed to go to the movies thrice a week like all the girls  babbitt raged im sick of it having to carry three generations whole damn bunch lean on me pay half of mothers income listen to henry t listen to myras worrying be polite to mart and get called an old grouch for trying to help the children all of em depending on me and picking on me and not a damn one of em grateful no relief and no credit and no help from anybody and to keep it up forgood lord how long  he enjoyed being sick in february he was delighted by their consternation that he the rock should give way  he had eaten a questionable clam for two days he was languorous and petted and esteemed he was allowed to snarl oh let me alone without reprisals he lay on the sleepingporch and watched the winter sun slide along the taut curtains turning their ruddy khaki to pale blood red the shadow of the drawrope was dense black in an enticing ripple on the canvas he found pleasure in the curve of it sighed as the fading light blurred it he was conscious of life and a little sad with no vergil gunches before whom to set his face in resolute optimism he beheld and half admitted that he beheld his way of life as incredibly mechanical mechanical businessa brisk selling of badly built houses mechanical religiona dry hard church shut off from the real life of the streets inhumanly respectable as a tophat mechanical golf and dinnerparties and bridge and conversation save with paul riesling mechanical friendshipsbackslapping and jocular never daring to essay the test of quietness  he turned uneasily in bed  he saw the years the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet afternoons which were meant for summery meadows lost in such brittle pretentiousness he thought of telephoning about leases of cajoling men he hated of making business calls and waiting in dirty anteroomshat on knee yawning at flyspecked calendars being polite to officeboys  i dont hardly want to go back to work he prayed id like toi dont know  but he was back next day busy and of doubtful temper     chapter xix  i  the zenith street traction company planned to build carrepair shops in the suburb of dorchester but when they came to buy the land they found it held on options by the babbittthompson realty company the purchasingagent the first vicepresident and even the president of the traction company protested against the babbitt price they mentioned their duty toward stockholders they threatened an appeal to the courts though somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the officials found it wiser to compromise with babbitt carbon copies of the correspondence are in the companys files where they may be viewed by any public commission  just after this babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank the purchasingagent of the street traction company bought a five thousand dollar car he first vicepresident built a home in devon woods and the president was appointed minister to a foreign country  to obtain the options to tie up one mans land without letting his neighbor know had been an unusual strain on babbitt it was necessary to introduce rumors about planning garages and stores to pretend that he wasnt taking any more options to wait and look as bored as a pokerplayer at a time when the failure to secure a keylot threatened his whole plan to all this was added a nervejabbing quarrel with his secret associates in the deal they did not wish babbitt and thompson to have any share in the deal except as brokers babbitt rather agreed ethics of the businessbroker ought to strictly represent his principles and not get in on the buying he said to thompson  ethics rats think im going to see that bunch of holy grafters get away with the swag and us not climb in snorted old henry  well i dont like to do it kind of doublecrossing  it aint its triplecrossing its the public that gets doublecrossed well now weve been ethical and got it out of our systems the question is where we can raise a loan to handle some of the property for ourselves on the q t we cant go to our bank for it might come out  i could see old eathorne hes close as the tomb  thats the stuff  eathorne was glad he said to invest in character to make babbitt the loan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the bank thus certain of the options which babbitt and thompson obtained were on parcels of real estate which they themselves owned though the property did not appear in their names  in the midst of closing this splendid deal which stimulated business and public confidence by giving an example of increased realestate activity babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person working for him  the dishonest one was stanley graff the outside salesman  for some time babbitt had been worried about graff he did not keep his word to tenants in order to rent a house he would promise repairs which the owner had not authorized it was suspected that he juggled inventories of furnished houses so that when the tenant left he had to pay for articles which had never been in the house and the price of which graff put into his pocket babbitt had not been able to prove these suspicions and though he had rather planned to discharge graff he had never quite found time for it  now into babbitts private room charged a redfaced man panting look here ive come to raise particular merry hell and unless you have that fellow pinched i will whatscalm down o man whats trouble  trouble huh heres the trouble  sit down and take it easy they can hear you all over the building  this fellow graff you got working for you he leases me a house i was in yesterday and signs the lease all ok and he was to get the owners signature and mail me the lease last night well and he did this morning i comes down to breakfast and the girl says a fellow had come to the house right after the early delivery and told her he wanted an envelope that had been mailed by mistake big long envelope with babbittthompson in the corner of it sure enough there it was so she lets him have it and she describes the fellow to me and it was this graff so i phones to him and he the poor fool he admits it he says after my lease was all signed he got a better offer from another fellow and he wanted my lease back now what you going to do about it  your name is  william varneyw k varney  oh yes that was the garrison house babbitt sounded the buzzer when miss mcgoun came in he demanded graff gone out  yes sir  will you look through his desk and see if there is a lease made out to mr varney on the garrison house to varney cant tell you how sorry i am this happened needless to say ill fire graff the minute he comes in and of course your lease stands but theres one other thing id like to do ill tell the owner not to pay us the commission but apply it to your rent no straight i want to to be frank this thing shakes me up bad i suppose ive always been a practical business man probably ive told one or two fairy stories in my time when the occasion called for ityou know sometimes you have to lay things on thick to impress boneheads but this is the first time ive ever had to accuse one of my own employees of anything more dishonest than pinching a few stamps honest it would hurt me if we profited by it so youll let me hand you the commission good   ii  he walked through the february city where trucks flung up a spattering of slush and the sky was dark above dark brick cornices he came back miserable he who respected the law had broken it by concealing the federal crime of interception of the mails but he could not see graff go to jail and his wife suffer worse he had to discharge graff and this was a part of office routine which he feared he liked people so much he so much wanted them to like him that he could not bear insulting them  miss mcgoun dashed in to whisper with the excitement of an approaching scene hes here  mr graff ask him to come in  he tried to make himself heavy and calm in his chair and to keep his eyes expressionless graff stalked ina man of thirtyfive dapper eyeglassed with a foppish mustache  want me said graff  yes sit down  graff continued to stand grunting i suppose that old nut varney has been in to see you let me explain about him hes a regular tightwad and he sticks out for every cent and he practically lied to me about his ability to pay the renti found that out just after we signed up and then another fellow comes along with a better offer for the house and i felt it was my duty to the firm to get rid of varney and i was so worried about it i skun up there and got back the lease honest mr babbitt i didnt intend to pull anything crooked i just wanted the firm to have all the commis  wait now stan this may all be true but ive been having a lot of complaints about you now i dont spose you ever mean to do wrong and i think if you just get a good lesson thatll jog you up a little youll turn out a firstclass realtor yet but i dont see how i can keep you on  graff leaned against the filingcabinet his hands in his pockets and laughed so im fired well old vision and ethics im tickled to death but i dont want you to think you can get away with any holierthanthou stuff sure ive pulled some raw stuffa little of itbut how could i help it in this office  now by god young man  tut tut keep the naughty temper down and dont holler because everybody in the outside office will hear you theyre probably listening right now babbitt old dear youre crooked in the first place and a damn skinflint in the second if you paid me a decent salary i wouldnt have to steal pennies off a blind man to keep my wife from starving us married just five months and her the nicest girl living and you keeping us flat broke all the time you damned old thief so you can put money away for your saphead of a son and your wishywashy fool of a daughter wait now youll by god take it or ill bellow so the whole office will hear it and crookedsay if i told the prosecuting attorney what i know about this last street traction option steal both you and me would go to jail along with some nice clean pious highup traction guns  well stan looks like we were coming down to cases that dealthere was nothing crooked about it the only way you can get progress is for the broadgauged men to get things done and they got to be rewarded  oh for petes sake dont get virtuous on me as i gather it im fired all right its a good thing for me and if i catch you knocking me to any other firm ill squeal all i know about you and henry t and the dirty little lickspittle deals that you corporals of industry pull off for the bigger and brainier crooks and youll get chased out of town and meyoure right babbitt ive been going crooked but now im going straight and the first step will be to get a job in some office where the boss doesnt talk about ideals bad luck old dear and you can stick your job up the sewer  babbitt sat for a long time alternately raging ill have him arrested and yearning i wonderno ive never done anything that wasnt necessary to keep the wheels of progress moving  next day he hired in graffs place fritz weilinger the salesman of his most injurious rival the east side homes and development company and thus at once annoyed his competitor and acquired an excellent man young fritz was a curlyheaded merry tennisplaying youngster he made customers welcome to the office babbitt thought of him as a son and in him had much comfort   iii  an abandoned racetrack on the outskirts of chicago a plot excellent for factory sites was to be sold and jake offut asked babbitt to bid on it for him the strain of the street traction deal and his disappointment in stanley graff had so shaken babbitt that he found it hard to sit at his desk and concentrate he proposed to his family look here folks do you know whos going to trot up to chicago for a couple of daysjust weekend wont lose but one day of schoolknow whos going with that celebrated businessambassador george f babbitt why mr theodore roosevelt babbitt  hurray ted shouted and oh maybe the babbitt men wont paint that lil ole town red  and once away from the familiar implications of home they were two men together ted was young only in his assumption of oldness and the only realms apparently in which babbitt had a larger and more grownup knowledge than teds were the details of real estate and the phrases of politics when the other sages of the pullman smokingcompartment had left them to themselves babbitts voice did not drop into the playful and otherwise offensive tone in which one addresses children but continued its overwhelming and monotonous rumble and ted tried to imitate it in his strident tenor  gee dad you certainly did show up that poor boot when he got flip about the league of nations  well the trouble with a lot of these fellows is they simply dont know what theyre talking about they dont get down to facts what do you think of ken escott  ill tell you dad it strikes me ken is a nice lad no special faults except he smokes too much but slow lord why if we dont give him a shove the poor dumbbell never will propose and rone just as bad slow  yes i guess youre right theyre slow they havent either one of em got our pep  thats right theyre slow i swear dad i dont know how rone got into our family ill bet if the truth were known you were a bad old egg when you were a kid  well i wasnt so slow  ill bet you werent ill bet you didnt miss many tricks  well when i was out with the girls i didnt spend all the time telling em about the strike in the knitting industry  they roared together and together lighted cigars  what are we going to do with em babbitt consulted  gosh i dont know i swear sometimes i feel like taking ken aside and putting him over the jumps and saying to him young fella me lad are you going to marry young rone or are you going to talk her to death here you are getting on toward thirty and youre only making twenty or twentyfive a week when you going to develop a sense of responsibility and get a raise if theres anything that george f or i can do to help you call on us but show a little speed anyway  well at that it might not be so bad if you or i talked to him except he might not understand hes one of these high brows he cant come down to cases and lay his cards on the table and talk straight out from the shoulder like you or i can  thats right hes like all these highbrows  thats so like all of em  thats a fact  they sighed and were silent and thoughtful and happy  the conductor came in he had once called at babbitts office to ask about houses h are you mr babbitt we going to have you with us to chicago this your boy  yes this is my son ted  well now what do you know about that here i been thinking you were a youngster yourself not a day over forty hardly and you with this great big fellow  forty why brother ill never see fortyfive again  is that a fact wouldnt hardly a thought it  yes sir its a bad giveaway for the old man when he has to travel with a young whale like ted here  youre right it is to ted i suppose youre in college now  proudly no not till next fall im just kind of giving the diffrent colleges the onceover now  as the conductor went on his affable way huge watchchain jingling against his blue chest babbitt and ted gravely considered colleges they arrived at chicago late at night they lay abed in the morning rejoicing pretty nice not to have to get up and get down to breakfast heh they were staying at the modest eden hotel because zenith business men always stayed at the eden but they had dinner in the brocade and crystal versailles room of the regency hotel babbitt ordered blue point oysters with cocktail sauce a tremendous steak with a tremendous platter of french fried potatoes two pots of coffee apple pie with ice cream for both of them and for ted an extra piece of mince pie  hot stuff some feed young fella ted admired  huh you stick around with me old man and ill show you a good time  they went to a musical comedy and nudged each other at the matrimonial jokes and the prohibition jokes they paraded the lobby arm in arm between acts and in the glee of his first release from the shame which dissevers fathers and sons ted chuckled dad did you ever hear the one about the three milliners and the judge  when ted had returned to zenith babbitt was lonely as he was trying to make alliance between offutt and certain milwaukee interests which wanted the racetrack plot most of his time was taken up in waiting for telephone calls sitting on the edge of his bed holding the portable telephone asking wearily mr sagen not in yet didn he leave any message for me all right ill hold the wire staring at a stain on the wall reflecting that it resembled a shoe and being bored by this twentieth discovery that it resembled a shoe lighting a cigarette then bound to the telephone with no ashtray in reach wondering what to do with this burning menace and anxiously trying to toss it into the tiled bathroom at last on the telephone no message eh all right ill call up again  one afternoon he wandered through snowrutted streets of which he had never heard streets of small tenements and twofamily houses and marooned cottages it came to him that he had nothing to do that there was nothing he wanted to do he was bleakly lonely in the evening when he dined by himself at the regency hotel he sat in the lobby afterward in a plush chair bedecked with the saxecoburg arms lighting a cigar and looking for some one who would come and play with him and save him from thinking in the chair next to him showing the arms of lithuania was a halffamiliar man a large redfaced man with pop eyes and a deficient yellow mustache he seemed kind and insignificant and as lonely as babbitt himself he wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange tie  it came to babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash the melancholy stranger was sir gerald doak  instinctively babbitt rose bumbling how re you sir gerald member we met in zenith at charley mckelveys babbitts my namereal estate  oh how d you do sir gerald shook hands flabbily  embarrassed standing wondering how he could retreat babbitt maundered well i suppose you been having a great trip since we saw you in zenith  quite british columbia and california and all over the place he said doubtfully looking at babbitt lifelessly  how did you find business conditions in british columbia or i suppose maybe you didnt look into em scenery and sport and so on  scenery oh capital but business conditionsyou know mr babbitt theyre having almost as much unemployment as we are sir gerald was speaking warmly now  so business conditions not so doggone good eh  no business conditions werent at all what id hoped to find them  not good eh  no notnot really good  thats a darn shame welli suppose youre waiting for somebody to take you out to some big shindig sir gerald  shindig oh shindig no to tell you the truth i was wondering what the deuce i could do this evening dont know a soul in tchicahgo i wonder if you happen to know whether theres a good theater in this city  good why say theyre running grand opera right now i guess maybe youd like that  eh eh went to the opera once in london covent garden sort of thing shocking no i was wondering if there was a good cinemamovie  babbitt was sitting down hitching his chair over shouting movie say sir gerald i supposed of course you had a raft of dames waiting to lead you out to some soiree  god forbid  but if you havent what do you say you and me go to a movie theres a peach of a film at the grantham bill hart in a bandit picture  righto just a moment while i get my coat  swollen with greatness slightly afraid lest the noble blood of nottingham change its mind and leave him at any street corner babbitt paraded with sir gerald doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat beside him trying not to be too enthusiastic lest the knight despise his adoration of sixshooters and broncos at the end sir gerald murmured jolly good picture this so awfully decent of you to take me havent enjoyed myself so much for weeks all these hostessesthey never let you go to the cinema  the devil you say babbitts speech had lost the delicate refinement and all the broad as with which he had adorned it and become hearty and natural well im tickled to death you liked it sir gerald  they crawled past the knees of fat women into the aisle they stood in the lobby waving their arms in the rite of putting on overcoats babbitt hinted say how about a little something to eat i know a place where we could get a swell rarebit and we might dig up a little drinkthat is if you ever touch the stuff  rather but why dont you come to my room ive some scotchnot half bad  oh i dont want to use up all your hootch its darn nice of you butyou probably want to hit the hay  sir gerald was transformed he was beefily yearning oh really now i havent had a decent evening for so long having to go to all these dances no chance to discuss business and that sort of thing do be a good chap and come along wont you  will i you bet i just thought maybesay by golly it does do a fellow good dont it to sit and visit about business conditions after hes been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all that society stuff i often feel that way in zenith sure you bet ill come  thats awfully nice of you they beamed along the street look here old chap can you tell me do american cities always keep up this dreadful social pace all these magnificent parties  go on now quit your kidding gosh you with court balls and functions

american women they know so muchculture and that sort of thing this mrs mckelveyyour friend  yuh old lucile good kid  she asked me which of the galleries i liked best in florence or was it in firenze never been in italy in my life and primitives did i like primitives do you know what the deuce a primitive is  me i should say not but i know what a discount for cash is  rather so do i by george but primitives  yuh primitives  they laughed with the sound of a boosters luncheon  sir geralds room was except for his ponderous and durable english bags very much like the room of george f babbitt and quite in the manner of babbitt he disclosed a huge whisky flask looked proud and hospitable and chuckled say when old chap  it was after the third drink that sir gerald proclaimed how do you yankees get the notion that writing chaps like bertrand shaw and this wells represent us the real business england we think those chaps are traitors both our countries have their comic old aristocracyyou know old county families hunting people and all that sort of thingand we both have our wretched labor leaders but we both have a backbone of sound business men who run the whole show  you bet heres to the real guys  im with you heres to ourselves  it was after the fourth drink that sir gerald asked humbly what do you think of north dakota mortgages but it was not till after the fifth that babbitt began to call him jerry and sir gerald confided i say do you mind if i pull off my boots and ecstatically stretched his knightly feet his poor tired hot swollen feet out on the bed  after the sixth babbitt irregularly arose well i better be hiking along jerry youre a regular human being i wish to thunder wed been better acquainted in zenith lookit cant you come back and stay with me a while  so sorrymust go to new york tomorrow most awfully sorry old boy i havent enjoyed an evening so much since ive been in the states real talk not all this social rot id never have let them give me the beastly titleand i didnt get it for nothing ehif id thought id have to talk to women about primitives and polo goodish thing to have in nottingham though annoyed the mayor most frightfully when i got

tell the fellows in nottingham your ideas about visions and real guysat our next rotary club luncheon   iv  babbitt lay abed at his hotel imagining the zenith athletic club asking him what kind of a time dyou have in chicago and his answering oh fair ran around with sir gerald doak a lot picturing himself meeting lucile mckelvey and admonishing her youre all right mrs mac when you arent trying to pull this highbrow pose its just as gerald doak says to me in chicagooh yes jerrys an old friend of minethe wife and i are thinking of running over to england to stay with jerry in his castle next yearand he said to me georgie old bean i like lucile firstrate but you and me george we got to make her get over this hightytighty hooptediddle way shes got  but that evening a thing happened which wrecked his pride   v  at the regency hotel cigarcounter he fell to talking with a salesman of pianos and they dined together babbitt was filled with friendliness and wellbeing he enjoyed the gorgeousness of the diningroom the chandeliers the looped brocade curtains the portraits of french kings against panels of gilded oak he enjoyed the crowd pretty women good solid fellows who were liberal spenders  he gasped he stared and turned away and stared again three tables off with a doubtful sort of woman a woman at once coy and withered was paul riesling and paul was supposed to be in akron selling tarroofing the woman was tapping his hand mooning at him and giggling babbitt felt that he had encountered something involved and harmful paul was talking with the rapt eagerness of a man who is telling his troubles he was concentrated on the womans faded eyes once he held her hand and once blind to the other guests he puckered his lips as though he was pretending to kiss her babbitt had so strong an impulse to go to paul that he could feel his body uncoiling his shoulders moving but he felt desperately that he must be diplomatic and not till he saw paul paying the check did he bluster to the pianosalesman by gollyfriend of mine over therescuse me secondjust say hello to him  he touched pauls shoulder and cried well when did you hit town  paul glared up at him face hardening oh hello george thought youd gone back to zenith he did not introduce his companion babbitt peeped at her she was a flabbily pretty weakly flirtatious woman of fortytwo or three in an atrocious flowery hat her rouging was thorough but unskilful  where you staying paulibus  the woman turned yawned examined her nails she seemed accustomed to not being introduced  paul grumbled campbell inn on the south side  alone it sounded insinuating  yes unfortunately furiously paul turned toward the woman smiling with a fondness sickening to babbitt may want to introduce you mrs arnold this is my oldacquaintance george babbitt  pleasmeech growled babbitt while she gurgled oh im very pleased to meet any friend of mr rieslings im sure  babbitt demanded be back there later this evening paul ill drop down and see you  no betterwe better lunch together tomorrow  all right but ill see you tonight too paul ill go down to your hotel and ill wait for you     chapter xx  i  he sat smoking with the pianosalesman clinging to the warm refuge of gossip afraid to venture into thoughts of paul he was the more affable on the surface as secretly he became more apprehensive felt more hollow he was certain that paul was in chicago without zillas knowledge and that he was doing things not at all moral and secure when the salesman yawned that he had to write up his orders babbitt left him left the hotel in leisurely calm but savagely he said campbell inn to the taxidriver he sat agitated on the slippery leather seat in that chill dimness which smelled of dust and perfume and turkish cigarettes he did not heed the snowy lakefront the dark spaces and sudden bright corners in the unknown land south of the loop  the office of the campbell inn was hard bright new the night clerk harder and brighter yep he said to babbitt  mr paul riesling registered here  yep  is he in now  nope  then if youll give me his key ill wait for him  cant do that brother wait down here if you wanna  babbitt had spoken with the deference which all the clan of good fellows give to hotel clerks now he said with snarling abruptness  i may have to wait some time im rieslings brotherinlaw ill go up to his room d i look like a sneakthief  his voice was low and not pleasant with considerable haste the clerk took down the key protesting i never said you looked like a sneakthief just rules of the hotel but if you want to  on his way up in the elevator babbitt wondered why he was here why shouldnt paul be dining with a respectable married woman why had he lied to the clerk about being pauls brotherinlaw he had acted like a child he must be careful not to say foolish dramatic things to paul as he settled down he tried to look pompous and placid then the thoughtsuicide hed been dreading that without knowing it paul would be just the person to do something like that he must be out of his head or he wouldnt be confiding in thatthat driedup hag  zilla oh damn zilla how gladly hed throttle that nagging fiend of a womanshed probably succeeded at last and driven paul crazy  suicide out there in the lake way out beyond the piled ice along the shore it would be ghastly cold to drop into the water tonight  orthroat cutin the bathroom  babbitt flung into pauls bathroom it was empty he smiled feebly  he pulled at his choking collar looked at his watch opened the window to stare down at the street looked at his watch tried to read the evening paper lying on the glasstopped bureau looked again at his watch three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it  and he waited for three hours  he was sitting fixed chilled when the doorknob turned paul came in glowering  hello paul said been waiting  yuh little while  well  well what just thought id drop in to see how you made out in akron  i did all right what difference does it make  why gosh paul what are you sore about  what are you butting into my affairs for  why paul thats no way to talk im not butting into nothing i was so glad to see your ugly old phiz that i just dropped in to say howdy  well im not going to have anybody following me around and trying to boss me ive had all of that im going to stand  well gosh im not  i didnt like the way you looked at may arnold or the snooty way you talked  well all right then if you think im a buttinsky then ill just butt in i dont know who your may arnold is but i know doggone good and well that you and her werent talking about tarroofing no nor about playing the violin neither if you havent got any moral consideration for yourself you ought to have some for your position in the community the idea of your going around places gawping into a females eyes like a lovesick pup i can understand a fellow slipping once but i dont propose to see a fellow thats been as chummy with me as you have getting started on the downward path and sneaking off from his wife even as cranky a one as zilla to go womanchasing  oh youre a perfectly moral little husband  i am by god ive never looked at any woman except myra since ive been marriedpracticallyand i never will i tell you theres nothing to immorality it dont pay cant you see old man it just makes zilla still crankier  slight of resolution as he was of body paul threw his snowbeaded overcoat on the floor and crouched on a flimsy cane chair oh youre an old blowhard and you know less about morality than tinka but youre all right georgie but you cant understand thatim through i cant go zillas hammering any longer shes made up her mind that im a devil andreglar inquisition torture she enjoys it its a game to see how sore she can make me and me either its find a little comfort any comfort anywhere or else do something a lot worse now this mrs arnold shes not so young but shes a fine woman and she understands a fellow and shes had her own troubles  yea i suppose shes one of these hens whose husband doesnt understand her  i dont know maybe he was killed in the war  babbitt lumbered up stood beside paul patting his shoulder making soft apologetic noises  honest george shes a fine woman and shes had one hell of a time we manage to jolly each other up a lot we tell each other were the dandiest pair on earth maybe we dont believe it but it helps a lot to have somebody with whom you can be perfectly simple and not all this discussingexplaining  and thats as far as you go  it is not go on say it  well i donti cant say i like it but with a burst which left him feeling large and shining with generosity its none of my darn business ill do anything i can for you if theres anything i can do  there might be i judge from zillas letters that ve been forwarded from akron that shes getting suspicious about my staying away so long shed be perfectly capable of having me shadowed and of coming to chicago and busting into a hotel diningroom and bawling me out before everybody  ill take care of zilla ill hand her a good fairystory when i get back to zenith  i dont knowi dont think you better try it youre a good fellow but i dont know that diplomacy is your strong point babbitt looked hurt then irritated i mean with women with women i mean course they got to go some to beat you in business diplomacy but i just mean with women zilla may do a lot of rough talking but shes pretty shrewd shed have the story out of you in no time  well all right but babbitt was still pathetic at not being allowed to play secret agent paul soothed  course maybe you might tell her youd been in akron and seen me there  why sure you bet dont i have to go look at that candystore property in akron dont i aint it a shame i have to stop off there when im so anxious to get home aint it a regular shame ill say it is ill say its a doggone shame  fine but for glory hallelujahs sake dont go putting any fancy fixings on the story when men lie they always try to make it too artistic and thats why women get suspicious andlets have a drink georgie ive got some gin and a little vermouth  the paul who normally refused a second cocktail took a second now and a third he became redeyed and thicktongued he was embarrassingly jocular and salacious  in the taxicab babbitt incredulously found tears crowding into his eyes   ii  he had not told paul of his plan but he did stop at akron between trains for the one purpose of sending to zilla a postcard with had to come here for the day ran into paul in zenith he called on her if for public appearances zilla was overcoiffed overpainted and resolutely corseted for private misery she wore a filthy blue dressinggown and torn stockings thrust into streaky pink satin mules her face was sunken she seemed to have but half as much hair as babbitt remembered and that half was stringy she sat in a rocker amid a debris of candyboxes and cheap magazines and she sounded dolorous when she did not sound derisive but babbitt was exceedingly breezy  well well zil old dear having a good loaf while hubbys away thats the ideal ill bet a hat myra never got up till ten while i was in chicago say could i borrow your thermosjust dropped in to see if i could borrow your thermos bottle were going to have a toboggan partywant to take some coffee mit oh did you get my card from akron saying id run into paul  yes what was he doing  how do you mean he unbuttoned his overcoat sat tentatively on the arm of a chair  you know how i mean she slapped the pages of a magazine with an irritable clatter i suppose he was trying to make love to some hotel waitress or manicure girl or somebody  hang it youre always letting on that paul goes round chasing skirts he doesnt in the first place and if he did it would probly be because you keep hinting at him and dinging at him so much i hadnt meant to zilla but since paul is away in akron  he really is in akron i know he has some horrible woman that he writes to in chicago  didnt i tell you i saw him in akron what re you trying to do make me out a liar  no but i justi get so worried  now there you are thats what gets me here you love paul and yet you plague him and cuss him out as if you hated him i simply cant understand why it is that the more some folks love people the harder they try to make em miserable  you love ted and ronei supposeand yet you nag them  oh well that thats different besides i dont nag em not what youd call nagging but zize saying now heres paul the nicest most sensitive critter on gods green earth you ought to be ashamed of yourself the way you pan him why you talk to him like a washerwoman im surprised you can act so doggone common zilla  she brooded over her linked fingers oh i know i do go and get mean sometimes and im sorry afterwards but oh georgie paul is so aggravating honestly ive tried awfully hard these last few years to be nice to him but just because i used to be spitefulor i seemed so i wasnt really but i used to speak up and say anything that came into my headand so he made up his mind that everything was my fault everything cant always be my fault can it and now if i get to fussing he just turns silent oh so dreadfully silent and he wont look at mehe just ignores me he simply isnt human and he deliberately keeps it up till i bust out and say a lot of things i dont mean so silentoh you righteous men how wicked you are how rotten wicked  they thrashed things over and over for half an hour at the end weeping drably zilla promised to restrain herself  paul returned four days later and the babbitts and rieslings went festively to the movies and had chop suey at a chinese restaurant as they walked to the restaurant through a street of tailor shops and barber shops the two wives in front chattering about cooks babbitt murmured to paul zil seems a lot nicer now  yes she has been except once or twice but its too late now i justim not going to discuss it but im afraid of her theres nothing left i dont ever want to see her some day im going to break away from her somehow     chapter xxi  the international organization of boosters clubs has be come a worldforce for optimism manly pleasantry and good business chapters are to be found now in thirty countries nine hundred and twenty of the thousand chapters however are in the united states  none of these is more ardent than the zenith boosters club  the second march lunch of the zenith boosters was the most important of the year as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers there was agitation abroad the lunch was held in the ballroom of the ohearn house as each of the four hundred boosters entered he took from a wallboard a huge celluloid button announcing his name his nick name and his business there was a fine of ten cents for calling a fellow booster by anything but his nickname at a lunch and as babbitt jovially checked his hat the air was radiant with shouts of hello chet and howre you shorty and top o the mornin mac  they sat at friendly tables for eight choosing places by lot babbitt was with albert boos the merchant tailor hector seybolt of the little sweetheart condensed milk company emil wengert the jeweler professor pumphrey of the riteway business college dr walter gorbutt roy teegarten the photographer and ben berkey the photoengraver one of the merits of the boosters club was that only two persons from each department of business were permitted to join so that you at once encountered the ideals of other occupations and realized the metaphysical oneness of all occupationsplumbing and portraitpainting medicine and the manufacture of chewinggum  babbitts table was particularly happy today because professor pumphrey had just had a birthday and was therefore open to teasing  lets pump pump about how old he is said emil wengert  no lets paddle him with a dancingpump said ben berkey  but it was babbitt who had the applause with dont talk about pumps to that guy the only pump he knows is a bottle honest they tell me hes starting a class in homebrewing at the ole college  at each place was the boosters club booklet listing the members though the object of the club was goodfellowship yet they never lost sight of the importance of doing a little more business after each name was the members occupation there were scores of advertisements in the booklet and on one page the admonition theres no rule that you have to trade with your fellow boosters but get wise boywhats the use of letting all this good money get outside of our happy fambly and at each place today there was a present a card printed in artistic red and black   service and boosterism  service finds its finest opportunity and development only in its broadest and deepest application and the consideration of its perpetual action upon reaction i believe the highest type of service like the most progressive tenets of ethics senses unceasingly and is motived by active adherence and loyalty to that which is the essential principle of boosterismgood citizenship in all its factors and aspects  dad petersen  compliments of dadbury petersen advertising corp  ads not fads at dads   the boosters all read mr petersons aphorism and said they understood it perfectly  the meeting opened with the regular weekly stunts retiring president vergil gunch was in the chair his stiff hair like a hedge his voice like a brazen gong of festival members who had brought guests introduced them publicly this tall redheaded piece of misinformation is the sporting editor of the press said willis ijams and h h hazen the druggist chanted boys when youre on a long motor tour and finally get to a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to the wife this is certainly a romantic place it sends a glow right up and down your vertebrae well my guest today is from such a place harpers ferry virginia in the beautiful southland with memories of good old general robert e lee and of that brave soul john brown who like every good booster goes marching on  there were two especially distinguished guests the leading man of the bird of paradise company playing this week at the dodsworth theater and the mayor of zenith the hon lucas prout  vergil gunch thundered when we manage to grab this celebrated thespian off his lovely aggregation of beautiful actressesand i got to admit i butted right into his dressingroom and told him how the boosters appreciated the highclass artistic performance hes giving usand dont forget that the treasurer of the dodsworth is a booster and will appreciate our patronageand when on top of that we yank hizzonor out of his multifarious duties at city hall then i feel weve done ourselves proud and mr prout will now say a few words about the problems and duties  by rising vote the boosters decided which was the handsomest and which the ugliest guest and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations donated president gunch noted by brother booster h g yeager the jennifer avenue florist  each week in rotation four boosters were privileged to obtain the pleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services to four fellowmembers chosen by lot there was laughter this week when it was announced that one of the contributors was barnabas joy the undertaker everybody whispered i can think of a coupla good guys to be buried if his donation is a free funeral  through all these diversions the boosters were lunching on chicken croquettes peas fried potatoes coffee apple pie and american cheese gunch did not lump the speeches presently he called on the visiting secretary of the zenith rotary club a rival organization the secretary had the distinction of possessing state motor car license number 5  the rotary secretary laughingly admitted that wherever he drove in the state so low a number created a sensation and though it was pretty nice to have the honor yet traffic cops remembered it only too darn well and sometimes he didnt know but what hed almost as soon have just plain b56876 or something like that only let any doggone booster try to get number 5 away from a live rotarian next year and watch the fur fly and if theyd permit him hed wind up by calling for a cheer for the boosters and rotarians and the kiwanis all together  babbitt sighed to professor pumphrey be pretty nice to have as low a number as that everybody d say he must be an important guy wonder how he got it ill bet he wined and dined the superintendent of the motor license bureau to a fareyouwell  then chum frink addressed them  some of you may feel that its out of place here to talk on a strictly highbrow and artistic subject but i want to come out flatfooted and ask you boys to ok the proposition of a symphony orchestra for zenith now where a lot of you make your mistake is in assuming that if you dont like classical music and all that junk you ought to oppose it now i want to confess that though im a literary guy by profession i dont care a rap for all this longhaired music id rather listen to a good jazz band any time than to some piece by beethoven that hasnt any more tune to it than a bunch of fighting cats and you couldnt whistle it to save your life but that isnt the point culture has become as necessary an adornment and advertisement for a city today as pavements or bankclearances its culture in theaters and artgalleries and so on that brings thousands of visitors to new york every year and to be frank for all our splendid attainments we havent yet got the culture of a new york or chicago or bostonor at least we dont get the credit for it the thing to do then as a live bunch of gogetters is to capitalize culture to go right out and grab it  pictures and books are fine for those that have the time to study em but they dont shoot out on the road and holler this is what little old zenith can put up in the way of culture thats precisely what a symphony orchestra does do look at the credit minneapolis and cincinnati get an orchestra with firstclass musickers and a swell conductorand i believe we ought to do the thing up brown and get one of the highestpaid conductors on the market providing he aint a hunit goes right into beantown and new york and washington it plays at the best theaters to the most cultured and moneyed people it gives such classadvertising as a town can get in no other way and the guy who is so shortsighted as to crab this orchestra proposition is passing up the chance to impress the glorious name of zenith on some big new york millionaire that mightthat might establish a branch factory here  i could also go into the fact that for our daughters who show an interest in highbrow music and may want to teach it having an a1 local organization is of great benefit but lets keep this on a practical basis and i call on you good brothers to whoop it up for culture and a worldbeating symphony orchestra  they applauded  to a rustle of excitement president gunch proclaimed gentlemen we will now proceed to the annual election of officers for each of the six offices three candidates had been chosen by a committee the second name among the candidates for vicepresident was babbitts  he was surprised he looked selfconscious his heart pounded he was still more agitated when the ballots were counted and gunch said its a pleasure to announce that georgie babbitt will be the next assistant gavelwielder i know of no man who stands more stanchly for common sense and enterprise than good old george come on lets give him our best long yell  as they adjourned a hundred men crushed in to slap his back he had never known a higher moment he drove away in a blur of wonder he lunged into his office chuckling to miss mcgoun well i guess you better congratulate your boss been elected vicepresident of the boosters  he was disappointed she answered only yesoh mrs babbitts been trying to get you on the phone but the new salesman fritz weilinger said by golly chief say thats great thats perfectly great im tickled to death congratulations  babbitt called the house and crowed to his wife heard you were trying to get me myra say you got to hand it to little georgie this time better talk careful you are now addressing the vicepresident of the boosters club  oh georgie  pretty nice huh willis ijams is the new president but when hes away little ole georgie takes the gavel and whoops em up and introduces the speakersno matter if theyre the governor himselfand  george listen  it puts him in solid with big men like doc dilling and  george paul riesling  yes sure ill phone paul and let him know about it right away  georgie listen pauls in jail he shot his wife he shot zilla this noon she may not live     chapter xxii  i  he drove to the city prison not blindly but with unusual fussy care at corners the fussiness of an old woman potting plants it kept him from facing the obscenity of fate  the attendant said naw you cant see any of the prisoners till threethirtyvisitinghour  it was three for half an hour babbitt sat looking at a calendar and a clock on a whitewashed wall the chair was hard and mean and creaky people went through the office and he thought stared at him he felt a belligerent defiance which broke into a wincing fear of this machine which was grinding paulpaul  exactly at halfpast three he sent in his name  the attendant returned with riesling says he dont want to see you  youre crazy you didnt give him my name tell him its george wants to see him george babbitt  yuh i told him all right all right he said he didnt want to see you  then take me in anyway  nothing doing if you aint his lawyer if he dont want to see you thats all there is to it  but my godsay let me see the warden  hes busy come on now you babbitt reared over him the attendant hastily changed to a coaxing you can come back and try tomorrow probably the poor guy is off his nut  babbitt drove not at all carefully or fussily sliding viciously past trucks ignoring the truckmens curses to the city hall he stopped with a grind of wheels against the curb and ran up the marble steps to the office of the hon mr lucas prout the mayor he bribed the mayors doorman with a dollar he was instantly inside demanding you remember me mr prout babbittvicepresident of the boosterscampaigned for you say have you heard about poor riesling well i want an order on the warden or whatever you call um of the city prison to take me back and see him good thanks  in fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage where paul riesling sat on a cot twisted like an old beggar legs crossed arms in a knot biting at his clenched fist  paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell admitted babbitt and left them together he spoke slowly go on be moral  babbitt plumped on the couch beside him im not going to be moral i dont care what happened i just want to do anything i can im glad zilla got what was coming to her  paul said argumentatively now dont go jumping on zilla ive been thinking maybe she hasnt had any too easy a time just after i shot heri didnt hardly mean to but she got to deviling me so i went crazy just for a second and pulled out that old revolver you and i used to shoot rabbits with and took a crack at her didnt hardly mean toafter that when i was trying to stop the bloodit was terrible what it did to her shoulder and she had beautiful skinmaybe she wont die i hope it wont leave her skin all scarred but just afterward when i was hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the blood i ran onto a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one christmas and i remembered she and id been awfully happy thenhell i cant hardly believe its me here as babbitts arm tightened about his shoulder paul sighed im glad you came but i thought maybe youd lecture me and when youve committed a murder and been brought here and everythingthere was a big crowd outside the apartment house all staring and the cops took me through itoh im not going to talk about it any more  but he went on in a monotonous terrified insane mumble to divert him babbitt said why you got a scar on your cheek  yes thats where the cop hit me i suppose cops get a lot of fun out of lecturing murderers too he was a big fellow and they wouldnt let me help carry zilla down to the ambulance  paul quit it listen she wont die and when its all over you and ill go off to maine again and maybe we can get that may arnold to go along ill go up to chicago and ask her good woman by golly and afterwards ill see that you get started in business out west somewhere maybe seattlethey say thats a lovely city  paul was half smiling it was babbitt who rambled now he could not tell whether paul was heeding but he droned on till the coming of pauls lawyer p j maxwell a thin busy unfriendly man who nodded at babbitt and hinted if riesling and i could be alone for a moment  babbitt wrung pauls hands and waited in the office till maxwell came pattering out look old man what can i do he begged  nothing not a thing not just now said maxwell sorry got to hurry and dont try to see him ive had the doctor give him a shot of morphine so hell sleep  it seemed somehow wicked to return to the office babbitt felt as though he had just come from a funeral he drifted out to the city hospital to inquire about zilla she was not likely to die he learned the bullet from pauls huge old 44 army revolver had smashed her shoulder and torn upward and out  he wandered home and found his wife radiant with the horified interest we have in the tragedies of our friends of course paul isnt altogether to blame but this is what comes of his chasing after other women instead of bearing his cross in a christian way she exulted  he was too languid to respond as he desired he said what was to be said about the christian bearing of crosses and went out to clean the car dully patiently he scraped linty grease from the drippan gouged at the mud caked on the wheels he used up many minutes in washing his hands scoured them with gritty kitchen soap rejoiced in hurting his plump knuckles damn soft handslike a womans aah  at dinner when his wife began the inevitable he bellowed i forbid any of you to say a word about paul ill tend to all the talking about this thats necessary hear me theres going to be one house in this scandalmongering town tonight that isnt going to spring the holierthanthou and throw those filthy evening papers out of the house  but he himself read the papers after dinner  before nine he set out for the house of lawyer maxwell he was received without cordiality well said maxwell  i want to offer my services in the trial ive got an idea why couldnt i go on the stand and swear i was there and she pulled the gun first and he wrestled with her and the gun went off accidentally  and perjure yourself  huh yes i suppose it would be perjury ohwould it help  but my dear fellow perjury  oh dont be a fool excuse me maxwell i didnt mean to get your goat i just mean ive known and youve known many and many a case of perjury just to annex some rotten little piece of real estate and here where its a case of saving paul from going to prison id perjure myself black in the face  no aside from the ethics of the matter im afraid it isnt practicable the prosecutor would tear your testimony to pieces its known that only riesling and his wife were there at the time  then look here let me go on the stand and swearand this would be the gods truththat she pestered him till he kind of went crazy  no sorry riesling absolutely refuses to have any testimony reflecting on his wife he insists on pleading guilty  then let me get up and testify somethingwhatever you say let me do something  im sorry babbitt but the best thing you can doi hate to say it but you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it  babbitt revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant winced so visibly that maxwell condescended  i dont like to hurt your feelings but you see we both want to do our best for riesling and we mustnt consider any other factor the trouble with you babbitt is that youre one of these fellows who talk too readily you like to hear your own voice if there were anything for which i could put you in the witnessbox youd get going and give the whole show away sorry now i must look over some papersso sorry   ii  he spent most of the next morning nerving himself to face the garrulous world of the athletic club they would talk about paul they would be liplicking and rotten but at the roughnecks table they did not mention paul they spoke with zeal of the coming baseball season he loved them as he never had before   iii  he had doubtless from some storybook pictured pauls trial as a long struggle with bitter arguments a taut crowd and sudden and overwhelming new testimony actually the trial occupied less than fifteen minutes largely filled with the evidence of doctors that zilla would recover and that paul must have been temporarily insane next day paul was sentenced to three years in the state penitentiary and taken offquite undramatically not handcuffed merely plodding in a tired way beside a cheerful deputy sheriffand after saying goodby to him at the station babbitt returned to his office to realize that he faced a world which without paul was meaningless     chapter xxiii  i  he was busy from march to june he kept himself from the bewilderment of thinking his wife and the neighbors were generous every evening he played bridge or attended the movies and the days were blank of face and silent  in june mrs babbitt and tinka went east to stay with relatives and babbitt was free to dohe was not quite sure what  all day long after their departure he thought of the emancipated house in which he could if he desired go mad and curse the gods without having to keep up a husbandly front he considered i could have a reglar party tonight stay out till two and not do any explaining afterwards cheers he telephoned to vergil gunch to eddie swanson both of them were engaged for the evening and suddenly he was bored by having to take so much trouble to be riotous  he was silent at dinner unusually kindly to ted and verona hesitating but not disapproving when verona stated her opinion of kenneth escotts opinion of dr john jennison drews opinion of the opinions of the evolutionists ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation and he related his daily triumphs how he had found a cracked ballrace what he had said to the old grouch what he had said to the foreman about the future of wireless telephony  ted and verona went to a dance after dinner even the maid was out rarely had babbitt been alone in the house for an entire evening he was restless he vaguely wanted something more diverting than the newspaper comic strips to read he ambled up to veronas room sat on her maidenly blue and white bed humming and grunting in a solidcitizen manner as he examined her books conrads rescue a volume strangely named figures of earth poetry quite irregular poetry babbitt thought by vachel lindsay and essays by h l menckenhighly improper essays making fun of the church and all the decencies he liked none of the books in them he felt a spirit of rebellion against niceness and solidcitizenship these authorsand he supposed they were famous ones toodid not seem to care about telling a good story which would enable a fellow to forget his troubles he sighed he noted a book the three black pennies by joseph hergesheimer ah that was something like it it would be an adventure story maybe about counterfeitingdetectives sneaking up on the old house at night he tucked the book under his arm he clumped downstairs and solemnly began to read under the pianolamp  a twilight like blue dust sifted into the shallow fold of the thickly wooded hills it was early october but a crisping frost had already stamped the maple trees with gold the spanish oaks were hung with patches of wine red the sumach was brilliant in the darkening underbrush a pattern of wild geese flying low and unconcerned above the hills wavered against the serene ashen evening howat penny standing in the comparative clearing of a road decided that the shifting regular flight would not come close enough for a shot he had no intention of hunting the geese with the drooping of day his keenness had evaporated an habitual indifference strengthened permeating him  there it was again discontent with the good common ways babbitt laid down the book and listened to the stillness the inner doors of the house were open he heard from the kitchen the steady drip of the refrigerator a rhythm demanding and disquieting he roamed to the window the summer evening was foggy and seen through the wire screen the street lamps were crosses of pale fire the whole world was abnormal while he brooded verona and ted came in and went up to bed silence thickened in the sleeping house he put on his hat his respectable derby lighted a cigar and walked up and down before the house a portly worthy unimaginative figure humming silver threads among the gold he casually considered might call up paul then he remembered he saw paul in a jailbirds uniform but while he agonized he didnt believe the tale it was part of the unreality of this fogenchanted evening  if she were here myra would be hinting isnt it late georgie he tramped in forlorn and unwanted freedom fog hid the house now the world was uncreated a chaos without turmoil or desire  through the mist came a man at so feverish a pace that he seemed to dance with fury as he entered the orb of glow from a streetlamp at each step he brandished his stick and brought it down with a crash his glasses on their broad pretentious ribbon banged against his stomach babbitt incredulously saw that it was chum frink  frink stopped focused his vision and spoke with gravity  theres another fool george babbitt lives for renting howsheshouses know who i am im traitor to poetry im drunk im talking too much i dont care know what i could ve been i could ve been a gene field or a james whitcomb riley maybe a stevenson i could ve whimsies magination lissen lissen to this just made it up       glittering summery meadowy noise      of beetles and bums and respectable boys  hear that whimzhwhimsy i made that up i dont know what it means beginning good verse chiles garden verses and whadi write tripe cheerup poems all tripe could have writtentoo late  he darted on with an alarming plunge seeming always to pitch forward yet never quite falling babbitt would have been no more astonished and no less had a ghost skipped out of the fog carrying his head he accepted frink with vast apathy he grunted poor boob and straightway forgot him  he plodded into the house deliberately went to the refrigerator and rifled it when mrs babbitt was at home this was one of the major household crimes he stood before the covered laundry tubs eating a chicken leg and half a saucer of raspberry jelly and grumbling over a clammy cold boiled potato he was thinking it was coming to him that perhaps all life as he knew it and vigorously practised it was futile that heaven as portrayed by the reverend dr john jennison drew was neither probable nor very interesting that he hadnt much pleasure out of making money that it was of doubtful worth to rear children merely that they might rear children who would rear children what was it all about what did he want  he blundered into the livingroom lay on the davenport hands behind his head  what did he want wealth social position travel servants yes but only incidentally  i give it up he sighed  but he did know that he wanted the presence of paul riesling and from that he stumbled into the admission that he wanted the fairy girlin the flesh if there had been a woman whom he loved he would have fled to her humbled his forehead on her knees  he thought of his stenographer miss mcgoun he thought of the prettiest of the manicure girls at the hotel thornleigh barber shop as he fell asleep on the davenport he felt that he had found something in life and that he had made a terrifying thrilling break with everything that was decent and normal   ii  he had forgotten next morning that he was a conscious rebel but he was irritable in the office and at the eleven oclock drive of telephone calls and visitors he did something he had often desired and never dared he left the office without excuses to those stavedrivers his employees and went to the movies he enjoyed the right to be alone he came out with a vicious determination to do what he pleased  as he approached the roughnecks table at the club everybody laughed  well heres the millionaire said sidney finkelstein  yes i saw him in his locomobile said professor pumphrey  gosh it must be great to be a smart guy like georgie moaned vergil gunch hes probably stolen all of dorchester id hate to leave a poor little defenseless piece of property lying around where he could get his hooks on it  they had babbitt perceived something on him also they had their kidding clothes on ordinarily he would have been delighted at the honor implied in being chaffed but he was suddenly touchy he grunted yuh sure maybe ill take you guys on as office boys he was impatient as the jest elaborately rolled on to its denouement  of course he may have been meeting a girl they said and no i think he was waiting for his old roommate sir jerusalem doak  he exploded oh spring it spring it you boneheads whats the great joke  hurray george is peeved snickered sidney finkelstein while a grin went round the table gunch revealed the shocking truth he had seen babbitt coming out of a motionpicture theaterat noon  they kept it up with a hundred variations a hundred guffaws they said that he had gone to the movies during businesshours he didnt so much mind gunch but he was annoyed by sidney finkelstein that brisk lean redheaded explainer of jokes he was bothered too by the lump of ice in his glass of water it was too large it spun round and burned his nose when he tried to drink he raged that finkelstein was like that lump of ice but he won through he kept up his banter till they grew tired of the superlative jest and turned to the great problems of the day  he reflected whats the matter with me today seems like ive got an awful grouch only they talk so darn much but i better steer careful and keep my mouth shut  as they lighted their cigars he mumbled got to get back and on a chorus of if you will go spending your mornings with lady ushers at the movies he escaped he heard them giggling he was embarrassed while he was most bombastically agreeing with the coatman that the weather was warm he was conscious that he was longing to run childishly with his troubles to the comfort of the fairy child   iii  he kept miss mcgoun after he had finished dictating he searched for a topic which would warm her office impersonality into friendliness  where you going on your vacation he purred  i think ill go upstate to a farm do you want me to have the siddons lease copied this afternoon  oh no hurry about it i suppose you have a great time when you get away from us cranks in the office  she rose and gathered her pencils oh nobodys cranky here i think i can get it copied after i do the letters  she was gone babbitt utterly repudiated the view that he had been trying to discover how approachable was miss mcgoun course knew there was nothing doing he said   iv  eddie swanson the motorcar agent who lived across the street from babbitt was giving a sunday supper his wife louetta young louetta who loved jazz in music and in clothes and laughter was at her wildest she cried well have a real party as she received the guests babbitt had uneasily felt that to many men she might be alluring now he admitted that to himself she was overwhelmingly alluring mrs babbitt had never quite approved of louetta babbitt was glad that she was not here this evening  he insisted on helping louetta in the kitchen taking the chicken croquettes from the warmingoven the lettuce sandwiches from the icebox he held her hand once and she depressingly didnt notice it she caroled youre a good little mothershelper georgie now trot in with the tray and leave it on the sidetable  he wished that eddie swanson would give them cocktails that louetta would have one he wantedoh he wanted to be one of these bohemians you read about studio parties wild lovely girls who were independent not necessarily bad certainly not but not tame like floral heights how hed ever stood it all these years  eddie did not give them cocktails true they supped with mirth and with several repetitions by orville jones of any time louetta wants to come sit on my lap ill tell this sandwich to beat it but they were respectable as befitted sunday evening babbitt had discreetly preempted a place beside louetta on the piano bench while he talked about motors while he listened with a fixed smile to her account of the film she had seen last wednesday while he hoped that she would hurry up and finish her description of the plot the beauty of the leading man and the luxury of the setting he studied her slim waist girdled with raw silk strong brows ardent eyes hair parted above a broad foreheadshe meant youth to him and a charm which saddened he thought of how valiant a companion she would be on a long motor tour exploring mountains picnicking in a pine grove high above a valley her frailness touched him he was angry at eddie swanson for the incessant family bickering all at once he identified louetta with the fairy girl he was startled by the conviction that they had always had a romantic attraction for each other  i suppose youre leading a simply terrible life now youre a widower she said  you bet im a bad little fellow and proud of it some evening you slip eddie some dope in his coffee and sneak across the road and ill show you how to mix a cocktail he roared  well now i might do it you never can tell  well whenever youre ready you just hang a towel out of the attic window and ill jump for the gin  every one giggled at this naughtiness in a pleased way eddie swanson stated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily the others were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent murders but babbitt drew louetta back to personal things  thats the prettiest dress i ever saw in my life  do you honestly like it  like it why say im going to have kenneth escott put a piece in the paper saying that the swellest dressed woman in the u s is mrs e louetta swanson  now you stop teasing me but she beamed lets dance a little george youve got to dance with me  even as he protested oh you know what a rotten dancer i am he was lumbering to his feet  ill teach you i can teach anybody  her eyes were moist her voice was jagged with excitement he was convinced that he had won her he clasped her conscious of her smooth warmth and solemnly he circled in a heavy version of the onestep he bumped into only one or two people gosh im not doing so bad hittin em up like a regular stage dancer he gloated and she answered busily yesyesi told you i could teach anybodydont take such long steps  for a moment he was robbed of confidence with fearful concentration he sought to keep time to the music but he was enveloped again by her enchantment shes got to like me ill make her he vowed he tried to kiss the lock beside her ear she mechanically moved her head to avoid it and mechanically she murmured dont  for a moment he hated her but after the moment he was as urgent as ever he danced with mrs orville jones but he watched louetta swooping down the length of the room with her husband careful youre getting foolish he cautioned himself the while he hopped and bent his solid knees in dalliance with mrs jones and to that worthy lady rumbled gee its hot without reason he thought of paul in that shadowy place where men never dance im crazy tonight better go home he worried but he left mrs jones and dashed to louettas lovely side demanding the next is mine  oh im so hot im not going to dance this one  then boldly come out and sit on the porch and get all nice and cool  well  in the tender darkness with the clamor in the house behind them he resolutely took her hand she squeezed his once then relaxed  louetta i think youre the nicest thing i know  well i think youre very nice  do you you got to like me im so lonely  oh youll be all right when your wife comes home  no im always lonely  she clasped her hands under her chin so that he dared not touch her he sighed  when i feel punk and he was about to bring in the tragedy of paul but that was too sacred even for the diplomacy of love when i get tired out at the office and everything i like to look across the street and think of you do you know i dreamed of you one time  was it a nice dream  lovely  oh well they say dreams go by opposites now i must run in  she was on her feet  oh dont go in yet please louetta  yes i must have to look out for my guests  let em look out for emselves  i couldnt do that she carelessly tapped his shoulder and slipped away  but after two minutes of shamed and childish longing to sneak home he was snorting certainly i wasnt trying to get chummy with her knew there was nothing doing all the time and he ambled in to dance with mrs orville jones and to avoid louetta virtuously and conspicuously     chapter xxiv  i  his visit to paul was as unreal as his night of fog and questioning unseeing he went through prison corridors stinking of carbolic acid to a room lined with pale yellow settees pierced in rosettes like the shoestore benches he had known as a boy the guard led in paul above his uniform of linty gray pauls face was pale and without expression he moved timorously in response to the guards commands he meekly pushed babbitts gifts of tobacco and magazines across the table to the guard for examination he had nothing to say but oh im getting used to it and im working in the tailor shop the stuff hurts my fingers  babbitt knew that in this place of death paul was already dead and as he pondered on the train home something in his own self seemed to have died a loyal and vigorous faith in the goodness of the world a fear of public disfavor a pride in success he was glad that his wife was away he admitted it without justifying it he did not care   ii  her card read mrs daniel judique babbitt knew of her as the widow of a wholesale paperdealer she must have been forty or fortytwo but he thought her younger when he saw her in the office that afternoon she had come to inquire about renting an apartment and he took her away from the unskilled girl accountant he was nervously attracted by her smartness she was a slender woman in a black swiss frock dotted with white a coollooking graceful frock a broad black hat shaded her face her eyes were lustrous her soft chin of an agreeable plumpness and her cheeks an even rose babbitt wondered afterward if she was made up but no man living knew less of such arts  she sat revolving her violet parasol her voice was appealing without being coy i wonder if you can help me  be delighted  ive looked everywhere andi want a little flat just a bedroom or perhaps two and sittingroom and kitchenette and bath but i want one that really has some charm to it not these dingy places or these new ones with terrible gaudy chandeliers and i cant pay so dreadfully much my names tanis judique  i think maybe ive got just the thing for you would you like to chase around and look at it now  yes i have a couple of hours  in the new cavendish apartments babbitt had a flat which he had been holding for sidney finkelstein but at the thought of driving beside this agreeable woman he threw over his friend finkelstein and with a note of gallantry he proclaimed ill let you see what i can do  he dusted the seat of the car for her and twice he risked death in showing off his driving  you do know how to handle a car she said  he liked her voice there was he thought music in it and a hint of culture not a bouncing giggle like louetta swansons  he boasted you know theres a lot of these fellows that are so scared and drive so slow that they get in everybodys way the safest driver is a fellow that knows how to handle his machine and yet isnt scared to speed up when its necessary dont you think so  oh yes  i bet you drive like a wiz  oh noi meannot really of course we had a cari mean before my husband passed onand i used to make believe drive it but i dont think any woman ever learns to drive like a man  well now theres some mighty good woman drivers  oh of course these women that try to imitate men and play golf and everything and ruin their complexions and spoil their hands  thats so i never did like these mannish females  i meanof course i admire them dreadfully and i feel so weak and useless beside them  oh rats now i bet you play the piano like a wiz  oh noi meannot really  well ill bet you do he glanced at her smooth hands her diamond and ruby rings she caught the glance snuggled her hands together with a kittenish curving of slim white fingers which delighted him and yearned  i do love to playi meani like to drum on the piano but i havent had any real training mr judique used to say i would ve been a good pianist if id had any training but then i guess he was just flattering me  ill bet he wasnt ill bet youve got temperament  ohdo you like music mr babbitt  you bet i do only i dont know s i care so much for all this classical stuff  oh i do i just love chopin and all those  do you honest well of course i go to lots of these highbrow concerts but i do like a good jazz orchestra right up on its toes with the fellow that plays the bass fiddle spinning it around and beating it up with the bow  oh i know i do love good dance music i love to dance dont you mr babbitt  sure you bet not that im very darn good at it though  oh im sure you are you ought to let me teach you i can teach anybody to dance  would you give me a lesson some time  indeed i would  better be careful or ill be taking you up on that proposition ill be coming up to your flat and making you give me that lesson  yees she was not offended but she was noncommittal he warned himself have some sense now you chump dont go making a fool of yourself again and with loftiness he discoursed  i wish i could dance like some of these young fellows but ill tell you i feel its a mans place to take a full you might say a creative share in the worlds work and mold conditions and have something to show for his life dont you think so  oh i do  and so i have to sacrifice some of the things i might like to tackle though i do by golly play about as good a game of golf as the next fellow  oh im sure you do are you married  uhyes and uh of course official duties im the vicepresident of the boosters club and im running one of the committees of the state association of real estate boards and that means a lot of work and responsibilityand practically no gratitude for it  oh i know public men never do get proper credit  they looked at each other with a high degree of mutual respect and at the cavendish apartments he helped her out in a courtly manner waved his hand at the house as though he were presenting it to her and ponderously ordered the elevator boy to hustle and get the keys she stood close to him in the elevator and he was stirred but cautious  it was a pretty flat of white woodwork and soft blue walls mrs judique gushed with pleasure as she agreed to take it and as they walked down the hall to the elevator she touched his sleeve caroling oh im so glad i went to you its such a privilege to meet a man who really understands oh the flats some people have showed me  he had a sharp instinctive belief that he could put his arm around her but he rebuked himself and with excessive politeness he saw her to the car drove her home all the way back to his office he raged  glad i had some sense for once curse it i wish id tried shes a darling a corker a reglar charmer lovely eyes and darling lips and that trim waistnever get sloppy like some women no no no shes a real cultured lady one of the brightest little women ive met these many moons understands about public topics andbut darn it why didnt i try    tanis   iii  he was harassed and puzzled by it but he found that he was turning toward youth as youth the girl who especially disturbed himthough he had never spoken to herwas the last manicure girl on the right in the pompeian barber shop she was small swift blackhaired smiling she was nineteen perhaps or twenty she wore thin salmoncolored blouses which exhibited her shoulders and her blackribboned camisoles  he went to the pompeian for his fortnightly hairtrim as always he felt disloyal at deserting his neighbor the reeves building barber shop then for the first time he overthrew his sense of guilt doggone it i dont have to go here if i dont want to i dont own the reeves building these barbers got nothing on me ill doggone well get my hair cut where i doggone well want to dont want to hear anything more about it im through standing by peopleunless i want to it doesnt get you anywhere im through  the pompeian barber shop was in the basement of the hotel thornleigh largest and most dynamically modern hotel in zenith curving marble steps with a rail of polished brass led from the hotellobby down to the barber shop the interior was of black and white and crimson tiles with a sensational ceiling of burnished gold and a fountain in which a massive nymph forever emptied a scarlet cornucopia forty barbers and nine manicure girls worked desperately and at the door six colored porters lurked to greet the customers to care reverently for their hats and collars to lead them to a place of waiting where on a carpet like a tropic isle in the stretch of white stone floor were a dozen leather chairs and a table heaped with magazines  babbitts porter was an obsequious grayhaired negro who did him an honor highly esteemed in the land of zenithgreeted him by name yet babbitt was unhappy his bright particular manicure girl was engaged she was doing the nails of an overdressed man and giggling with him babbitt hated him he thought of waiting but to stop the powerful system of the pompeian was inconceivable and he was instantly wafted into a chair  about him was luxury rich and delicate one votary was having a violetray facial treatment the next an oil shampoo boys wheeled about miraculous electrical massagemachines the barbers snatched steaming towels from a machine like a howitzer of polished nickel and disdainfully flung them away after a seconds use on the vast marble shelf facing the chairs were hundreds of tonics amber and ruby and emerald it was flattering to babbitt to have two personal slaves at oncethe barber and the bootblack he would have been completely happy if he could also have had the manicure girl the barber snipped at his hair and asked his opinion of the havre de grace races the baseball season and mayor prout the young negro bootblack hummed the camp meeting blues and polished in rhythm to his tune drawing the shiny shoerag so taut at each stroke that it snapped like a banjo string the barber was an excellent salesman he made babbitt feel rich and important by his manner of inquiring what is your favorite tonic sir have you time today sir for a facial massage your scalp is a little tight shall i give you a scalp massage  babbitts best thrill was in the shampoo the barber made his hair creamy with thick soap then as babbitt bent over the bowl muffled in towels drenched it with hot water which prickled along his scalp and at last ran the water icecold at the shock the sudden burning cold on his skull babbitts heart thumped his chest heaved and his spine was an electric wire it was a sensation which broke the monotony of life he looked grandly about the shop as he sat up the barber obsequiously rubbed his wet hair and bound it in a towel as in a turban so that babbitt resembled a plump pink calif on an ingenious and adjustable throne the barber begged in the manner of one who was a good fellow yet was overwhelmed by the splendors of the calif how about a little eldorado oil rub sir very beneficial to the scalp sir didnt i give you one the last time  he hadnt but babbitt agreed well all right  with quaking eagerness he saw that his manicure girl was free  i dont know i guess ill have a manicure after all he droned and excitedly watched her coming darkhaired smiling tender little the manicuring would have to be finished at her table and he would be able to talk to her without the barber listening he waited contentedly not trying to peep at her while she filed his nails and the barber shaved him and smeared on his burning cheeks all the interesting mixtures which the pleasant minds of barbers have devised through the revolving ages when the barber was done and he sat opposite the girl at her table he admired the marble slab of it admired the sunken set bowl with its tiny silver taps and admired himself for being able to frequent so costly a place when she withdrew his wet hand from the bowl it was so sensitive from the warm soapy water that he was abnormally aware of the clasp of her firm little paw he delighted in the pinkness and glossiness of her nails her hands seemed to him more adorable than mrs judiques thin fingers and more elegant he had a certain ecstasy in the pain when she gnawed at the cuticle of his nails with a sharp knife he struggled not to look at the outline of her young bosom and her shoulders the more apparent under a film of pink chiffon he was conscious of her as an exquisite thing and when he tried to impress his personality on her he spoke as awkwardly as a country boy at his first party  well kinda hot to be working today  oh yes it is hot you cut your own nails last time didnt you  yees guess i must ve  you always ought to go to a manicure  yes maybe thats so i  theres nothing looks so nice as nails that are looked after good i always think thats the best way to spot a real gent there was an auto salesman in here yesterday that claimed you could always tell a fellows class by the car he drove but i says to him dont be silly i says the wisenheimers grab a look at a fellows nails when they want to tell if hes a tinhorn or a real gent  yes maybe theres something to that course that iswith a pretty kiddy like you a man cant help coming to get his mitts done  yeh i may be a kid but im a wise bird and i know nice folks when i see umi can read character at a glanceand id never talk so frank with a fellow if i couldnt see he was a nice fellow  she smiled her eyes seemed to him as gentle as april pools with great seriousness he informed himself that there were some roughnecks who would think that just because a girl was a manicure girl and maybe not awful well educated she was no good but as for him he was a democrat and understood people and he stood by the assertion that this was a fine girl a good girlbut not too uncomfortably good he inquired in a voice quick with sympathy  i suppose you have a lot of fellows who try to get fresh with you  say gee do i say listen theres some of these cigarstore sports that think because a girls working in a barber shop they can get away with anything the things they saaaaaay but believe me i know how to hop those birds i just give um the north and south and ask um say who do you think youre talking to and they fade away like loves young nightmare and oh dont you want a box of nailpaste it will keep the nails as shiny as when first manicured harmless to apply and lasts for days  sure ill try some saysay its funny ive been coming here ever since the shop opened and with arch surprise i dont believe i know your name  dont you my thats funny i dont know yours  now you quit kidding me whats the nice little name  oh it aint so darn nice i guess its kind of kike but my folks aint kikes my papas papa was a nobleman in poland and there was a gentleman in here one day he was kind of a count or something  kind of a noaccount i guess you mean  whos telling this smarty and he said he knew my papas papas folks in poland and they had a dandy big house right on a lake doubtfully maybe you dont believe it  sure no really sure i do why not dont think im kidding you honey but every time ive noticed you ive said to myself that kid has blue blood in her veins  did you honest  honest i did well well come onnow were friendswhats the darling little name  ida putiak it aint so muchamuch of a name i always say to ma i say ma why didnt you name me doloress or something with some class to it  well now i think its a scrumptious name ida  i bet i know your name  well now not necessarily of courseoh it isnt so specially well known  arent you mr sondheim that travels for the krackajack kitchen kutlery ko  i am not im mr babbitt the realestate broker  oh excuse me oh of course you mean here in zenith  yep with the briskness of one whose feelings have been hurt  oh sure ive read your ads theyre swell  um wellyou might have read about my speeches  course i have i dont get much time to read buti guess you think im an awfully silly little nit  i think youre a little darling  welltheres one nice thing about this job it gives a girl a chance to meet some awfully nice gentlemen and improve her mind with conversation and you get so you can read a guys character at the first glance  look here ida please dont think im getting fresh he was hotly reflecting that it would be humiliating to be rejected by this child and dangerous to be accepted if he took her to dinner if he were seen by censorious friendsbut he went on ardently dont think im getting fresh if i suggest it would be nice for us to go out and have a little dinner together some evening  i dont know as i ought to butmy gentlemanfriends always wanting to take me out but maybe i could tonight   iv  there was no reason he assured himself why he shouldnt have a quiet dinner with a poor girl who would benefit by association with an educated and mature person like himself but lest some one see them and not understand he would take her to biddlemeiers inn on the outskirts of the city they would have a pleasant drive this hot lonely evening and he might hold her handno he wouldnt even do that ida was complaisant her bare shoulders showed it only too clearly but hed be hanged if hed make love to her merely because she expected it  then his car broke down something had happened to the ignition and he had to have the car this evening furiously he tested the sparkplugs stared at the commutator his angriest glower did not seem to stir the sulky car and in disgrace it was hauled off to a garage with a renewed thrill he thought of a taxicab there was something at once wealthy and interestingly wicked about a taxicab  but when he met her on a corner two blocks from the hotel thornleigh she said a taxi why i thought you owned a car  i do of course i do but its out of commission tonight  oh she remarked as one who had heard that tale before  all the way out to biddlemeiers inn he tried to talk as an old friend but he could not pierce the wall of her words with interminable indignation she narrated her retorts to that fresh headbarber and the drastic things she would do to him if he persisted in saying that she was better at gassing than at hoofparing  at biddlemeiers inn they were unable to get anything to drink the headwaiter refused to understand who george f babbitt was they sat steaming before a vast mixed grill and made conversation about baseball when he tried to hold idas hand she said with bright friendliness careful that fresh waiter is rubbering but they came out into a treacherous summer night the air lazy and a little moon above transfigured maples  lets drive some other place where we can get a drink and dance he demanded  sure some other night but i promised ma id be home early tonight  rats its too nice to go home  id just love to but ma would give me fits  he was trembling she was everything that was young and exquisite he put his arm about her she snuggled against his shoulder unafraid and he was triumphant then she ran down the steps of the inn singing come on georgie well have a nice drive and get cool  it was a night of lovers all along the highway into zenith under the low and gentle moon motors were parked and dim figures were clasped in revery he held out hungry hands to ida and when she patted them he was grateful there was no sense of struggle and transition he kissed her and simply she responded to his kiss they two behind the stolid back of the chauffeur  her hat fell off and she broke from his embrace to reach for it  oh let it be he implored  huh my hat not a chance  he waited till she had pinned it on then his arm sank about her she drew away from it and said with maternal soothing now dont be a silly boy mustnt make ittle mama scold just sit back dearie and see what a swell night it is if youre a good boy maybe ill kiss you when we say nightynight now give me a cigarette  he was solicitous about lighting her cigarette and inquiring as to her comfort then he sat as far from her as possible he was cold with failure no one could have told babbitt that he was a fool with more vigor precision and intelligence than he himself displayed he reflected that from the standpoint of the rev dr john jennison drew he was a wicked man and from the standpoint of miss ida putiak an old bore who had to be endured as the penalty attached to eating a large dinner  dearie you arent going to go and get peevish are you  she spoke pertly he wanted to spank her he brooded i dont have to take anything off this gutterpup darn immigrant well lets get it over as quick as we can and sneak home and kick ourselves for the rest of the night  he snorted huh me peevish why you baby why should i be peevish now listen ida listen to uncle george i want to put you wise about this scrapping with your headbarber all the time ive had a lot of experience with employees and let me tell you it doesnt pay to antagonize  at the drab wooden house in which she lived he said goodnight briefly and amiably but as the taxicab drove off he was praying oh my god     chapter xxv  i  he awoke to stretch cheerfully as he listened to the sparrows then to remember that everything was wrong that he was determined to go astray and not in the least enjoying the process why he wondered should he be in rebellion what was it all about why not be sensible stop all this idiotic running around and enjoy himself with his family his business the fellows at the club what was he getting out of rebellion misery and shamethe shame of being treated as an offensive small boy by a ragamuffin like ida putiak and yetalways he came back to and yet whatever the misery he could not regain contentment with a world which once doubted became absurd  only he assured himself he was through with this chasing after girls  by noontime he was not so sure even of that if in miss mcgoun louetta swanson and ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely it did not prove that she did not exist he was hunted by the ancient thought that somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would understand him value him and make him happy   ii  mrs babbitt returned in august  on her previous absences he had missed her reassuring buzz and of her arrival he had made a fete now though he dared not hurt her by letting a hint of it appear in his letters he was sorry that she was coming before he had found himself and he was embarrassed by the need of meeting her and looking joyful  he loitered down to the station he studied the summerresort posters lest he have to speak to acquaintances and expose his uneasiness but he was well trained when the train clanked in he was out on the cement platform peering into the chaircars and as he saw her in the line of passengers moving toward the vestibule he waved his hat at the door he embraced her and announced well well well well by golly you look fine you look fine then he was aware of tinka here was something this child with her absurd little nose and lively eyes that loved him believed him great and as he clasped her lifted and held her till she squealed he was for the moment come back to his old steady self  tinka sat beside him in the car with one hand on the steeringwheel pretending to help him drive and he shouted back to his wife ill bet the kid will be the best chuffer in the family she holds the wheel like an old professional  all the while he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent   iii  there was about the house an unofficial theory that he was to take his vacation alone to spend a week or ten days in catawba but he was nagged by the memory that a year ago he had been with paul in maine he saw himself returning finding peace there and the presence of paul in a life primitive and heroic like a shock came the thought that he actually could go only he couldnt really he couldnt leave his business and myra would think it sort of funny his going way off there alone course hed decided to do whatever he darned pleased from now on but stillto go way off to maine  he went after lengthy meditations  with his wife since it was inconceivable to explain that he was going to seek pauls spirit in the wilderness he frugally employed the lie prepared over a year ago and scarcely used at all he said that he had to see a man in new york on business he could not have explained even to himself why he drew from the bank several hundred dollars more than he needed nor why he kissed tinka so tenderly and cried god bless you baby from the train he waved to her till she was but a scarlet spot beside the brown bulkier presence of mrs babbitt at the end of a steel and cement aisle ending in vast barred gates with melancholy he looked back at the last suburb of zenith  all the way north he pictured the maine guides simple and strong and daring jolly as they played studpoker in their unceiled shack wise in woodcraft as they tramped the forest and shot the rapids he particularly remembered joe paradise half yankee half indian if he could but take up a backwoods claim with a man like joe work hard with his hands be free and noisy in a flannel shirt and never come back to this dull decency  or like a trapper in a northern canada movie plunge through the forest make camp in the rockies a grim and wordless caveman why not he could do it thered be enough money at home for the family to live on till verona was married and ted selfsupporting old henry t would look out for them honestly why not really live  he longed for it admitted that he longed for it then almost believed that he was going lo do it whenever common sense snorted nonsense folks dont run away from decent families and partners just simply dont do it thats all then babbitt answered pleadingly well it wouldnt take any more nerve than for paul to go to jail andlord how id like to do it moccasinssixgunfrontier towngamblerssleep under the starsbe a regular man with hemen like joe paradisegosh  so he came to maine again stood on the wharf before the camphotel again spat heroically into the delicate and shivering water while the pines rustled the mountains glowed and a trout leaped and fell in a sliding circle he hurried to the guides shack as to his real home his real friends long missed they would be glad to see him they would stand up and shout why heres mr babbitt he aint one of these ordinary sports hes a real guy  in their boarded and rather littered cabin the guides sat about the greasy table playing studpoker with greasy cards half a dozen wrinkled men in old trousers and easy old felt hats they glanced up and nodded joe paradise the swart aging man with the big mustache grunted how do back again  silence except for the clatter of chips  babbitt stood beside them very lonely he hinted after a period of highly concentrated playing guess i might take a hand joe  sure sit in how many chips you want lets see you were here with your wife last year want you said joe paradise  that was all of babbitts welcome to the old home  he played for half an hour before he spoke again his head was reeking with the smoke of pipes and cheap cigars and he was weary of pairs and fourflushes resentful of the way in which they ignored him he flung at joe  working now  nope  like to guide me for a few days  well jus soon i aint engaged till next week  only thus did joe recognize the friendship babbitt was offering him babbitt paid up his losses and left the shack rather childishly joe raised his head from the coils of smoke like a seal rising from surf grunted ill come round tmorrow and dived down to his three aces  neither in his voiceless cabin fragrant with planks of newcut pine nor along the lake nor in the sunset clouds which presently eddied behind the lavendermisted mountains could babbitt find the spirit of paul as a reassuring presence he was so lonely that after supper he stopped to talk with an ancient old lady a gasping and steadily discoursing old lady by the stove in the hoteloffice he told her of teds presumable future triumphs in the state university and of tinkas remarkable vocabulary till he was homesick for the home he had left forever  through the darkness through that northern pinewalled silence he blundered down to the lakefront and found a canoe there were no paddles in it but with a board sitting awkwardly amidships and poking at the water rather than paddling he made his way far out on the lake the lights of the hotel and the cottages became yellow dots a cluster of glowworms at the base of sachem mountain larger and ever more imperturbable was the mountain in the starfiltered darkness and the lake a limitless pavement of black marble he was dwarfed and dumb and a little awed but that insignificance freed him from the pomposities of being mr george f babbitt of zenith saddened and freed his heart now he was conscious of the presence of paul fancied him rescued from prison from zilla and the brisk exactitudes of the tarroofing business playing his violin at the end of the canoe he vowed i will go on ill never go back now that pauls out of it i dont want to see any of those damn people again i was a fool to get sore because joe paradise didnt jump up and hug me hes one of these woodsmen too wise to go yelping and talking your arm off like a cityman but get him back in the mountains out on the trail thats real living   iv  joe reported at babbitts cabin at nine the next morning babbitt greeted him as a fellow caveman  well joe how d you feel about hitting the trail and getting away from these darn soft summerites and these women and all  all right mr babbitt  what do you say we go over to box car pondthey tell me the shack there isnt being usedand camp out  well all right mr babbitt but its nearer to skowtuit pond and you can get just about as good fishing there  no i want to get into the real wilds  well all right  well put the old packs on our backs and get into the woods and really hike  i think maybe it would be easier to go by water through lake chogue we can go all the way by motor boatflatbottom boat with an evinrude  no sir bust up the quiet with a chugging motor not on your life you just throw a pair of socks in the old pack and tell em what you want for eats ill be ready soon s you are  most of the sports go by boat mr babbitt its a long walk  look here joe are you objecting to walking  oh no i guess i can do it but i havent tramped that far for sixteen years most of the sports go by boat but i can do it if you say soi guess joe walked away in sadness  babbitt had recovered from his touchy wrath before joe returned he pictured him as warming up and telling the most entertaining stories but joe had not yet warmed up when they took the trail he persistently kept behind babbitt and however much his shoulders ached from the pack however sorely he panted babbitt could hear his guide panting equally but the trail was satisfying a path brown with pineneedles and rough with roots among the balsams the ferns the sudden groves of white birch he became credulous again and rejoiced in sweating when he stopped to rest he chuckled guess were hitting it up pretty good for a couple o old birds eh  uhhuh admitted joe  this is a mighty pretty place look you can see the lake down through the trees i tell you joe you dont appreciate how lucky you are to live in woods like this instead of a city with trolleys grinding and typewriters clacking and people bothering the life out of you all the time i wish i knew the woods like you do say whats the name of that little red flower  rubbing his back joe regarded the flower resentfully well some folks call it one thing and some calls it another i always just call it pink flower  babbitt blessedly ceased thinking as tramping turned into blind plodding he was submerged in weariness his plump legs seemed to go on by themselves without guidance and he mechanically wiped away the sweat which stung his eyes he was too tired to be consciously glad as after a sunscourged mile of corduroy toteroad through a swamp where flies hovered over a hot waste of brush they reached the cool shore of box car pond when he lifted the pack from his back he staggered from the change in balance and for a moment could not stand erect he lay beneath an amplebosomed maple tree near the guestshack and joyously felt sleep running through his veins  he awoke toward dusk to find joe efficiently cooking bacon and eggs and flapjacks for supper and his admiration of the woodsman returned he sat on a stump and felt virile  joe what would you do if you had a lot of money would you stick to guiding or would you take a claim way back in the woods and be independent of people  for the first time joe brightened he chewed his cud a second and bubbled ive often thought of that if i had the money id go down to tinkers falls and open a swell shoe store  after supper joe proposed a game of studpoker but babbitt refused with brevity and joe contentedly went to bed at eight babbitt sat on the stump facing the dark pond slapping mosquitos save the snoring guide there was no other human being within ten miles he was lonelier than he had ever been in his life then he was in zenith  he was worrying as to whether miss mcgoun wasnt paying too much for carbon paper he was at once resenting and missing the persistent teasing at the roughnecks table he was wondering what zilla riesling was doing now he was wondering whether after the summers maturity of being a garageman ted would get busy in the university he was thinking of his wife if she would onlyif she wouldnt be so darn satisfied with just settling downno i wont i wont go back ill be fifty in three years sixty in thirteen years im going to have some fun before its too late i dont care i will  he thought of ida putiak of louetta swanson of that nice widowwhat was her nametanis judiquethe one for whom hed found the flat he was enmeshed in imaginary conversations then  gee i cant seem to get away from thinking about folks  thus it came to him merely to run away was folly because he could never run away from himself  that moment he started for zenith in his journey there was no appearance of flight but he was fleeing and four days afterward he was on the zenith train he knew that he was slinking back not because it was what he longed to do but because it was all he could do he scanned again his discovery that he could never run away from zenith and family and office because in his own brain he bore the office and the family and every street and disquiet and illusion of zenith  but im going tooh im going to start something he vowed and he tried to make it valiant     chapter xxvi  i  as he walked through the train looking for familiar faces he saw only one person whom he knew and that was seneca doane the lawyer who after the blessings of being in babbitts own class at college and of becoming a corporationcounsel had turned crank had headed farmerlabor tickets and fraternized with admitted socialists though he was in rebellion naturally babbitt did not care to be seen talking with such a fanatic but in all the pullmans he could find no other acquaintance and reluctantly he halted seneca doane was a slight thinhaired man rather like chum frink except that he hadnt frinks grin he was reading a book called the way of all flesh it looked religious to babbitt and he wondered if doane could possibly have been converted and turned decent and patriotic  why hello doane he said  doane looked up his voice was curiously kind oh how do babbitt  been away eh  yes ive been in washington  washington eh hows the old government making out  itswont you sit down  thanks dont care if i do well well been quite a while since ive had a good chance to talk to you doane i was uhsorry you didnt turn up at the last classdinner  ohthanks  hows the unions coming going to run for mayor again doane seemed restless he was fingering the pages of his book he said i might as though it didnt mean anything in particular and he smiled  babbitt liked that smile and hunted for conversation saw a bangup cabaret in new york the goodmorning cutie bunch at the hotel minton  yes theyre pretty girls i danced there one evening  oh like dancing  naturally i like dancing and pretty women and good food better than anything else in the world most men do  but gosh doane i thought you fellows wanted to take all the good eats and everything away from us  no not at all what id like to see is the meetings of the garment workers held at the ritz with a dance afterward isnt that reasonable  yuh might be good idea all right wellshame i havent seen more of you recent years oh say hope you havent held it against me my bucking you as mayor going on the stump for prout you see im an organization republican and i kind of felt  theres no reason why you shouldnt fight me i have no doubt youre good for the organization i rememberin college you were an unusually liberal sensitive chap i can still recall your saying to me that you were going to be a lawyer and take the cases of the poor for nothing and fight the rich and i remember i said i was going to be one of the rich myself and buy paintings and live at newport im sure you inspired us all  well well ive always aimed to be liberal babbitt was enormously shy and proud and selfconscious he tried to look like the boy he had been a quartercentury ago and he shone upon his old friend seneca doane as he rumbled trouble with a lot of these fellows even the live wires and some of em that think theyre forwardlooking is they arent broadminded and liberal now i always believe in giving the other fellow a chance and listening to his ideas  thats fine  tell you how i figure it a little opposition is good for all of us so a fellow especially if hes a business man and engaged in doing the work of the world ought to be liberal  yes  i always say a fellow ought to have vision and ideals i guess some of the fellows in my business think im pretty visionary but i just let em think what they want to and go right onsame as you do by golly this is nice to have a chance to sit and visit and kind of you might say brush up on our ideals  but of course we visionaries do rather get beaten doesnt it bother you  not a bit nobody can dictate to me what i think  youre the man i want to help me i want you to talk to some of the business men and try to make them a little more liberal in their attitude toward poor beecher ingram  ingram but why hes this nut preacher that got kicked out of the congregationalist church isnt he and preaches free love and sedition  this doane explained was indeed the general conception of beecher ingram but he himself saw beecher ingram as a priest of the brotherhood of man of which babbitt was notoriously an upholder so would babbitt keep his acquaintances from hounding ingram and his forlorn little church  you bet ill call down any of the boys i hear getting funny about ingram babbitt said affectionately to his dear friend doane  doane warmed up and became reminiscent he spoke of student days in germany of lobbying for single tax in washington of international labor conferences he mentioned his friends lord wycombe colonel wedgwood professor piccoli babbitt had always supposed that doane associated only with the i w w but now he nodded gravely as one who knew lord wycombes by the score and he got in two references to sir gerald doak he felt daring and idealistic and cosmopolitan  suddenly in his new spiritual grandeur he was sorry for zilla riesling and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the boosters club never could   ii  five hours after he had arrived in zenith and told his wife how hot it was in new york he went to call on zilla he was buzzing with ideas and forgiveness hed get paul released hed do things vague but highly benevolent things for zilla hed be as generous as his friend seneca doane  he had not seen zilla since paul had shot her and he still pictured her as buxom highcolored lively and a little blowsy as he drove up to her boardinghouse in a depressing back street below the wholesale district he stopped in discomfort at an upper window leaning on her elbow was a woman with the features of zilla but she was bloodless and aged like a yellowed wad of old paper crumpled into wrinkles where zilla had bounced and jiggled this woman was dreadfully still  he waited half an hour before she came into the boardinghouse parlor fifty times he opened the book of photographs of the chicago worlds fair of 1893 fifty times he looked at the picture of the court of honor  he was startled to find zilla in the room she wore a black streaky gown which she had tried to brighten with a girdle of crimson ribbon the ribbon had been torn and patiently mended he noted this carefully because he did not wish to look at her shoulders one shoulder was lower than the other one arm she carried in contorted fashion as though it were paralyzed and behind a high collar of cheap lace there was a gouge in the anemic neck which had once been shining and softly plump  yes she said  well well old zilla by golly its good to see you again  he can send his messages through a lawyer  why rats zilla i didnt come just because of him came as an old friend  you waited long enough  well you know how it is figured you wouldnt want to see a friend of his for quite some time andsit down honey lets be sensible weve all of us done a bunch of things that we hadnt ought to but maybe we can sort of start over again honest zilla id like to do something to make you both happy know what i thought today mind you paul doesnt know a thing about thisdoesnt know i was going to come see you i got to thinking zillas a fine bighearted woman and shell understand that uh pauls had his lesson now why wouldnt it be a fine idea if you asked the governor to pardon him believe he would if it came from you no wait just think how good youd feel if you were generous  yes i wish to be generous she was sitting primly speaking icily for that reason i wish to keep him in prison as an example to evildoers ive gotten religion george since the terrible thing that man did to me sometimes i used to be unkind and i wished for worldly pleasures for dancing and the theater but when i was in the hospital the pastor of the pentecostal communion faith used to come to see me and he showed me right from the prophecies written in the word of god that the day of judgment is coming and all the members of the older churches are going straight to eternal damnation because they only do lipservice and swallow the world the flesh and the devil  for fifteen wild minutes she talked pouring out admonitions to flee the wrath to come and her face flushed her dead voice recaptured something of the shrill energy of the old zilla she wound up with a furious  its the blessing of god himself that paul should be in prison now and torn and humbled by punishment so that he may yet save his soul and so other wicked men these horrible chasers after women and lust may have an example  babbitt had itched and twisted as in church he dared not move during the sermon so now he felt that he must seem attentive though her screeching denunciations flew past him like carrion birds  he sought to be calm and brotherly  yes i know zilla but gosh it certainly is the essence of religion to be charitable isnt it let me tell you how i figure it what we need in the world is liberalism liberality if were going to get anywhere ive always believed in being broadminded and liberal  you liberal it was very much the old zilla why george babbitt youre about as broadminded and liberal as a razorblade  oh i am am i well just let me tell you justlet metellyou im as by golly liberal as you are religious anyway you religious  i am so our pastor says i sustain him in the faith  ill bet you do with pauls money but just to show you how liberal i am im going to send a check for ten bucks to this beecher ingram because a lot of fellows are saying the poor cuss preaches sedition and free love and theyre trying to run him out of town  and theyre right they ought to run him out of town why he preachesif you can call it preachingin a theater in the house of satan you dont know what it is to find god to find peace to behold the snares that the devil spreads out for our feet oh im so glad to see the mysterious purposes of god in having paul harm me and stop my wickednessand pauls getting his good and plenty for the cruel things he did to me and i hope he dies in prison  babbitt was up hat in hand growling well if thats what you call being at peace for heavens sake just warn me before you go to war will you   iii  vast is the power of cities to reclaim the wanderer more than mountains or the shoredevouring sea a city retains its character imperturbable cynical holding behind apparent changes its essential purpose though babbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with joe paradise in the wilderness though he had become a liberal though he had been quite sure on the night before he reached zenith that neither he nor the city would be the same again ten days after his return he could not believe that he had ever been away nor was it at all evident to his acquaintances that there was a new george f babbitt save that he was more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the athletic club and once when vergil gunch observed that seneca doane ought to be hanged babbitt snorted oh rats hes not so bad  at home he grunted eh across the newspaper to his commentatory wife and was delighted by tinkas new red tam oshanter and announced no class to that corrugated iron garage have to build me a nice frame one  verona and kenneth escott appeared really to be engaged in his newspaper escott had conducted a purefood crusade against commissionhouses as a result he had been given an excellent job in a commissionhouse and he was making a salary on which he could marry and denouncing irresponsible reporters who wrote stories criticizing commissionhouses without knowing what they were talking about  this september ted had entered the state university as a freshman in the college of arts and sciences the university was at mohalis only fifteen miles from zenith and ted often came down for the weekend babbitt was worried ted was going in for everything but books he had tried to make the football team as a light halfback he was looking forward to the basketball season he was on the committee for the freshman hop and as a zenithite an aristocrat among the yokels he was being rushed by two fraternities but of his studies babbitt could learn nothing save a mumbled oh gosh these old stiffs of teachers just give you a lot of junk about literature and economics  one weekend ted proposed say dad why cant i transfer over from the college to the school of engineering and take mechanical engineering you always holler that i never study but honest i would study there  no the engineering school hasnt got the standing the college has fretted babbitt  id like to know how it hasnt the engineers can play on any of the teams  there was much explanation of the dollarsandcents value of being known as a college man when you go into the law and a truly oratorical account of the lawyers life before he was through with it babbitt had ted a united states senator  among the great lawyers whom he mentioned was seneca doane  but gee whiz ted marveled i thought you always said this doane was a reglar nut  thats no way to speak of a great man doanes always been a good friend of minefact i helped him in collegei started him out and you might say inspired him just because hes sympathetic with the aims of labor a lot of chumps that lack liberality and broadmindedness think hes a crank but let me tell you theres mighty few of em that rake in the fees he does and hes a friend of some of the strongest most conservative men in the worldlike lord wycombe this uh this big english nobleman thats so well known and you now which would you rather do be in with a lot of greasy mechanics and laboringmen or chum up to a real fellow like lord wycombe and get invited to his house for parties  wellgosh sighed ted  the next weekend he came in joyously with say dad why couldnt i take mining engineering instead of the academic course you talk about standingmaybe there isnt much in mechanical engineering but the miners gee they got seven out of eleven in the new elections to nu tau tau     chapter xxvii  i  the strike which turned zenith into two belligerent camps white and red began late in september with a walkout of telephone girls and linemen in protest against a reduction of wages the newly formed union of dairyproducts workers went out partly in sympathy and partly in demand for a fortyfour hour week they were followed by the truckdrivers union industry was tied up and the whole city was nervous with talk of a trolley strike a printers strike a general strike furious citizens trying to get telephone calls through strikebreaking girls danced helplessly every truck that made its way from the factories to the freightstations was guarded by a policeman trying to look stoical beside the scab driver a line of fifty trucks from the zenith steel and machinery company was attacked by strikersrushing out from the sidewalk pulling drivers from the seats smashing carburetors and commutators while telephone girls cheered from the walk and small boys heaved bricks  the national guard was ordered out colonel nixon who in private life was mr caleb nixon secretary of the pullmore tractor company put on a long khaki coat and stalked through crowds a 44 automatic in hand even babbitts friend clarence drum the shoe merchanta round and merry man who told stories at the athletic club and who strangely resembled a victorian pugdogwas to be seen as a waddling but ferocious captain with his belt tight about his comfortable little belly and his round little mouth petulant as he piped to chattering groups on corners move on there now i cant have any of this loitering  every newspaper in the city save one was against the strikers when mobs raided the newsstands at each was stationed a militiaman a young embarrassed citizensoldier with eyeglasses bookkeeper or groceryclerk in private life trying to look dangerous while small boys yelped get onto de tin soldier and striking truckdrivers inquired tenderly say joe when i was fighting in france was you in camp in the states or was you doing swede exercises in the y m c a be careful of that bayonet now or youll cut yourself  there was no one in zenith who talked of anything but the strike and no one who did not take sides you were either a courageous friend of labor or you were a fearless supporter of the rights of property and in either case you were belligerent and ready to disown any friend who did not hate the enemy  a condensedmilk plant was set afireeach side charged it to the otherand the city was hysterical  and babbitt chose this time to be publicly liberal  he belonged to the sound sane rightthinking wing and at first he agreed that the crooked agitators ought to be shot he was sorry when his friend seneca doane defended arrested strikers and he thought of going to doane and explaining about these agitators but when he read a broadside alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls had been hungry he was troubled all lies and fake figures he said but in a doubtful croak  for the sunday after the chatham road presbyterian church announced a sermon by dr john jennison drew on how the saviour would end strikes babbitt had been negligent about churchgoing lately but he went to the service hopeful that dr drew really did have the information as to what the divine powers thought about strikes beside babbitt in the large curving glossy velvetupholstered pew was chum frink  frink whispered hope the doc gives the strikers hell ordinarily i dont believe in a preacher butting into political matterslet him stick to straight religion and save souls and not stir up a lot of discussionbut at a time like this i do think he ought to stand right up and bawl out those pluguglies to a fareyouwell  yeswell said babbitt  the rev dr drew his rustic bang flopping with the intensity of his poetic and sociologic ardor trumpeted  during the untoward series of industrial dislocations which havelet us be courageous and admit it boldlythrottled the business life of our fair city these past days there has been a great deal of loose talk about scientific prevention of scientificscientific now let me tell you that the most unscientific thing in the world is science take the attacks on the established fundamentals of the christian creed which were so popular with the scientists a generation ago oh yes they were mighty fellows and great poobahs of criticism they were going to destroy the church they were going to prove the world was created and has been brought to its extraordinary level of morality and civilization by blind chance yet the church stands just as firmly today as ever and the only answer a christian pastor needs make to the longhaired opponents of his simple faith is just a pitying smile  and now these same scientists want to replace the natural condition of free competition by crazy systems which no matter by what highsounding names they are called are nothing but a despotic paternalism naturally im not criticizing labor courts injunctions against men proven to be striking unjustly or those excellent unions in which the men and the boss get together but i certainly am criticizing the systems in which the free and fluid motivation of independent labor is to be replaced by cookedup wagescales and minimum salaries and government commissions and labor federations and all that poppycock  what is not generally understood is that this whole industrial matter isnt a question of economics its essentially and only a matter of love and of the practical application of the christian religion imagine a factoryinstead of committees of workmen alienating the boss the boss goes among them smiling and they smile back the elder brother and the younger brothers thats what they must be loving brothers and then strikes would be as inconceivable as hatred in the home  it was at this point that babbitt muttered oh rot  huh said chum frink  he doesnt know what hes talking about its just as clear as mud it doesnt mean a darn thing  maybe but  frink looked at him doubtfully through all the service kept glancing at him doubtfully till babbitt was nervous   ii  the strikers had announced a parade for tuesday morning but colonel nixon had forbidden it the newspapers said when babbitt drove west from his office at ten that morning he saw a drove of shabby men heading toward the tangled dirty district beyond court house square he hated them because they were poor because they made him feel insecure damn loafers wouldnt be common workmen if they had any pep he complained he wondered if there was going to be a riot he drove toward the startingpoint of the parade a triangle of limp and faded grass known as moore street park and halted his car  the park and streets were buzzing with strikers young men in blue denim shirts old men with caps through them keeping them stirred like a boiling pot moved the militiamen babbitt could hear the soldiers monotonous orders keep movingmove on bokeep your feet warm babbitt admired their stolid good temper the crowd shouted tin soldiers and dirty dogsservants of the capitalists but the militiamen grinned and answered only sure thats right keep moving billy  babbitt thrilled over the citizensoldiers hated the scoundrels who were obstructing the pleasant ways of prosperity admired colonel nixons striding contempt for the crowd and as captain clarence drum that rather puffing shoedealer came raging by babbitt respectfully clamored great work captain dont let em march he watched the strikers filing from the park many of them bore posters with they cant stop our peacefully walking the militiamen tore away the posters but the strikers fell in behind their leaders and straggled off a thin unimpressive trickle between steelglinting lines of soldiers babbitt saw with disappointment that there wasnt going to be any violence nothing interesting at all then he gasped  among the marchers beside a bulky young workman was seneca doane smiling content in front of him was professor brockbank head of the history department in the state university an old man and whitebearded known to come from a distinguished massachusetts family  why gosh babbitt marveled a swell like him in with the strikers and good ole senny doane theyre fools to get mixed up with this bunch theyre parlor socialists but they have got nerve and nothing in it for them not a cent andi dont know s all the strikers look like such tough nuts look just about like anybody else to me  the militiamen were turning the parade down a side street  they got just as much right to march as anybody else they own the streets as much as clarence drum or the american legion does babbitt grumbled of course theyretheyre a bad element butoh rats  at the athletic club babbitt was silent during lunch while the others fretted i dont know what the worlds coming to or solaced their spirits with kidding  captain clarence drum came swinging by splendid in khaki  hows it going captain inquired vergil gunch  oh we got em stopped we worked em off on side streets and separated em and they got discouraged and went home  fine work no violence  fine work nothing groaned mr drum if i had my way thered be a whole lot of violence and id start it and then the whole thing would be over i dont believe in standing back and wetnursing these fellows and letting the disturbances drag on i tell you these strikers are nothing in gods world but a lot of bombthrowing socialists and thugs and the only way to handle em is with a club thats what id do beat up the whole lot of em  babbitt heard himself saying oh rats clarence they look just about like you and me and i certainly didnt notice any bombs  drum complained oh you didnt eh well maybe youd like to take charge of the strike just tell colonel nixon what innocents the strikers are hed be glad to hear about it drum strode on while all the table stared at babbitt  whats the idea do you want us to give those hellhounds love and kisses or what said orville jones  do you defend a lot of hoodlums that are trying to take the bread and butter away from our families raged professor pumphrey  vergil gunch intimidatingly said nothing he put on sternness like a mask his jaw was hard his bristly short hair seemed cruel his silence was a ferocious thunder while the others assured babbitt that they must have misunderstood him gunch looked as though he had understood only too well like a robed judge he listened to babbitts stammering  no sure course theyre a bunch of toughs but i just meanstrikes me its bad policy to talk about clubbing em cabe nixon doesnt hes got the fine italian hand and thats why hes colonel clarence drum is jealous of him  well said professor pumphrey you hurt clarences feelings george hes been out there all morning getting hot and dusty and no wonder he wants to beat the tar out of those sons of guns  gunch said nothing and watched and babbitt knew that he was being watched   iii  as he was leaving the club babbitt heard chum frink protesting to gunch dont know whats got into him last sunday doc drew preached a corking sermon about decency in business and babbitt kicked about that too near s i can figure out  babbitt was vaguely frightened   iv  he saw a crowd listening to a man who was talking from the rostrum of a kitchenchair he stopped his car from newspaper pictures he knew that the speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher beecher ingram of whom seneca doane had spoken ingram was a gaunt man with flamboyant hair weatherbeaten cheeks and worried eyes he was pleading  if those telephone girls can hold out living on one meal a day doing their own washing starving and smiling you big hulking men ought to be able  babbitt saw that from the sidewalk vergil gunch was watching him in vague disquiet he started the car and mechanically drove on while gunchs hostile eyes seemed to follow him all the way   v  theres a lot of these fellows babbitt was complaining to his wife that think if workmen go on strike theyre a regular bunch of fiends now of course its a fight between sound business and the destructive element and we got to lick the stuffins out of em when they challenge us but doggoned if i see why we cant fight like gentlemen and not go calling em dirty dogs and saying they ought to be shot down  why george she said placidly i thought you always insisted that all strikers ought to be put in jail  i never did well i meansome of em of course irresponsible leaders but i mean a fellow ought to be broadminded and liberal about things like  but dearie i thought you always said these socalled liberal people were the worst of  rats woman never can understand the different definitions of a word depends on how you mean it and it dont pay to be too cocksure about anything now these strikers honest theyre not such bad people just foolish they dont understand the complications of merchandizing and profit the way we business men do but sometimes i think theyre about like the rest of us and no more hogs for wages than we are for profits  george if people were to hear you talk like thatof course i know you i remember what a wild crazy boy you were i know you dont mean a word you saybut if people that didnt understand you were to hear you talking theyd think you were a regular socialist  what do i care what anybody thinks and let me tell you right nowi want you to distinctly understand i never was a wild crazy kid and when i say a thing i mean it and i stand by it andhonest do you think people would think i was too liberal if i just said the strikers were decent  of course they would but dont worry dear i know you dont mean a word of it time to trot up to bed now have you enough covers for tonight  on the sleepingporch he puzzled she doesnt understand me hardly understand myself why cant i take things easy way i used to  wish i could go out to senny doanes house and talk things over with him no suppose verg gunch saw me going in there  wish i knew some really smart woman and nice that would see what im trying to get at and let me talk to her andi wonder if myras right could the fellows think ive gone nutty just because im broadminded and liberal way verg looked at me     chapter xxviii  i  miss mcgoun came into his private office at three in the afternoon with lissen mr babbitt theres a mrs judique on the phonewants to see about some repairs and the salesmen are all out want to talk to her  all right  the voice of tanis judique was clear and pleasant the black cylinder of the telephonereceiver seemed to hold a tiny animated image of her lustrous eyes delicate nose gentle chin  this is mrs judique do you remember me you drove me up here to the cavendish apartments and helped me find such a nice flat  sure bet i remember what can i do for you  why its just a littlei dont know that i ought to bother you but the janitor doesnt seem to be able to fix it you know my flat is on the top floor and with these autumn rains the roof is beginning to leak and id be awfully glad if  sure ill come up and take a look at it nervously when do you expect to be in  why im in every morning  be in this afternoon in an hour or so  yees perhaps i could give you a cup of tea i think i ought to after all your trouble  fine ill run up there soon as i can get away  he meditated now theres a woman thats got refinement savvy class after all your troublegive you a cup of tea shed appreciate a fellow im a fool but im not such a bad cuss get to know me and not so much a fool as they think  the great strike was over the strikers beaten except that vergil gunch seemed less cordial there were no visible effects of babbitts treachery to the clan the oppressive fear of criticism was gone but a diffident loneliness remained now he was so exhilarated that to prove he wasnt he droned about the office for fifteen minutes looking at blueprints explaining to miss mcgoun that this mrs scott wanted more money for her househad raised the askingpriceraised it from seven thousand to eightyfive hundredwould miss mcgoun be sure and put it down on the cardmrs scotts houseraise when he had thus established himself as a person unemotional and interested only in business he sauntered out he took a particularly long time to start his car he kicked the tires dusted the glass of the speedometer and tightened the screws holding the windshield spotlight  he drove happily off toward the bellevue district conscious of the presence of mrs judique as of a brilliant light on the horizon the maple leaves had fallen and they lined the gutters of the asphalted streets it was a day of pale gold and faded green tranquil and lingering babbitt was aware of the meditative day and of the barrenness of bellevueblocks of wooden houses garages little shops weedy lots needs pepping up needs the touch that people like mrs judique could give a place he ruminated as he rattled through the long crude airy streets the wind rose enlivening keen and in a blaze of wellbeing he came to the flat of tanis judique  she was wearing when she flutteringly admitted him a frock of black chiffon cut modestly round at the base of her pretty throat she seemed to him immensely sophisticated he glanced at the cretonnes and colored prints in her livingroom and gurgled gosh youve fixed the place nice takes a clever woman to know how to make a home all right  you really like it im so glad but youve neglected me scandalously you promised to come some time and learn to dance  rather unsteadily oh but you didnt mean it seriously  perhaps not but you might have tried  well here ive come for my lesson and you might just as well prepare to have me stay for supper  they both laughed in a manner which indicated that of course he didnt mean it  but first i guess i better look at that leak  she climbed with him to the flat roof of the apartmenthouse a detached world of slatted wooden walks clotheslines watertank in a penthouse he poked at things with his toe and sought to impress her by being learned about copper gutters the desirability of passing plumbing pipes through a lead collar and sleeve and flashing them with copper and the advantages of cedar over boileriron for rooftanks   you have to know so much in real estate she admired  he promised that the roof should be repaired within two days do you mind my phoning from your apartment he asked  heavens no  he stood a moment at the coping looking over a land of hard little bungalows with abnormally large porches and new apartmenthouses small but brave with variegated brick walls and terracotta trimmings beyond them was a hill with a gouge of yellow clay like a vast wound behind every apartmenthouse beside each dwelling were small garages it was a world of good little people comfortable industrious credulous  in the autumnal light the flat newness was mellowed and the air was a suntinted pool  golly its one fine afternoon you get a great view here right up tanners hill said babbitt  yes isnt it nice and open  so darn few people appreciate a view  dont you go raising my rent on that account oh that was naughty of me i was just teasing seriously though there are so few who respondwho react to views i meanthey havent any feeling of poetry and beauty  thats a fact they havent he breathed admiring her slenderness and the absorbed airy way in which she looked toward the hill chin lifted lips smiling well guess id better telephone the plumbers so theyll get on the job first thing in the morning  when he had telephoned making it conspicuously authoritative and gruff and masculine he looked doubtful and sighed spose id better be  oh you must have that cup of tea first  well it would go pretty good at that  it was luxurious to loll in a deep green rep chair his legs thrust out before him to glance at the black chinese telephone stand and the colored photograph of mount vernon which he had always liked so much while in the tiny kitchenso nearmrs judique sang my creole queen in an intolerable sweetness a contentment so deep that he was wistfully discontented he saw magnolias by moonlight and heard plantation darkies crooning to the banjo he wanted to be near her on pretense of helping her yet he wanted to remain in this still ecstasy languidly he remained  when she bustled in with the tea he smiled up at her this is awfully nice for the first time he was not fencing he was quietly and securely friendly and friendly and quiet was her answer its nice to have you here you were so kind helping me to find this little home  they agreed that the weather would soon turn cold they agreed that prohibition was prohibitive they agreed that art in the home was cultural they agreed about everything they even became bold they hinted that these modern young girls well honestly their short skirts were short they were proud to find that they were not shocked by such frank speaking tanis ventured i know youll understandi meani dont quite know how to say it but i do think that girls who pretend theyre bad by the way they dress really never go any farther they give away the fact that they havent the instincts of a womanly woman  remembering ida putiak the manicure girl and how ill she had used him babbitt agreed with enthusiasm remembering how ill all the world had used him he told of paul riesling of zilla of seneca doane of the strike  see how it was course i was as anxious to have those beggars licked to a standstill as anybody else but gosh no reason for not seeing their side for a fellows own sake hes got to be broadminded and liberal dont you think so  oh i do sitting on the hard little couch she clasped her hands beside her leaned toward him absorbed him and in a glorious state of being appreciated he proclaimed  so i up and said to the fellows at the club look here i  do you belong to the union club i think its  no the athletic tell you course theyre always asking me to join the union but i always say no sir nothing doing i dont mind the expense but i cant stand all the old fogies  oh yes thats so but tell me what did you say to them  oh you dont want to hear it im probably boring you to death with my troubles you wouldnt hardly think i was an old duffer i sound like a kid  oh youre a boy yet i meanyou cant be a day over fortyfive  well im notmuch but by golly i begin to feel middleaged sometimes all these responsibilities and all  oh i know her voice caressed him it cloaked him like warm silk and i feel lonely so lonely some days mr babbitt  were a sad pair of birds but i think were pretty darn nice  yes i think were lots nicer than most people i know they smiled but please tell me what you said at the club  well it was like this course seneca doane is a friend of minethey can say what they want to they can call him anything they please but what most folks here dont know is that senny is the bosom pal of some of the biggest statesmen in the worldlord wycombe frinstanceyou know this big british nobleman my friend sir gerald doak told me that lord wycombe is one of the biggest guns in englandwell doak or somebody told me  oh do you know sir gerald the one that was here at the mckelveys  know him well say i know him just well enough so we call each other george and jerry and we got so pickled together in chicago  that must have been fun but she shook a finger at him i cant have you getting pickled ill have to take you in hand  wish you would    well zize saying you see i happen to know what a big noise senny doane is outside of zenith but of course a prophet hasnt got any honor in his own country and senny darn his old hide hes so blame modest that he never lets folks know the kind of an outfit he travels with when he goes abroad well during the strike clarence drum comes peerading up to our table all dolled up fit to kill in his nice lil capns uniform and somebody says to him busting the strike clarence  well he swells up like a pouterpigeon and he hollers so s you could hear him way up in the readingroom yes sure i told the strikeleaders where they got off and so they went home  well i says to him glad there wasnt any violence  yes he says but if i hadnt kept my eye skinned there would ve been all those fellows had bombs in their pockets theyre reglar anarchists  oh rats clarence i says i looked em all over carefully and they didnt have any more bombs n a rabbit i says course i says theyre foolish but theyre a good deal like you and me after all  and then vergil gunch or somebodyno it was chum frinkyou know this famous poetgreat pal of minehe says to me look here he says do you mean to say you advocate these strikes well i was so disgusted with a fellow whose mind worked that way that i swear i had a good mind to not explain at alljust ignore him  oh thats so wise said mrs judique  but finally i explains to him if youd done as much as i have on chamber of commerce committees and all i says then youd have the right to talk but same time i says i believe in treating your opponent like a gentleman well sir that held em frinkchum i always call himhe didnt have another word to say but at that i guess some of em kind o thought i was too liberal what do you think  oh you were so wise and courageous i love a man to have the courage of his convictions  but do you think it was a good stunt after all some of these fellows are so darn cautious and narrowminded that theyre prejudiced against a fellow that talks right out in meeting  what do you care in the long run theyre bound to respect a man who makes them think and with your reputation for oratory you  what do you know about my reputation for oratory  oh im not going to tell you everything i know but seriously you dont realize what a famous man you are  wellthough i havent done much orating this fall too kind of bothered by this paul riesling business i guess butdo you know youre the first person thats really understood what i was getting at tanislisten to me will you fat nerve ive got calling you tanis  oh do and shall i call you george dont you think its awfully nice when two people have so muchwhat shall i call itso much analysis that they can discard all these stupid conventions and understand each other and become acquainted right away like ships that pass in the night  i certainly do i certainly do  he was no longer quiescent in his chair he wandered about the room he dropped on the couch beside her but as he awkwardly stretched his hand toward her fragile immaculate fingers she said brightly do give me a cigarette would you think poor tanis was dreadfully naughty if she smoked  lord no i like it  he had often and weightily pondered flappers smoking in zenith restaurants but he knew only one woman who smokedmrs sam doppelbrau his flighty neighbor he ceremoniously lighted taniss cigarette looked for a place to deposit the burnt match and dropped it into his pocket  im sure you want a cigar you poor man she crooned  do you mind one  oh no i love the smell of a good cigar so nice andso nice and like a man youll find an ashtray in my bedroom on the table beside the bed if you dont mind getting it  he was embarrassed by her bedroom the broad couch with a cover of violet silk mauve curtains striped with gold chinese chippendale bureau and an amazing row of slippers with ribbonwound shoetrees and primrose stockings lying across them his manner of bringing the ashtray had just the right note of easy friendliness he felt a boob like verg gunch would try to get funny about seeing her bedroom but i take it casually he was not casual afterward the contentment of companionship was gone and he was restless with desire to touch her hand but whenever he turned toward her the cigarette was in his way it was a shield between them he waited till she should have finished but as he rejoiced at her quick crushing of its light on the ashtray she said dont you want to give me another cigarette and hopelessly he saw the screen of pale smoke and her graceful tilted hand again between them he was not merely curious now to find out whether she would let him hold her hand all in the purest friendship naturally but agonized with need of it  on the surface appeared none of all this fretful drama they were talking cheerfully of motors of trips to california of chum frink once he said delicately i do hate these guysi hate these people that invite themselves to meals but i seem to have a feeling im going to have supper with the lovely mrs tanis judique tonight but i suppose you probably have seven dates already  well i was thinking some of going to the movies yes i really think i ought to get out and get some fresh air  she did not encourage him to stay but never did she discourage him he considered i better take a sneak she will let me staythere is something doingand i mustnt get mixed up withi mustntive got to beat it then no its too late now  suddenly at seven brushing her cigarette away brusquely taking her hand  tanis stop teasing me you know wehere we are a couple of lonely birds and were awful happy together anyway i am never been so happy do let me stay ill gallop down to the delicatessen and buy some stuffcold chicken maybeor cold turkeyand we can have a nice little supper and afterwards if you want to chase me out ill be good and go like a lamb  wellyesit would be nice she said  nor did she withdraw her hand he squeezed it trembling and blundered toward his coat at the delicatessen he bought preposterous stores of food chosen on the principle of expensiveness from the drug store across the street he telephoned to his wife got to get a fellow to sign a lease before he leaves town on the midnight wont be home till late dont wait up for me kiss tinka goodnight he expectantly lumbered back to the flat  oh you bad thing to buy so much food was her greeting and her voice was gay her smile acceptant  he helped her in the tiny white kitchen he washed the lettuce he opened the olive bottle she ordered him to set the table and as he trotted into the livingroom as he hunted through the buffet for knives and forks he felt utterly at home  now the only other thing he announced is what youre going to wear i cant decide whether youre to put on your swellest evening gown or let your hair down and put on short skirts and makebelieve youre a little girl  im going to dine just as i am in this old chiffon rag and if you cant stand poor tanis that way you can go to the club for dinner  stand you he patted her shoulder child youre the brainiest and the loveliest and finest woman ive ever met come now lady wycombe if youll take the duke of zeniths arm we will proambulate in to the magnolious feed  oh you do say the funniest nicest things  when they had finished the picnic supper he thrust his head out of the window and reported its turned awful chilly and i think its going to rain you dont want to go to the movies  well  i wish we had a fireplace i wish it was raining like all getout tonight and we were in a funny little oldfashioned cottage and the trees thrashing like everything outside and a great big log fire andill tell you lets draw this couch up to the radiator and stretch our feet out and pretend its a woodfire  oh i think thats pathetic you big child  but they did draw up to the radiator and propped their feet against ithis clumsy black shoes her patentleather slippers in the dimness they talked of themselves of how lonely she was how bewildered he and how wonderful that they had found each other as they fell silent the room was stiller than a country lane there was no sound from the street save the whir of motortires the rumble of a distant freighttrain selfcontained was the room warm secure insulated from the harassing world  he was absorbed by a rapture in which all fear and doubting were smoothed away and when he reached home at dawn the rapture had mellowed to contentment serene and full of memories     chapter xxix  i  the assurance of tanis judiques friendship fortified babbitts selfapproval at the athletic club he became experimental though vergil gunch was silent the others at the roughnecks table came to accept babbitt as having for no visible reason turned crank they argued windily with him and he was cocky and enjoyed the spectacle of his interesting martyrdom he even praised seneca doane professor pumphrey said that was carrying a joke too far but babbitt argued no fact i tell you hes got one of the keenest intellects in the country why lord wycombe said that  oh who the hell is lord wycombe what you always lugging him in for you been touting him for the last six weeks protested orville jones  george ordered him from searsroebuck you can get those english highmuckamucks by mail for two bucks apiece suggested sidney finkelstein  thats all right now lord wycombe hes one of the biggest intellects in english political life as i was saying of course im conservative myself but i appreciate a guy like senny doane because  vergil gunch interrupted harshly i wonder if you are so conservative i find i can manage to run my own business without any skunks and reds like doane in it  the grimness of gunchs voice the hardness of his jaw disconcerted babbitt but he recovered and went on till they looked bored then irritated then as doubtful as gunch   ii  he thought of tanis always with a stir he remembered her every aspect his arms yearned for her ive found her ive dreamed of her all these years and now ive found her he exulted he met her at the movies in the morning he drove out to her flat in the late afternoon or on evenings when he was believed to be at the elks he knew her financial affairs and advised her about them while she lamented her feminine ignorance and praised his masterfulness and proved to know much more about bonds than he did they had remembrances and laughter over old times once they quarreled and he raged that she was as bossy as his wife and far more whining when he was inattentive but that passed safely  their high hour was a tramp on a ringing december afternoon through snowdrifted meadows down to the icy chaloosa river she was exotic in an astrachan cap and a short beaver coat she slid on the ice and shouted and he panted after her rotund with laughter myra babbitt never slid on the ice  he was afraid that they would be seen together in zenith it is impossible to lunch with a neighbors wife without the fact being known before nightfall in every house in your circle but tanis was beautifully discreet however appealingly she might turn to him when they were alone she was gravely detached when they were abroad and he hoped that she would be taken for a client orville jones once saw them emerging from a movie theater and babbitt bumbled let me make you quainted with mrs judique now heres a lady who knows the right broker to come to orvy mr jones though he was a man censorious of morals and of laundry machinery seemed satisfied  his predominant fearnot from any especial fondness for her but from the habit of proprietywas that his wife would learn of the affair he was certain that she knew nothing specific about tanis but he was also certain that she suspected something indefinite for years she had been bored by anything more affectionate than a farewell kiss yet she was hurt by any slackening in his irritable periodic interest and now he had no interest rather a revulsion he was completely faithfulto tanis he was distressed by the sight of his wifes slack plumpness by her puffs and billows of flesh by the tattered petticoat which she was always meaning and always forgetting to throw away but he was aware that she so long attuned to him caught all his repulsions he elaborately heavily jocularly tried to check them he couldnt  they had a tolerable christmas kenneth escott was there admittedly engaged to verona mrs babbitt was tearful and called kenneth her new son babbitt was worried about ted because he had ceased complaining of the state university and become suspiciously acquiescent he wondered what the boy was planning and was too shy to ask himself babbitt slipped away on christmas afternoon to take his present a silver cigarettebox to tanis when he returned mrs babbitt asked much too innocently did you go out for a little fresh air  yes just lil drive he mumbled  after new years his wife proposed i heard from my sister today george she isnt well i think perhaps i ought to go stay with her for a few weeks  now mrs babbitt was not accustomed to leave home during the winter except on violently demanding occasions and only the summer before she had been gone for weeks nor was babbitt one of the detachable husbands who take separations casually he liked to have her there she looked after his clothes she knew how his steak ought to be cooked and her clucking made him feel secure but he could not drum up even a dutiful oh she doesnt really need you does she while he tried to look regretful while he felt that his wife was watching him he was filled with exultant visions of tanis  do you think id better go she said sharply  youve got to decide honey i cant  she turned away sighing and his forehead was damp  till she went four days later she was curiously still he cumbrously affectionate her train left at noon as he saw it grow small beyond the trainshed he longed to hurry to tanis  no by golly i wont do that he vowed i wont go near her for a week  but he was at her flat at four   iii  he who had once controlled or seemed to control his life in a progress unimpassioned but diligent and sane was for that fortnight borne on a current of desire and very bad whisky and all the complications of new acquaintances those furious new intimates who demand so much more attention than old friends each morning he gloomily recognized his idiocies of the evening before with his head throbbing his tongue and lips stinging from cigarettes he incredulously counted the number of drinks he had taken and groaned i got to quit he had ceased saying i will quit for however resolute he might be at dawn he could not for a single evening check his drift  he had met taniss friends he had with the ardent haste of the midnight people who drink and dance and rattle and are ever afraid to be silent been adopted as a member of her group which they called the bunch he first met them after a day when he had worked particularly hard and when he hoped to be quiet with tanis and slowly sip her admiration  from down the hall he could hear shrieks and the grind of a phonograph as tanis opened the door he saw fantastic figures dancing in a haze of cigarette smoke the tables and chairs were against the wall  oh isnt this dandy she gabbled at him carrie nork had the loveliest idea she decided it was time for a party and she phoned the bunch and told em to gather round    george this is carrie  carrie was in the less desirable aspects of both at once matronly and spinsterish she was perhaps forty her hair was an unconvincing ashblond and if her chest was flat her hips were ponderous she greeted babbitt with a giggling welcome to our little midst tanis says youre a real sport  he was apparently expected to dance to be boyish and gay with carrie and he did his unforgiving best he towed her about the room bumping into other couples into the radiator into chairlegs cunningly ambushed as he danced he surveyed the rest of the bunch a thin young woman who looked capable conceited and sarcastic another woman whom he could never quite remember three overdressed and slightly effeminate young mensodafountain clerks or at least born for that profession a man of his own age immovable selfsatisfied resentful of babbitts presence  when he had finished his dutiful dance tanis took him aside and begged dear wouldnt you like to do something for me im all out of booze and the bunch want to celebrate couldnt you just skip down to healey hansons and get some  sure he said trying not to sound sullen  ill tell you ill get minnie sonntag to drive down with you tanis was pointing to the thin sarcastic young woman  miss sonntag greeted him with an astringent how dyou do mr babbitt tanis tells me youre a very prominent man and im honored by being allowed to drive with you of course im not accustomed to associating with society people like you so i dont know how to act in such exalted circles  thus miss sonntag talked all the way down to healey hansons to her jibes he wanted to reply oh go to the devil but he never quite nerved himself to that reasonable comment he was resenting the existence of the whole bunch he had heard tanis speak of darling carrie and min sonntagshes so cleveryoull adore her but they had never been real to him he had pictured tanis as living in a rosetinted vacuum waiting for him free of all the complications of a floral heights  when they returned he had to endure the patronage of the young sodaclerks they were as damply friendly as miss sonntag was dryly hostile they called him old georgie and shouted come on now sport shake a leg    boys in belted coats pimply boys as young as ted and as flabby as chorusmen but powerful to dance and to mind the phonograph and smoke cigarettes and patronize tanis he tried to be one of them he cried good work pete but his voice creaked  tanis apparently enjoyed the companionship of the dancing darlings she bridled to their bland flirtation and casually kissed them at the end of each dance babbitt hated her for the moment he saw her as middleaged he studied the wrinkles in the softness of her throat the slack flesh beneath her chin the taut muscles of her youth were loose and drooping between dances she sat in the largest chair waving her cigarette summoning her callow admirers to come and talk to her she thinks shes a blooming queen growled babbitt she chanted to miss sonntag isnt my little studio sweet studio rats its a plain oldmaidandchowdog flat oh god i wish i was home i wonder if i cant make a getaway now  his vision grew blurred however as he applied himself to healey hansons raw but vigorous whisky he blended with the bunch he began to rejoice that carrie nork and pete the most nearly intelligent of the nimble youths seemed to like him and it was enormously important to win over the surly older man who proved to be a railway clerk named fulton bemis  the conversation of the bunch was exclamatory highcolored full of references to people whom babbitt did not know apparently they thought very comfortably of themselves they were the bunch wise and beautiful and amusing they were bohemians and urbanites accustomed to all the luxuries of zenith dancehalls movietheaters and roadhouses and in a cynical superiority to people who were slow or tightwad they cackled  oh pete did i tell you what that dub of a cashier said when i came in late yesterday oh it was perfectly priceless  oh but wasnt t d stewed say he was simply ossified what did gladys say to him  think of the nerve of bob bickerstaff trying to get us to come to his house say the nerve of him can you beat it for nerve some nerve i call it  did you notice how dotty was dancing gee wasnt she the limit  babbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the oncehated miss minnie sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to jazz music were crabs pikers and poor fish and he roared you bet when mrs carrie nork gurgled dont you love to sit on the floor its so bohemian he began to think extremely well of the bunch when he mentioned his friends sir gerald doak lord wycombe william washington eathorne and chum frink he was proud of their condescending interest he got so thoroughly into the jocund spirit that he didnt much mind seeing tanis drooping against the shoulder of the youngest and milkiest of the young men and he himself desired to hold carrie norks pulpy hand and dropped it only because tanis looked angry  when he went home at two he was fully a member of the bunch and all the week thereafter he was bound by the exceedingly straitened conventions the exceedingly wearing demands of their life of pleasure and freedom he had to go to their parties he was involved in the agitation when everybody telephoned to everybody else that she hadnt meant what shed said when shed said that and anyway why was pete going around saying shed said it  never was a family more insistent on learning one anothers movements than were the bunch all of them volubly knew or indignantly desired to know where all the others had been every minute of the week babbitt found himself explaining to carrie or fulton bemis just what he had been doing that he should not have joined them till ten oclock and apologizing for having gone to dinner with a business acquaintance  every member of the bunch was expected to telephone to every other member at least once a week why havent you called me up babbitt was asked accusingly not only by tanis and carrie but presently by new ancient friends jennie and capitolina and toots  if for a moment he had seen tanis as withering and sentimental he lost that impression at carrie norks dance mrs nork had a large house and a small husband to her party came all of the bunch perhaps thirtyfive of them when they were completely mobilized babbitt under the name of old georgie was now a pioneer of the bunch since each month it changed half its membership and he who could recall the prehistoric days of a fortnight ago before mrs absolom the fooddemonstrator had gone to indianapolis and mac had got sore at minnie was a venerable leader and able to condescend to new petes and minnies and gladyses  at carries tanis did not have to work at being hostess she was dignified and sure a clear fine figure in the black chiffon frock he had always loved and in the wider spaces of that ugly house babbitt was able to sit quietly with her he repented of his first revulsion mooned at her feet and happily drove her home next day he bought a violent yellow tie to make himself young for her he knew a little sadly that he could not make himself beautiful he beheld himself as heavy hinting of fatness but he danced he dressed he chattered to be as young as she was    as young as she seemed to be   iv  as all converts whether to a religion love or gardening find as by magic that though hitherto these hobbies have not seemed to exist now the whole world is filled with their fury so once he was converted to dissipation babbitt discovered agreeable opportunities for it everywhere  he had a new view of his sporting neighbor sam doppelbrau the doppelbraus were respectable people industrious people prosperous people whose ideal of happiness was an eternal cabaret their life was dominated by suburban bacchanalia of alcohol nicotine gasoline and kisses they and their set worked capably all the week and all week looked forward to saturday night when they would as they expressed it throw a party and the thrown party grew noisier and noisier up to sunday dawn and usually included an extremely rapid motor expedition to nowhere in particular  one evening when tanis was at the theater babbitt found himself being lively with the doppelbraus pledging friendship with men whom he had for years privily denounced to mrs babbitt as a rotten bunch of tinhorns that i wouldnt go out with rot if they were the last people on earth that evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in front of the house chipping off the walk the iceclots like fossil footprints made by the steps of passersby during the recent snow howard littlefield came up snuffling  still a widower george  yump cold again tonight  what do you hear from the wife  shes feeling fine but her sister is still pretty sick  say better come in and have dinner with us tonight george  ohoh thanks have to go out  suddenly he could not endure littlefields recitals of the more interesting statistics about totally uninteresting problems he scraped at the walk and grunted  sam doppelbrau appeared  evenin babbitt working hard  yuh lil exercise  cold enough for you tonight  well just about  still a widower  uhhuh  say babbitt while shes awayi know you dont care much for boozefights but the missus and id be awfully glad if you could come in some night think you could stand a good cocktail for once  stand it young fella i bet old uncle george can mix the best cocktail in these united states  hurray thats the way to talk look here theres some folks coming to the house tonight louetta swanson and some other live ones and im going to open up a bottle of prewar gin and maybe well dance a while why dont you drop in and jazz it up a little just for a change  wellwhat time they coming  he was at sam doppelbraus at nine it was the third time he had entered the house by ten he was calling mr doppelbrau sam old hoss  at eleven they all drove out to the old farm inn babbitt sat in the back of doppelbraus car with louetta swanson once he had timorously tried to make love to her now he did not try he merely made love and louetta dropped her head on his shoulder told him what a nagger eddie was and accepted babbitt as a decent and welltrained libertine  with the assistance of taniss bunch the doppelbraus and other companions in forgetfulness there was not an evening for two weeks when he did not return home late and shaky with his other faculties blurred he yet had the motorists gift of being able to drive when he could scarce walk of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching cars he came wambling into the house if verona and kenneth escott were about he got past them with a hasty greeting horribly aware of their level young glances and hid himself upstairs he found when he came into the warm house that he was hazier than he had believed his head whirled he dared not lie down he tried to soak out the alcohol in a hot bath for the moment his head was clearer but when he moved about the bathroom his calculations of distance were wrong so that he dragged down the towels and knocked over the soapdish with a clatter which he feared would betray him to the children chilly in his dressinggown he tried to read the evening paper he could follow every word he seemed to take in the sense of things but a minute afterward he could not have told what he had been reading when he went to bed his brain flew in circles and he hastily sat up struggling for selfcontrol at last he was able to lie still feeling only a little sick and dizzyand enormously ashamed to hide his condition from his own children to have danced and shouted with people whom he despised to have said foolish things sung idiotic songs tried to kiss silly girls incredulously he remembered that he had by his roaring familiarity with them laid himself open to the patronizing of youths whom he would have kicked out of his office that by dancing too ardently he had exposed himself to rebukes from the rattiest of withering women as it came relentlessly back to him he snarled i hate myself god how i hate myself but he raged im through no more had enough plenty  he was even surer about it the morning after when he was trying to be grave and paternal with his daughters at breakfast at noontime he was less sure he did not deny that he had been a fool he saw it almost as clearly as at midnight but anything he struggled was better than going back to a life of barren heartiness at four he wanted a drink he kept a whisky flask in his desk now and after two minutes of battle he had his drink three drinks later he began to see the bunch as tender and amusing friends and by six he was with them    and the tale was to be told all over  each morning his head ached a little less a bad head for drinks had been his safeguard but the safeguard was crumbling presently he could be drunk at dawn yet not feel particularly wretched in his conscienceor in his stomachwhen he awoke at eight no regret no desire to escape the toil of keeping up with the arduous merriment of the bunch was so great as his feeling of social inferiority when he failed to keep up to be the livest of them was as much his ambition now as it had been to excel at making money at playing golf at motordriving at oratory at climbing to the mckelvey set but occasionally he failed  he found that pete and the other young men considered the bunch too austerely polite and the carrie who merely kissed behind doors too embarrassingly monogamic as babbitt sneaked from floral heights down to the bunch so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the bunch off to times with bouncing young women whom they picked up in department stores and at hotel coatrooms once babbitt tried to accompany them there was a motor car a bottle of whisky and for him a grubby shrieking cashgirl from parcher and steins he sat beside her and worried he was apparently expected to jolly her along but when she sang out hey leggo quit crushing me cootiegarage he did not quite know how to go on they sat in the back room of a saloon and babbitt had a headache was confused by their new slang looked at them benevolently wanted to go home and had a drinka good many drinks  two evenings after fulton bemis the surly older man of the bunch took babbitt aside and grunted look here its none of my business and god knows i always lap up my share of the hootch but dont you think you better watch yourself youre one of these enthusiastic chumps that always overdo things d you realize youre throwing in the booze as fast as you can and you eat one cigarette right after another better cut it out for a while  babbitt tearfully said that good old fult was a prince and yes he certainly would cut it out and thereafter he lighted a cigarette and took a drink and had a terrific quarrel with tanis when she caught him being affectionate with carrie nork  next morning he hated himself that he should have sunk into a position where a fifteenthrater like fulton bemis could rebuke him he perceived that since he was making love to every woman possible tanis was no longer his one pure star and he wondered whether she had ever been anything more to him than a woman and if bemis had spoken to him were other people talking about him he suspiciously watched the men at the athletic club that noon it seemed to him that they were uneasy they had been talking about him then he was angry he became belligerent he not only defended seneca doane but even made fun of the y m c a vergil gunch was rather brief in his answers  afterward babbitt was not angry he was afraid he did not go to the next lunch of the boosters club but hid in a cheap restaurant and while he munched a hamandegg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on the arm of his chair he worried  four days later when the bunch were having one of their best parties babbitt drove them to the skatingrink which had been laid out on the chaloosa river after a thaw the streets had frozen in smooth ice down those wide endless streets the wind rattled between the rows of wooden houses and the whole bellevue district seemed a frontier town even with skid chains on all four wheels babbitt was afraid of sliding and when he came to the long slide of a hill he crawled down both brakes on slewing round a corner came a less cautious car it skidded it almost raked them with its rear fenders in relief at their escape the bunchtanis minnie sonntag pete fulton bemisshouted oh baby and waved their hands to the agitated other driver then babbitt saw professor pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill afoot staring owlishly at the revelers he was sure that pumphrey recognized him and saw tanis kiss him as she crowed youre such a good driver  at lunch next day he probed pumphrey with out last night with my brother and some friends of his gosh what driving slippery s glass thought i saw you hiking up the bellevue avenue hill  no i wasnti didnt see you said pumphrey hastily rather guiltily  perhaps two days afterward babbitt took tanis to lunch at the hotel thornleigh she who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat had begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little of her if he never introduced her to his friends if he was unwilling to be seen with her except at the movies he thought of taking her to the ladies annex of the athletic club but that was too dangerous he would have to introduce her and oh people might misunderstand andhe compromised on the thornleigh  she was unusually smart all in black small black tricorne hat short black caracul coat loose and swinging and austere highnecked black velvet frock at a time when most street costumes were like evening gowns perhaps she was too smart every one in the gold and oak restaurant of the thornleigh was staring at her as babbitt followed her to a table he uneasily hoped that the headwaiter would give them a discreet place behind a pillar but they were stationed on the center aisle tanis seemed not to notice her admirers she smiled at babbitt with a lavish oh isnt this nice what a peppylooking orchestra babbitt had difficulty in being lavish in return for two tables away he saw vergil gunch all through the meal gunch watched them while babbitt watched himself being watched and lugubriously tried to keep from spoiling taniss gaiety i felt like a spree today she rippled i love the thornleigh dont you its so live and yet soso refined  he made talk about the thornleigh the service the food the people he recognized in the restaurant all but vergil gunch there did not seem to be anything else to talk of he smiled conscientiously at her fluttering jests he agreed with her that minnie sonntag was so hard to get along with and young pete such a silly lazy kid really just no good at all but he himself had nothing to say he considered telling her his worries about gunch butoh gosh it was too much work to go into the whole thing and explain about verg and everything  he was relieved when he put tanis on a trolley he was cheerful in the familiar simplicities of his office  at four oclock vergil gunch called on him  babbitt was agitated but gunch began in a friendly way  hows the boy say some of us are getting up a scheme wed kind of like to have you come in on  fine verg shoot  you know during the war we had the undesirable element the reds and walking delegates and just the plain common grouches dead to rights and so did we for quite a while after the war but folks forget about the danger and that gives these cranks a chance to begin working underground again especially a lot of these parlor socialists well its up to the folks that do a little sound thinking to make a conscious effort to keep bucking these fellows some guy back east has organized a society called the good citizens league for just that purpose of course the chamber of commerce and the american legion and so on do a fine work in keeping the decent people in the saddle but theyre devoted to so many other causes that they cant attend to this one problem properly but the good citizens league the g c l they stick right to it oh the g c l has to have some other ostensible purposesfrinstance here in zenith i think it ought to support the parkextension project and the city planning committeeand then too it should have a social aspect being made up of the best peoplehave dances and so on especially as one of the best ways it can put the kibosh on cranks is to apply this social boycott business to folks big enough so you cant reach em otherwise then if that dont work the g c l can finally send a little delegation around to inform folks that get too flip that they got to conform to decent standards and quit shooting off their mouths so free dont it sound like the organization could do a great work weve already got some of the strongest men in town and of course we want you in how about it  babbitt was uncomfortable he felt a compulsion back to all the standards he had so vaguely yet so desperately been fleeing he fumbled  i suppose youd especially light on fellows like seneca doane and try to make em  you bet your sweet life we would look here old georgie ive never for one moment believed you meant it when youve defended doane and the strikers and so on at the club i knew you were simply kidding those poor galoots like sid finkelstein at least i certainly hope you were kidding  oh wellsurecourse you might say babbitt was conscious of how feeble he sounded conscious of gunchs mature and relentless eye gosh you know where i stand im no labor agitator im a business man first last and all the time butbut honestly i dont think doane means so badly and you got to remember hes an old friend of mine  george when it comes right down to a struggle between decency and the security of our homes on the one hand and red ruin and those lazy dogs plotting for free beer on the other you got to give up even old friendships he that is not with me is against me  yees i suppose  how about it going to join us in the good citizens league  ill have to think it over verg  all right just as you say babbitt was relieved to be let off so easily but gunch went on george i dont know whats come over you none of us do and weve talked a lot about you for a while we figured out youd been upset by what happened to poor riesling and we forgave you for any fool thing you said but thats old stuff now george and we cant make out whats got into you personally ive always defended you but i must say its getting too much for me all the boys at the athletic club and the boosters are sore the way you go on deliberately touting doane and his bunch of hellhounds and talking about being liberalwhich means being wishywashyand even saying this preacher guy ingram isnt a professional freelove artist and then the way you been carrying on personally joe pumphrey says he saw you out the other night with a gang of totties all stewed to the gills and here today coming right into the thornleigh with awell she may be all right and a perfect lady but she certainly did look like a pretty gay skirt for a fellow with his wife out of town to be taking to lunch didnt look well what the devil has come over you george  strikes me theres a lot of fellows that know more about my personal business than i do myself  now dont go getting sore at me because i come out flatfooted like a friend and say what i think instead of tattling behind your back the way a whole lot of em do i tell you george you got a position in the community and the community expects you to live up to it andbetter think over joining the good citizens league see you about it later  he was gone  that evening babbitt dined alone he saw all the clan of good fellows peering through the restaurant window spying on him fear sat beside him and he told himself that tonight he would not go to taniss flat and he did not go    till late     chapter xxx  i  the summer before mrs babbitts letters had crackled with desire to return to zenith now they said nothing of returning but a wistful i suppose everything is going on all right without me among her dry chronicles of weather and sicknesses hinted to babbitt that he hadnt been very urgent about her coming he worried it  if she were here and i went on raising cain like i been doing shed have a fit i got to get hold of myself i got to learn to play around and yet not make a fool of myself i can do it too if folks like verg gunch ll let me alone and myra ll stay away butpoor kid she sounds lonely lord i dont want to hurt her  impulsively he wrote that they missed her and her next letter said happily that she was coming home  he persuaded himself that he was eager to see her he bought roses for the house he ordered squab for dinner he had the car cleaned and polished all the way home from the station with her he was adequate in his accounts of teds success in basketball at the university but before they reached floral heights there was nothing more to say and already he felt the force of her stolidity wondered whether he could remain a good husband and still sneak out of the house this evening for half an hour with the bunch when he had housed the car he blundered upstairs into the familiar talcumscented warmth of her presence blaring help you unpack your bag  no i can do it  slowly she turned holding up a small box and slowly she said i brought you a present just a new cigarcase i dont know if youd care to have it  she was the lonely girl the brown appealing myra thompson whom he had married and he almost wept for pity as he kissed her and besought oh honey honey care to have it of course i do im awful proud you brought it to me and i needed a new case badly  he wondered how he would get rid of the case he had bought the week before  and you really are glad to see me back  why you poor kiddy what you been worrying about  well you didnt seem to miss me very much  by the time he had finished his stint of lying they were firmly bound again by ten that evening it seemed improbable that she had ever been away there was but one difference the problem of remaining a respectable husband a floral heights husband yet seeing tanis and the bunch with frequency he had promised to telephone to tanis that evening and now it was melodramatically impossible he prowled about the telephone impulsively thrusting out a hand to lift the receiver but never quite daring to risk it nor could he find a reason for slipping down to the drug store on smith street with its telephonebooth he was laden with responsibility till he threw it off with the speculation why the deuce should i fret so about not being able to phone tanis she can get along without me i dont owe her anything shes a fine girl but ive given her just as much as she has me    oh damn these women and the way they get you all tied up in complications   ii  for a week he was attentive to his wife took her to the theater to dinner at the littlefields then the old weary dodging and shifting began and at least two evenings a week he spent with the bunch he still made pretense of going to the elks and to committeemeetings but less and less did he trouble to have his excuses interesting less and less did she affect to believe them he was certain that she knew he was associating with what floral heights called a sporty crowd yet neither of them acknowledged it in matrimonial geography the distance between the first mute recognition of a break and the admission thereof is as great as the distance between the first naive faith and the first doubting  as he began to drift away he also began to see her as a human being to like and dislike her instead of accepting her as a comparatively movable part of the furniture and he compassionated that husbandandwife relation which in twentyfive years of married life had become a separate and real entity he recalled their high lights the summer vacation in virginia meadows under the blue wall of the mountains their motor tour through ohio and the exploration of cleveland cincinnati and columbus the birth of verona their building of this new house planned to comfort them through a happy old agechokingly they had said that it might be the last home either of them would ever have yet his most softening remembrance of these dear moments did not keep him from barking at dinner yep going out f few hours dont sit up for me  he did not dare now to come home drunk and though he rejoiced in his return to high morality and spoke with gravity to pete and fulton bemis about their drinking he prickled at myras unexpressed criticisms and sulkily meditated that a fellow couldnt ever learn to handle himself if he was always bossed by a lot of women  he no longer wondered if tanis wasnt a bit worn and sentimental in contrast to the complacent myra he saw her as swift and airborne and radiant a firespirit tenderly stooping to the hearth and however pitifully he brooded on his wife he longed to be with tanis  then mrs babbitt tore the decent cloak from her unhappiness and the astounded male discovered that she was having a small determined rebellion of her own   iii  they were beside the fireless fireplace in the evening  georgie she said you havent given me the list of your household expenses while i was away  no ihavent made it out yet very affably gosh we must try to keep down expenses this year  thats so i dont know where all the money goes to i try to economize but it just seems to evaporate  i suppose i oughtnt to spend so much on cigars dont know but what ill cut down my smoking maybe cut it out entirely i was thinking of a good way to do it the other day start on these cubeb cigarettes and theyd kind of disgust me with smoking  oh i do wish you would it isnt that i care but honestly george it is so bad for you to smoke so much dont you think you could reduce the amount and georgei notice now when you come home from these lodges and all that sometimes you smell of whisky dearie you know i dont worry so much about the moral side of it but you have a weak stomach and you cant stand all this drinking  weak stomach hell i guess i can carry my booze about as well as most folks  well i do think you ought to be careful dont you see dear i dont want you to get sick  sick rats im not a baby i guess i aint going to get sick just because maybe once a week i shoot a highball thats the trouble with women they always exaggerate so  george i dont think you ought to talk that way when im just speaking for your own good  i know but gosh all fishhooks thats the trouble with women theyre always criticizing and commenting and bringing things up and then they say its for your own good  why george thats not a nice way to talk to answer me so short  well i didnt mean to answer short but gosh talking as if i was a kindergarten brat not able to tote one highball without calling for the st marys ambulance a fine idea you must have of me  oh it isnt that its justi dont want to see you get sick andmy i didnt know it was so late dont forget to give me those household accounts for the time while i was away  oh thunder whats the use of taking the trouble to make em out now lets just skip em for that period  why george babbitt in all the years weve been married weve never failed to keep a complete account of every penny weve spent  no maybe thats the trouble with us  what in the world do you mean  oh i dont mean anything onlysometimes i get so darn sick and tired of all this routine and the accounting at the office and expenses at home and fussing and stewing and fretting and wearing myself out worrying over a lot of junk that doesnt really mean a doggone thing and being so careful andgood lord what do you think im made for i could have been a darn good orator and here i fuss and fret and worry  dont you suppose i ever get tired of fussing i get so bored with ordering three meals a day three hundred and sixtyfive days a year and ruining my eyes over that horrid sewingmachine and looking after your clothes and rones and teds and tinkas and everybodys and the laundry and darning socks and going down to the piggly wiggly to market and bringing my basket home to save money on the cashandcarry andeverything  well gosh with a certain astonishment i suppose maybe you do but talk abouthere i have to be in the office every single day while you can go out all afternoon and see folks and visit with the neighbors and do any blinkin thing you want to  yes and a fine lot of good that does me just talking over the same old things with the same old crowd while you have all sorts of interesting people coming in to see you at the office  interesting cranky old dames that want to know why i havent rented their dear precious homes for about seven times their value and bunch of old crabs panning the everlasting daylights out of me because they dont receive every cent of their rentals by three gm on the second of the month sure interesting just as interesting as the small pox  now george i will not have you shouting at me that way  well it gets my goat the way women figure out that a man doesnt do a darn thing but sit on his chair and have loveydovey conferences with a lot of classy dames and give em the glad eye  i guess you manage to give them a glad enough eye when they do come in  what do you mean mean im chasing flappers  i should hope notat your age  now you look here you may not believe itof course all you see is fat little georgie babbitt sure handy man around the house fixes the furnace when the furnaceman doesnt show up and pays the bills but dull awful dull well you may not believe it but theres some women that think old george babbitt isnt such a bad scout they think hes not so badlooking not so bad that it hurts anyway and hes got a pretty good line of guff and some even think he shakes a darn wicked walkover at dancing  yes she spoke slowly i havent much doubt that when im away you manage to find people who properly appreciate you  well i just mean he protested with a sound of denial then he was angered into semihonesty you bet i do i find plenty of folks and doggone nice ones that dont think im a weakstomached baby  thats exactly what i was saying you can run around with anybody you please but im supposed to sit here and wait for you you have the chance to get all sorts of culture and everything and i just stay home  well gosh almighty theres nothing to prevent your reading books and going to lectures and all that junk is there  george i told you i wont have you shouting at me like that i dont know whats come over you you never used to speak to me in this cranky way  i didnt mean to sound cranky but gosh it certainly makes me sore to get the blame because you dont keep up with things  im going to will you help me  sure anything i can do to help you in the culturegrabbing lineyours to oblige g f babbitt  very well then i want you to go to mrs mudges new thought meeting with me next sunday afternoon  mrs whos which  mrs opal emerson mudge the fieldlecturer for the american new thought league shes going to speak on cultivating the sun spirit before the league of the higher illumination at the thornleigh  oh punk new thought hashed thought with a poached egg cultivating the it sounds like why is a mouse when it spins thats a fine spiel for a good presbyterian to be going to when you can hear doc drew  reverend drew is a scholar and a pulpit orator and all that but he hasnt got the inner ferment as mrs mudge calls it he hasnt any inspiration for the new era women need inspiration now so i want you to come as you promised   iv  the zenith branch of the league of the higher illumination met in the smaller ballroom at the hotel thornleigh a refined apartment with pale green walls and plaster wreaths of roses refined parquet flooring and ultrarefined frail gilt chairs here were gathered sixtyfive women and ten men most of the men slouched in their chairs and wriggled while their wives sat rigidly at attention but two of themrednecked meaty menwere as respectably devout as their wives they were newly rich contractors who having bought houses motors handpainted pictures and gentlemanliness were now buying a refined readymade philosophy it had been a tossup with them whether to buy new thought christian science or a good standard highchurch model of episcopalianism  in the flesh mrs opal emerson mudge fell somewhat short of a prophetic aspect she was ponybuilt and plump with the face of a haughty pekingese a button of a nose and arms so short that despite her most indignant endeavors she could not clasp her hands in front of her as she sat on the platform waiting her frock of taffeta and green velvet with three strings of glass beads and large folding eyeglasses dangling from a black ribbon was a triumph of refinement  mrs mudge was introduced by the president of the league of the higher illumination an oldish young woman with a yearning voice white spats and a mustache she said that mrs mudge would now make it plain to the simplest intellect how the sun spirit could be cultivated and they who had been thinking about cultivating one would do well to treasure mrs mudges words because even zenith and everybody knew that zenith stood in the van of spiritual and new thought progress didnt often have the opportunity to sit at the feet of such an inspiring optimist and metaphysical seer as mrs opal emerson mudge who had lived the life of wider usefulness through concentration and in the silence found those secrets of mental control and the inner key which were immediately going to transform and bring peace power and prosperity to the unhappy nations and so friends would they for this precious gemstudded hour forget the illusions of the seeming real and in the actualization of the deeplying veritas pass along with mrs opal emerson mudge to the realm beautiful  if mrs mudge was rather pudgier than one would like ones swamis yogis seers and initiates yet her voice had the real professional note it was refined and optimistic it was overpoweringly calm it flowed on relentlessly without one comma till babbitt was hypnotized her favorite word was always which she pronounced olllllleways her principal gesture was a pontifical but thoroughly ladylike blessing with two stubby fingers  she explained about this matter of spiritual saturation  there are those  of those she made a linked sweetness long drawn out a faroff delicate call in a twilight minor it chastely rebuked the restless husbands yet brought them a message of healing  there are those who have seen the rim and outer seeming of the logos there are those who have glimpsed and in enthusiasm possessed themselves of some segment and portion of the logos there are those who thus flicked but not penetrated and radioactivated by the dynamis go always to and fro assertative that they possess and are possessed of the logos and the metaphysikos but this word i bring you this concept i enlarge that those that are not utter are not even inceptive and that holiness is in its definitive essence always always always wholeiness and  it proved that the essence of the sun spirit was truth but its aura and effluxion were cheerfulness  face always the day with the dawnlaugh with the enthusiasm of the initiate who perceives that all works together in the revolutions of the wheel and who answers the strictures of the soured souls of the destructionists with a glad affirmation  it went on for about an hour and seven minutes  at the end mrs mudge spoke with more vigor and punctuation  now let me suggest to all of you the advantages of the theosophical and pantheistic oriental reading circle which i represent our object is to unite all the manifestations of the new era into one cohesive wholenew thought christian science theosophy vedanta bahaism and the other sparks from the one new light the subscription is but ten dollars a year and for this mere pittance the members receive not only the monthly magazine pearls of healing but the privilege of sending right to the president our revered mother dobbs any questions regarding spiritual progress matrimonial problems health and wellbeing questions financial difficulties and  they listened to her with adoring attention they looked genteel they looked ironedout they coughed politely and crossed their legs with quietness and in expensive linen handkerchiefs they blew their noses with a delicacy altogether optimistic and refined  as for babbitt he sat and suffered  when they were blessedly out in the air again when they drove home through a wind smelling of snow and honest sun he dared not speak they had been too near to quarreling these days mrs babbitt forced it  did you enjoy mrs mudges talk  well iwhat did you get out of it  oh it starts a person thinking it gets you out of a routine of ordinary thoughts  well ill hand it to opal she isnt ordinary but goshhonest did that stuff mean anything to you  of course im not trained in metaphysics and there was lots i couldnt quite grasp but i did feel it was inspiring and she speaks so readily i do think you ought to have got something out of it  well i didnt i swear i was simply astonished the way those women lapped it up why the dickens they want to put in their time listening to all that blaa when they  its certainly better for them than going to roadhouses and smoking and drinking  i dont know whether it is or not personally i dont see a whole lot of difference in both cases theyre trying to get away from themselvesmost everybody is these days i guess and id certainly get a whole lot more out of hoofing it in a good lively dance even in some dive than sitting looking as if my collar was too tight and feeling too scared to spit and listening to opal chewing her words  im sure you do youre very fond of dives no doubt you saw a lot of them while i was away  look here you been doing a hell of a lot of insinuating and hinting around lately as if i were leading a double life or something and im damn sick of it and i dont want to hear anything more about it  why george babbitt do you realize what youre saying why george in all our years together youve never talked to me like that  its about time then  lately youve been getting worse and worse and now finally youre cursing and swearing at me and shouting at me and your voice so ugly and hatefuli just shudder  oh rats quit exaggerating i wasnt shouting or swearing either  i wish you could hear your own voice maybe you dont realize how it sounds but even soyou never used to talk like that you simply couldnt talk this way if something dreadful hadnt happened to you  his mind was hard with amazement he found that he wasnt particularly sorry it was only with an effort that he made himself more agreeable well gosh i didnt mean to get sore  george do you realize that we cant go on like this getting farther and farther apart and you ruder and ruder to me i just dont know whats going to happen  he had a moments pity for her bewilderment he thought of how many deep and tender things would be hurt if they really couldnt go on like this but his pity was impersonal and he was wondering wouldnt it maybe be a good thing ifnot a divorce and all that o course but kind of a little more independence  while she looked at him pleadingly he drove on in a dreadful silence     chapter xxxi  i  when he was away from her while he kicked about the garage and swept the snow off the runningboard and examined a cracked hoseconnection he repented he was alarmed and astonished that he could have flared out at his wife and thought fondly how much more lasting she was than the flighty bunch he went in to mumble that he was sorry didnt mean to be grouchy and to inquire as to her interest in movies but in the darkness of the movie theater he brooded that hed gone and tied himself up to myra all over again he had some satisfaction in taking it out on tanis judique hang tanis anyway whyd she gone and got him into these mixups and made him all jumpy and nervous and cranky too many complications cut em out  he wanted peace for ten days he did not see tanis nor telephone to her and instantly she put upon him the compulsion which he hated when he had stayed away from her for five days hourly taking pride in his resoluteness and hourly picturing how greatly tanis must miss him miss mcgoun reported mrs judique on the phone like t speak t you bout some repairs  tanis was quick and quiet  mr babbitt oh george

emotional crises at the roughnecks table at the club verg gunch talked of the good citizens league and it seemed to babbitt deliberately left him out of the invitations to join old mat penniman the general utility man at babbitts office had troubles and came in to groan about them his oldest boy was no good his wife was sick and he had quarreled with his brotherinlaw conrad lyte also had troubles and since lyte was one of his best clients babbitt had to listen to them mr lyte it appeared was suffering from a peculiarly interesting neuralgia and the garage had overcharged him when babbitt came home everybody had troubles his wife was simultaneously thinking about discharging the impudent new maid and worried lest the maid leave and tinka desired to denounce her teacher  oh quit fussing babbitt fussed you never hear me whining about my troubles and yet if you had to run a realestate officewhy today i found miss bannigan was two days behind with her accounts and i pinched my finger in my desk and lyte was in and just as unreasonable as ever  he was so vexed that after dinner when it was time for a tactful escape to tanis he merely grumped to his wife got to go out be back by eleven should think  oh youre going out again  again what do you mean again havent hardly been out of the house for a week  are youare you going to the elks  nope got to see some people  though this time he heard his own voice and knew that it was curt though she was looking at him with wideeyed reproach he stumped into the hall jerked on his ulster and furlined gloves and went out to start the car  he was relieved to find tanis cheerful unreproachful and brilliant in a frock of brown net over gold tissue you poor man having to come out on a night like this its terribly cold dont you think a small highball would be nice  now by golly theres a woman with savvy i think we could more or less stand a highball if it wasnt too long a onenot over a foot tall  he kissed her with careless heartiness he forgot the compulsion of her demands he stretched in a large chair and felt that he had beautifully come home he was suddenly loquacious he told her what a noble and misunderstood man he was and how superior to pete fulton bemis and the other men of their acquaintance and she bending forward chin in charming hand brightly agreed but when he forced himself to ask well honey hows things with you she took his dutyquestion seriously and he discovered that she too had troubles  oh all right buti did get so angry with carrie she told minnie that i told her that minnie was an awful tightwad and minnie told me carrie had told her and of course i told her i hadnt said anything of the kind and then carrie found minnie had told me and she was simply furious because minnie had told me and of course i was just boiling because carrie had told her id told her and then we all met up at fultonshis wife is awaythank heavensoh theres the dandiest floor in his house to dance onand we were all of us simply furious at each other andoh i do hate that kind of a mixup dont you i meanits so lacking in refinement butand mother wants to come and stay with me for a whole month and of course i do love her i suppose i do but honestly shell cramp my style something dreadfulshe never can learn not to comment and she always wants to know where im going when i go out evenings and if i lie to her she always spies around and ferrets around and finds out where ive been and then she looks like patience on a monument till i could just scream and oh i must tell youyou know i never talk about myself i just hate people who do dont you buti feel so stupid tonight and i know i must be boring you with all this butwhat would you do about mother  he gave her facile masculine advice she was to put off her mothers stay she was to tell carrie to go to the deuce for these valuable revelations she thanked him and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the bunch of what a sentimental fool was carrie of what a lazy brat was pete of how nice fulton bemis could becourse lots of people think hes a regular old grouch when they meet him because he doesnt give em the glad hand the first crack out of the box but when they get to know him hes a corker  but as they had gone conscientiously through each of these analyses before the conversation staggered babbitt tried to be intellectual and deal with general topics he said some thoroughly sound things about disarmament and broadmindedness and liberalism but it seemed to him that general topics interested tanis only when she could apply them to pete carrie or themselves he was distressingly conscious of their silence he tried to stir her into chattering again but silence rose like a gray presence and hovered between them  i uh he labored it strikes meit strikes me that unemployment is lessening  maybe pete will get a decent job then  silence  desperately he essayed whats the trouble old honey you seem kind of quiet tonight  am i oh im not butdo you really care whether i am or not  care sure course i do  do you really she swooped on him sat on the arm of his chair  he hated the emotional drain of having to appear fond of her he stroked her hand smiled up at her dutifully and sank back  george i wonder if you really like me at all  course i do silly  do you really precious do you care a bit  why certainly you dont suppose id be here if i didnt  now see here young man i wont have you speaking to me in that huffy way  i didnt mean to sound huffy i just in injured and rather childish tones gosh almighty it makes me tired the way everybody says i sound huffy when i just talk natural do they expect me to sing it or something  who do you mean by everybody how many other ladies have you been consoling  look here now i wont have this hinting  humbly i know dear i was only teasing i know it didnt mean to talk huffyit was just tired forgive bad tanis but say you love me say it  i love you course i do  yes you do cynically oh darling i dont mean to be rude buti get so lonely i feel so useless nobody needs me nothing i can do for anybody and you know dear im so activei could be if there was something to do and i am young arent i im not an old thing im not old and stupid am i  he had to assure her she stroked his hair and he had to look pleased under that touch the more demanding in its beguiling softness he was impatient he wanted to flee out to a hard sure unemotional manworld through her delicate and caressing fingers she may have caught something of his shrugging distaste she left himhe was for the moment buoyantly relievedshe dragged a footstool to his feet and sat looking beseechingly up at him but as in many men the cringing of a dog the flinching of a frightened child rouse not pity but a surprised and jerky cruelty so her humility only annoyed him and he saw her now as middleaged as beginning to be old even while he detested his own thoughts they rode him she was old he winced old he noted how the soft flesh was creasing into webby folds beneath her chin below her eyes at the base of her wrists a patch of her throat had a minute roughness like the crumbs from a rubber eraser old she was younger in years than himself yet it was sickening to have her yearning up at him with rolling great eyesas if he shuddered his own aunt were making love to him  he fretted inwardly im through with this asinine fooling around im going to cut her out shes a darn decent nice woman and i dont want to hurt her but itll hurt a lot less to cut her right out like a good clean surgical operation  he was on his feet he was speaking urgently by every rule of selfesteem he had to prove to her and to himself that it was her fault  i suppose maybe im kind of out of sorts tonight but honest honey when i stayed away for a while to catch up on work and everything and figure out where i was at you ought to have been cannier and waited till i came back cant you see dear when you made me come ibeing about an average bullheaded chumpmy tendency was to resist listen dear im going now  not for a while precious no  yep right now and then sometime well see about the future  what do you mean dear about the future have i done something i oughtnt to oh im so dreadfully sorry  he resolutely put his hands behind him not a thing god bless you not a thing youre as good as they make em but its justgood lord do you realize ive got things to do in the world ive got a business to attend to and you might not believe it but ive got a wife and kids that im awful fond of then only during the murder he was committing was he able to feel nobly virtuous i want us to be friends but gosh i cant go on this way feeling i got to come up here every so often  oh darling darling and ive always told you so carefully that you were absolutely free i just wanted you to come around when you were tired and wanted to talk to me or when you could enjoy our parties  she was so reasonable she was so gently right it took him an hour to make his escape with nothing settled and everything horribly settled in a barren freedom of icy northern wind he sighed thank god thats over poor tanis poor darling decent tanis but it is over absolute im free     chapter xxxii  i  his wife was up when he came in did you have a good time she sniffed  i did not i had a rotten time anything else i got to explain  george how can you speak likeoh i dont know whats come over you  good lord theres nothing come over me why do you look for trouble all the time he was warning himself careful stop being so disagreeable course she feels it being left alone here all evening but he forgot his warning as she went on  why do you go out and see all sorts of strange people i suppose youll say youve been to another committeemeeting this evening  nope ive been calling on a woman we sat by the fire and kidded each other and had a whale of a good time if you want to know  wellfrom the way you say it i suppose its my fault you went there i probably sent you  you did  well upon my word  you hate strange people as you call em if you had your way id be as much of an old stickinthemud as howard littlefield you never want to have anybody with any git to em at the house you want a bunch of old stiffs that sit around and gas about the weather youre doing your level best to make me old well let me tell you im not going to have  overwhelmed she bent to his unprecedented tirade and in answer she mourned  oh dearest i dont think thats true i dont mean to make you old i know perhaps youre partly right perhaps i am slow about getting acquainted with new people but when you think of all the dear good times we have and the supperparties and the movies and all  with true masculine wiles he not only convinced himself that she had injured him but by the loudness of his voice and the brutality of his attack he convinced her also and presently he had her apologizing for his having spent the evening with tanis he went up to bed well pleased not only the master but the martyr of the household for a distasteful moment after he had lain down he wondered if he had been altogether just ought to be ashamed bullying her maybe there is her side to things maybe she hasnt had such a bloomin hectic time herself but i dont care good for her to get waked up a little and im going to keep free of her and tanis and the fellows at the club and everybody im going to run my own life   ii  in this mood he was particularly objectionable at the boosters club lunch next day they were addressed by a congressman who had just returned from an exhaustive threemonths study of the finances ethnology political systems linguistic divisions mineral resources and agriculture of germany france great britain italy austria czechoslovakia jugoslavia and bulgaria he told them all about those subjects together with three funny stories about european misconceptions of america and some spirited words on the necessity of keeping ignorant foreigners out of america  say that was a mighty informative talk real hestuff said sidney finkelstein  but the disaffected babbitt grumbled fourflusher bunch of hot air and whats the matter with the immigrants gosh they arent all ignorant and i got a hunch were all descended from immigrants ourselves  oh you make me tired said mr finkelstein  babbitt was aware that dr a i dilling was sternly listening from across the table dr dilling was one of the most important men in the boosters he was not a physician but a surgeon a more romantic and sounding occupation he was an intense large man with a boiling of black hair and a thick black mustache the newspapers often chronicled his operations he was professor of surgery in the state university he went to dinner at the very best houses on royal ridge and he was said to be worth several hundred thousand dollars it was dismaying to babbitt to have such a person glower at him he hastily praised the congressmans wit to sidney finkelstein but for dr dillings benefit   iii  that afternoon three men shouldered into babbitts office with the air of a vigilante committee in frontier days they were large resolute bigjawed men and they were all high lords in the land of zenithdr dilling the surgeon charles mckelvey the contractor and most dismaying of all the whitebearded colonel rutherford snow owner of the advocatetimes in their whelming presence babbitt felt small and insignificant  well well great pleasure have chairs what cn i do for you he babbled  they neither sat nor offered observations on the weather  babbitt said colonel snow weve come from the good citizens league weve decided we want you to join vergil gunch says you dont care to but i think we can show you a new light the league is going to combine with the chamber of commerce in a campaign for the open shop so its time for you to put your name down  in his embarrassment babbitt could not recall his reasons for not wishing to join the league if indeed he had ever definitely known them but he was passionately certain that he did not wish to join and at the thought of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even these princes of commerce  sorry colonel have to think it over a little he mumbled  mckelvey snarled that means youre not going to join george  something black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from babbitt now you look here charley im damned if im going to be bullied into joining anything not even by you plutes  were not bullying anybody dr dilling began but colonel snow thrust him aside with certainly we are we dont mind a little bullying if its necessary babbitt the gcl has been talking about you a good deal youre supposed to be a sensible clean responsible man you always have been but here lately for god knows what reason i hear from all sorts of sources that youre running around with a loose crowd and whats a whole lot worse youve actually been advocating and supporting some of the most dangerous elements in town like this fellow doane  colonel that strikes me as my private business  possibly but we want to have an understanding youve stood in you and your fatherinlaw with some of the most substantial and forwardlooking interests in town like my friends of the street traction company and my papers have given you a lot of boosts well you cant expect the decent citizens to go on aiding you if you intend to side with precisely the people who are trying to undermine us  babbitt was frightened but he had an agonized instinct that if he yielded in this he would yield in everything he protested  youre exaggerating colonel i believe in being broadminded and liberal but of course im just as much agin the cranks and blatherskites and labor unions and so on as you are but fact is i belong to so many organizations now that i cant do em justice and i want to think it over before i decide about coming into the gcl  colonel snow condescended oh no im not exaggerating why the doctor here heard you cussing out and defaming one of the finest types of republican congressmen just this noon and you have entirely the wrong idea about thinking over joining were not begging you to join the gclwere permitting you to join im not sure my boy but what if you put it off itll be too late im not sure well want you then better think quickbetter think quick  the three vigilantes formidable in their righteousness stared at him in a taut silence babbitt waited through he thought nothing at all he merely waited while in his echoing head buzzed i dont want to joini dont want to joini dont want to  all right sorry for you said colonel snow and the three men abruptly turned their beefy backs   iv  as babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw vergil gunch coming down the block he raised his hand in salutation but gunch ignored it and crossed the street he was certain that gunch had seen him he drove home in sharp discomfort  his wife attacked at once georgie dear muriel frink was in this afternoon and she says that chum says the committee of this good citizens league especially asked you to join and you wouldnt dont you think it would be better you know all the nicest people belong and the league stands for  i know what the league stands for it stands for the suppression of free speech and free thought and everything else i dont propose to be bullied and rushed into joining anything and it isnt a question of whether its a good league or a bad league or what the hell kind of a league it is its just a question of my refusing to be told i got to  but dear if you dont join people might criticize you  let em criticize  but i mean nice people  rats imatter of fact this whole league is just a fad its like all these other organizations that start off with such a rush and let on theyre going to change the whole works and pretty soon they peter out and everybody forgets all about em  but if its the fad now dont you think you  no i dont oh myra please quit nagging me about it im sick of hearing about the confounded gcl i almost wish id joined it when verg first came around and got it over and maybe id ve come in today if the committee hadnt tried to bullyrag me but by god as long as im a freeborn independent american cit  now george youre talking exactly like the german furnaceman  oh i am am i then i wont talk at all  he longed that evening to see tanis judique to be strengthened by her sympathy when all the family were upstairs he got as far as telephoning to her apartmenthouse but he was agitated about it and when the janitor answered he blurted nev mindill call later and hung up the receiver   v  if babbitt had not been certain about vergil gunchs avoiding him there could be little doubt about william washington eathorne next morning when babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook eathornes car with the great banker sitting in anemic solemnity behind his chauffeur babbitt waved and cried mornin eathorne looked at him deliberately hesitated and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct cut  babbitts partner and fatherinlaw came in at ten  george whats this i hear about some song and dance you gave colonel snow about not wanting to join the gcl what the dickens you trying to do wreck the firm you dont suppose these big guns will stand your bucking them and springing all this liberal poppycock you been getting off lately do you  oh rats henry t you been reading bum fiction there aint any such a thing as these plots to keep folks from being liberal this is a free country a man can do anything he wants to  course th aint any plots who said they was only if folks get an idea youre scatterbrained and unstable you dont suppose theyll want to do business with you do you one little rumor about your being a crank would do more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff that these fool storywriters could think up in a month of sundays  that afternoon when the old reliable conrad lyte the merry miser conrad lyte appeared and babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land in the new residential section of dorchester lyte said hastily too hastily no no dont want to go into anything new just now  a week later babbitt learned through henry thompson that the officials of the street traction company were planning another realestate coup and that sanders torrey and wing not the babbittthompson company were to handle it for them i figure that jake offutt is kind of leery about the way folks are talking about you of course jake is a rockribbed old diehard and he probably advised the traction fellows to get some other broker george you got to do something trembled thompson  and in a rush babbitt agreed all nonsense the way people misjudged him but stillhe determined to join the good citizens league the next time he was asked and in furious resignation he waited he wasnt asked they ignored him he did not have the courage to go to the league and beg in and he took refuge in a shaky boast that he had gotten away with bucking the whole city nobody could dictate to him how he was going to think and act  he was jarred as by nothing else when the paragon of stenographers miss mcgoun suddenly left him though her reasons were excellentshe needed a rest her sister was sick she might not do any more work for six months he was uncomfortable with her successor miss havstad what miss havstads given name was no one in the office ever knew it seemed improbable that she had a given name a lover a powderpuff or a digestion she was so impersonal this slight pale industrious swede that it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat hash she was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine and she ought each evening to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her tooslim toofrail pencil points she took dictation swiftly her typing was perfect but babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with her she made him feel puffy and at his bestbeloved daily jokes she looked gently inquiring he longed for miss mcgouns return and thought of writing to her  then he heard that miss mcgoun had a week after leaving him gone over to his dangerous competitors sanders torrey and wing  he was not merely annoyed he was frightened why did she quit then he worried did she have a hunch my business is going on the rocks and it was sanders got the street traction deal ratssinking ship  gray fear loomed always by him now he watched fritz weilinger the young salesman and wondered if he too would leave daily he fancied slights he noted that he was not asked to speak at the annual chamber of commerce dinner when orville jones gave a large poker party and he was not invited he was certain that he had been snubbed he was afraid to go to lunch at the athletic club and afraid not to go he believed that he was spied on that when he left the table they whispered about him everywhere he heard the rustling whispers in the offices of clients in the bank when he made a deposit in his own office in his own home interminably he wondered what they were saying of him all day long in imaginary conversations he caught them marveling babbitt why say hes a regular anarchist you got to admire the fellow for his nerve the way he turned liberal and by golly just absolutely runs his life to suit himself but say hes dangerous thats what he is and hes got to be shown up  he was so twitchy that when he rounded a corner and chanced on two acquaintances talkingwhisperinghis heart leaped and he stalked by like an embarrassed schoolboy when he saw his neighbors howard littlefield and orville jones together he peered at them went indoors to escape their spying and was miserably certain that they had been whisperingplottingwhispering  through all his fear ran defiance he felt stubborn sometimes he decided that he had been a very devil of a fellow as bold as seneca doane sometimes he planned to call on doane and tell him what a revolutionist he was and never got beyond the planning but just as often when he heard the soft whispers enveloping him he wailed good lord what have i done just played with the bunch and called down clarence drum about being such a highandmighty sodger never catch me criticizing people and trying to make them accept my ideas  he could not stand the strain before long he admitted that he would like to flee back to the security of conformity provided there was a decent and creditable way to return but stubbornly he would not be forced back he would not he swore eat dirt  only in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears rise to the surface she complained that he seemed nervous that she couldnt understand why he did not want to drop in at the littlefields for the evening he tried but he could not express to her the nebulous facts of his rebellion and punishment and with paul and tanis lost he had no one to whom he could talk good lord tinka is the only real friend i have these days he sighed and he clung to the child played floorgames with her all evening  he considered going to see paul in prison but though he had a pale curt note from him every week he thought of paul as dead it was tanis for whom he was longing  i thought i was so smart and independent cutting tanis out and i need her lord how i need her he raged myra simply cant understand all she sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks but tanis shed tell me i was all right  then he broke and one evening late he did run to tanis he had not dared to hope for it but she was in and alone only she wasnt tanis she was a courteous browlifting icearmored woman who looked like tanis she said yes george what is it in even and uninterested tones and he crept away whipped  his first comfort was from ted and eunice littlefield  they danced in one evening when ted was home from the university and ted chuckled whats this i hear from euny dad she says her dad says you raised cain by boosting old seneca doane hot dog give em fits stir em up this old burg is asleep eunice plumped down on babbitts lap kissed him nestled her bobbed hair against his chin and crowed i think youre lots nicer than howard why is it confidentially that howard is such an old grouch the man has a good heart and honestly hes awfully bright but he never will learn to step on the gas after all the training ive given him dont you think we could do something with him dearest  why eunice that isnt a nice way to speak of your papa babbitt observed in the best floral heights manner but he was happy for the first time in weeks he pictured himself as the veteran liberal strengthened by the loyalty of the young generation they went out to rifle the icebox babbitt gloated if your mother caught us at this wed certainly get our comeuppance and eunice became maternal scrambled a terrifying number of eggs for them kissed babbitt on the ear and in the voice of a brooding abbess marveled it beats the devil why feminists like me still go on nursing these men  thus stimulated babbitt was reckless when he encountered sheldon smeeth educational director of the ymca and choirleader of the chatham road church with one of his damp hands smeeth imprisoned babbitts thick paw while he chanted brother babbitt we havent seen you at church very often lately i know youre busy with a multitude of details but you mustnt forget your dear friends at the old church home  babbitt shook off the affectionate claspsheldy liked to hold hands for a long timeand snarled well i guess you fellows can run the show without me sorry smeeth got to beat it gday  but afterward he winced if that white worm had the nerve to try to drag me back to the old church home then the holy outfit must have been doing a lot of talking about me too  he heard them whisperingwhisperingdr john jennison drew cholmondeley frink even william washington eathorne the independence seeped out of him and he walked the streets alone afraid of mens cynical eyes and the incessant hiss of whispering     chapter xxxiii  i  he tried to explain to his wife as they prepared for bed how objectionable was sheldon smeeth but all her answer was he has such a beautiful voiceso spiritual i dont think you ought to speak of him like that just because you cant appreciate music he saw her then as a stranger he stared bleakly at this plump and fussy woman with the broad bare arms and wondered how she had ever come here  in his chilly cot turning from aching side to side he pondered of tanis hed been a fool to lose her he had to have somebody he could really talk to hedoh hed bust if he went on stewing about things by himself and myra useless to expect her to understand well rats no use dodging the issue darn shame for two married people to drift apart after all these years darn rotten shame but nothing could bring them together now as long as he refused to let zenith bully him into taking ordersand he was by golly not going to let anybody bully him into anything or wheedle him or coax him either  he woke at three roused by a passing motor and struggled out of bed for a drink of water as he passed through the bedroom he heard his wife groan his resentment was nightblurred he was solicitous in inquiring whats the trouble hon  ive gotsuch a pain down here in my sideoh its justit tears at me  bad indigestion shall i get you some bicarb  dont thinkthat would help i felt funny last evening and yesterday and thenohit passed away and i got to sleep andthat auto woke me up  her voice was laboring like a ship in a storm he was alarmed  i better call the doctor  no no itll go away but maybe you might get me an icebag  he stalked to the bathroom for the icebag down to the kitchen for ice he felt dramatic in this latenight expedition but as he gouged the chunk of ice with the daggerlike pick he was cool steady mature and the old friendliness was in his voice as he patted the icebag into place on her groin rumbling there there thatll be better now he retired to bed but he did not sleep he heard her groan again instantly he was up soothing her still pretty bad honey  yes it just gripes me and i cant get to sleep  her voice was faint he knew her dread of doctors verdicts and he did not inform her but he creaked downstairs telephoned to dr earl patten and waited shivering trying with fuzzy eyes to read a magazine till he heard the doctors car  the doctor was youngish and professionally breezy he came in as though it were sunny noontime well george little trouble eh how is she now he said busily as with tremendous and rather irritating cheerfulness he tossed his coat on a chair and warmed his hands at a radiator he took charge of the house babbitt felt ousted and unimportant as he followed the doctor up to the bedroom and it was the doctor who chuckled oh just little stomachache when verona peeped through her door begging what is it dad what is it  to mrs babbitt the doctor said with amiable belligerence after his examination kind of a bad old pain eh ill give you something to make you sleep and i think youll feel better in the morning ill come in right after breakfast but to babbitt lying in wait in the lower hall the doctor sighed i dont like the feeling there in her belly theres some rigidity and some inflammation shes never had her appendix out has she um well no use worrying ill be here first thing in the morning and meantime shell get some rest ive given her a hypo good night  then was babbitt caught up in the black tempest  instantly all the indignations which had been dominating him and the spiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd before the ancient and overwhelming realities the standard and traditional realities of sickness and menacing death the long night and the thousand steadfast implications of married life he crept back to her as she drowsed away in the tropic languor of morphia he sat on the edge of her bed holding her hand and for the first time in many weeks her hand abode trustfully in his  he draped himself grotesquely in his toweling bathrobe and a pink and white couchcover and sat lumpishly in a wingchair the bedroom was uncanny in its halflight which turned the curtains to lurking robbers the dressingtable to a turreted castle it smelled of cosmetics of linen of sleep he napped and woke napped and woke a hundred times he heard her move and sigh in slumber he wondered if there wasnt some officious brisk thing he could do for her and before he could quite form the thought he was asleep racked and aching the night was infinite when dawn came and the waiting seemed at an end he fell asleep and was vexed to have been caught off his guard to have been aroused by veronas entrance and her agitated oh what is it dad  his wife was awake her face sallow and lifeless in the morning light but now he did not compare her with tanis she was not merely a woman to be contrasted with other women but his own self and though he might criticize her and nag her it was only as he might criticize and nag himself interestedly unpatronizingly without the expectation of changingor any real desire to changethe eternal essence  with verona he sounded fatherly again and firm he consoled tinka who satisfactorily pointed the excitement of the hour by wailing he ordered early breakfast and wanted to look at the newspaper and felt somehow heroic and useful in not looking at it but there were still crawling and totally unheroic hours of waiting before dr patten returned  dont see much change said patten ill be back about eleven and if you dont mind i think ill bring in some other worldfamous pillpedler for consultation just to be on the safe side now george theres nothing you can do ill have verona keep the icebag filledmight as well leave that on i guessand you you better beat it to the office instead of standing around her looking as if you were the patient the nerve of husbands lot more neurotic than the women they always have to horn in and get all the credit for feeling bad when their wives are ailing now have another nice cup of coffee and git  under this derision babbitt became more matteroffact he drove to the office tried to dictate letters tried to telephone and before the call was answered forgot to whom he was telephoning at a quarter after ten he returned home as he left the downtown traffic and sped up the car his face was as grimly creased as the mask of tragedy  his wife greeted him with surprise why did you come back dear i think i feel a little better i told verona to skip off to her office was it wicked of me to go and get sick  he knew that she wanted petting and she got it joyously they were curiously happy when he heard dr pattens car in front he looked out of the window he was frightened with patten was an impatient man with turbulent black hair and a hussar mustachedr a i dilling the surgeon babbitt sputtered with anxiety tried to conceal it and hurried down to the door  dr patten was profusely casual dont want to worry you old man but i thought it might be a good stunt to have dr dilling examine her he gestured toward dilling as toward a master  dilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode upstairs babbitt tramped the livingroom in agony except for his wifes confinements there had never been a major operation in the family and to him surgery was at once a miracle and an abomination of fear but when dilling and patten came down again he knew that everything was all right and he wanted to laugh for the two doctors were exactly like the bearded physicians in a musical comedy both of them rubbing their hands and looking foolishly sagacious  dr dilling spoke  im sorry old man but its acute appendicitis we ought to operate of course you must decide but theres no question as to what has to be done  babbitt did not get all the force of it he mumbled well i suppose we could get her ready in a couple o days probably ted ought to come down from the university just in case anything happened  dr dilling growled nope if you dont want peritonitis to set in well have to operate right away i must advise it strongly if you say go ahead ill phone for the st marys ambulance at once and well have her on the table in threequarters of an hour  ii of course i suppose you know whatbut great god man i cant get her clothes ready and everything in two seconds you know and in her state so wroughtup and weak  just throw her hairbrush and comb and toothbrush in a bag thats all shell need for a day or two said dr dilling and went to the telephone  babbitt galloped desperately upstairs he sent the frightened tinka out of the room he said gaily to his wife well old thing the doc thinks maybe we better have a little operation and get it over just take a few minutesnot half as serious as a confinementand youll be all right in a jiffy  she gripped his hand till the fingers ached she said patiently like a cowed child im afraidto go into the dark all alone maturity was wiped from her eyes they were pleading and terrified will you stay with me darling you dont have to go to the office now do you could you just go down to the hospital with me could you come see me this eveningif everythings all right you wont have to go out this evening will you  he was on his knees by the bed while she feebly ruffled his hair he sobbed he kissed the lawn of her sleeve and swore old honey i love you more than anything in the world ive kind of been worried by business and everything but thats all over now and im back again  are you really george i was thinking lying here maybe it would be a good thing if i just went i was wondering if anybody really needed me or wanted me i was wondering what was the use of my living ive been getting so stupid and ugly  why you old humbug fishing for compliments when i ought to be packing your bag me sure im young and handsome and a regular village cutup and he could not go on he sobbed again and in muttered incoherencies they found each other  as he packed his brain was curiously clear and swift hed have no more wild evenings he realized he admitted that he would regret them a little grimly he perceived that this had been his last despairing fling before the paralyzed contentment of middleage well and he grinned impishly it was one doggone good party while it lasted andhow much was the operation going to cost i ought to have fought that out with dilling but no damn it i dont care how much it costs  the motor ambulance was at the door even in his grief the babbitt who admired all technical excellences was interested in the kindly skill with which the attendants slid mrs babbitt upon a stretcher and carried her downstairs the ambulance was a huge suave varnished white thing mrs babbitt moaned it frightens me its just like a hearse just like being put in a hearse i want you to stay with me  ill be right up front with the driver babbitt promised  no i want you to stay inside with me to the attendants cant he be inside  sure maam you bet theres a fine little campstool in there the older attendant said with professional pride  he sat beside her in that traveling cabin with its cot its stool its active little electric radiator and its quite unexplained calendar displaying a girl eating cherries and the name of an enterprising grocer but as he flung out his hand in hopeless cheerfulness it touched the radiator and he squealed  ouch jesus  why george babbitt i wont have you cursing and swearing and blaspheming  i know awful sorry butgosh all fishhooks look how i burned my hand gee whiz it hurts it hurts like the mischief why that damn radiator is hot asits hot asits hotter n the hinges of hades look you can see the mark  so as they drove up to st marys hospital with the nurses already laying out the instruments for an operation to save her life it was she who consoled him and kissed the place to make it well and though he tried to be gruff and mature he yielded to her and was glad to be babied  the ambulance whirled under the hooded carriageentrance of the hospital and instantly he was reduced to a zero in the nightmare succession of corkfloored halls endless doors open on old women sitting up in bed an elevator the anesthetizing room a young interne contemptuous of husbands he was permitted to kiss his wife he saw a thin dark nurse fit the cone over her mouth and nose he stiffened at a sweet and treacherous odor then he was driven out and on a high stool in a laboratory he sat dazed longing to see her once again to insist that he had always loved her had never for a second loved anybody else or looked at anybody else in the laboratory he was conscious only of a decayed object preserved in a bottle of yellowing alcohol it made him very sick but he could not take his eyes from it he was more aware of it than of waiting his mind floated in abeyance coming back always to that horrible bottle to escape it he opened the door to the right hoping to find a sane and businesslike office he realized that he was looking into the operatingroom in one glance he took in dr dilling strange in white gown and bandaged head bending over the steel table with its screws and wheels then nurses holding basins and cotton sponges and a swathed thing just a lifeless chin and a mound of white in the midst of which was a square of sallow flesh with a gash a little bloody at the edges protruding from the gash a cluster of forceps like clinging parasites  he shut the door with haste it may be that his frightened repentance of the night and morning had not eaten in but this dehumanizing interment of her who had been so pathetically human shook him utterly and as he crouched again on the high stool in the laboratory he swore faith to his wife    to zenith    to business efficiency    to the boosters club    to every faith of the clan of good fellows  then a nurse was soothing all over perfect success shell come out fine shell be out from under the anesthetic soon and you can see her  he found her on a curious tilted bed her face an unwholesome yellow but her purple lips moving slightly then only did he really believe that she was alive she was muttering he bent and heard her sighing hard get real maple syrup for pancakes he laughed inexhaustibly he beamed on the nurse and proudly confided think of her talking about maple syrup by golly im going to go and order a hundred gallons of it right from vermont   ii  she was out of the hospital in seventeen days he went to see her each afternoon and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy once he hinted something of his relations to tanis and the bunch and she was inflated by the view that a wicked woman had captivated her poor george  if once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the good fellows he was convinced now you didnt he noted see seneca doane coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the missus but mrs howard littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine jelly flavored with real wine orville jones spent hours in picking out the kind of novels mrs babbitt likednice love stories about new york millionaries and wyoming cowpunchers louetta swanson knitted a pink bedjacket sidney finkelstein and his merry browneyed flapper of a wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of parcher and stein  all his friends ceased whispering about him suspecting him at the athletic club they asked after her daily club members whose names he did not know stopped him to inquire hows your good lady getting on babbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich warm air of a valley pleasant with cottages  one noon vergil gunch suggested you planning to be at the hospital about six the wife and i thought wed drop in they did drop in gunch was so humorous that mrs babbitt said he must stop making her laugh because honestly it was hurting her incision as they passed down the hall gunch demanded amiably george old scout you were soreheaded about something here a while back i dont know why and its none of my business but you seem to be feeling all hunkydory again and why dont you come join us in the good citizens league old man we have some corking times together and we need your advice  then did babbitt almost tearful with joy at being coaxed instead of bullied at being permitted to stop fighting at being able to desert without injuring his opinion of himself cease utterly to be a domestic revolutionist he patted gunchs shoulder and next day he became a member of the good citizens league  within two weeks no one in the league was more violent regarding the wickedness of seneca doane the crimes of labor unions the perils of immigration and the delights of golf morality and bankaccounts than was george f babbitt     chapter xxxiv  i  the good citizens league had spread through the country but nowhere was it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of zenith commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants most of whichthough not alllay inland against a background of cornfields and mines and of small towns which depended upon them for mortgageloans tablemanners art social philosophy and millinery  to the league belonged most of the prosperous citizens of zenith they were not all of the kind who called themselves regular guys besides these hearty fellows these salesmen of prosperity there were the aristocrats that is the men who were richer or had been rich for more generations the presidents of banks and of factories the landowners the corporation lawyers the fashionable doctors and the few youngold men who worked not at all but reluctantly remaining in zenith collected lusterware and first editions as though they were back in paris all of them agreed that the workingclasses must be kept in their place and all of them perceived that american democracy did not imply any equality of wealth but did demand a wholesome sameness of thought dress painting morals and vocabulary  in this they were like the rulingclass of any other country particularly of great britain but they differed in being more vigorous and in actually trying to produce the accepted standards which all classes everywhere desire but usually despair of realizing  the longest struggle of the good citizens league was against the open shopwhich was secretly a struggle against all union labor accompanying it was an americanization movement with evening classes in english and history and economics and daily articles in the newspapers so that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the trueblue and one hundred per cent american way of settling labortroubles was for workmen to trust and love their employers  the league was more than generous in approving other organizations which agreed with its aims it helped the ym ca to raise a twohundredthousanddollar fund for a new building babbitt vergil gunch sidney finkelstein and even charles mckelvey told the spectators at movie theaters how great an influence for manly christianity the good old y had been in their own lives and the hoar and mighty colonel rutherford snow owner of the advocatetimes was photographed clasping the hand of sheldon smeeth of the ymca it is true that afterward when smeeth lisped you must come to one of our prayermeetings the ferocious colonel bellowed what the hell would i do that for ive got a bar of my own but this did not appear in the public prints  the league was of value to the american legion at a time when certain of the lesser and looser newspapers were criticizing that organization of veterans of the great war one evening a number of young men raided the zenith socialist headquarters burned its records beat the office staff and agreeably dumped desks out of the window all of the newspapers save the advocatetimes and the evening advocate attributed this valuable but perhaps hasty directaction to the american legion then a flying squadron from the good citizens league called on the unfair papers and explained that no exsoldier could possibly do such a thing and the editors saw the light and retained their advertising when zeniths lone conscientious objector came home from prison and was righteously run out of town the newspapers referred to the perpetrators as an unidentified mob   ii  in all the activities and triumphs of the good citizens league babbitt took part and completely won back to selfrespect placidity and the affection of his friends but he began to protest gosh ive done my share in cleaning up the city i want to tend to business think ill just kind of slacken up on this gcl stuff now  he had returned to the church as he had returned to the boosters club he had even endured the lavish greeting which sheldon smeeth gave him he was worried lest during his late discontent he had imperiled his salvation he was not quite sure there was a heaven to be attained but dr john jennison drew said there was and babbitt was not going to take a chance  one evening when he was walking past dr drews parsonage he impulsively went in and found the pastor in his study  jus minutegetting phone call said dr drew in businesslike tones then aggressively to the telephone lolo this berkey and hannis reverend drew speaking where the dickens is the proof for next sundays calendar huh y ought to have it here well i cant help it if theyre all sick i got to have it tonight get an adt boy and shoot it up here quick  he turned without slackening his briskness well brother babbitt what cn i do for you  i just wanted to asktell you how it is dominie here a while ago i guess i got kind of slack took a few drinks and so on what i wanted to ask is how is it if a fellow cuts that all out and comes back to his senses does it sort of well you might say does it score against him in the long run  the reverend dr drew was suddenly interested and uh brotherthe other things too women  no practically you might say practically not at all  dont hesitate to tell me brother thats what im here for been going on joyrides squeezing girls in cars the reverend eyes glistened  nono  well ill tell you ive got a deputation from the dont make prohibition a joke association coming to see me in a quarter of an hour and one from the antibirthcontrol union at a quarter of ten he busily glanced at his watch but i can take five minutes off and pray with you kneel right down by your chair brother dont be ashamed to seek the guidance of god  babbitts scalp itched and he longed to flee but dr drew had already flopped down beside his deskchair and his voice had changed from rasping efficiency to an unctuous familiarity with sin and with the almighty babbitt also knelt while drew gloated  o lord thou seest our brother here who has been led astray by manifold temptations o heavenly father make his heart to be pure as pure as a little childs oh let him know again the joy of a manly courage to abstain from evil  sheldon smeeth came frolicking into the study at the sight of the two men he smirked forgivingly patted babbitt on the shoulder and knelt beside him his arm about him while he authorized dr drews imprecations with moans of yes lord help our brother lord  though he was trying to keep his eyes closed babbitt squinted between his fingers and saw the pastor glance at his watch as he concluded with a triumphant and let him never be afraid to come to us for counsel and tender care and let him know that the church can lead him as a little lamb  dr drew sprang up rolled his eyes in the general direction of heaven chucked his watch into his pocket and demanded has the deputation come yet sheldy  yep right outside sheldy answered with equal liveliness then caressingly to babbitt brother if it would help id love to go into the next room and pray with you while dr drew is receiving the brothers from the dont make prohibition a joke association  nono thankscant take the time yelped babbitt rushing toward the door  thereafter he was often seen at the chatham road presbyterian church but it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the door   iii  if his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he was not quite dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the good citizens league nor quite appreciative of the church yet there was no doubt of the joy with which babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of the athletic club the boosters the elks  verona and kenneth escott were eventually and hesitatingly married for the wedding babbitt was dressed as carefully as was verona he was crammed into the morningcoat he wore to teas thrice a year and with a certain relief after verona and kenneth had driven away in a limousine he returned to the house removed the morning coat sat with his aching feet up on the davenport and reflected that his wife and he could have the livingroom to themselves now and not have to listen to verona and kenneth worrying in a cultured collegiate manner about minimum wages and the drama league  but even this sinking into peace was less consoling than his return to being one of the bestloved men in the boosters club   iv  president willis ijams began that boosters club luncheon by standing quiet and staring at them so unhappily that they feared he was about to announce the death of a brother booster he spoke slowly then and gravely  boys i have something shocking to reveal to you something terrible about one of our own members  several boosters including babbitt looked disconcerted  a knight of the grip a trusted friend of mine recently made a trip upstate and in a certain town where a certain booster spent his boyhood he found out something which can no longer be concealed in fact he discovered the inward nature of a man whom we have accepted as a real guy and as one of us gentlemen i cannot trust my voice to say it so i have written it down  he uncovered a large blackboard and on it in huge capitals was the legend  george follansbee babbittoh you folly  the boosters cheered they laughed they wept they threw rolls at babbitt they cried speech speech oh you folly  president ijams continued  that gentlemen is the awful thing georgie babbitt has been concealing all these years when we thought he was just plain george f now i want you to tell us taking it in turn what youve always supposed the f stood for  flivver they suggested and frogface and flathead and farinaceous and freezone and flapdoodle and foghorn by the joviality of their insults babbitt knew that he had been taken back to their hearts and happily he rose  boys ive got to admit it ive never worn a wristwatch or parted my name in the middle but i will confess to follansbee my only justification is that my old dadthough otherwise he was perfectly sane and packed an awful wallop when it came to trimming the city fellers at checkersnamed me after the family doc old dr ambrose follansbee i apologize boys in my next whatdyoucallit ill see to it that i get named something really practicalsomething that sounds swell and yet is good and virilesomething in fact like that grand old name so familiar to every householdthat bold and almost overpowering name willis jimjams ijams  he knew by the cheer that he was secure again and popular he knew that he would no more endanger his security and popularity by straying from the clan of good fellows   v  henry thompson dashed into the office clamoring george big news jake offutt says the traction bunch are dissatisfied with the way sanders torrey and wing handled their last deal and theyre willing to dicker with us  babbitt was pleased in the realization that the last scar of his rebellion was healed yet as he drove home he was annoyed by such background thoughts as had never weakened him in his days of belligerent conformity he discovered that he actually did not consider the traction group quite honest well hed carry out one more deal for them but as soon as it was practicable maybe as soon as old henry thompson died hed break away from all association from them he was fortyeight in twelve years hed be sixty he wanted to leave a clean business to his grandchildren course there was a lot of money in negotiating for the traction people and a fellow had to look at things in a practical way only he wriggled uncomfortably he wanted to tell the traction group what he thought of them oh he couldnt do it not now if he offended them this second time they would crush him but  he was conscious that his line of progress seemed confused he wondered what he would do with his future he was still young was he through with all adventuring he felt that he had been trapped into the very net from which he had with such fury escaped and supremest jest of all been made to rejoice in the trapping  theyve licked me licked me to a finish he whimpered  the house was peaceful that evening and he enjoyed a game of pinochle with his wife he indignantly told the tempter that he was content to do things in the good old fashioned way the day after he went to see the purchasingagent of the street traction company and they made plans for the secret purchase of lots along the evanston road but as he drove to his office he struggled im going to run things and figure out things to suit myselfwhen i retire   vi  ted had come down from the university for the weekend though he no longer spoke of mechanical engineering and though he was reticent about his opinion of his instructors he seemed no more reconciled to college and his chief interest was his wireless telephone set  on saturday evening he took eunice littlefield to a dance at devon woods babbitt had a glimpse of her bouncing in the seat of the car brilliant in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk they two had not returned when the babbitts went to bed at halfpast eleven at a blurred indefinite time of late night babbitt was awakened by the ring of the telephone and gloomily crawled downstairs howard littlefield was speaking  george euny isnt back yet is ted  noat least his door is open  they ought to be home eunice said the dance would be over at midnight whats the name of those people where theyre going  why gosh tell the truth i dont know howard its some classmate of teds out in devon woods dont see what we can do wait ill skip up and ask myra if she knows their name  babbitt turned on the light in teds room it was a brown boyish room disordered dresser worn books a highschool pennant photographs of basketball teams and baseball teams ted was decidedly not there  mrs babbitt awakened irritably observed that she certainly did not know the name of teds host that it was late that howard littlefield was but little better than a born fool and that she was sleepy but she remained awake and worrying while babbitt on the sleepingporch struggled back into sleep through the incessant soft rain of her remarks it was after dawn when he was aroused by her shaking him and calling george george in something like horror  whawhawhat is it  come here quick and see be quiet  she led him down the hall to the door of teds room and pushed it gently open on the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rosecolored chiffon lingerie on the sedate morris chair a girls silver slipper and on the pillows were two sleepy headsteds and eunices  ted woke to grin and to mutter with unconvincing defiance good morning let me introduce my wifemrs theodore roosevelt eunice littlefield babbitt esquiress  good god from babbitt and from his wife a long wailing youve gone and  we got married last evening wife sit up and say a pretty good morning to motherinlaw  but eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the pillow  by nine oclock the assembly which was gathered about ted and eunice in the livingroom included mr and mrs george babbitt dr and mrs howard littlefield mr and mrs kenneth escott mr and mrs henry t thompson and tinka babbitt who was the only pleased member of the inquisition  a crackling shower of phrases filled the room  at their age ought to be annulled never heard of such a thing in fault of both of them and keep it out of the papers ought to be packed off to school do something about it at once and what i say is damn good oldfashioned spanking  worst of them all was verona ted some way must be found to make you understand how dreadfully serious this is instead of standing around with that silly foolish smile on your face  he began to revolt gee whittakers rone you got married yourself didnt you  thats entirely different  you bet it is they didnt have to work on eu and me with a chain and tackle to get us to hold hands  now young man well have no more flippancy old henry thompson ordered you listen to me  you listen to grandfather said verona  yes listen to your grandfather said mrs babbitt  ted you listen to mr thompson said howard littlefield  oh for the love o mike i am listening ted shouted but you look here all of you im getting sick and tired of being the corpse in this post mortem if you want to kill somebody go kill the preacher that married us why he stung me five dollars and all the money i had in the world was six dollars and two bits im getting just about enough of being hollered at  a new voice booming authoritative dominated the room it was babbitt yuh theres too darn many putting in their oar rone you dry up howard and i are still pretty strong and able to do our own cussing ted come into the diningroom and well talk this over  in the diningroom the door firmly closed babbitt walked to his son put both hands on his shoulders youre more or less right they all talk too much now what do you plan to do old man  gosh dad are you really going to be human  well iremember one time you called us the babbitt men and said we ought to stick together i want to i dont pretend to think this isnt serious the way the cards are stacked against a young fellow today i cant say i approve of early marriages but you couldnt have married a better girl than eunice and way i figure it littlefield is darn lucky to get a babbitt

some day but me i want to get into mechanics i think id get to be a good inventor theres a fellow that would give me twenty dollars a week in a factory right now  well babbitt crossed the floor slowly ponderously seeming a little old ive always wanted you to have a college degree he meditatively stamped across the floor again but ive nevernow for heavens sake dont repeat this to your mother or shed remove what little hair ive got left but practically ive never done a single thing ive wanted to in my whole life i dont know s ive accomplished anything except just get along i figure out ive made about a quarter of an inch out of a possible hundred rods well maybe youll carry things on further i dont know but i do get a kind of sneaking pleasure out of the fact that you knew what you wanted to

zenith nor of yourself the way ive been go ahead old man the world is yours  arms about each others shoulders the babbitt men marched into the livingroom and faced the swooping family
