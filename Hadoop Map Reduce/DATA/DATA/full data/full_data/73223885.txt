and other matters  it was a warm goldencloudy lovable afternoon in the big livingroom at ingleside susan baker sat down with a certain grim satisfaction hovering about her like an aura it was four oclock and susan who had been working incessantly since six that morning felt that she had fairly earned an hour of repose and gossip susan just then was perfectly happy everything had gone almost uncannily well in the kitchen that day dr jekyll had not been mr hyde and so had not grated on her nerves from where she sat she could see the pride of her heartthe bed of peonies of her own planting and culture blooming as no other peony plot in glen st mary ever did or could bloom with peonies crimson peonies silvery pink peonies white as drifts of winter snow  susan had on a new black silk blouse quite as elaborate as anything mrs marshall elliott ever wore and a white starched apron trimmed with complicated crocheted lace fully five inches wide not to mention insertion to match therefore susan had all the comfortable consciousness of a welldressed woman as she opened her copy of the daily enterprise and prepared to read the glen notes which as miss cornelia had just informed her filled half a column of it and mentioned almost everybody at ingleside there was a big black headline on the front page of the enterprise stating that some archduke ferdinand or other had been assassinated at a place bearing the weird name of sarajevo but susan tarried not over uninteresting immaterial stuff like that she was in quest of something really vital oh here it wasjottings from glen st mary susan settled down keenly reading each one over aloud to extract all possible gratification from it  mrs blythe and her visitor miss corneliaalias mrs marshall elliottwere chatting together near the open door that led to the veranda through which a cool delicious breeze was blowing bringing whiffs of phantom perfume from the garden and charming gay echoes from the vinehung corner where rilla and miss oliver and walter were laughing and talking wherever rilla blythe was there was laughter  there was another occupant of the livingroom curled up on a couch who must not be overlooked since he was a creature of marked individuality and moreover had the distinction of being the only living thing whom susan really hated  all cats are mysterious but dr jekyllandmr hydedoc for shortwas trebly so he was a cat of double personalityor else as susan vowed he was possessed by the devil to begin with there had been something uncanny about the very dawn of his existence four years previously rilla blythe had had a treasured darling of a kitten white as snow with a saucy black tip to its tail which she called jack frost susan disliked jack frost though she could not or would not give any valid reason therefor  take my word for it mrs dr dear she was wont to say ominously that cat will come to no good  but why do you think so mrs blythe would ask  i do not thinki know was all the answer susan would vouchsafe  with the rest of the ingleside folk jack frost was a favourite he was so very clean and well groomed and never allowed a spot or stain to be seen on his beautiful white suit he had endearing ways of purring and snuggling he was scrupulously honest  and then a domestic tragedy took place at ingleside jack frost had kittens  it would be vain to try to picture susans triumph had she not always insisted that that cat would turn out to be a delusion and a snare now they could see for themselves  rilla kept one of the kittens a very pretty one with peculiarly sleek glossy fur of a dark yellow crossed by orange stripes and large satiny golden ears she called it goldie and the name seemed appropriate enough to the little frolicsome creature which during its kittenhood gave no indication of the sinister nature it really possessed susan of course warned the family that no good could be expected from any offspring of that diabolical jack frost but susans cassandralike croakings were unheeded  the blythes had been so accustomed to regard jack frost as a member of the male sex that they could not get out of the habit so they continually used the masculine pronoun although the result was ludicrous visitors used to be quite electrified when rilla referred casually to jack and his kitten or told goldie sternly go to your mother and get him to wash your fur  it is not decent mrs dr dear poor susan would say bitterly she herself compromised by always referring to jack as it or the white beast and one heart at least did not ache when it was accidentally poisoned the following winter  in a years time goldie became so manifestly an inadequate name for the orange kitten that walter who was just then reading stevensons story changed it to dr jekyllandmr hyde in his dr jekyll mood the cat was a drowsy affectionate domestic cushionloving puss who liked petting and gloried in being nursed and patted especially did he love to lie on his back and have his sleek creamcoloured throat stroked gently while he purred in somnolent satisfaction he was a notable purrer never had there been an ingleside cat who purred so constantly and so ecstatically  the only thing i envy a cat is its purr remarked dr blythe once listening to docs resonant melody it is the most contented sound in the world  doc was very handsome his every movement was grace his poses magnificent when he folded his long duskyringed tail about his feet and sat him down on the veranda to gaze steadily into space for long intervals the blythes felt that an egyptian sphinx could not have made a more fitting deity of the portal  when the mr hyde mood came upon himwhich it invariably did before rain or windhe was a wild thing with changed eyes the transformation always came suddenly he would spring fiercely from a reverie with a savage snarl and bite at any restraining or caressing hand his fur seemed to grow darker and his eyes gleamed with a diabolical light there was really an unearthly beauty about him if the change happened in the twilight all the ingleside folk felt a certain terror of him at such times he was a fearsome beast and only rilla defended him asserting that he was such a nice prowly cat certainly he prowled  dr jekyll loved new milk mr hyde would not touch milk and growled over his meat dr jekyll came down the stairs so silently that no one could hear him mr hyde made his tread as heavy as a mans several evenings when susan was alone in the house he scared her stiff as she declared by doing this he would sit in the middle of the kitchen floor with his terrible eyes fixed unwinkingly upon hers for an hour at a time this played havoc with her nerves but poor susan really held him in too much awe to try to drive him out once she had dared to throw a stick at him and he had promptly made a savage leap towards her susan rushed out of doors and never attempted to meddle with mr hyde againthough she visited his misdeeds upon the innocent dr jekyll chasing him ignominiously out of her domain whenever he dared to poke his nose in and denying him certain savoury tidbits for which he yearned  the many friends of miss faith meredith gerald meredith and james blythe read susan rolling the names like sweet morsels under her tongue were very much pleased to welcome them home a few weeks ago from redmond college james blythe who was graduated in arts in 1913 had just completed his first year in medicine  faith meredith has really got to be the most handsomest creature i ever saw commented miss cornelia above her filet crochet its amazing how those children came on after rosemary west went to the manse people have almost forgotten what imps of mischief they were once anne dearie will you ever forget the way they used to carry on its really surprising how well rosemary got on with them shes more like a chum than a stepmother they all love her and una adores her as for that little bruce una just makes a perfect slave of herself to him of course he is a darling but did you ever see any child look as much like an aunt as he looks like his aunt ellen hes just as dark and just as emphatic i cant see a feature of rosemary in him norman douglas always vows at the top of his voice that the stork meant bruce for him and ellen and took him to the manse by mistake  bruce adores jem said mrs blythe when he comes over here he follows jem about silently like a faithful little dog looking up at him from under his black brows he would do anything for jem i verily believe  are jem and faith going to make a match of it  mrs blythe smiled it was well known that miss cornelia who had been such a virulent manhater at one time had actually taken to matchmaking in her declining years  they are only good friends yet miss cornelia  very good friends believe me said miss cornelia emphatically i hear all about the doings of the young fry  i have no doubt that mary vance sees that you do mrs marshall elliott said susan significantly but i think it is a shame to talk about children making matches  children jem is twentyone and faith is nineteen retorted miss cornelia you must not forget susan that we old folks are not the only grownup people in the world  outraged susan who detested any reference to her agenot from vanity but from a haunting dread that people might come to think her too old to workreturned to her notes  carl meredith and shirley blythe came home last friday evening from queens academy we understand that carl will be in charge of the school at harbour head next year and we are sure he will be a popular and successful teacher  he will teach the children all there is to know about bugs anyhow said miss cornelia he is through with queens now and mr meredith and rosemary wanted him to go right on to redmond in the fall but carl has a very independent streak in him and means to earn part of his own way through college hell be all the better for it  walter blythe who has been teaching for the past two years at lowbridge has resigned read susan he intends going to redmond this fall  is walter quite strong enough for redmond yet queried miss cornelia anxiously  we hope that he will be by the fall said mrs blythe an idle summer in the open air and sunshine will do a great deal for him  typhoid is a hard thing to get over said miss cornelia emphatically especially when one has had such a close shave as walter had i think hed do well to stay out of college another year but then hes so ambitious are di and nan going too  yes they both wanted to teach another year but gilbert thinks they had better go to redmond this fall  im glad of that theyll keep an eye on walter and see that he doesnt study too hard i suppose continued miss cornelia with a side glance at susan that after the snub i got a few minutes ago it will not be safe for me to suggest that jerry meredith is making sheeps eyes at nan  susan ignored this and mrs blythe laughed again  dear miss cornelia i have my hands full havent iwith all these boys and girls sweethearting around me if i took it seriously it would quite crush me but i dontit is too hard yet to realize that theyre grown up when i look at those two tall sons of mine i wonder if they can possibly be the fat sweet dimpled babies i kissed and cuddled and sang to slumber the other dayonly the other day miss cornelia wasnt jem the dearest baby in the old house of dreams and now hes a ba and accused of courting  were all growing older sighed miss cornelia  the only part of me that feels old said mrs blythe is the ankle i broke when josie pye dared me to walk the barry ridgepole in the green gables days i have an ache in it when the wind is east i wont admit that it is rheumatism but it does ache as for the children they and the merediths are planning a gay summer before they have to go back to studies in the fall they are such a funloving little crowd they keep this house in a perpetual whirl of merriment  is rilla going to queens when shirley goes back  it isnt decided yet i rather fancy not her father thinks she is not quite strong enoughshe has rather outgrown her strengthshes really absurdly tall for a girl not yet fifteen i am not anxious to have her gowhy it would be terrible not to have a single one of my babies home with me next winter susan and i would fall to fighting with each other to break the monotony  susan smiled at this pleasantry the idea of her fighting with mrs dr dear  does rilla herself want to go asked miss cornelia  no the truth is rilla is the only one of my flock who isnt ambitious i really wish she had a little more ambition she has no serious ideals at allher sole aspiration seems to be to have a good time  and why should she not have it mrs dr dear cried susan who could not bear to hear a single word against anyone of the ingleside folk even from one of themselves a young girl should have a good time and that i will maintain there will be time enough for her to think of latin and greek  i should like to see a little sense of responsibility in her susan and you know yourself that she is abominably vain  she has something to be vain about retorted susan she is the prettiest girl in glen st mary do you think that all those overharbour macallisters and crawfords and elliotts could scare up a skin like rillas in four generations they could not no mrs dr dear i know my place but i cannot allow you to run down rilla listen to this mrs marshall elliott  susan had found a chance to get square with miss cornelia for her digs at the childrens love affairs she read the item with gusto  miller douglas has decided not to go west he says old pei is good enough for him and he will continue to farm for his aunt mrs alec davis  susan looked keenly at miss cornelia  i have heard mrs marshall elliott that miller is courting mary vance  this shot pierced miss cornelias armour her sonsy face flushed  i wont have miller douglas hanging round mary she said crisply he comes of a low family his father was a sort of outcast from the douglasesthey never really counted him inand his mother was one of those terrible dillons from the harbour head  i think i have heard mrs marshall elliott that mary vances own parents were not what you could call aristocratic  mary vance has had a good bringing up and she is a smart clever capable girl retorted miss cornelia she is not going to throw herself away on miller douglas believe me she knows my opinion on the matter and mary has never disobeyed me yet  well i do not think you need worry mrs marshall elliott for mrs alec davis is as much against it as you could be and says no nephew of hers is ever going to marry a nameless nobody like mary vance  susan returned to her mutton feeling that she had got the best of it in this passage of arms and read another note  we are pleased to hear that miss oliver has been engaged as teacher for another year miss oliver will spend her wellearned vacation at her home in lowbridge  im so glad gertrude is going to stay said mrs blythe we would miss her horribly and she has an excellent influence over rilla who worships her they are chums in spite of the difference in their ages  i thought i heard she was going to be married  i believe it was talked of but i understand it is postponed for a year  who is the young man  robert grant he is a young lawyer in charlottetown i hope gertrude will be happy she has had a sad life with much bitterness in it and she feels things with a terrible keenness her first youth is gone and she is practically alone in the world this new love that has come into her life seems such a wonderful thing to her that i think she hardly dares believe in its permanence when her marriage had to be put off she was quite in despairthough it certainly wasnt mr grants fault there were complications in the settlement of his fathers estatehis father died last winterand he could not marry till the tangles were unravelled but i think gertrude felt it was a bad omen and that her happiness would somehow elude her yet  it does not do mrs dr dear to set your affections too much on a man remarked susan solemnly  mr grant is quite as much in love with gertrude as she is with him susan it is not he whom she distrustsit is fate she has a little mystic streak in heri suppose some people would call her superstitious she has an odd belief in dreams and we have not been able to laugh it out of her i must own too that some of her dreamsbut there it would not do to let gilbert hear me hinting such heresy what have you found of much interest susan  susan had given an exclamation  listen to this mrs dr dear mrs sophia crawford has given up her house at lowbridge and will make her home in future with her niece mrs albert crawford why that is my own cousin sophia mrs dr dear we quarrelled when we were children over who should get a sundayschool card with the words god is love wreathed in rosebuds on it and have never spoken to each other since and now she is coming to live right across the road from us  you will have to make up the old quarrel susan it will never do to be at outs with your neighbours  cousin sophia began the quarrel so she can begin the making up also mrs dr dear said susan loftily if she does i hope i am a good enough christian to meet her halfway she is not a cheerful person and has been a wet blanket all her life the last time i saw her her face had a thousand wrinklesmaybe more maybe lessfrom worrying and foreboding she howled dreadful at her first husbands funeral but she married again in less than a year the next note i see describes the special service in our church last sunday night and says the decorations were very beautiful  speaking of that reminds me that mr pryor strongly disapproves of flowers in church said miss cornelia i always said there would be trouble when that man moved here from lowbridge he should never have been put in as elderit was a mistake and we shall live to rue it believe me i have heard that he has said that if the girls continue to mess up the pulpit with weeds that he will not go to church  the church got on very well before old whiskersonthemoon came to the glen and it is my opinion it will get on without him after he is gone said susan  who in the world ever gave him that ridiculous nickname asked mrs blythe  why the lowbridge boys have called him that ever since i can remember mrs dr deari suppose because his face is so round and red with that fringe of sandy whisker about it it does not do for anyone to call him that in his hearing though and that you may tie to but worse than his whiskers mrs dr dear he is a very unreasonable man and has a great many queer ideas he is an elder now and they say he is very religious but i can well remember the time mrs dr dear twenty years ago when he was caught pasturing his cow in the lowbridge graveyard yes indeed i have not forgotten that and i always think of it when he is praying in meeting well that is all the notes and there is not much else in the paper of any importance i never take much interest in foreign parts who is this archduke man who has been murdered  what does it matter to us asked miss cornelia unaware of the hideous answer to her question which destiny was even then preparing somebody is always murdering or being murdered in those balkan states its their normal condition and i dont really think that our papers ought to print such shocking things the enterprise is getting far too sensational with its big headlines well i must be getting home no anne dearie its no use asking me to stay to supper marshall has got to thinking that if im not home for a meal its not worth eatingjust like a man so off i go merciful goodness anne dearie what is the matter with that cat is he having a fitthis as doc suddenly bounded to the rug at miss cornelias feet laid back his ears swore at her and then disappeared with one fierce leap through the window  oh no hes merely turning into mr hydewhich means that we shall have rain or high wind before morning doc is as good as a barometer  well i am thankful he has gone on the rampage outside this time and not into my kitchen said susan and i am going out to see about supper with such a crowd as we have at ingleside now it behooves us to think about our meals betimes    chapter ii  dew of morning  outside the ingleside lawn was full of golden pools of sunshine and plots of alluring shadows rilla blythe was swinging in the hammock under the big scotch pine gertrude oliver sat at its roots beside her and walter was stretched at full length on the grass lost in a romance of chivalry wherein old heroes and beauties of dead and gone centuries lived vividly again for him  rilla was the baby of the blythe family and was in a chronic state of secret indignation because nobody believed she was grown up she was so nearly fifteen that she called herself that and she was quite as tall as di and nan also she was nearly as pretty as susan believed her to be she had great dreamy hazel eyes a milky skin dappled with little golden freckles and delicately arched eyebrows giving her a demure questioning look which made people especially lads in their teens want to answer it her hair was ripely ruddily brown and a little dent in her upper lip looked as if some good fairy had pressed it in with her finger at rillas christening rilla whose best friends could not deny her share of vanity thought her face would do very well but worried over her figure and wished her mother could be prevailed upon to let her wear longer dresses she who had been so plump and rolypoly in the old rainbow valley days was incredibly slim now in the armsandlegs period jem and shirley harrowed her soul by calling her spider yet she somehow escaped awkwardness there was something in her movements that made you think she never walked but always danced she had been much petted and was a wee bit spoiled but still the general opinion was that rilla blythe was a very sweet girl even if she were not so clever as nan and di  miss oliver who was going home that night for vacation had boarded for a year at ingleside the blythes had taken her to please rilla who was fathoms deep in love with her teacher and was even willing to share her room since no other was available gertrude oliver was twentyeight and life had been a struggle for her she was a strikinglooking girl with rather sad almondshaped brown eyes a clever rather mocking mouth and enormous masses of black hair twisted about her head she was not pretty but there was a certain charm of interest and mystery in her face and rilla found her fascinating even her occasional moods of gloom and cynicism had allurement for rilla these moods came only when miss oliver was tired at all other times she was a stimulating companion and the gay set at ingleside never remembered that she was so much older than themselves walter and rilla were her favourites and she was the confidante of the secret wishes and aspirations of both she knew that rilla longed to be outto go to parties as nan and di did and to have dainty evening dresses andyes there is no mincing mattersbeaux in the plural at that as for walter miss oliver knew that he had written a sequence of sonnets to rosamondie faith meredithand that he aimed at a professorship of english literature in some big college she knew his passionate love of beauty and his equally passionate hatred of ugliness she knew his strength and his weakness  walter was as ever the handsomest of the ingleside boys miss oliver found pleasure in looking at him for his good lookshe was so exactly like what she would have liked her own son to be glossy black hair brilliant dark grey eyes faultless features and a poet to his fingertips that sonnet sequence was really a remarkable thing for a lad of twenty to write miss oliver was no partial critic and she knew that walter blythe had a wonderful gift  rilla loved walter with all her heart he never teased her as jem and shirley did he never called her spider his pet name for her was rillamyrillaa little pun on her real name marilla she had been named after aunt marilla of green gables but aunt marilla had died before rilla was old enough to know her very well and rilla detested the name as being horribly oldfashioned and prim why couldnt they have called her by her first name bertha which was beautiful and dignified instead of that silly rilla she did not mind walters version but nobody else was allowed to call her that except miss oliver now and then rillamyrilla in walters musical voice sounded very beautiful to herlike the lilt and ripple of some silvery brook she would have died for walter if it would have done him any good so she told miss oliver rilla was as fond of italics as most girls of fifteen areand the bitterest drop in her cup was her suspicion that he told di more of his secrets than he told her  he thinks im not grown up enough to understand she had once lamented rebelliously to miss oliver but i am and i would never tell them to a single soulnot even to you miss oliver i tell you all my owni just couldnt be happy if i had any secret from you dearestbut i would never betray his i tell him everythingi even show him my diary and it hurts me dreadfully when he doesnt tell me things he shows me all his poems thoughthey are marvellous miss oliver oh i just live in the hope that some day i shall be to walter what wordsworths sister dorothy was to him wordsworth never wrote anything like walters poemsnor tennyson either  i wouldnt say just that both of them wrote a great deal of trash said miss oliver dryly then repenting as she saw a hurt look in rillas eye she added hastily  but i believe walter will be a great poet toosome dayand you will have more of his confidence as you grow older  when walter was in the hospital with typhoid last year i was almost crazy sighed rilla a little importantly they never told me how ill he really was until it was all overfather wouldnt let them im glad i didnt knowi couldnt have borne it i cried myself to sleep every night as it was but sometimes concluded rilla bitterlyshe liked to speak bitterly now and then in imitation of miss oliversometimes i think walter cares more for dog monday than he does for me  dog monday was the ingleside dog so called because he had come into the family on a monday when walter had been reading robinson crusoe he really belonged to jem but was much attached to walter also he was lying beside walter now with nose snuggled against his arm thumping his tail rapturously whenever walter gave him an absent pat monday was not a collie or a setter or a hound or a newfoundland he was just as jem said plain dogvery plain dog uncharitable people added certainly mondays looks were not his strong point black spots were scattered at random over his yellow carcass one of them apparently blotting out an eye his ears were in tatters for monday was never successful in affairs of honour but he possessed one talisman he knew that not all dogs could be handsome or eloquent or victorious but that every dog could love inside his homely hide beat the most affectionate loyal faithful heart of any dog since dogs were and something looked out of his brown eyes that was nearer akin to a soul than any theologian would allow everybody at ingleside was fond of him even susan although his one unfortunate propensity of sneaking into the spare room and going to sleep on the bed tried her affection sorely  on this particular afternoon rilla had no quarrel on hand with existing conditions  hasnt june been a delightful month she asked looking dreamily afar at the little quiet silvery clouds hanging so peacefully over rainbow valley weve had such lovely timesand such lovely weather it has just been perfect every way  i dont half like that said miss oliver with a sigh its ominoussomehow a perfect thing is a gift of the godsa sort of compensation for what is coming afterwards ive seen that so often that i dont care to hear people say theyve had a perfect time june has been delightful though  of course it hasnt been very exciting said rilla the only exciting thing that has happened in the glen for a year was old miss mead fainting in church sometimes i wish something dramatic would happen once in a while  dont wish it dramatic things always have a bitterness for some one what a nice summer all you gay creatures will have and me moping at lowbridge  youll be over often wont you i think theres going to be lots of fun this summer though ill just be on the fringe of things as usual i suppose isnt it horrid when people think youre a little girl when youre not  theres plenty of time for you to be grown up rilla dont wish your youth away it goes too quickly youll begin to taste life soon enough  taste life i want to eat it cried rilla laughing i want everythingeverything a girl can have ill be fifteen in another month and then nobody can say im a child any longer i heard someone say once that the years from fifteen to nineteen are the best years in a girls life im going to make them perfectly splendidjust fill them with fun  theres no use thinking about what youre going to doyou are tolerably sure not to do it  oh but you do get a lot of fun out of the thinking cried rilla  you think of nothing but fun you monkey said miss oliver indulgently reflecting that rillas chin was really the last word in chins well what else is fifteen for but have you any notion of going to college this fall  nonor any other fall i dont want to i never cared for all those ologies and isms nan and di are so crazy about and theres five of us going to college already surely thats enough theres bound to be one dunce in every family im quite willing to be a dunce if i can be a pretty popular delightful one i cant be clever i have no talent at all and you cant imagine how comfortable it is nobody expects me to do anything so im never pestered to do it and i cant be a housewifely cookly creature either i hate sewing and dusting and when susan couldnt teach me to make biscuits nobody could father says i toil not neither do i spin therefore i must be a lily of the field concluded rilla with another laugh  you are too young to give up your studies altogether rilla  oh mother will put me through a course of reading next winter it will polish up her ba degree luckily i like reading dont look at me so sorrowfully and so disapprovingly dearest i cant be sober and seriouseverything looks so rosy and rainbowy to me next month ill be fifteenand next year sixteenand the year after that seventeen could anything be more enchanting  rap wood said gertrude oliver half laughingly half seriously rap wood rillamyrilla    chapter iii  moonlit mirth  rilla who still buttoned up her eyes when she went to sleep so that she always looked as if she were laughing in her slumber yawned stretched and smiled at gertrude oliver the latter had come over from lowbridge the previous evening and had been prevailed upon to remain for the dance at the four winds lighthouse the next night  the new day is knocking at the window what will it bring us i wonder  miss oliver shivered a little she never greeted the days with rillas enthusiasm she had lived long enough to know that a day may bring a terrible thing  i think the nicest thing about days is their unexpectedness went on rilla its jolly to wake up like this on a goldenfine morning and wonder what surprise packet the day will hand you i always daydream for ten minutes before i get up imagining the heaps of splendid things that may happen before night  i hope something very unexpected will happen today said gertrude i hope the mail will bring us news that war has been averted between germany and france  ohyes said rilla vaguely it will be dreadful if it isnt i suppose but it wont really matter much to us will it i think a war would e so exciting the boer war was they say but i dont remember anything about it of course miss oliver shall i wear my white dress tonight or my new green one the green one is by far the prettier of course but im almost afraid to wear it to a shore dance for fear something will happen to it and will you do my hair the new way none of the other girls in the glen wear it yet and it will make such a sensation  how did you induce your mother to let you go to the dance  oh walter coaxed her over he knew i would be heartbroken if i didnt go its my first reallytruly grownup party miss oliver and ive just lain awake at nights for a week thinking it over when i saw the sun shining this morning i wanted to whoop for joy it would be simply terrible if it rained tonight i think ill wear the green dress and risk it i want to look my nicest at my first party besides its an inch longer than my white one and ill wear my silver slippers too mrs ford sent them to me last christmas and ive never had a chance to wear them yet theyre the dearest things oh miss oliver i do hope some of the boys will ask me to dance i shall die of mortificationtruly i will if nobody does and i have to sit stuck up against the wall all the evening of course carl and jerry cant dance because theyre the ministers sons or else i could depend on them to save me from utter disgrace  youll have plenty of partnersall the overharbour boys are comingtherell be far more boys than girls  im glad im not a ministers daughter laughed rilla poor faith is so furious because she wont dare to dance tonight una doesnt care of course she has never hankered after dancing somebody told faith there would be a taffypull in the kitchen for those who didnt dance and you should have seen the face she made she and jem will sit out on the rocks most of the evening i suppose did you know that we are all to walk down as far as that little creek below the old house of dreams and then sail to the lighthouse wont it just be absolutely divine  when i was fifteen i talked in italics and superlatives too said miss oliver sarcastically i think the party promises to be pleasant for young fry i expect to be bored none of those boys will bother dancing with an old maid like me jem and walter will take me out once out of charity so you cant expect me to look forward to it with your touching young rapture  didnt you have a good time at your first party though miss oliver  no i had a hateful time i was shabby and homely and nobody asked me to dance except one boy homelier and shabbier than myself he was so awkward i hated himand even he didnt ask me again i had no real girlhood rilla its a sad loss thats why i want you to have a splendid happy girlhood and i hope your first party will be one youll remember all your life with pleasure  i dreamed last night i was at the dance and right in the middle of things i discovered i was dressed in my kimono and bedroom shoes sighed rilla i woke up with a gasp of horror  speaking of dreamsi had an odd one said miss oliver absently it was one of those vivid dreams i sometimes havethey are not the vague jumble of ordinary dreamsthey are as clear cut and real as life  what was your dream  i was standing on the veranda steps here at ingleside looking down over the fields of the glen all at once far in the distance i saw a long silvery glistening wave breaking over them it came nearer and nearerjust a succession of little white waves like those that break on the sandshore sometimes the glen was being swallowed up i thought surely the waves will not come near inglesidebut they came nearer and nearerso rapidlybefore i could move or call they were breaking right at my feetand everything was gonethere was nothing but a waste of stormy water where the glen had been i tried to draw backand i saw that the edge of my dress was wet with bloodand i wokeshivering i dont like the dream there was some sinister significance in it that kind of vivid dream always comes true with me  i hope it doesnt mean theres a storm coming up from the east to spoil the party murmured rilla  incorrigible fifteen said miss oliver dryly no rillamyrilla i dont think there is any danger that it foretells anything so awful as that  there had been an undercurrent of tension in the ingleside existence for several days only rilla absorbed in her own budding life was unaware of it dr blythe had taken to looking grave and saying little over the daily paper jem and walter were keenly interested in the news it brought jem sought walter out in excitement that evening  oh boy germany has declared war on france this means that england will fight too probablyand if she doeswell the piper of your old fancy will have come at last  it wasnt a fancy said walter slowly it was a presentimenta visionjem i really saw him for a moment that evening long ago suppose england does fight  why well all have to turn in and help her cried jem gaily we couldnt let the old grey mother of the northern sea fight it out alone could we but you cant gothe typhoid has done you out of that sort of a shame eh  walter did not say whether it was a shame or not  he looked silently over the glen to the dimpling blue harbour beyond  were the cubsweve got to pitch in tooth and claw if it comes to a family row jem went on cheerfully rumpling up his red curls with a strong lean sensitive brown handthe hand of the born surgeon his father often thought what an adventure it would be but i suppose grey or some of those wary old chaps will patch matters up at the eleventh hour itll be a rotten shame if they leave france in the lurch though if they dont well see some fun well i suppose its time to get ready for the spree at the light  jem departed whistling wi a hundred pipers and a and a and walter stood for a long time where he was there was a little frown on his forehead this had all come up with the blackness and suddenness of a thundercloud a few days ago nobody had even thought of such a thing it was absurd to think of it now some way out would be found war was a hellish horrible hideous thingtoo horrible and hideous to happen in the twentieth century between civilized nations the mere thought of it was hideous and made walter unhappy in its threat to the beauty of life he would not think of ithe would resolutely put it out of his mind how beautiful the old glen was in its august ripeness with its chain of bowery old homesteads tilled meadows and quiet gardens the western sky was like a great golden pearl far down the harbour was frosted with a dawning moonlight the air was full of exquisite soundssleepy robin whistles wonderful mournful soft murmurs of wind in the twilit trees rustle of aspen poplars talking in silvery whispers and shaking their dainty heartshaped leaves lilting young laughter from the windows of rooms where the girls were making ready for the dance the world was steeped in maddening loveliness of sound and colour he would think only of these things and of the deep subtle joy they gave him anyhow no one will expect me to go he thought as jem says typhoid has seen to that  rilla was leaning out of her room window dressed for the dance a yellow pansy slipped from her hair and fell out over the sill like a falling star of gold she caught at it vainlybut there were enough left miss oliver had woven a little wreath of them for her pets hair  its so beautifully calmisnt that splendid well have a perfect night listen miss oliveri can hear those old bells in rainbow valley quite clearly theyve been hanging there for over ten years  their wind chime always makes me think of the aerial celestial music adam and eve heard in miltons eden responded miss oliver  we used to have such fun in rainbow valley when we were children said rilla dreamily  nobody ever played in rainbow valley now it was very silent on summer evenings walter liked to go there to read jem and faith trysted there considerably jerry and nan went there to pursue uninterruptedly the ceaseless wrangles and arguments on profound subjects that seemed to be their preferred method of sweethearting and rilla had a beloved little sylvan dell of her own there where she liked to sit and dream  i must run down to the kitchen before i go and show myself off to susan she would never forgive me if i didnt  rilla whirled into the shadowy kitchen at ingleside where susan was prosaically darning socks and lighted it up with her beauty she wore her green dress with its little pink daisy garlands her silk stockings and silver slippers she had golden pansies in her hair and at her creamy throat she was so pretty and young and glowing that even cousin sophia crawford was compelled to admire herand cousin sophia crawford admired few transient earthly things cousin sophia and susan had made up or ignored their old feud since the former had come to live in the glen and cousin sophia often came across in the evenings to make a neighbourly call susan did not always welcome her rapturously for cousin sophia was not what could be called an exhilarating companion some calls are visits and some are visitations mrs dr dear susan said once and left it to be inferred that cousin sophias were the latter  cousin sophia had a long pale wrinkled face a long thin nose a long thin mouth and very long thin pale hands generally folded resignedly on her black calico lap everything about her seemed long and thin and pale she looked mournfully upon rilla blythe and said sadly  is your hair all your own  of course it is cried rilla indignantly  ah well cousin sophia sighed it might be better for you if it wasnt such a lot of hair takes from a persons strength its a sign of consumption ive heard but i hope it wont turn out like that in your case i spose youll all be dancing tonighteven the ministers boys most likely i spose his girls wont go that far ah well i never held with dancing i knew a girl once who dropped dead while she was dancing how any one could ever dance aga after a judgment like that i cannot comprehend  did she ever dance again asked rilla pertly  i told you she dropped dead of course she never danced again poor creature she was a kirke from lowbridge you aint agoing off like that with nothing on your bare neck are you  its a hot evening protested rilla but ill put on a scarf when we go on the water  i knew of a boat load of young folks who went sailing on that harbour forty years ago just such a night as thisjust exactly such a night as this said cousin sophia lugubriously and they were upset and drownedevery last one of them i hope nothing like thatll happen to you tonight do you ever try anything for the freckles i used to find plantain juice real good  you certainly should be a judge of freckles cousin sophia said susan rushing to rillas defence you were more speckled than any toad when you was a girl rillas only come in summer but yours stayed put season in and season out and you had not a ground colour like hers behind them neither you look real nice rilla and that way of fixing your hair is becoming but you are not going to walk to the harbour in those slippers are you  oh no well all wear our old shoes to the harbour and carry our slippers do you like my dress susan  it minds me of a dress i wore when i was a girl sighed cousin sophia before susan could reply it was green with pink posies on it too and it was flounced from the waist to the hem we didnt wear the skimpy things girls wear nowadays ah me times has changed and not for the better im afraid i tore a big hole in it that night and someone spilled a cup of tea all over it ruined it completely but i hope nothing will happen to your dress it orter to be a bit longer im thinkingyour legs are so terrible long and thin  mrs dr blythe does not approve of little girls dressing like grownup ones said susan stiffly intending merely a snub to cousin sophia but rilla felt insulted a little girl indeed she whisked out of the kitchen in high dudgeon another time she wouldnt go down to show herself off to susansusan who thought nobody was grown up until she was sixty and that horrid cousin sophia with her digs about freckles and legs what business had an oldan old beanpole like that to talk of anybody else being long and thin rilla felt all her pleasure in herself and her evening clouded and spoiled the very teeth of her soul were set on edge and she could have sat down and cried  but later on her spirits rose again when she found herself one of the gay crowd bound for the four winds light  the blythes left ingleside to the melancholy music of howls from dog monday who was locked up in the barn lest he make an uninvited guest at the light they picked up the merediths in the village and others joined them as they walked down the old harbour road mary vance resplendent in blue crepe with lace overdress came out of miss cornelias gate and attached herself to rilla and miss oliver who were walking together and who did not welcome her overwarmly rilla was not very fond of mary vance she had never forgotten the humiliating day when mary had chased her through the village with a dried codfish mary vance to tell the truth was not exactly popular with any of her set still they enjoyed her societyshe had such a biting tongue that it was stimulating mary vance is a habit of ourswe cant do without her even when we are furious with her di blythe had once said  most of the little crowd were paired off after a fashion jem walked with faith meredith of course and jerry meredith with nan blythe di and walter were together deep in confidential conversation which rilla envied  carl meredith was walking with miranda pryor more to torment joe milgrave than for any other reason joe was known to have a strong hankering for the said miranda which shyness prevented him from indulging on all occasions joe might summon enough courage to amble up beside miranda if the night were dark but here in this moonlit dusk he simply could not do it so he trailed along after the procession and thought things not lawful to be uttered of carl meredith miranda was the daughter of whiskersonthemoon she did not share her fathers unpopularity but she was not much run after being a pale neutral little creature somewhat addicted to nervous giggling she had silvery blonde hair and her eyes were big china blue orbs that looked as if she had been badly frightened when she was little and had never got over it she would much rather have walked with joe than with carl with whom she did not feel in the least at home yet it was something of an honour too to have a college boy beside her and a son of the manse at that  shirley blythe was with una meredith and both were rather silent because such was their nature shirley was a lad of sixteen sedate sensible thoughtful full of a quiet humour he was susans little brown boy yet with his brown hair brown eyes and clear brown skin he liked to walk with una meredith because she never tried to make him talk or badgered him with chatter una was as sweet and shy as she had been in the rainbow valley days and her large darkblue eyes were as dreamy and wistful she had a secret carefullyhidden fancy for walter blythe that nobody but rilla ever suspected rilla sympathized with it and wished walter would return it she liked una better than faith whose beauty and aplomb rather overshadowed other girlsand rilla did not enjoy being overshadowed  but just now she was very happy it was so delightful to be tripping with her friends down that dark gleaming road sprinkled with its little spruces and firs whose balsam made all the air resinous around them meadows of sunset afterlight were behind the westerning hills before them was the shining harbour a bell was ringing in the little church overharbour and the lingering dreamnotes died around the dim amethystine points the gulf beyond was still silvery blue in the afterlight oh it was all gloriousthe clear air with its salt tang the balsam of the firs the laughter of her friends rilla loved lifeits bloom and brilliance she loved the ripple of music the hum of merry conversation she wanted to walk on forever over this road of silver and shadow it was her first party and she was going to have a splendid time there was nothing in the world to worry aboutnot even freckles and overlong legsnothing except one little haunting fear that nobody would ask her to dance it was beautiful and satisfying just to be aliveto be fifteento be pretty rilla drew a long breath of raptureand caught it midway rather sharply jem was telling some story to faithsomething that had happened in the balkan war  the doctor lost both his legsthey were smashed to pulpand he was left on the field to die and he crawled about from man to man to all the wounded men round him as long as he could and did everything possible to relieve their sufferingsnever thinking of himselfhe was tying a bit of bandage round another mans leg when he went under they found them there the doctors dead hands still held the bandage tight the bleeding was stopped and the other mans life was saved some hero wasnt he faith i tell you when i read that  jem and faith moved on out of hearing gertrude oliver suddenly shivered rilla pressed her arm sympathetically  wasnt it dreadful miss oliver i dont know why jem tells such gruesome things at a time like this when were all out for fun  do you think it dreadful rilla i thought it wonderfulbeautiful such a story makes one ashamed of ever doubting human nature that mans action was godlike and how humanity responds to the ideal of selfsacrifice as for my shiver i dont know what caused it the evening is certainly warm enough perhaps someone is walking over the dark starshiny spot that is to be my grave that is the explanation the old superstition would give well i wont think of that on this lovely night do you know rilla that when nighttime comes im always glad i live in the country we know the real charm of night here as town dwellers never do every night is beautiful in the countryeven the stormy ones i love a wild night storm on this old gulf shore as for a night like this it is almost too beautifulit belongs to youth and dreamland and im half afraid of it  i feel as if i were part of it said rilla  ah yes youre young enough not to be afraid of perfect things well here we are at the house of dreams it seems lonely this summer the fords didnt come  mr and mrs ford and persis didnt kenneth didbut he stayed with his mothers people overharbour we havent seen a great deal of him this summer hes a little lame so didnt go about very much  lame what happened to him  he broke his ankle in a football game last fall and was laid up most of the winter he has limped a little ever since but it is getting better all the time and he expects it will be all right before long he has been up to ingleside only twice  ethel reese is simply crazy about him said mary vance she hasnt got the sense she was born with where he is concerned he walked home with her from the overharbour church last prayermeeting night and the airs she has put on since would really make you weary of life as if a toronto boy like ken ford would ever really think of a country girl like ethel  rilla flushed it did not matter to her if kenneth ford walked home with ethel reese a dozen timesit did not nothing that he did mattered to her he was ages older than she was he chummed with nan and di and faith and looked upon her rilla as a child whom he never noticed except to tease and she detested ethel reese and ethel reese hated heralways had hated her since walter had pummelled dan so notoriously in rainbow valley days but why need she be thought beneath kenneth fords notice because she was a country girl pray as for mary vance she was getting to be an outandout gossip and thought of nothing but who walked home with people  there was a little pier on the harbour shore below the house of dreams and two boats were moored there one boat was skippered by jem blythe the other by joe milgrave who knew all about boats and was nothing loth to let miranda pryor see it they raced down the harbour and joes boat won more boats were coming down from the harbour head and across the harbour from the western side everywhere there was laughter the big white tower on four winds point was overflowing with light while its revolving beacon flashed overhead a family from charlottetown relatives of the lights keeper were summering at the light and they were giving the party to which all the young people of four winds and glen st mary and overharbour had been invited as jems boat swung in below the lighthouse rilla desperately snatched off her shoes and donned her silver slippers behind miss olivers screening back a glance had told her that the rockcut steps climbing up to the light were lined with boys and lighted by chinese lanterns and she was determined she would not walk up those steps in the heavy shoes her mother had insisted on her wearing for the road the slippers pinched abominably but nobody would have suspected it as rilla tripped smilingly up the steps her soft dark eyes glowing and questioning her colour deepening richly on her round creamy cheeks the very minute she reached the top of the steps an overharbour boy asked her to dance and the next moment they were in the pavilion that had been built seaward of the lighthouse for dances it was a delightful spot roofed over with firboughs and hung with lanterns beyond was the sea in a radiance that glowed and shimmered to the left the moonlit crests and hollows of the sanddunes to the right the rocky shore with its inky shadows and its crystalline coves rilla and her partner swung in among the dancers she drew a long breath of delight what witching music ned burr of the upper glen was coaxing from his fiddleit was really like the magical pipes of the old tale which compelled all who heard them to dance how cool and fresh the gulf breeze blew how white and wonderful the moonlight was over everything this was lifeenchanting life rilla felt as if her feet and her soul both had wings    chapter iv  the piper pipes  rillas first party was a triumphor so it seemed at first she had so many partners that she had to split her dances her silver slippers seemed verily to dance of themselves and though they continued to pinch her toes and blister her heels that did not interfere with her enjoyment in the least ethel reese gave her a bad ten minutes by beckoning her mysteriously out of the pavilion and whispering with a reeselike smirk that her dress gaped behind and that there was a stain on the flounce rilla rushed miserably to the room in the lighthouse which was fitted up for a temporary ladies dressingroom and discovered that the stain was merely a tiny grass smear and that the gap was equally tiny where a hook had pulled loose irene howard fastened it up for her and gave her some oversweet condescending compliments rilla felt flattered by irenes condescension she was an upper glen girl of nineteen who seemed to like the society of the younger girlsspiteful friends said because she could queen it over them without rivalry but rilla thought irene quite wonderful and loved her for her patronage irene was pretty and stylish she sang divinely and spent every winter in charlottetown taking music lessons she had an aunt in montreal who sent her wonderful things to wear she was reported to have had a sad love affairnobody knew just what but its very mystery allured rilla felt that irenes compliments crowned her evening she ran gaily back to the pavilion and lingered for a moment in the glow of the lanterns at the entrance looking at the dancers a momentary break in the whirling throng gave her a glimpse of kenneth ford standing at the other side  rillas heart skipped a beator if that be a physiological impossibility she thought it did so he was here after all she had concluded he was not comingnot that it mattered in the least would he see her would he take any notice of her of course he wouldnt ask her to dancethat couldnt be hoped for he thought her just a mere child he had called her spider not three weeks ago when he had been at ingleside one evening she had cried about it upstairs afterwards and hated him but her heart skipped a beat when she saw that he was edging his way round the side of the pavilion towards her was he coming to herwas hewas heyes he was he was looking for herhe was here beside herhe was gazing down at her with something in his dark grey eyes that rilla had never seen in them oh it was almost too much to bear and everything was going on as beforethe dancers were spinning round the boys who couldnt get partners were hanging about the pavilion canoodling couples were sitting out on the rocksnobody seemed to realize what a stupendous thing had happened  kenneth was a tall lad very good looking with a certain careless grace of bearing that somehow made all the other boys seem stiff and awkward by contrast he was reported to be awesomely clever with the glamour of a faraway city and a big university hanging around him he had also the reputation of being a bit of a ladykiller but that probably accrued to him from his possession of a laughing velvety voice which no girl could hear without a heartbeat and a dangerous way of listening as if she were saying something that he had longed all his life to hear  is this rillamyrilla he asked in a low tone  yeth said rilla and immediately wished she could throw herself headlong down the lighthouse rock or otherwise vanish from a jeering world  rilla had lisped in early childhood but she had grown out of it only on occasions of stress and strain did the tendency reassert itself she hadnt lisped for a year and now at this very moment when she was so especially desirous of appearing grown up and sophisticated she must go and lisp like a baby it was too mortifying she felt as if tears were going to come into her eyes the next minute she would beblubberingyes just blubberingshe wished kenneth would go awayshe wished he had never come the party was spoiled everything had turned to dust and ashes  and he had called her rillamyrillanot spider or kid or puss as he had been used to call her when he took any notice whatever of her she did not at all resent his using walters pet name for her it sounded beautifully in his low caressing tones with just the faintest suggestion of emphasis on the my it would have been so nice if she had not made a fool of herself she dared not look up lest she should see laughter in his eyes so she looked down and as her lashes were very long and dark and her lids very thick and creamy the effect was quite charming and provocative and kenneth reflected that rilla blythe was going to be the beauty of the ingleside girls after all he wanted to make her look upto catch again that little demure questioning glance she was the prettiest thing at the party there was no doubt of that  what was he saying rilla could hardly believe her ears  can we have a dance  yes said rilla she said it with such a fierce determination not to lisp that she fairly blurted the word out then she writhed in spirit again it sounded so boldso eageras if she were fairly jumping at him what would he think of her oh why did dreadful things like this happen just when a girl wanted to appear at her best  kenneth drew her in among the dancers  i think this game ankle of mine is good for one hop around at least he said  how is your ankle said rilla oh why couldnt she think of something else to say she knew he was sick of inquiries about his ankle she had heard him say so at inglesideheard him tell di he was going to wear a placard on his breast announcing to all and sundry that the ankle was improving etc and now she must go and ask this stale question again  kenneth was tired of inquiries about his ankle but then he had not often been asked about it by lips with such an adorable kissable dent just above them perhaps that was why he answered very patiently that it was getting on well and didnt trouble him much if he didnt walk or stand too long at a time  they tell me it will be as strong as ever in time but ill have to cut football out this fall  they danced together and rilla knew every girl in sight envied her after the dance they went down the rock steps and kenneth found a little flat and they rowed across the moonlit channel to the sandshore they walked on the sand till kenneths ankle made protest and then they sat down among the dunes kenneth talked to her as he had talked to nan and di rilla overcome with a shyness she did not understand could not talk much and thought he would think her frightfully stupid but in spite of this it was all very wonderfulthe exquisite moonlit night the shining sea the tiny little wavelets swishing on the sand the cool and freakish wind of night crooning in the stiff grasses on the crest of the dunes the music sounding faintly and sweetly over the channel  a merry lilt o moonlight for mermaiden revelry quoted kenneth softly from one of walters poems  and just he and she alone together in the glamour of sound and sight if only her slippers didnt bite so and if only she could talk cleverly like miss olivernay if she could only talk as she did herself to other boys but words would not come she could only listen and murmur little commonplace sentences now and again but perhaps her dreamy eyes and her dented lip and her slender throat talked eloquently for her at any rate kenneth seemed in no hurry to suggest going back and when they did go back supper was in progress he found a seat for her near the window of the lighthouse kitchen and sat on the sill beside her while she ate her ices and cake rilla looked about her and thought how lovely her first party had been she would never forget it the room reechoed to laughter and jest beautiful young eyes sparkled and shone from the pavilion outside came the lilt of the fiddle and the rhythmic steps of the dancers  there was a little disturbance among a group of boys crowded about the door a young fellow pushed through and halted on the threshold looking about him rather sombrely it was jack elliott from overharboura mcgill medical student a quiet chap not much addicted to social doings he had been invited to the party but had not been expected to come since he had to go to charlottetown that day and could not be back until late yet here he wasand he carried a folded paper in his hand  gertrude oliver looked at him from her corner and shivered again she had enjoyed the party herself after all for she had foregathered with a charlottetown acquaintance who being a stranger and much older than most of the guests felt himself rather out of it and had been glad to fall in with this clever girl who could talk of world doings and outside events with the zest and vigour of a man in the pleasure of his society she had forgotten some of her misgivings of the day now they suddenly returned to her what news did jack elliott bring lines from an old poem flashed unbidden into her mindthere was a sound of revelry by nighthush hark a deep sound strikes like a rising knellwhy should she think of that now why didnt jack elliott speakif he had anything to tell why did he just stand there glowering importantly  ask himask him she said feverishly to allan daly but somebody else had already asked him the room grew very silent all at once outside the fiddler had stopped for a rest and there was silence there too afar off they heard the low moan of the gulfthe presage of a storm already on its way up the atlantic a girls laugh drifted up from the rocks and died away as if frightened out of existence by the sudden stillness  england declared war on germany today said jack elliott slowly the news came by wire just as i left town  god help us whispered gertrude oliver under her breath my dreammy dream the first wave has broken she looked at allan daly and tried to smile  is this armageddon she asked  i am afraid so he said gravely  a chorus of exclamations had arisen round themlight surprise and idle interest for the most part few there realized the import of the messagefewer still realized that it meant anything to them before long the dancing was on again and the hum of pleasure was as loud as ever gertrude and allan daly talked the news over in low troubled tones walter blythe had turned pale and left the room outside he met jem hurrying up the rock steps  have you heard the news jem  yes the piper has come hurrah i knew england wouldnt leave france in the lurch ive been trying to get captain josiah to hoist the flag but he says it isnt the proper caper till sunrise jack says theyll be calling for volunteers tomorrow  what a fuss to make over nothing said mary vance disdainfully as jem dashed off she was sitting out with miller douglas on a lobster trap which was not only an unromantic but an uncomfortable seat but mary and miller were both supremely happy on it miller douglas was a big strapping uncouth lad who thought mary vances tongue uncommonly gifted and mary vances white eyes stars of the first magnitude and neither of them had the least inkling why jem blythe wanted to hoist the lighthouse flag what does it matter if theres going to be a war over there in europe im sure it doesnt concern us  walter looked at her and had one of his odd visitations of prophecy  before this war is over he saidor something said through his lipsevery man and woman and child in canada will feel ityou mary will feel itfeel it to your hearts core you will weep tears of blood over it the piper has comeand he will pipe until every corner of the world has heard his awful and irresistible music it will be years before the dance of death is overyears mary and in those years millions of hearts will break  fancy now said mary who always said that when she couldnt think of anything else to say she didnt know what walter meant but she felt uncomfortable walter blythe was always saying odd things that old piper of hisshe hadnt heard anything about him since their playdays in rainbow valleyand now here he was bobbing up again she didnt like it and that was the long and short of it  arent you painting it rather strong walter asked harvey crawford coming up just then this war wont last for yearsitll be over in a month or two england will just wipe germany off the map in no time  do you think a war for which germany has been preparing for twenty years will be over in a few weeks said walter passionately this isnt a paltry struggle in a balkan corner harvey it is a death grapple germany comes to conquer or to die and do you know what will happen if she conquers canada will be a german colony  well i guess a few things will happen before that said harvey shrugging his shoulders the british navy would have to be licked for one and for another miller here now and i wed raise a dust wouldnt we miller no germans need apply for this old country eh  harvey ran down the steps laughing  i declare i think all you boys talk the craziest stuff said mary vance in disgust she got up and dragged miller off to the rockshore it didnt happen often that they had a chance for a talk together mary was determined that this one shouldnt be spoiled by walter blythes silly blather about pipers and germans and such like absurd things they left walter standing alone on the rock steps looking out over the beauty of four winds with brooding eyes that saw it not  the best of the evening was over for rilla too ever since jack elliotts announcement she had sensed that kenneth was no longer thinking about her she felt suddenly lonely and unhappy it was worse than if he had never noticed her at all was life like thissomething delightful happening and then just as you were revelling in it slipping away from you rilla told herself pathetically that she felt years older than when she had left home that evening perhaps she didperhaps she was who knows it does not do to laugh at the pangs of youth they are very terrible because youth has not yet learned that this too will pass away rilla sighed and wished she were home in bed crying into her pillow  tired said kenneth gently but absentlyoh so absently he really didnt care a bit whether she were tired or not she thought  kenneth she ventured timidly you dont think this war will matter much to us in canada do you  matter of course it will matter to the lucky fellows who will be able to take a hand i wontthanks to this confounded ankle rotten luck i call it  i dont see why we should fight englands battles cried rilla shes quite able to fight them herself  that isnt the point we are part of the british empire its a family affair weve got to stand by each other the worst of it is it will be over before i can be of any use  do you mean that you would really volunteer to go if it wasnt for your ankle asked rilla incredulously  sure i would you see theyll go by thousands jemll be off ill bet a centwalter wont be strong enough yet i suppose and jerry meredithhell go and i was worrying about being out of football this year  rilla was too startled to say anything jemand jerry nonsense why father and mr meredith wouldnt allow it they werent through college oh why hadnt jack elliott kept his horrid news to himself  mark warren came up and asked her to dance rilla went knowing kenneth didnt care whether she went or stayed an hour ago on the sandshore he had been looking at her as if she were the only being of any importance in the world and now she was nobody his thoughts were full of this great game which was to be played out on bloodstained fields with empires for stakesa game in which womenkind could have no part women thought rilla miserably just had to sit and cry at home but all this was foolishness kenneth couldnt gohe admitted that himselfand walter couldntthank goodness for thatand jem and jerry would have more sense she wouldnt worryshe would enjoy herself but how awkward mark warren was how he bungled his steps why for mercys sake did boys try to dance who didnt know the first thing about dancing and who had feet as big as boats there he had bumped her into somebody she would never dance with him again  she danced with others though the zest was gone out of the performance and she had begun to realize that her slippers hurt her badly kenneth seemed to have goneat least nothing was to be seen of him her first party was spoiled though it had seemed so beautiful at one time her head achedher toes burned and worse was yet to come she had gone down with some overharbour friends to the rockshore where they all lingered as dance after dance went on above them it was cool and pleasant and they were tired rilla sat silent taking no part in the gay conversation she was glad when someone called down that the overharbour boats were leaving a laughing scramble up the lighthouse rock followed a few couples still whirled about in the pavilion but the crowd had thinned out rilla looked about her for the glen group she could not see one of them she ran into the lighthouse still no sign of anybody in dismay she ran to the rock steps down which the overharbour guests were hurrying she could see the boats belowwhere was jemswhere was joes  why rilla blythe i thought youd be gone home long ago said mary vance who was waving her scarf at a boat skimming up the channel skippered by miller douglas  where are the rest gasped rilla  why theyre gonejem went an hour agouna had a headache and the rest went with joe about fifteen minutes ago seetheyre just going around birch point i didnt go because its getting rough and i knew id be seasick i dont mind walking home from here its only a mile and a half i sposed youd gone where were you  down on the rocks with jem and mollie crawford oh why didnt they look for me  they didbut you couldnt be found then they concluded you must have gone in the other boat dont worry you can stay all night with me and well phone up to ingleside where you are  rilla realized that there was nothing else to do her lips trembled and tears came into her eyes she blinked savagelyshe would not let mary vance see her crying but to be forgotten like this to think nobody had thought it worth while to make sure where she wasnot even walter then she had a sudden dismayed recollection  my shoes she exclaimed i left them in the boat  well i never said mary youre the most thoughtless kid i ever saw youll have to ask hazel lewison to lend you a pair of shoes  i wont cried rilla who didnt like the said hazel ill go barefoot first  mary shrugged her shoulders  just as you like pride must suffer pain itll teach you to be more careful well lets hike  accordingly they hiked but to hike along a deeprutted pebbly lane in frail silverhued slippers with high french heels is not an exhilarating performance rilla managed to limp and totter along until they reached the harbour road but she could go no farther in those detestable slippers she took them and her dear silk stockings off and started barefoot that was not pleasant either her feet were very tender and the pebbles and ruts of the road hurt them her blistered heels smarted but physical pain was almost forgotten in the sting of humiliation this was a nice predicament if kenneth ford could see her now limping along like a little girl with a stone bruise oh what a horrid way for her lovely party to end she just had to cryit was too terrible nobody cared for hernobody bothered about her at all well if she caught cold from walking home barefoot on a dewwet road and went into a decline perhaps they would be sorry she furtively wiped her tears away with her scarfhandkerchiefs seemed to have vanished like shoesbut she could not help sniffling worse and worse  youve got a cold i see said mary you ought to have known you would sitting down in the wind on those rocks your mother wont let you go out again in a hurry i can tell you its certainly been something of a party the lewisons know how to do things ill say that for them though hazel lewison is no choice of mine my how black she looked when she saw you dancing with ken ford and so did that little hussy of an ethel reese what a flirt he is  i dont think hes a flirt said rilla as defiantly as two desperate sniffs would let her  youll know more about men when youre as old as i am said mary patronizingly mind you it doesnt do to believe all they tell you dont let ken ford think that all he has to do to get you on a string is to drop his handkerchief have more spirit than that child  to be thus hectored and patronized by mary vance was unendurable and it was unendurable to walk on stony roads with blistered heels and bare feet and it was unendurable to be crying and have no handkerchief and not to be able to stop crying  im not thinkingsniffabout kennethsnifffordtwo sniffsat all cried tortured rilla  theres no need to fly off the handle child you ought to be willing to take advice from older people i saw how you slipped over to the sands with ken and stayed there ever so long with him your mother wouldnt like it if she knew  ill tell my mother all about itand miss oliverand walter rilla gasped between sniffs you sat for hours with miller douglas on that lobster trap mary vance what would mrs elliott say to that if she knew  oh im not going to quarrel with you said mary suddenly retreating to high and lofty ground all i say is you should wait until youre grownup before you do things like that  rilla gave up trying to hide the fact that she was crying everything was spoiledeven that beautiful dreamy romantic moonlit hour with kenneth on the sands was vulgarized and cheapened she loathed mary vance  why whatevers wrong cried mystified mary what are you crying for  my feethurt so sobbed rilla clinging to the last shred of her pride it was less humiliating to admit crying because of your feet than becausebecause somebody had been amusing himself with you and your friends had forgotten you and other people patronized you  i daresay they do said mary not unkindly never mind i know where theres a pot of goosegrease in cornelias tidy pantry and it beats all the fancy cold creams in the world ill put some on your heels before you go to bed  goosegrease on your heels so this was what your first party and your first beau and your first moonlit romance ended in  rilla gave over crying in sheer disgust at the futility of tears and went to sleep in mary vances bed in the calm of despair outside the dawn came greyly in on wings of storm captain josiah true to his word ran up the union jack at the four winds light and it streamed on the fierce wind against the clouded sky like a gallant unquenchable beacon    chapter v  the sound of a going  rilla ran down through the sunlit glory of the maple grove behind ingleside to her favourite nook in rainbow valley she sat down on a greenmossed stone among the fern propped her chin on her hands and stared unseeingly at the dazzling blue sky of the august afternoonso blue so peaceful so unchanged just as it had arched over the valley in the mellow days of late summer ever since she could remember  she wanted to be aloneto think things outto adjust herself if it were possible to the new world into which she seemed to have been transplanted with a suddenness and completeness that left her half bewildered as to her own identity was shecould she bethe same rilla blythe who had danced at four winds light six days agoonly six days ago it seemed to rilla that she had lived as much in those six days as in all her previous lifeand if it be true that we should count time by heartthrobs she had that evening with its hopes and fears and triumphs and humiliations seemed like ancient history now could she really ever have cried just because she had been forgotten and had to walk home with mary vance ah thought rilla sadly how trivial and absurd such a cause of tears now appeared to her she could cry now with a right good willbut she would notshe must not what was it mother had said looking with her white lips and stricken eyes as rilla had never seen her mother look before    when our women fail in courage   shall our men be fearless still  yes that was it she must be bravelike motherand nanand faithfaith who had cried with flashing eyes oh if i were only a man to go too only when her eyes ached and her throat burned like this she had to hide herself in rainbow valley for a little just to think things out and remember that she wasnt a child any longershe was grownup and women had to face things like this but it wasniceto get away alone now and then where nobody could see her and where she neednt feel that people thought her a little coward if some tears came in spite of her  how sweet and woodsey the ferns smelled how softly the great feathery boughs of the firs waved and murmured over her how elfinly rang the bells of the tree loversjust a tinkle now and then as the breeze swept by how purple and elusive the haze where incense was being offered on many an altar of the hills how the maple leaves whitened in the wind until the grove seemed covered with pale silvery blossoms everything was just the same as she had seen it hundreds of times and yet the whole face of the world seemed changed  how wicked i was to wish that something dramatic would happen she thought oh if we could only have those dear monotonous pleasant days back again i would never never grumble about them again  rillas world had tumbled to pieces the very day after the party as they lingered around the dinner table at ingleside talking of the war the telephone had rung it was a longdistance call from charlottetown for jem when he had finished talking he hung up the receiver and turned around with a flushed face and glowing eyes before he had said a word his mother and nan and di had turned pale as for rilla for the first time in her life she felt that every one must hear her heart beating and that something had clutched at her throat  they are calling for volunteers in town father said jem scores have joined up already im going in tonight to enlist  ohlittle jem cried mrs blythe brokenly she had not called him that for many yearsnot since the day he had rebelled against it ohnonolittle jem  i must mother im rightam i not father said jem  dr blythe had risen he was very pale too and his voice was husky but he did not hesitate  yes jem yesif you feel that way yes  mrs blythe covered her face walter stared moodily at his plate nan and di clasped each others hands shirley tried to look unconcerned susan sat as if paralysed her piece of pie halfeaten on her plate susan never did finish that piece of piea fact which bore eloquent testimony to the upheaval in her inner woman for susan considered it a cardinal offence against civilized society to begin to eat anything and not finish it that was wilful waste hens to the contrary notwithstanding  jem turned to the phone again i must ring the manse jerry will want to go too  at this nan had cried out oh as if a knife had been thrust into her and rushed from the room di followed her rilla turned to walter for comfort but walter was lost to her in some reverie she could not share  all right jem was saying as coolly as if he were arranging the details of a picnic i thought you wouldyes tonightthe seven oclockmeet me at the station so long  mrs dr dear said susan i wish you would wake me up am i dreamingor am i awake does that blessed boy realize what he is saying does he mean that he is going to enlist as a soldier you do not mean to tell me that they want children like him it is an outrage surely you and the doctor will not permit it  we cant stop him said mrs blythe chokingly oh gilbert  dr blythe came up behind his wife and took her hand gently looking down into the sweet grey eyes that he had only once before seen filled with such imploring anguish as now they both thought of that other timethe day years ago in the house of dreams when little joyce had died  would you have him stay annewhen the others are goingwhen he thinks it his dutywould you have him so selfish and smallsouled  nono butohour firstborn sonhes only a ladgilbertill try to be brave after a whilejust now i cant its all come so suddenly give me time  the doctor and his wife went out of the room jem had gonewalter had goneshirley got up to go rilla and susan remained staring at each other across the deserted table rilla had not yet criedshe was too stunned for tears then she saw that susan was cryingsusan whom she had never seen shed a tear before  oh susan will he really go she asked  ititit is just ridiculous that is what it is said susan  she wiped away her tears gulped resolutely and got up  i am going to wash the dishes that has to be done even if everybody has gone crazy there now dearie do not you cry jem will go most likelybut the war will be over long before he gets anywhere near it let us take a brace and not worry your poor mother  in the enterprise today it was reported that lord kitchener says the war will last three years said rilla dubiously  i am not acquainted with lord kitchener said susan composedly but i dare say he makes mistakes as often as other people your father says it will be over in a few months and i have as much faith in his opinion as i have in lord anybodys so just let us be calm and trust in the almighty and get this place tidied up i am done with crying which is a waste of time and discourages everybody  jem and jerry went to charlottetown that night and two days later they came back in khaki the glen hummed with excitement over it life at ingleside had suddenly become a tense strained thrilling thing mrs blythe and nan were brave and smiling and wonderful already mrs blythe and miss cornelia were organizing a red cross the doctor and mr meredith were rounding up the men for a patriotic society rilla after the first shock reacted to the romance of it all in spite of her heartache jem certainly looked magnificent in his uniform it was splendid to think of the lads of canada answering so speedily and fearlessly and uncalculatingly to the call of their country rilla carried her head high among the girls whose brothers had not so responded in her diary she wrote    he goes to do what i had done   had douglass daughter been his son  and was sure she meant it if she were a boy of course she would go too she hadnt the least doubt of that  she wondered if it was very dreadful of her to feel glad that walter hadnt got strong as soon as they had wished after the fever  i couldnt bear to have walter go she wrote i love jem ever so much but walter means more to me than anyone in the world and i would die if he had to go he seems so changed these days he hardly ever talks to me i suppose he wants to go too and feels badly because he cant he doesnt go about with jem and jerry at all i shall never forget susans face when jem came home in his khaki it worked and twisted as if she were going to cry but all she said was you look almost like a man in that jem jem laughed he never minds because susan thinks him just a child still everybody seems busy but me i wish there was something i could do but there doesnt seem to be anything mother and nan and di are busy all the time and i just wander about like a lonely ghost what hurts me terribly though is that mothers smiles and nans just seem put on from the outside mothers eyes never laugh now it makes me feel that i shouldnt laugh eitherthat its wicked to feel laughy and its so hard for me to keep from laughing even if jem is going to be a soldier but when i laugh i dont enjoy it either as i used to do theres something behind it all that keeps hurting meespecially when i wake up in the night then i cry because i am afraid that kitchener of khartoum is right and the war will last for years and jem may bebut no i wont write it it would make me feel as if it were really going to happen the other day nan said nothing can ever be quite the same for any of us again it made me feel rebellious why shouldnt things be the same againwhen everything is over and jem and jerry are back well all be happy and jolly again and these days will seem just like a bad dream  the coming of the mail is the most exciting event of every day now father just snatches the paperi never saw father snatch beforeand the rest of us crowd round and look at the headlines over his shoulder susan vows she does not and will not believe a word the papers say but she always comes to the kitchen door and listens and then goes back shaking her head she is terribly indignant all the time but she cooks up all the things jem likes especially and she did not make a single bit of fuss when she found monday asleep on the spareroom bed yesterday right on top of mrs rachel lyndes appleleaf spread the almighty only knows where your master will be having to sleep before long you poor dumb beast she said as she put him quite gently out but she never relents towards doc she says the minute he saw jem in khaki he turned into mr hyde then and there and she thinks that ought to be proof enough of what he really is susan is funny but she is an old dear shirley says she is one half angel and the other half good cook but then shirley is the only one of us she never scolds  faith meredith is wonderful i think she and jem are really engaged now she goes about with a shining light in her eyes but her smiles are a little stiff and starched just like mothers i wonder if i could be as brave as she is if i had a lover and he was going to the war it is bad enough when it is your brother bruce meredith cried all night mrs meredith says when he heard jem and jerry were going and he wanted to know if the k of k his father talked about was the king of kings he is the dearest kiddy i just love himthough i dont really care much for children i dont like babies one bitthough when i say so people look at me as if i had said something perfectly shocking well i dont and ive got to be honest about it i dont mind looking at a nice clean baby if somebody else holds itbut i wouldnt touch it for anything and i dont feel a single real spark of interest in it gertrude oliver says she just feels the same she is the most honest person i know she never pretends anything she says babies bore her until they are old enough to talk and then she likes thembut still a good ways off mother and nan and di all adore babies and seem to think im unnatural because i dont  i havent seen kenneth since the night of the party he was here one evening after jem came back but i happened to be away i dont think he mentioned me at allat least nobody told me he did and i was determined i wouldnt askbut i dont care in the least all that matters absolutely nothing to me now the only thing that does matter is that jem has volunteered for active service and will be going to valcartier in a few more daysmy big splendid brother jem oh im so proud of him  i suppose kenneth would enlist too if it werent for his ankle i think that is quite providential he is his mothers only son and how dreadful she would feel if he went only sons should never think of going  walter came wandering through the valley as rilla sat there with his head bent and his hands clasped behind him when he saw rilla he turned abruptly away then as abruptly he turned and came back to her  rillamyrilla what are you thinking of  everything is so changed walter said rilla wistfully even youyoure changed a week ago we were all so happyandandnow i just cant find myself at all im lost  walter sat down on a neighbouring stone and took rillas little appealing hand  im afraid our old world has come to an end rilla weve got to face that fact  its so terrible to think of jem pleaded rilla sometimes i forget for a little while what it really means and feel excited and proudand then it comes over me again like a cold wind  i envy jem said walter moodily  envy jem oh walter youyou dont want to go too  no said walter gazing straight before him down the emerald vistas of the valley no i dont want to go thats just the trouble rilla im afraid to go im a coward  youre not rilla burst out angrily why anybody would be afraid to go you might bewhy you might be killed  i wouldnt mind that if it didnt hurt muttered walter i dont think im afraid of death itselfits of the pain that might come before deathit wouldnt be so bad to die and have it overbut to keep on dying rilla ive always been afraid of painyou know that i cant help iti shudder when i think of the possibility of being mangled oror blinded rilla i cannot face that thought to be blindnever to see the beauty of the world againmoonlight on four windsthe stars twinkling through the firtreesmist on the gulf i ought to goi ought to want to gobut i donti hate the thought of itim ashamedashamed  but walter you couldnt go anyhow said rilla piteously she was sick with a new terror that walter would go after all youre not strong enough  i am ive felt as fit as ever i did this last month id pass any examinationi know it everybody thinks im not strong yetand im skulking behind that belief ii should have been a girl walter concluded in a burst of passionate bitterness  even if you were strong enough you oughtnt to go sobbed rilla what would mother do shes breaking her heart over jem it would kill her to see you both go  oh im not goingdont worry i tell you im afraid to goafraid i dont mince the matter to myself its a relief to own up even to you rilla i wouldnt confess it to anybody elsenan and di would despise me but i hate the whole thingthe horror the pain the ugliness war isnt a khaki uniform or a drill paradeeverything ive read in old histories haunts me i lie awake at night and see things that have happenedsee the blood and filth and misery of it all and a bayonet charge if i could face the other things i could never face that it turns me sick to think of itsicker even to think of giving it than receiving itto think of thrusting a bayonet through another man walter writhed and shuddered i think of these things all the timeand it doesnt seem to me that jem and jerry ever think of them they laugh and talk about potting huns but it maddens me to see them in the khaki and they think im grumpy because im not fit to go  walter laughed bitterly it is not a nice thing to feel yourself a coward but rilla got her arms about him and cuddled her head on his shoulder she was so glad he didnt want to gofor just one minute she had been horribly frightened and it was so nice to have walter confiding his troubles to herto her not di she didnt feel so lonely and superfluous any longer  dont you despise me rillamyrilla asked walter wistfully somehow it hurt him to think rilla might despise himhurt him as much as if it had been di he realized suddenly how very fond he was of this adoring kid sister with her appealing eyes and troubled girlish face  no i dont why walter hundreds of people feel just as you do you know what that verse of shakespeare in the old fifth reader saysthe brave man is not he who feels no fear  nobut it is he whose noble soul its fear subdues i dont do that we cant gloss it over rilla im a coward  youre not think of how you fought dan reese long ago  one spurt of courage isnt enough for a lifetime  walter one time i heard father say that the trouble with you was a sensitive nature and a vivid imagination you feel things before they really comefeel them all alone when there isnt anything to help you bear themto take away from them it isnt anything to be ashamed of when you and jem got your hands burned when the grass was fired on the sandhills two years ago jem made twice the fuss over the pain that you did as for this horrid old war therell be plenty to go without you it wont last long  i wish i could believe it well its suppertime rilla youd better run i dont want anything  neither do i i couldnt eat a mouthful let me stay here with you walter its such a comfort to talk things over with someone the rest all think that im too much of a baby to understand  so they two sat there in the old valley until the evening star shone through a palegrey gauzy cloud over the maple grove and a fragrant dewy darkness filled their little sylvan dell it was one of the evenings rilla was to treasure in remembrance all her lifethe first one on which walter had ever talked to her as if she were a woman and not a child they comforted and strengthened each other walter felt for the time being at least that it was not such a despicable thing after all to dread the horror of war and rilla was glad to be made the confidante of his strugglesto sympathize with and encourage him she was of importance to somebody  when they went back to ingleside they found callers sitting on the veranda mr and mrs meredith had come over from the manse and mr and mrs norman douglas had come up from the farm cousin sophia was there also sitting with susan in the shadowy background mrs blythe and nan and di were away but dr blythe was home and so was dr jekyll sitting in golden majesty on the top step and of course they were all talking of the war except dr jekyll who kept his own counsel and looked contempt as only a cat can when two people foregathered in those days they talked of the war and old highland sandy of the harbour head talked of it when he was alone and hurled anathemas at the kaiser across all the acres of his farm walter slipped away not caring to see or be seen but rilla sat down on the steps where the garden mint was dewy and pungent it was a very calm evening with a dim golden afterlight irradiating the glen she felt happier than at any time in the dreadful week that had passed she was no longer haunted by the fear that walter would go  id go myself if i was twenty years younger norman douglas was shouting norman always shouted when he was excited id show the kaiser a thing or two did i ever say there wasnt a hell of course theres a helldozens of hellshundreds of hellswhere the kaiser and all his brood are bound for  i knew this war was coming said mrs norman triumphantly i saw it coming right along i could have told all those stupid englishmen what was ahead of them i told you john meredith years ago what the kaiser was up to but you wouldnt believe it you said he would never plunge the world in war who was right about the kaiser john youor i tell me that  you were i admit said mr meredith  its too late to admit it now said mrs norman shaking her head as if to intimate that if john meredith had admitted it sooner there might have been no war  thank god englands navy is ready said the doctor  amen to that nodded mrs norman batblind as most of them were somebody had foresight enough to see to that  maybe englandll manage not to get into trouble over it said cousin sophia plaintively i dunno but im much afraid  one would suppose that england was in trouble over it already up to her neck sophia crawford said susan but your ways of thinking are beyond me and always were it is my opinion that the british navy will settle germany in a jiffy and that we are all getting worked up over nothing  susan spat out the words as if she wanted to convince herself more than anybody else she had her little store of homely philosophies to guide her through life but she had nothing to buckler her against the thunderbolts of the week that had just passed what had an honest hardworking presbyterian old maid of glen st mary to do with a war thousands of miles away susan felt that it was indecent that she should have to be disturbed by it  the british army will settle germany shouted norman just wait till it gets into line and the kaiser will find that real war is a different thing from parading round berlin with your moustaches cocked up  britain hasnt got an army said mrs norman emphatically you neednt glare at me norman glaring wont make soldiers out of timothy stalks a hundred thousand men will just be a mouthful for germanys millions  therell be some tough chewing in the mouthful i reckon persisted norman valiantly germanyll break her teeth on it dont you tell me one britisher isnt a match for ten foreigners i could polish off a dozen of em myself with both hands tied behind my back  i am told said susan that old mr pryor does not believe in this war i am told that he says england went into it just because she was jealous of germany and that she did not really care in the least what happened to belgium  i believe hes been talking some such rot said norman i havent heard him when i do whiskersonthemoon wont know what happened to him that precious relative of mine kitty alec holds forth to the same effect i understand not before me thoughsomehow folks dont indulge in that kind of conversation in my presence lord love you theyve a kind of presentiment so to speak that it wouldnt be healthy for their complaint  i am much afraid that this war has been sent as a punishment for our sins said cousin sophia unclasping her pale hands from her lap and reclasping them solemnly over her stomach the world is very evilthe times are waxing late  parson heres got something of the same idea chuckled norman havent you parson thats why you preached tother night on the text without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins i didnt agree with youwanted to get up in the pew and shout out that there wasnt a word of sense in what you were saying but ellen here she held me down i never have any fun sassing parsons since i got married  without shedding of blood there is no anything said mr meredith in the gentle dreamy way which had an unexpected trick of convincing his hearers everything it seems to me has to be purchased by selfsacrifice our race has marked every step of its painful ascent with blood and now torrents of it must flow again no mrs crawford i dont think the war has been sent as a punishment for sin i think it is the price humanity must pay for some blessingsome advance great enough to be worth the pricewhich we may not live to see but which our childrens children will inherit  if jerry is killed will you feel so fine about it demanded norman who had been saying things like that all his life and never could be made to see any reason why he shouldnt now never mind kicking me in the shins ellen i want to see if parson meant what he said or if it was just a pulpit frill  mr merediths face quivered he had had a terrible hour alone in his study on the night jem and jerry had gone to town but he answered quietly  whatever i felt it could not alter my beliefmy assurance that a country whose sons are ready to lay down their lives in her defence will win a new vision because of their sacrifice  you do mean it parson i can always tell when people mean what they say its a gift that was born in me makes me a terror to most parsons that but ive never caught you yet saying anything you didnt mean im always hoping i willthats what reconciles me to going to church itd be such a comfort to mesuch a weapon to batter ellen here with when she tries to civilize me well im off over the road to see ab crawford a minute the gods be good to you all  the old pagan muttered susan as norman strode away she did not care if ellen douglas did hear her susan could never understand why fire did not descend from heaven upon norman douglas when he insulted ministers the way he did but the astonishing thing was mr meredith seemed really to like his brotherinlaw  rilla wished they would talk of something besides war she had heard nothing else for a week and she was really a little tired of it now that she was relieved from her haunting fear that walter would want to go it made her quite impatient but she supposedwith a sighthat there would be three or four months of it yet    chapter vi  susan rilla and dog monday make a resolution  the big livingroom at ingleside was snowed over with drifts of white cotton word had come from red cross headquarters that sheets and bandages would be required nan and di and rilla were hard at work mrs blythe and susan were upstairs in the boys room engaged in a more personal task with dry anguished eyes they were packing up jems belongings he must leave for valcartier the next morning they had been expecting the word but it was none the less dreadful when it came  rilla was basting the hem of a sheet for the first time in her life when the word had come that jem must go she had her cry out among the pines in rainbow valley and then she had gone to her mother  mother i want to do something im only a girli cant do anything to win the warbut i must do something to help at home  the cotton has come up for the sheets said mrs blythe you can help nan and di make them up and rilla dont you think you could organize a junior red cross among the young girls i think they would like it better and do better work by themselves than if mixed up with the older people  but motherive never done anything like that  we will all have to do a great many things in the months ahead of us that we have never done before rilla  wellrilla took the plungeill try motherif youll tell me how to begin i have been thinking it all over and i have decided that i must be as brave and heroic and unselfish as i can possibly be  mrs blythe did not smile at rillas italics perhaps she did not feel like smiling or perhaps she detected a real grain of serious purpose behind rillas romantic pose so here was rilla hemming sheets and organizing a junior red cross in her thoughts as she hemmed moreover she was enjoying itthe organizing that is not the hemming it was interesting and rilla discovered a certain aptitude in herself for it that surprised her who would be president not she the older girls would not like that irene howard no somehow irene was not quite as popular as she deserved to be marjorie drew no marjorie hadnt enough backbone she was too prone to agree with the last speaker betty meadcalm capable tactful bettythe very one and una meredith for treasurer and if they were very insistent they might make her rilla secretary as for the various committees they must be chosen after the juniors were organized but rilla knew just who should be put on which they would meet aroundand there must be no eatsrilla knew she would have a pitched battle with olive kirk over thatand everything should be strictly businesslike and constitutional her minute book should be covered in white with a red cross on the coverand wouldnt it be nice to have some kind of uniform which they could all wear at the concerts they would have to get up to raise moneysomething simple but smart  you have basted the top hem of that sheet on one side and the bottom hem on the other said di  rilla picked out her stitches and reflected that she hated sewing running the junior reds would be much more interesting  mrs blythe was saying upstairs susan do you remember that first day jem lifted up his little arms to me and called me moerthe very first word he ever tried to say  you could not mention anything about that blessed baby that i do not and will not remember till my dying day said susan drearily  susan i keep thinking today of once when he cried for me in the night he was just a few months old gilbert didnt want me to go to himhe said the child was well and warm and that it would be fostering bad habits in him but i wentand took him upi can feel that tight clinging of his little arms round my neck yet susan if i hadnt gone that night twentyone years ago and taken my baby up when he cried for me i couldnt face tomorrow morning  i do not know how we are going to face it anyhow mrs dr dear but do not tell me that it will be the final farewell he will be back on leave before he goes overseas will he not  we hope so but we are not very sure i am making up my mind that he will not so that there will be no disappointment to bear susan i am determined that i will send my boy off tomorrow with a smile he shall not carry away with him the remembrance of a weak mother who had not the courage to send when he had the courage to go i hope none of us will cry  i am not going to cry mrs dr dear and that you may tie to but whether i shall manage to smile or not will be as providence ordains and as the pit of my stomach feels have you room there for this fruitcake and the shortbread and the mincepie that blessed boy shall not starve whether they have anything to eat in that quebec place or not everything seems to be changing all at once does it not even the old cat at the manse has passed away he breathed his last at a quarter to ten last night and bruce is quite heartbroken they tell me  its time that pussy went where good cats go he must be at least fifteen years old he has seemed so lonely since aunt martha died  i should not have lamented mrs dr dear if that hydebeast had died also he has been mr hyde most of the time since jem came home in khaki and that has a meaning i will maintain i do not know what monday will do when jem is gone the creature just goes about with a human look in his eyes that takes all the good out of me when i see it ellen west used to be always railing at the kaiser and we thought her crazy but now i see that there was a method in her madness this tray is packed mrs dr dear and i will go down and put in my best licks preparing supper i wish i knew when i would cook another supper for jem but such things are hidden from our eyes  jem blythe and jerry meredith left next morning it was a dull day threatening rain and the clouds lay in heavy grey rolls over the sky but almost everybody in the glen and four winds and harbour head and upper glen and overharbourexcept whiskersonthemoonwas there to see them off the blythe family and the meredith family were all smiling even susan as providence did ordain wore a smile though the effect was somewhat more painful than tears would have been faith and nan were very pale and very gallant rilla thought she would get on very well if something in her throat didnt choke her and if her lips didnt take such spells of trembling dog monday was there too jem had tried to say goodbye to him at ingleside but monday implored so eloquently that jem relented and let him go to the station he kept close to jems legs and watched every movement of his beloved master  i cant bear that dogs eyes said mrs meredith  the beast has more sense than most humans said mary vance well did we any of us ever think wed live to see this day i bawled all night to think of jem and jerry going like this i think theyre plumb deranged miller got a maggot in his head about going but i soon talked him out of itlikewise his aunt said a few touching things for once in our lives kitty alec and i agree its a miracle that isnt likely to happen again theres ken rilla  rilla knew kenneth was there she had been acutely conscious of it from the moment he had sprung from leo wests buggy now he came up to her smiling  doing the bravesmilingsisterstunt i see what a crowd for the glen to muster well im off home in a few days myself  a queer little wind of desolation that even jems going had not caused blew over rillas spirit  why you have another month of vacation  yesbut i cant hang around four winds and enjoy myself when the worlds on fire like this its me for little old toronto where ill find some way of helping in spite of this bally ankle im not looking at jem and jerrymakes me too sick with envy you girls are greatno crying no grim endurance the boysll go off with a good taste in their mouths i hope persis and mother will be as game when my turn comes  oh kenneththe war will be over before your turn cometh  there she had lisped again another great moment of life spoiled well it was her fate and anyhow nothing mattered kenneth was off alreadyhe was talking to ethel reese who was dressed at seven in the morning in the gown she had worn to the dance and was crying what on earth had ethel to cry about none of the reeses were in khaki rilla wanted to cry toobut she would not what was that horrid old mrs drew saying to mother in that melancholy whine of hers i dont know how you can stand this mrs blythe i couldnt if it was my pore boy and motheroh mother could always be depended on how her grey eyes flashed in her pale face it might have been worse mrs drew i might have had to urge him to go mrs drew did not understand but rilla did she flung up her head her brother did not have to be urged to go  rilla found herself standing alone and listening to disconnected scraps of talk as people walked up and down past her  i told mark to wait and see if they asked for a second lot of men if they did id let him gobut they wont said mrs palmer burr  i think ill have it made with a crush girdle of velvet said bessie clow  im frightened to look at my husbands face for fear ill see in it that he wants to go too said a little overharbour bride  im scared stiff said whimsical mrs jim howard im scared jim will enlistand im scared he wont  the war will be over by christmas said joe vickers  let them european nations fight it out between them said abner reese  when he was a boy i gave him many a good trouncing shouted norman douglas who seemed to be referring to some one high in military circles in charlottetown yes sir i walloped him well big gun as he is now  the existence of the british empire is at stake said the methodist minister  theres certainly something about uniforms sighed irene howard  its a commercial war when all is said and done and not worth one drop of good canadian blood said a stranger from the shore hotel  the blythe family are taking it easy said kate drew  them young fools are just going for adventure growled nathan crawford  i have absolute confidence in kitchener said the overharbour doctor  in these ten minutes rilla passed through a dizzying succession of anger laughter contempt depression and inspiration oh people werefunny how little they understood taking it easy indeedwhen even susan hadnt slept a wink all night kate drew always was a minx  rilla felt as if she were in some fantastic nightmare were these the people who three weeks ago were talking of crops and prices and local gossip  therethe train was comingmother was holding jems handdog monday was licking iteverybody was saying goodbyethe train was in jem kissed faith before everybodyold mrs drew whooped hystericallythe men led by kenneth cheeredrilla felt jem seize her handgoodbye spidersomebody kissed her cheekshe believed it was jerry but never was surethey were offthe train was pulling outjem and jerry were waving to everybodyeverybody was waving backmother and nan were smiling still but as if they had just forgotten to take the smile offmonday was howling dismally and being forcibly restrained by the methodist minister from tearing after the trainsusan was waving her best bonnet and hurrahing like a manhad she gone crazythe train rounded a curve they had gone  rilla came to herself with a gasp there was a sudden quiet nothing to do now but to go homeand wait the doctor and mrs blythe walked off togetherso did nan and faithso did john meredith and rosemary walter and una and shirley and di and carl and rilla went in a group susan had put her bonnet back on her head hindside foremost and stalked grimly off alone nobody missed dog monday at first when they did shirley went back for him he found dog monday curled up in one of the shippingsheds near the station and tried to coax him home dog monday would not move he wagged his tail to show he had no hard feelings but no blandishments availed to budge him  guess monday has made up his mind to wait there till jem comes back said shirley trying to laugh as he rejoined the rest this was exactly what dog monday had done his dear master had gonehe monday had been deliberately and of malice aforethought prevented from going with him by a demon disguised in the garb of a methodist minister wherefore he monday would wait there until the smoking snorting monster which had carried his hero off carried him back  ay wait there little faithful dog with the soft wistful puzzled eyes but it will be many a long bitter day before your boyish comrade comes back to you  the doctor was away on a case that night and susan stalked into mrs blythes room on her way to bed to see if her adored mrs dr dear were comfortable and composed she paused solemnly at the foot of the bed and solemnly declared  mrs dr dear i have made up my mind to be a heroine  mrs dr dear found herself violently inclined to laughwhich was manifestly unfair since she had not laughed when rilla had announced a similar heroic determination to be sure rilla was a slim whiterobed thing with a flowerlike face and starry young eyes aglow with feeling whereas susan was arrayed in a grey flannel nightgown of strait simplicity and had a strip of red woollen worsted tied around her grey hair as a charm against neuralgia but that should not make any vital difference was it not the spirit that counted yet mrs blythe was hard put to it not to laugh  i am not proceeded susan firmly going to lament or whine or question the wisdom of the almighty any more as i have been doing lately whining and shirking and blaming providence do not get us anywhere we have just got to grapple with whatever we have to do whether it is weeding the onion patch or running the government i shall grapple those blessed boys have gone to war and we women mrs dr dear must tarry by the stuff and keep a stiff upper lip    chapter vii  a warbaby and a soup tureen  liege and namurand now brussels the doctor shook his head i dont like iti dont like it  do not you lose heart dr dear they were just defended by foreigners said susan superbly wait you till the germans come against the british there will be a very different story to tell and that you may tie to  the doctor shook his head again but a little less gravely perhaps they all shared subconsciously in susans belief that the thin grey line was unbreakable even by the victorious rush of germanys ready millions at any rate when the terrible day camethe first of many terrible dayswith the news that the british army was driven back they stared at each other in blank dismay  itit cant be true gasped nan taking a brief refuge in temporary incredulity  i felt that there was to be bad news today said susan for that catcreature turned into mr hyde this morning without rhyme or reason for it and that was no good omen  a broken a beaten but not a demoralized army muttered the doctor from a london dispatch can it be englands army of which such a thing is said  it will be a long time now before the war is ended said mrs blythe despairingly  susans faith which had for a moment been temporarily submerged now reappeared triumphantly  remember mrs dr dear that the british army is not the british navy never forget that and the russians are on their way too though russians are people i do not know much about and consequently will not tie to  the russians will not be in time to save paris said walter gloomily paris is the heart of franceand the road to it is open oh i wishhe stopped abruptly and went out  after a paralysed day the ingleside folk found it was possible to carry on even in the face of everdarkening bad news susan worked fiercely in her kitchen the doctor went out on his round of visits nan and di returned to their red cross activities mrs blythe went to charlottetown to attend a red cross convention rilla after relieving her feelings by a stormy fit of tears in rainbow valley and an outburst in her diary remembered that she had elected to be brave and heroic and she thought it really was heroic to volunteer to drive about the glen and four winds one day collecting promised red cross supplies with abner crawfords old grey horse one of the ingleside horses was lame and the doctor needed the other so there was nothing for it but the crawford nag a placid unhasting thickskinned creature with an amiable habit of stopping every few yards to kick a fly off one leg with the foot of the other rilla felt that this coupled with the fact that the germans were only fifty miles from paris was hardly to be endured but she started off gallantly on an errand fraught with amazing results  late in the afternoon she found herself with a buggy full of parcels at the entrance to a grassy deeprutted lane leading to the harbour shore wondering whether it was worth while to call down at the anderson house the andersons were desperately poor and it was not likely mrs anderson had anything to give on the other hand her husband who was an englishman by birth and who had been working in kingsport when the war broke out had promptly sailed for england to enlist there without it may be said coming home or sending much hard cash to represent him so possibly mrs anderson might feel hurt if she were overlooked rilla decided to call there were times afterwards when she wished she hadnt but in the long run she was very thankful that she did  the anderson house was a small and tumbledown affair crouching in a grove of battered spruces near the shore as if rather ashamed of itself and anxious to hide rilla tied her grey nag to the rickety fence and went to the door it was open and the sight she saw bereft her temporarily of the power of speech or motion  through the open door of the small bedroom opposite her rilla saw mrs anderson lying on the untidy bed and mrs anderson was dead there was no doubt of that neither was there any doubt that the big frowzy redheaded redfaced overfat woman sitting near the doorway smoking a pipe quite comfortably was very much alive she rocked idly back and forth amid her surroundings of squalid disorder and paid no attention whatever to the piercing wails proceeding from a cradle in the middle of the room  rilla knew the woman by sight and reputation her name was mrs conover she lived down at the fishing village she was a greataunt of mrs anderson and she drank as well as smoked  rillas first impulse was to turn and flee but that would never do perhaps this woman repulsive as she was needed helpthough she certainly did not look as if she were worrying over the lack of it  come in said mrs conover removing her pipe and staring at rilla with her little ratlike eyes  isis mrs anderson really dead asked rilla timidly as she stepped over the sill  dead as a door nail responded mrs conover cheerfully kicked the bucket half an hour ago ive sent jen conover to phone for the undertaker and get some help up from the shore youre the doctors miss aint ye have a cheer  rilla did not see any chair which was not cluttered with something she remained standing  wasnt itvery sudden  well shes been apining ever since that worthless jim lit out for englandwhich i say its a pity as he ever left its my belief she was took for death when she heard the news that young un there was born a fortnight ago and since then shes just gone down and today she up and died without a soul expecting it  is there anything i can do toto help hesitated rilla  bless yez nounless yeve a knack with kids i havent that young un there never lets up squalling day or night ive just got that i take no notice of it  rilla tiptoed gingerly over to the cradle and more gingerly still pulled down the dirty blanket she had no intention of touching the babyshe had no knack with kids either she saw an ugly midget with a red distorted little face rolled up in a piece of dingy old flannel she had never seen an uglier baby yet a feeling of pity for the desolate orphaned mite which had come out of the everywhere into such a dubious here took sudden possession of her  what is going to become of the baby she asked  lord knows said mrs conover candidly min worried awful over that before she died she kept on asaying oh what will become of my pore baby till it really got on my nerves i aint agoing to trouble myself with it i can tell yez i brung up a boy that my sister left and he skinned out as soon as he got to be some good and wont give me a mite o help in my old age ungrateful whelp as he is i told min itd have to be sent to an orphan asylum till wed see if jim ever came back to look after it would yez believe it she didnt relish the idee but thats the long and short of it  but who will look after it until it can be taken to the asylum persisted rilla somehow the babys fate worried her  spose ill have to grunted mrs conover she put away her pipe and took an unblushing swig from a black bottle she produced from a shelf near her its my opinion the kid wont live long its sickly min never had no gimp and i guess it haint either likely it wont trouble any one long and good riddance sez i  rilla drew the blanket down a little farther  why the baby isnt dressed she exclaimed in a shocked tone  who was to dress him id like to know demanded mrs conover truculently i hadnt timetook me all the time there was looking after min sides as i told yez i dont know nithing about kids old mrs billy crawford she was here when it was born and she washed it and rolled it up in that flannel and jen shes tended it a bit since the critter is warm enough this weather would melt a brass monkey  rilla was silent looking down at the crying baby she had never encountered any of the tragedies of life before and this one smote her to the core of her heart the thought of the poor mother going down into the valley of the shadow alone fretting about her baby with no one near but this abominable old woman hurt her terribly if she had only come a little sooner yet what could she have donewhat could she do now she didnt know but she must do something she hated babiesbut she simply could not go away and leave that poor little creature with mrs conoverwho was applying herself again to her black bottle and would probably be helplessly drunk before anybody came  i cant stay thought rilla mr crawford said i must be home by suppertime because he wanted the pony this evening himself oh what can i do  she made a sudden desperate impulsive resolution  ill take the baby home with me she said can i  sure if yez wants to said mrs conover amiably i haint any objection take it and welcome  ii cant carry it said rilla i have to drive the horse and id be afraid id drop it is there aa basket anywhere that i could put it in  not as i knows on there aint much here of anything i kin tell yez min was pore and as shiftless as jim ef ye opens that drawer over there yezll find a few baby cloes best take them along  rilla got the clothesthe cheap sleazy garments the poor mother had made ready as best she could but this did not solve the pressing problem of the babys transportation rilla looked helplessly round oh for motheror susan her eyes fell on an enormous blue soup tureen at the back of the dresser  may i have this toto lay him in she asked  well taint mine but i guess yez kin take it dont smash it if yez can helpjim might make a fuss about it if he comes back alivewhich he sure will seein he aint any good he brung that old tureen out from england with himsaid itd always been in the family him and min never used itnever had enough soup to put in itbut jim thought the world of it he was mighty perticuler about some things but didnt worry him none that there werent much in the way o eatables to put in the dishes  for the first time in her life rilla blythe touched a babylifted itrolled it in a blanket trembling with nervousness lest she drop it ororbreak it then she put it in the soup tureen  is there any fear of it smothering she asked anxiously  not much odds if it do said mrs conover  horrified rilla loosened the blanket round the babys face a little the mite had stopped crying and was blinking up at her it had big dark eyes in its ugly little face  better not let the wind blow on it admonished mrs conover take its breath if it do  rilla wrapped the tattered little quilt around the soup tureen  will you hand this to me after i get into the buggy please  sure i will said mrs conover getting up with a grunt  and so it was that rilla blythe who had driven to the anderson house a selfconfessed hater of babies drove away from it carrying one in a soup tureen on her lap  rilla thought she would never get to ingleside in the soup tureen there was an uncanny silence in one way she was thankful the baby did not cry but she wished it would give an occasional squeak to prove that it was alive suppose it were smothered rilla dared not unwrap it to see lest the wind which was now blowing a hurricane should take its breath whatever dreadful thing that might be she was a thankful girl when at last she reached harbour at ingleside  rilla carried the soup tureen to the kitchen and set it on the table under susans eyes susan looked into the tureen and for once in her life was so completely floored that she had not a word to say  what in the world is this asked the doctor coming in  rilla poured out her story i just had to bring it father she concluded i couldnt leave it there  what are you going to do with it asked the doctor coolly  rilla hadnt exactly expected this kind of question  wewe can keep it here for awhilecant weuntil something can be arranged she stammered confusedly  dr blythe walked up and down the kitchen for a moment or two while the baby stared at the white walls of the soup tureen and susan showed signs of returning animation  presently the doctor confronted rilla  a young baby means a great deal of additional work and trouble in a household rilla nan and di are leaving for redmond next week and neither your mother nor susan is able to assume so much extra care under present conditions if you want to keep that baby here you must attend to it yourself  me rilla was dismayed into being ungrammatical whyfatherii couldnt  younger girls than you have had to look after babies my advice and susans is at your disposal if you cannot then the baby must go back to meg conover its lease of life will be short if it does for it is evident that it is a delicate child and requires particular care i doubt if it would survive even if sent to an orphans home but i cannot have your mother and susan overtaxed  the doctor walked out of the kitchen looking very stern and immovable in his heart he knew quite well that the small inhabitant of the big soup tureen would remain at ingleside but he meant to see if rilla could not be induced to rise to the occasion  rilla sat looking blankly at the baby it was absurd to think she could take care of it butthat poor little frail dead mother who had worried about itthat dreadful old meg conover  susan what must be done for a baby she asked dolefully  you must keep it warm and dry and wash it every day and be sure the water is neither too hot nor too cold and feed it every two hours if it has colic you put hot things on its stomach said susan rather feebly and flatly for her  the baby began to cry again  it must be hungryit has to be fed anyhow said rilla desperately tell me what to get for it susan and ill get it  under susans directions a ration of milk and water was prepared and a bottle obtained from the doctors office then rilla lifted the baby out of the soup tureen and fed it she brought down the old basket of her own infancy from the attic and laid the now sleeping baby in it she put the soup tureen away in the pantry then she sat down to think things over  the result of her thinking things over was that she went to susan when the baby woke  im going to see what i can do susan i cant let that poor little thing go back to mrs conover tell me how to wash and dress it  under susans supervision rilla bathed the baby susan dared not help other than by suggestion for the doctor was in the livingroom and might pop in at any moment susan had learned by experience that when dr blythe put his foot down and said a thing must be that thing was rilla set her teeth and went ahead in the name of goodness how many wrinkles and kinks did a baby have why there wasnt enough of it to take hold of oh suppose she let it slip into the waterit was so wobbly if it would only stop howling like that how could such a tiny morsel make such an enormous noise its shrieks could be heard over ingleside from cellar to attic  am i really hurting it much susan do you suppose she asked piteously  no dearie most new babies hate like poison to be washed you are real knacky for a beginner keep your hand under its back whatever you do and keep cool  keep cool rilla was oozing perspiration at every pore when the baby was dried and dressed and temporarily quieted with another bottle she was as limp as a rag  what must i do with it tonight susan  a baby by day was dreadful enough a baby by night was unthinkable  set the basket on a chair by your bed and keep it covered you will have to feed it once or twice in the night so you would better take the oil heater upstairs if you cannot manage it call me and i will go doctor or no doctor  but susan if it cries  the baby however did not cry it was surprisingly goodperhaps because its poor little stomach was filled with proper food it slept most of the night but rilla did not she was afraid to go to sleep for fear something would happen to the baby she prepared its three oclock ration with a grim determination that she would not call susan oh was she dreaming was it really she rilla blythe who had got into this absurd predicament she did not care if the germans were near parisshe did not care if they were in parisif only the baby wouldnt cry or choke or smother or have convulsions babies did have convulsions didnt they oh why had she forgotten to ask susan what she must do if the baby had convulsions she reflected rather bitterly that father was very considerate of mothers and susans health but what about hers did he think she could continue to exist if she never got any sleep but she was not going to back down nownot she she would look after this detestable little animal if it killed her she would get a book on baby hygiene and be beholden to nobody she would never go to father for adviceshe wouldnt bother motherand she would only condescend to susan in dire extremity they would all see  thus it came about that mrs blythe when she returned home two nights later and asked susan where rilla was was electrified by susans composed reply  shes upstairs mrs dr dear putting her baby to bed    chapter viii  rilla decides  families and individuals alike soon become used to new conditions and accept them unquestioningly by the time a week had elapsed it seemed as it the anderson baby had always been at ingleside after the first three distracted nights rilla began to sleep again waking automatically to attend to her charge on schedule time she bathed and fed and dressed it as skilfully as if she had been doing it all her life she liked neither her job nor the baby any the better she still handled it as gingerly as if it were some kind of a small lizard and a breakable lizard at that but she did her work thoroughly and there was not a cleaner bettercaredfor infant in glen st mary she even took to weighing the creature every day and jotting the result down in her diary but sometimes she asked herself pathetically why unkind destiny had ever led her down the anderson lane on that fatal day shirley nan and di did not tease her as much as she had expected they all seemed rather stunned by the mere fact of rilla adopting a warbaby perhaps too the doctor had issued instructions walter of course never had teased her over anything one day he told her she was a brick  it took more courage for you to tackle that five pounds of new infant rillamyrilla than it would be for jem to face a mile of germans i wish i had half your pluck he said ruefully  rilla was very proud of walters approval nevertheless she wrote gloomily in her diary that night  i wish i could like the baby a little bit it would make things easier but i dont ive heard people say that when you took care of a baby you got fond of itbut you donti dont anyway and its a nuisanceit interferes with everything it just ties me downand now of all times when im trying to get the junior reds started and i couldnt go to alice clows party last night and i was just dying to of course father isnt really unreasonable and i can always get an hour or two off in the evening when its necessary but i knew he wouldnt stand for my being out half the night and leaving susan or mother to see to the baby i suppose it was just as well because the thing did take colicor somethingabout one oclock it didnt kick or stiffen out so i knew that according to morgan it wasnt crying for temper and it wasnt hungry and no pins were sticking in it it screamed till it was black in the face i got up and heated water and put the hotwater bottle on its stomach and it howled worse than ever and drew up its poor wee thin legs i was afraid i had burnt it but i dont believe i did then i walked the floor with it although morgan on infants says that should never be done i walked miles and oh i was so tired and discouraged and madyes i was i could have shaken the creature if it had been big enough to shake but it wasnt father was out on a case and mother had had a headache and susan is squiffy because when she and morgan differ i insist upon going by what morgan says so i was determined i wouldnt call her unless i had to  finally miss oliver came in she has rooms with nan now not me all because of the baby and i am brokenhearted about it i miss our long talks after we went to bed so much it was the only time i ever had her to myself i hated to think the babys yells had wakened her up for she has so much to bear now mr grant is at valcartier too and miss oliver feels it dreadfully though she is splendid about it she thinks he will never come back and her eyes just break my heartthey are so tragic she said it wasnt the baby that woke hershe hadnt been able to sleep because the germans are so near paris she took the little wretch and laid it flat on its stomach across her knee and thumped its back gently a few times and it stopped shrieking and went right off to sleep and slept like a lamb the rest of the night i didnti was too worn out  im having a perfectly dreadful time getting the junior reds started i succeeded in getting betty mead as president and i am secretary but they put jen vickers in as treasurer and i despise her she is the sort of girl who calls any clever handsome or distinguished people she knows slightly by their first namesbehind their backs and she is sly and twofaced una doesnt mind of course she is willing to do anything that comes to hand and never minds whether she has an office or not she is just a perfect angel while i am only angelic in spots and demonic in other spots i wish walter would take a fancy to her but he never seems to think about her in that way although i heard him say once she was like a tea rose she is too and she gets imposed upon just because she is so sweet and willing but i dont allow people to impose on rilla blythe and that you may tie to as susan says  just as i expected olive was determined we should have lunch served at our meetings we had a battle royal over it the majority was against eats and now the minority is sulking irene howard was on the eats side and she has been very cool to me ever since and it makes me feel miserable i wonder if mother and mrs elliott have problems in the senior society too i suppose they have but they just go on calmly in spite of everything i go onbut not calmlyi rage and crybut i do it all in private and blow off steam in this diary and when its over i vow ill show them i never sulk i detest people who sulk anyhow weve got the society started and were to meet once a week and were all going to learn to knit  shirley and i went down to the station again to try to induce dog monday to come home but we failed all the family have tried and failed three days after jem had gone walter went down and brought monday home by main force in the buggy and shut him up for three days then monday went on a hunger strike and howled like a banshee night and day we had to let him out or he would have starved to death  so we have decided to let him alone and father has arranged with the butcher near the station to feed him with bones and scraps besides one of us goes down nearly every day to take him something he just lies curled up in the shippingshed and every time a train comes in he will rush over to the platform wagging his tail expectantly and tear around to every one who comes off the train and then when the train goes and he realizes that jem has not come he creeps dejectedly back to his shed with his disappointed eyes and lies down patiently to wait for the next train mr gray the station master says there are times when he can hardly help crying from sheer sympathy one day some boys threw stones at monday and old johnny mead who never was known to take notice of anything before snatched up a meat axe in the butchers shop and chased them through the village nobody has molested monday since  kenneth ford has gone back to toronto he came up two evenings ago to say goodbye i wasnt homesome clothes had to be made for the baby and mrs meredith offered to help me so i was over at the manse and i didnt see kenneth not that it matters he told nan to say goodbye to spider for him and tell me not to forget him wholly in my absorbing maternal duties if he could leave such a frivolous insulting message as that for me it shows plainly that our beautiful hour on the sandshore meant nothing to him and i am not going to think about him or it again  fred arnold was at the manse and walked home with me he is the new methodist ministers son and very nice and clever and would be quite handsome if it were not for his nose it is a really dreadful nose when he talks of commonplace things it does not matter so much but when he talks of poetry and ideals the contrast between his nose and his conversation is too much for me and i want to shriek with laughter it is really not fair because everything he said was perfectly charming and if somebody like kenneth had said it i would have been enraptured when i listened to him with my eyes cast down i was quite fascinated but as soon as i looked up and saw his nose the spell was broken he wants to enlist too but cant because he is only seventeen mrs elliott met us as we were walking through the village and could not have looked more horrified if she caught me walking with the kaiser himself mrs elliott detests the methodists and all their works father says it is an obsession with her  about 1st september there was an exodus from ingleside and the manse faith nan di and walter left for redmond carl betook himself to his harbour head school and shirley was off to queens rilla was left alone at ingleside and would have been very lonely if she had had time to be she missed walter keenly since their talk in rainbow valley they had grown very near together and rilla discussed problems with walter which she never mentioned to others but she was so busy with the junior reds and her baby that there was rarely a spare minute for loneliness sometimes after she went to bed she cried a little in her pillow over walters absence and jem at valcartier and kenneths unromantic farewell message but she was generally asleep before the tears got fairly started  shall i make arrangements to have the baby sent to hopetown the doctor asked one day two weeks after the babys arrival at ingleside  for a moment rilla was tempted to say yes the baby could be sent to hopetownit would be decently looked aftershe could have her free days and untrammelled nights back again butbutthat poor young mother who hadnt wanted it to go to the asylum rilla couldnt get that out of her thoughts and that very morning she discovered that the baby had gained eight ounces since its coming to ingleside rilla had felt such a thrill of pride over this  youyou said it mightnt live if it went to hopetown she said  it mightnt somehow institutional care no matter how good it may be doesnt always succeed with delicate babies but you know what it means if you want it kept here rilla  ive taken care of it for a fortnightand it has gained half a pound cried rilla i think wed better wait until we hear from its father anyhow he mightnt want to have it sent to an orphan asylum when he is fighting the battles of his country  the doctor and mrs blythe exchanged amused satisfied smiles behind rillas back and nothing more was said about hopetown  then the smile faded from the doctors face the germans were twenty miles from paris horrible tales were beginning to appear in the papers of deeds done in martyred belgium life was very tense at ingleside for the older people  we eat up the war news gertrude oliver told mrs meredith trying to laugh and failing we study the maps and nip the whole hun army in a few welldirected strategic moves but papa joffre hasnt the benefit of our adviceand so parismustfall  will they reach itwill not some mighty hand yet intervene murmured john meredith  i teach school like one in a dream continued gertrude then i come home and shut myself in my room and walk the floor i am wearing a path right across nans carpet we are so horribly near this war  them german men are at senlis nothing nor nobody can save paris now wailed cousin sophia cousin sophia had taken to reading the newspapers and had learned more about the geography of northern france if not about the pronunciation of french names in her seventyfirst year than she had ever known in her schooldays  i have not such a poor opinion of the almighty or of kitchener said susan stubbornly i see there is a bernstoff man in the states who says that the war is over and germany has wonand they tell me whiskersonthemoon says the same thing and is quite pleased about it but i could tell them both that it is chancy work counting chickens even the day before they are hatched and bears have been known to live long after their skins were sold  why aint the british navy doing more persisted cousin sophia  even the british navy cannot sail on dry land sophia crawford i have not given up hope and i shall not tomascow and mobbage and all such barbarous names to the contrary notwithstanding mrs dr dear can you tell me if rheims is rimes or reems or rames or rems  i believe its really more like rhangs susan  oh those french names groaned susan  they tell me the germans has about ruined the church there sighed cousin sophia i always thought the germans was christians  a church is bad enough but their doings in belgium are far worse said susan grimly when i heard the doctor reading about them bayonetting the babies mrs dr dear i just thought oh what if it were our little jem i was stirring the soup when that thought came to me and i just felt that if i could have lifted that saucepan full of that boiling soup and thrown it at the kaiser i would not have lived in vain  tomorrowtomorrowwill bring the news that the germans are in paris said gertrude oliver through her tense lips she had one of those souls that are always tied to the stake burning in the suffering of the world around them apart from her own personal interest in the war she was racked by the thought of paris falling into the ruthless hands of the hordes who had burned louvain and ruined the wonder of rheims  but on the morrow and the next morrow came the news of the miracle of the marne rilla rushed madly home from the office waving the enterprise with its big red headlines susan ran out with trembling hands to hoist the flag the doctor stalked about muttering thank god mrs blythe cried and laughed and cried again  god just put out his hand and touched themthus farno farther said mr meredith that evening  rilla was singing upstairs as she put the baby to bed paris was savedthe war was overgermany had lostthere would soon be an end nowjem and jerry would be back the black clouds had rolled by  dont you dare have colic this joyful night she told the baby if you do ill clap you back into your soup tureen and ship you off to hopetownby freighton the early train you have got beautiful eyesand youre not quite as red and wrinkled as you werebut you havent a speck of hairand your hands are like little clawsand i dont like you a bit better than i ever did but i hope your poor little white mother knows that youre tucked in a soft basket with a bottle of milk as rich as morgan allows instead of perishing by inches with old meg conover and i hope she doesnt know that i nearly drowned you that first morning when susan wasnt there and i let you slip right out of my hands into the water why will you be so slippery no i dont like you and i never will but for all that im going to make a decent upstanding infant of you you are going to get as fat as a selfrespecting child should be for one thing i am not going to have people saying what a puny little thing that baby of rilla blythes is as old mrs drew said at the senior red cross yesterday if i cant love you i mean to be proud of you at least    chapter ix  doc has a misadventure  the war will not be over before next spring now said dr blythe when it became apparent that the long battle of the aisne had resulted in a stalemate  rilla was murmuring knit four purl one under her breath and rocking the babys cradle with one foot morgan disapproved of cradles for babies but susan did not and it was worth while to make some slight sacrifice of principle to keep susan in good humour she laid down her knitting for a moment and said oh how can we bear it so longthen picked up her sock and went on the rilla of two months before would have rushed off to rainbow valley and cried  miss oliver sighed and mrs blythe clasped her hands for a moment then susan said briskly well we must just gird up our loins and pitch in business as usual is englands motto they tell me mrs dr dear and i have taken it for mine not thinking i could easily find a better i shall make the same kind of pudding today i always make on saturday it is a good deal of trouble to make and that is well for it will employ my thoughts i will remember that kitchener is at the helm and joffer is doing very well for a frenchman i shall get that box of cake off to little jem and finish that pair of socks today likewise a sock a day is my allowance old mrs albert mead of harbour head manages a pair and a half a day but she has nothing to do but knit you know mrs dr dear she has been bedrid for years and she has been worrying terrible because she was no good to anybody and a dreadful expense and yet could not die and be out of the way and now they tell me she is quite chirked up and resigned to living because there is something she can do and she knits for the soldiers from daylight to dark even cousin sophia has taken to knitting mrs dr dear and it is a good thing for she cannot think of quite so many doleful speeches to make when her hands are busy with her needles instead of being folded on her stomach she thinks we will all be germans this time next year but i tell her it will take more than a year to make a german out of me do you know that rick macallister has enlisted mrs dr dear and they say joe milgrave would too only he is afraid that if he does that whiskersonthemoon will not let him have miranda whiskers says that he will believe the stories of german atrocities when he sees them and that it is a good thing that rangs cathedral has been destroyed because it was a roman catholic church now i am not a roman catholic mrs dr dear being born and bred a good presbyterian and meaning to live and die one but i maintain that the catholics have as good a right to their churches as we have to ours and that the huns had no kind of business to destroy them just think mrs dr dear concluded susan pathetically how we would feel if a german shell knocked down the spire of our church here in the glen and im sure it is every bit as bad to think of rangs cathedral being hammered to pieces  and meanwhile everywhere the lads of the world rich and poor low and high white and brown were following the pipers call  even billy andrews boy is goingand janes only sonand dianas little jack said mrs blythe priscillas son has gone from japan and stellas from vancouverand both the rev jos boys philippa writes that her boys went right away not being afflicted with her indecision  jem says that he thinks they will be leaving very soon now and that he will not be able to get leave to come so far before they go as they will have to start at a few hours notice said the doctor passing the letter to his wife  that is not fair said susan indignantly has sir sam hughes no regard for our feelings the idea of whisking that blessed boy away to europe without letting us even have a last glimpse of him if i were you doctor dear i would write to the papers about it  perhaps it is as well said the disappointed mother i dont believe i could bear another parting from himnow that i know the war will not be over as soon as we hoped when he left first oh if onlybut no i wont say it like susan and rilla concluded mrs blythe achieving a laugh i am determined to be a heroine  youre all good stuff said the doctor im proud of my women folk even rilla here my lily of the field is running a red cross society full blast and saving a little life for canada thats a good piece of work rilla daughter of anne what are you going to call your warbaby  im waiting to hear from jim anderson said rilla he may want to name his own child  but as the autumn weeks went by no word came from jim anderson who had never been heard from since he sailed from halifax and to whom the fate of wife and child seemed a matter of indifference eventually rilla decided to call the baby james and susan opined that kitchener should be added thereto so james kitchener anderson became the possessor of a name somewhat more imposing than himself the ingleside family promptly shortened it to jims but susan obstinately called him little kitchener and nothing else  jims is no name for a christian child mrs dr dear she said disapprovingly cousin sophia says it is too flippant and for once i consider she utters sense though i would not please her by openly agreeing with her as for the child he is beginning to look something like a baby and i must admit that rilla is wonderful with him though i would not pamper pride by saying so to her face mrs dr dear i shall never no never forget the first sight i had of that infant lying in that big soup tureen rolled up in dirty flannel it is not often that susan baker is flabbergasted but flabbergasted i was then and that you may tie to for one awful moment i thought my mind had given way and that i was seeing visions then thinks i no i never heard of anyone having a vision of a soup tureen so it must be real at least and i plucked up confidence when i heard the doctor tell rilla that she must take care of the baby i thought he was joking for i did not believe for a minute she would or could do it but you see what has happened and it is making a woman of her when we have to do a thing mrs dr dear we can do it  susan added another proof to this concluding dictum of hers one day in october the doctor and his wife were away rilla was presiding over jims afternoon siesta upstairs purling four and knitting one with ceaseless vim susan was seated on the back veranda shelling beans and cousin sophia was helping her peace and tranquility brooded over the glen the sky was fleeced over with silvery shining clouds rainbow valley lay in a soft autumnal haze of fairy purple the maple grove was a burning bush of colour and the hedge of sweetbriar around the kitchen yard was a thing of wonder in its subtle tintings it did not seem that strife could be in the world and susans faithful heart was lulled into a brief forgetfulness although she had lain awake most of the preceding night thinking of little jem far out on the atlantic where the great fleet was carrying canadas first army across the ocean even cousin sophia looked less melancholy than usual and admitted that there was not much fault to be found in the day although there was no doubt it was a weatherbreeder and there would be an awful storm on its heels  things is too calm to last she said  as if in confirmation of her assertion a most unearthly din suddenly arose behind them it was quite impossible to describe the confused medley of bangs and rattles and muffled shrieks and yowls that proceeded from the kitchen accompanied by occasional crashes susan and cousin sophia stared at each other in dismay  what upon airth has bruk loose in there gasped cousin sophia  it must be that hydecat gone clean mad at last muttered susan i have always expected it  rilla came flying out of the side door of the livingroom  what has happened she demanded  it is beyond me to say but that possessed beast of yours is evidently at the bottom of it said susan do not go near him at least i will open the door and peep in there goes some more of the crockery i have always said that the devil was in him and that i will tie to  it is my opinion that the cat has hydrophobia said cousin sophia solemnly i once heard of a cat that went mad and bit three peopleand they all died a most terrible death and turned black as ink  undismayed by this susan opened the door and looked in the floor was littered with fragments of broken dishes for it seemed that the fatal tragedy had taken place on the long dresser where susans array of cooking bowls had been marshalled in shining state around the kitchen tore a frantic cat with his head wedged tightly in an old salmon can blindly he careered about with shrieks and profanity commingled now banging the can madly against anything he encountered now trying vainly to wrench it off with his paws  the sight was so funny that rilla doubled up with laughter susan looked at her reproachfully  i see nothing to laugh at that beast has broken your mas big blue mixingbowl that she brought from green gables when she was married that is no small calamity in my opinion but the thing to consider now is how to get that can off hydes head  dont you dast go touching it exclaimed cousin sophia galvanized into animation it might be your death shut the kitchen up and send for albert  i am not in the habit of sending for albert during family difficulties said susan loftily that beast is in torment and whatever my opinion of him may be i cannot endure to see him suffering pain you keep away rilla for little kitcheners sake and i will see what i can do  susan stalked undauntedly into the kitchen seized an old storm coat of the doctors and after a wild pursuit and several fruitless dashes and pounces managed to throw it over the cat and can then she proceeded to saw the can loose with a canopener while rilla held the squirming animal rolled in the coat anything like docs shrieks while the process was going on was never heard at ingleside susan was in mortal dread that the albert crawfords would hear it and conclude she was torturing the creature to death doc was a wrathful and indignant cat when he was freed evidently he thought the whole thing was a putup job to bring him low he gave susan a baleful glance by way of gratitude and rushed out of the kitchen to take sanctuary in the jungle of the sweetbriar hedge where he sulked for the rest of the day susan swept up her broken dishes grimly  the huns themselves couldnt have worked more havoc here she said bitterly but when people will keep a satanic animal like that in spite of all warnings they cannot complain when their wedding bowls get broken things have come to a pretty pass when an honest woman cannot leave her kitchen for a few minutes without a fiend of a cat rampaging through it with his head in a salmon can    chapter x  the troubles of rilla  october passed out and the dreary days of november and december dragged by the world shook with the thunder of contending armies antwerp fellturkey declared wargallant little serbia gathered herself together and struck a deadly blow at her oppressor and in quiet hillgirdled glen st mary thousands of miles away hearts beat with hope and fear over the varying dispatches from day to day  a few months ago said miss oliver we thought and talked in terms of glen st mary now we think and talk in terms of military tactics and diplomatic intrigue  there was just one great event every daythe coming of the mail even susan admitted that from the time the mailcouriers buggy rumbled over the little bridge between the station and the village until the papers were brought home and read she could not work properly  i must take up my knitting then and knit hard till the papers come mrs dr dear knitting is something you can do even when your heart is going like a triphammer and the pit of your stomach feels all gone and your thoughts are catawampus then when i see the headlines be they good or be they bad i calm down and am able to go about my business again it is an unfortunate thing that the mail comes in just when our dinner rush is on and i think the government could arrange things better but the drive on calais has failed as i felt perfectly sure it would and the kaiser will not eat his christmas dinner in london this year do you know mrs dr dearsusans voice lowered as a token that she was going to impart a very shocking piece of informationi have been told on good authorityor else you may be sure i would not be repeating it when it concerns a minsterthat the rev mr arnold goes to charlottetown every week and takes a turkish bath for his rheumatism the idea of him doing that when we are at war with turkey one of his own deacons has always insisted that mr arnolds theology was not sound and i am beginning to believe that there is some reason to fear it well i must bestir myself this afternoon and get little jems christmas cake packed up for him he will enjoy it if the blessed boy is not drowned in mud before that time  jem was in camp on salisbury plain and was writing gay cheery letters home in spite of the mud walter was at redmond and his letters to rilla were anything but cheerful she never opened one without a dread tugging at her heart that it would tell her he had enlisted his unhappiness made her unhappy she wanted to put her arm round him and comfort him as she had done that day in rainbow valley she hated everybody who was responsible for walters unhappiness  he will go yet she murmured miserably to herself one afternoon as she sat alone in rainbow valley reading a letter from him he will go yetand if he does i just cant bear it  walter wrote that some one had sent him an envelope containing a white feather  i deserved it rilla i felt that i ought to put it on and wear itproclaiming myself to all redmond the coward i know i am the boys of my year are goinggoing every day two or three of them join up some days i almost make up my mind to do itand then i see myself thrusting a bayonet through another mansome womans husband or sweetheart or sonperhaps the father of little childreni see myself lying alone torn and mangled burning with thirst on a cold wet field surrounded by dead and dying menand i know i never can i cant face even the thought of it how could i face the reality there are times when i wish i had never been born life has always seemed such a beautiful thing to meand now it is a hideous thing rillamyrilla if it werent for your lettersyour dear bright merry funny comical believing lettersi think id give up and unas una is really a little brick isnt she theres a wonderful fineness and firmness under all that shy wistful girlishness of her she hasnt your knack of writing laughprovoking epistles but theres something in her lettersi dont know whatthat makes me feel at least while im reading them that i could even go to the front not that she ever says a word about my goingor hints that i ought to goshe isnt that kind its just the spirit of themthe personality that is in them well i cant go you have a brother and una has a friend who is a coward  oh i wish walter wouldnt write such things sighed rilla it hurts me he isnt a cowardhe isnthe isnt  she looked wistfully about herat the little woodland valley and the grey lonely fallows beyond how everything reminded her of walter the red leaves still clung to the wild sweetbriars that overhung a curve of the brook their stems were gemmed with the pearls of the gentle rain that had fallen a little while before walter had once written a poem describing them the wind was sighing and rustling among the frosted brown bracken ferns then lessening sorrowfully away down the brook walter had said once that he loved the melancholy of the autumn wind on a november day the old tree lovers still clasped each other in a faithful embrace and the white lady now a great whitebranched tree stood out beautifully fine against the grey velvet sky walter had named them long ago and last november when he had walked with her and miss oliver in the valley he had said looking at the leafless lady with a young silver moon hanging over her a white birch is a beautiful pagan maiden who has never lost the eden secret of being naked and unashamed miss oliver had said put that into a poem walter and he had done so and read it to them the next dayjust a short thing with goblin imagination in every line of it oh how happy they had been then  wellrilla scrambled to her feettime was up jims would soon be awakehis lunch had to be preparedhis little slips had to be ironedthere was a committee meeting of the junior reds that nightthere was her new knitting bag to finishit would be the handsomest bag in the junior societyhandsomer even than irene howardsshe must get home and get to work she was busy these days from morning till night that little monkey of a jims took so much time but he was growinghe was certainly growing and there were times when rilla felt sure that it was not merely a pious hope but an absolute fact that he was getting decidedly better looking sometimes she felt quite proud of him and sometimes she yearned to spank him but she never kissed him or wanted to kiss him  the germans captured lodz today said miss oliver one december evening when she mrs blythe and susan were busy sewing or knitting in the cosy livingroom this war is at least extending my knowledge of geography schoolmaam though i am three months ago i didnt know there was such a place in the world such as lodz had i heard it mentioned i would have known nothing about it and cared as little i know all about it nowits size its standing its military significance yesterday the news that the germans have captured it in their second rush to warsaw made my heart sink into my boots i woke up in the night and worried over it i dont wonder babies always cry when they wake up in the night everything presses on my soul then and no cloud has a silver lining  when i wake up in the night and cannot go to sleep again remarked susan who was knitting and reading at the same time i pass the moments by torturing the kaiser to death last night i fried him in boiling oil and a great comfort it was to me remembering those belgian babies  if the kaiser were here and had a pain in his shoulder youd be the first to run for the liniment bottle to rub him down laughed miss oliver  would i cried outraged susan would i miss oliver i would rub him down with coal oil miss oliverand leave it to blister that is what i would do and that you may tie to a pain in his shoulder indeed he will have pains all over him before he is through with what he has started  we are told to love our enemies susan said the doctor solemnly  yes our enemies but not king georges enemies doctor dear retorted susan crushingly she was so well pleased with herself over this flattening out of the doctor completely that she even smiled as she polished her glasses susan had never given in to glasses before but she had done so at last in order to be able to read the war newsand not a dispatch got by her can you tell me miss oliver how to pronounce mlawa and bzura and przemysl  that last is a conundrum which nobody seems to have solved yet susan and i can make only a guess at the others  these foreign names are far from being decent in my opinion said disgusted susan  i dare say the austrians and russians would think saskatchewan and musquodoboit about as bad susan said miss oliver the serbians have done wonderfully of late they have captured belgrade  and sent the austrian creatures packing across the danube with a flea in their ear said susan with a relish as she settled down to examine a map of eastern europe prodding each locality with the knitting needle to brand it on her memory cousin sophia said awhile ago that serbia was done for but i told her there was still such a thing as an overruling providence doubt it who might it says here that the slaughter was terrible for all they were foreigners it is awful to think of so many men being killed mrs dr dearfor they are scarce enough as it is  rilla was upstairs relieving her overcharged feelings by writing in her diary  things have all gone catawampus as susan says with me this week part of it was my own fault and part of it wasnt and i seem to be equally unhappy over both parts  i went to town the other day to buy a new winter hat it was the first time nobody insisted on coming with me to help me select it and i felt that mother had really given up thinking of me as a child and i found the dearest hatit was simply bewitching it was a velvet hat of the very shade of rich green that was made for me it just goes with my hair and complexion beautifully bringing out the redbrown shades and what miss oliver calls my creaminess so well only once before in my life have i come across that precise shade of green when i was twelve i had a little beaver hat of it and all the girls in school were wild over it well as soon as i saw this hat i felt that i simply must have itand have it i did the price was dreadful i will not put it down here because i dont want my descendants to know i was guilty of paying so much for a hat in wartime too when everybody isor should betrying to be economical  when i got home and tried on the hat again in my room i was assailed by qualms of course it was very becoming but somehow it seemed too elaborate and fussy for church going and our quiet little doings in the glentoo conspicuous in short it hadnt seemed so at the milliners but here in my little white room it did and that dreadful price tag and the starving belgians when mother saw the hat and the tag she just looked at me mother is some expert at looking father says she looked him into love with her years ago in avonlea school and i can well believe itthough i have heard a weird tale of her banging him over the head with a slate at the very beginning of their acquaintance mother was a limb when she was a little girl i understand and even up to the time when jem went away she was full of ginger but let me return to my muttonthat is to say my new green velvet hat  do you think rilla mother said quietlyfar too quietlythat it was right to spend so much for a hat especially when the need of the world is so great  i paid for it out of my own allowance mother i exclaimed  that is not the point your allowance is based on the principle of a reasonable amount for each thing you need if you pay too much for one thing you must cut off somewhere else and that is not satisfactory but if you think you did right rilla i have no more to say i leave it to your conscience  i wish mother would not leave things to my conscience and anyway what was i to do i couldnt take that hat backi had worn it to a concert in towni had to keep it i was so uncomfortable that i flew into a tempera cold calm deadly temper  mother i said haughtily i am sorry you disapprove of my hat  not of the hat exactly said mother though i consider it in doubtful taste for so young a girlbut of the price you paid for it  being interrupted didnt improve my temper so i went on colder and calmer and deadlier than ever just as if mother had not spoken  but i have to keep it now however i promise you that i will not get another hat for three years or for the duration of the war if it lasts longer than that even youoh the sarcasm i put into the youcannot say that what i paid was too much when spread over at least three years  you will be very tired of that hat before three years rilla said mother with a provoking grin which being interpreted meant that i wouldnt stick it out  tired or not i will wear it that long i said and then i marched upstairs and cried to think that i had been sarcastic to mother  i hate that hat already but three years or the duration of the war i said and three years or the duration of the war it shall be i vowed and i shall keep my vow cost what it will  that is one of the catawampus things the other is that i have quarrelled with irene howardor she quarrelled with meor no we both quarrelled  the junior red cross met here yesterday the hour of meeting was halfpast two but irene came at halfpast one because she got the chance of a drive down from the upper glen irene hasnt been a bit nice to me since the fuss about the eats and besides i feel sure she resents not being president but i have been determined that things should go smoothly so i have never taken any notice and when she came yesterday she seemed so nice and sweet again that i hoped she had got over her huffiness and we could be the chums we used to be  but as soon as we sat down irene began to rub me the wrong way i saw her cast a look at my new knittingbag all the girls have always said irene was jealousminded and i would never believe them before but now i feel that perhaps she is  the first thing she did was to pounce on jimsirene pretends to adore babiespick him out of his cradle and kiss him all over his face now irene knows perfectly well that i dont like to have jims kissed like that it is not hygienic after she had worried him till he began to fuss she looked at me and gave quite a nasty little laugh but she said oh so sweetly  why rilla darling you look as if you thought i was poisoning the baby  oh no i dont irene i saidevery bit as sweetly but you know morgan says that the only place a baby should be kissed is on its forehead for fear of germs and that is my rule with jims  dear me am i so full of germs said irene plaintively i knew she was making fun of me and i began to boil insidebut outside no sign of a simmer i was determined i would not scrap with irene  then she began to bounce jims now morgan says bouncing is almost the worst thing that can be done to a baby i never allow jims to be bounced but irene bounced him and that exasperating child liked it he smiledfor the very first time he is four months old and he has never smiled once before not even mother or susan have been able to coax that thing to smile try as they would and here he was smiling because irene howard bounced him talk of gratitude  i admit that smile made a big difference in him two of the dearest dimples came out in his cheeks and his big brown eyes seemed full of laughter the way irene raved over those dimples was silly i consider you would have supposed she thought she had really brought them into existence but i sewed steadily and did not enthuse and soon irene got tired of bouncing jims and put him back in his cradle he did not like that after being played with and he began to cry and was fussy the rest of the afternoon whereas if irene had only left him alone he would not have been a bit of trouble  irene looked at him and said does he often cry like that as if she had never heard a baby crying before  i explained patiently that children have to cry so many minutes per day in order to expand their lungs morgan says so  if jims didnt cry at all id have to make him cry for at least twenty minutes i said  oh indeed said irene laughing as if she didnt believe me morgan on the care of infants was upstairs or i would soon have convinced her then she said jims didnt have much hairshe had never seen a four months old baby so bald  of course i knew jims hadnt much hairyet but irene said it in a tone that seemed to imply it was my fault that he hadnt any hair i said i had seen dozens of babies every bit as bald as jims and irene said oh very well she hadnt meant to offend mewhen i wasnt offended  it went on like that the rest of the hourirene kept giving me little digs all the time the girls have always said she was revengeful like that if she were peeved about anything but i never believed it before i used to think irene just perfect and it hurt me dreadfully to find she could stoop to this but i corked up my feelings and sewed away for dear life on a belgian childs nightgown  then irene told me the meanest most contemptible thing that someone had said about walter i wont write it downi cant of course she said it made her furious to hear it and all thatbut there was no need for her to tell me such a thing even if she did hear it she simply did it to hurt me  i just exploded how dare you come here and repeat such a thing about my brother irene howard i exclaimed i shall never forgive younever your brother hasnt enlistedhasnt any idea of enlisting  why rilla dear i didnt say it said irene i told you it was mrs george burr and i told her  i dont want to hear what you told her dont you ever speak to me again irene howard  oh course i shouldnt have said that but it just seemed to say itself then the other girls all came in a bunch and i had to calm down and act the hostess part as well as i could irene paired off with olive kirk all the rest of the afternoon and went away without so much as a look so i suppose she means to take me at my word and i dont care for i do not want to be friends with a girl who could repeat such a falsehood about walter but i feel unhappy over it for all that weve always been such good chums and until lately irene was lovely to me and now another illusion has been stripped from my eyes and i feel as if there wasnt such a thing as real true friendship in the world  father got old joe mead to build a kennel for dog monday in the corner of the shippingshed today we thought perhaps monday would come home when the cold weather came but he wouldnt no earthly influence can coax monday away from that shed even for a few minutes there he stays and meets every train so we had to do something to make him comfortable joe built the kennel so that monday could lie in it and still see the platform so we hope he will occupy it  monday has become quite famous a reporter of the enterprise came out from town and photographed him and wrote up the whole story of his faithful vigil it was published in the enterprise and copied all over canada but that doesnt matter to poor little monday jem has gone awaymonday doesnt know where or whybut he will wait until he comes back somehow it comforts me its foolish i suppose but it gives me a feeling that jem will come back or else monday wouldnt keep on waiting for him  jims is snoring beside me in his cradle it is just a cold that makes him snorenot adenoids irene had a cold yesterday and i know she gave it to him kissing him he is not quite such a nuisance as he was he has got some backbone and can sit up quite nicely and he loves his bath now and splashes unsmilingly in the water instead of twisting and shrieking oh shall i ever forget those first two months i dont know how i lived through them but here i am and here is jims and we both are going to carry on i tickled him a little bit tonight when i undressed himi wouldnt bounce him but morgan doesnt mention ticklingjust to see if he would smile for me as well as irene and he didand out popped the dimples what a pity his mother couldnt have seen them  i finished my sixth pair of socks today with the first three i got susan to set the heel for me then i thought that was a bit of shirking so i learned to do it myself i hate itbut i have done so many things i hate since 4th of august that one more or less doesnt matter i just think of jem joking about the mud on salisbury plain and i go at them    chapter xi  dark and bright  at christmas the college boys and girls came home and for a little while ingleside was gay again but all were not therefor the first time one was missing from the circle round the christmas table jem of the steady lips and fearless eyes was far away and rilla felt that the sight of his vacant chair was more than she could endure susan had taken a stubborn freak and insisted on setting out jems place for him as usual with the twisted little napkin ring he had always had since a boy and the odd high green gables goblet that aunt marilla had once given him and from which he always insisted on drinking  that blessed boy shall have his place mrs dr dear said susan firmly and do not you feel over it for you may be sure he is here in spirit and next christmas he will be here in the body wait you till the big push comes in the spring and the war will be over in a jiffy  they tried to think so but a shadow stalked in the background of their determined merrymaking walter too was quiet and dull all through the holidays he showed rilla a cruel anonymous letter he had received at redmonda letter far more conspicuous for malice than for patriotic indignation  nevertheless all it says is true rilla  rilla had caught it from him and thrown it into the fire  there isnt one word of truth in it she declared hotly walter youve got morbidas miss oliver says she gets when she broods too long over one thing  i cant get away from it at redmond rilla the whole college is aflame over the war a perfectly fit fellow of military age who doesnt join up is looked upon as a shirker and treated accordingly dr milne the english professor who has always made a special pet of me has two sons in khaki and i can feel the change in his manner towards me  its not fairyoure not fit  physically i am sound as a bell the unfitness is in the soul and its a taint and a disgrace there dont cry rilla im not going if thats what youre afraid of the pipers music rings in my ears day and nightbut i cannot follow  you would break mothers heart and mine if you did sobbed rilla oh walter one is enough for any family  the holidays were an unhappy time for her still having nan and di and walter and shirley home helped in the enduring of things a letter and book came for her from kenneth ford too some sentences in the letter made her cheeks burn and her heart beatuntil the last paragraph which sent an icy chill over everything  my ankle is about as good as new ill be fit to join up in a couple of months more rillamyrilla it will be some feeling to get into khaki all right little ken will be able to look the whole world in the face then and owe not any man its been rotten lately since ive been able to walk without limping people who dont know look at me as much as to say slacker well they wont have the chance to look it much longer  i hate this war said rilla bitterly as she gazed out into the maple grove that was a chill glory of pink and gold in the winter sunset  nineteenfourteen has gone said dr blythe on new years day its sun which rose fairly has set in blood what will nineteenfifteen bring  victory said susan for once laconic  do you really believe well win the war susan said miss oliver drearily she had come over from lowbridge to spend the day and see walter and the girls before they went back to redmond she was in a rather blue and cynical mood and inclined to look on the dark side  believe well win the war exclaimed susan no miss oliver dear i do not believei know that does not worry me what does worry me is the trouble and expense of it all but then you cannot make omelets without breaking eggs so we must just trust in god and make big guns  sometimes i think the big guns are better to trust in than god said miss oliver defiantly  no no dear you do not the germans had the big guns at the marne had they not but providence settled them do not ever forget that just hold on to that when you feel inclined to doubt clutch hold of the sides of your chair and sit tight and keep saying big guns are good but the almighty is better and he is on our side no matter what the kaiser says about it i would have gone crazy many a day lately miss oliver dear if i had not sat tight and repeated that to myself my cousin sophia is like you somewhat inclined to despond oh dear me what will we do if the germans ever get here she wailed to me yesterday bury them said i just as offhand as that there is plenty of room for the graves cousin sophia said that i was flippant but i was not flippant miss oliver dear only calm and confident in the british navy and our canadian boys i am like old mr william pollock of the harbour head he is very old and has been ill for a long time and one night last week he was so low that his daughterinlaw whispered to some one that she thought he was dead darn it i aint he called right outonly miss oliver dear he did not use so mild a word as darndarn it i aint and i dont mean to die until the kaiser is well licked now that miss oliver dear concluded susan is the kind of spirit i admire  i admire it but i cant emulate it sighed gertrude before this i have always been able to escape from the hard things of life for a little while by going into dreamland and coming back like a giant refreshed but i cant escape from this  nor i said mrs blythe i hate going to bed now all my life ive liked going to bed to have a gay mad splendid halfhour of imagining things before sleeping now i imagine them still but such different things  i am rather glad when the time comes to go to bed said miss oliver i like the darkness because i can be myself in iti neednt smile or talk bravely but sometimes my imagination gets out of hand too and i see what you doterrible thingsterrible years to come  i am very thankful that i never had any imagination to speak of said susan i have been spared that i see by this paper that the crown prince is killed again do you suppose there is any hope of his staying dead this time and i also see that woodrow wilson is going to write another note i wonder concluded susan with the bitter irony she had of late begun to use when referring to the poor president if that mans schoolmaster is alive  in january jims was five months old and rilla celebrated the anniversary by shortening him  he weighs fourteen pounds she announced jubilantly just exactly what he should weigh at five months according to morgan  there was no longer any doubt in anybodys mind that jims was getting positively pretty his little cheeks were round and firm and faintly pink his eyes were big and bright his tiny paws had dimples at the root of every finger he had even begun to grow hair much to rillas unspoken relief there was a pale golden fuzz all over his head that was distinctly visible in some lights he was a good infant generally sleeping and digesting as morgan decreed occasionally he smiled but he had never laughed in spite of all efforts to make him this worried rilla also because morgan said that babies usually laughed aloud from the third to the fifth month jims was five months and had no notion of laughing why hadnt he wasnt he normal  one night rilla came home late from a recruiting meeting at the glen where she had been giving patriotic recitations rilla had never been willing to recite in public before she was afraid of her tendency to lisp which had a habit of reviving if she were doing anything that made her nervous when she had first been asked to recite at the upper glen meeting she had refused then she began to worry over her refusal was it cowardly what would jem think if he knew after two days of worry rilla phoned to the president of the patriotic society that she would recite she did and lisped several times and lay awake most of the night in an agony of wounded vanity then two nights after she recited again at harbour head she had been at lowbridge and overharbour since then and had become resigned to an occasional lisp nobody except herself seemed to mind it and she was so earnest and appealing and shiningeyed more than one recruit joined up because rillas eyes seemed to look right at him when she passionately demanded how could men die better than fighting for the ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods or assured her audience with thrilling intensity that one crowded hour of glorious life was worth an age without a name even stolid miller douglas was so fired one night that it took mary vance a good hour to talk him back to sense mary vance said bitterly that if rilla blythe felt as bad as she had pretended to feel over jems going to the front she wouldnt be urging other girls brothers and friends to go  on this particular night rilla was tired and cold and very thankful to creep into her warm nest and cuddle down between her blankets though as usual with a sorrowful wonder how jem and jerry were faring she was just getting warm and drowsy when jims suddenly began to cryand kept on crying  rilla curled herself up in her bed and determined she would let him cry she had morgan behind her for justification jims was warm physically comfortablehis cry wasnt the cry of painand had his little tummy as full as was good for him under such circumstances it would be simply spoiling him to fuss over him and she wasnt going to do it he could cry until he got good and tired and ready to go to sleep again  then rillas imagination began to torment her suppose she thought i was a tiny helpless creature only five months old with my father somewhere in france and my poor little mother who had been so worried about me in the graveyard suppose i was lying in a basket in a big black room without one speck of light and nobody within miles of me for all i could see or know suppose there wasnt a human being anywhere who loved mefor a father who had never seen me couldnt love me very much especially when he had never written a word to or about me wouldnt i cry too wouldnt i feel just so lonely and forsaken and frightened that id have to cry  rilla hopped out she picked jims out of his basket and took him into her own bed his hands were cold poor mite but he had promptly ceased to cry and then as she held him close to her in the darkness suddenly jims laugheda real gurgly chuckly delighted delightful laugh  oh you dear little thing exclaimed rilla are you so pleased at finding youre not all alone lost in a huge big black room then she knew she wanted to kiss him and she did she kissed his silky scented little head she kissed his chubby little cheek she kissed his little cold hands she wanted to squeeze himto cuddle him just as she used to squeeze and cuddle her kittens something delightful and yearning and brooding seemed to have taken possession of her she had never felt like this before  in a few minutes jims was sound asleep and as rilla listened to his soft regular breathing and felt the little body warm and contented against her she realized thatat lastshe loved her warbaby  he has got to besuchadarling she thought drowsily as she drifted off to slumberland herself  in february jem and jerry and robert grant were in the trenches and a little more tension and dread was added to the ingleside life in march yiprez as susan called it had come to have a bitter significance the daily list of casualties had begun to appear in the papers and no one at ingleside ever answered the telephone without a horrible cold shrinkingfor it might be the stationmaster phoning up to say a telegram had come from overseas no one at ingleside ever got up in the morning without a sudden piercing wonder over what the day might bring  and i used to welcome the mornings so thought rilla  yet the round of life and duty went steadily on and every week or so one of the glen lads who had just the other day been a rollicking schoolboy went into khaki  it is bitter cold out tonight mrs dr dear said susan coming in out of the clear starlit crispness of the canadian winter twilight i wonder if the boys in the trenches are warm  how everything comes back to this war cried gertrude oliver we cant get away from itnot even when we talk of the weather i never go out these dark cold nights myself without thinking of the men in the trenchesnot only our men but everybodys men i would feel the same if there were nobody i knew at the front when i snuggle down in my comfortable bed i am ashamed of being comfortable it seems as if it were wicked of me to be so when many are not  i saw mrs meredith down at the store said susan and she tells me that they are really troubled over bruce he takes things so much to heart he has cried himself to sleep for a week over the starving belgians oh mother he will say to her so beseechinglike surely the babies are never hungryoh not the babies mother just say the babies are not hungry mother and she cannot say it because it would not be true and she is at her wits end they try to keep such things from him but he finds them out and then they cannot comfort him it breaks my heart to read about them myself mrs dr dear and i cannot console myself with the thought that the tales are not true when i read a novel that makes me want to weep i just say severely to myself now susan baker you know that is all a pack of lies but we must carry on jack crawford says he is going to the war because he is tired of farming i hope he will find it a pleasant change and mrs richard elliott overharbour is worrying herself sick because she used to be always scolding her husband about smoking up the parlour curtains now that he has enlisted she wishes she had never said a word to him you know josiah cooper and william daley mrs dr dear they used to be fast friends but they quarrelled twenty years ago and have never spoken since well the other day josiah went to william and said right out let us be friends taint any time to be holding grudges william was real glad and held out his hand and they sat down for a good talk and in less than half an hour they had quarrelled again over how the war ought to be fought josiah holding that the dardanelles expedition was rank folly and william maintaining that it was the one sensible thing the allies had done and now they are madder at each other than ever and william says josiah is as bad a progerman as whiskersonthemoon whiskersonthemoon vows he is no progerman but calls himself a pacifist whatever that may be it is nothing proper or whiskers would not be it and that you may tie to he says that the big british victory at new chapelle cost more than it was worth and he has forbid joe milgrave to come near the house because joe ran up his fathers flag when the news came have you noticed mrs dr dear that the czar has changed that prish name to premysl which proves that the man had good sense russian though he is joe vickers told me in the store that he saw a very queer looking thing in the sky tonight over lowbridge way do you suppose it could have been a zeppelin mrs dr dear  i do not think it very likely susan  well i would feel easier about it if whiskersonthemoon were not living in the glen they say he was seen going through strange manoeuvres with a lantern in his back yard one night lately some people think he was signalling  to whomor what  ah that is the mystery mrs dr dear in my opinion the government would do well to keep an eye on that man if it does not want us to be all murdered in our beds some night now i shall just look over the papers a minute before going to write a letter to little jem two things i never did mrs dr dear were write letters and read politics yet here i am doing both regular and i find there is something in politics after all whatever woodrow wilson means i cannot fathom but i am hoping i will puzzle it out yet  susan in her pursuit of wilson and politics presently came upon something that disturbed her and exclaimed in a tone of bitter disappointment  that devilish kaiser has only a boil after all  dont swear susan said dr blythe pulling a long face  devilish is not swearing doctor dear i have always understood that swearing was taking the name of the almighty in vain  well it isntahemrefined said the doctor winking at miss oliver  no doctor dear the devil and the kaiserif so be that they are really two different peopleare not refined and you cannot refer to them in a refined way so i abide by what i said although you may notice that i am careful not to use such expressions when young rilla is about and i maintain that the papers have no right to say that the kaiser has pneumonia and raise peoples hopes and then come out and say he has nothing but a boil a boil indeed i wish he was covered with them  susan stalked out to the kitchen and settled down to write to jem deeming him in need of some home comfort from certain passages in his letter that day  were in an old wine cellar tonight dad he wrote in water to our knees rats everywhereno firea drizzling rain coming downrather dismal but it might be worse i got susans box today and everything was in tiptop order and we had a feast jerry is up the line somewhere and he says the rations are rather worse than aunt marthas ditto used to be but here theyre not badonly monotonous tell susan id give a years pay for a good batch of her monkeyfaces but dont let that inspire her to send any for they wouldnt keep  we have been under fire since the last week in february one boyhe was a nova scotianwas killed right beside me yesterday a shell burst near us and when the mess cleared away he was lying deadnot mangled at allhe just looked a little startled it was the first time id been close to anything like that and it was a nasty sensation but one soon gets used to horrors here were in an absolutely different world the only things that are the same are the starsand they are never in their right places somehow  tell mother not to worryim all rightfit as a fiddleand glad i came theres something across from us here that has got to be wiped out of the world thats allan emanation of evil that would otherwise poison life for ever its got to be done dad however long it takes and whatever it costs and you tell the glen people this for me they dont realize yet what it is has broken loosei didnt when i first joined up i thought it was fun well it isnt but im in the right place all rightmake no mistake about that when i saw what had been done here to homes and gardens and peoplewell dad i seemed to see a gang of huns marching through rainbow valley and the glen and the garden at ingleside there were gardens over herebeautiful gardens with the beauty of centuriesand what are they now mangled desecrated things we are fighting to make those dear old places where we had played as children safe for other boys and girlsfighting for the preservation and safety of all sweet wholesome things  whenever any of you go to the station be sure to give dog monday a double pat for me fancy the faithful little beggar waiting there for me like that honestly dad on some of these dark cold nights in the trenches it heartens and braces me up no end to think that thousands of miles away at the old glen station there is a small spotted dog sharing my vigil  tell rilla im glad her warbaby is turning out so well and tell susan that im fighting a good fight against both huns and cooties  mrs dr dear whispered susan solemnly what are cooties  mrs blythe whispered back and then said in reply to susans horrified ejaculations its always like that in the trenches susan  susan shook her head and went away in grim silence to reopen a parcel she had sewed up for jem and slip in a fine tooth comb    chapter xii  in the days of langemarck  how can spring come and be beautiful in such a horror wrote rilla in her diary when the sun shines and the fluffy yellow catkins are coming out on the willowtrees down by the brook and the garden is beginning to be beautiful i cant realize that such dreadful things are happening in flanders but they are  this past week has been terrible for us all since the news came of the fighting around ypres and the battles of langemarck and st julien our canadian boys have done splendidlygeneral french says they saved the situation when the germans had all but broken through but i cant feel pride or exultation or anything but a gnawing anxiety over jem and jerry and mr grant the casualty lists are coming out in the papers every dayoh there are so many of them i cant bear to read them for fear id find jems namefor there have been cases where people have seen their boys names in the casualty lists before the official telegram came as for the telephone for a day or two i just refused to answer it because i thought i could not endure the horrible moment that came between saying hello and hearing the response that moment seemed a hundred years long for i was always dreading to hear there is a telegram for dr blythe then when i had shirked for a while i was ashamed of leaving it all for mother or susan and now i make myself go but it never gets any easier gertrude teaches school and reads compositions and sets examination papers just as she always has done but i know her thoughts are over in flanders all the time her eyes haunt me  and kenneth is in khaki now too he has got a lieutenants commission and expects to go overseas in midsummer so he wrote me there wasnt much else in the letterhe seemed to be thinking of nothing but going overseas i shall not see him again before he goesperhaps i will never see him again sometimes i ask myself if that evening at four winds was all a dream it might as well beit seems as if it happened in another life lived years agoand everybody has forgotten it but me  walter and nan and di came home last night from redmond when walter stepped off the train dog monday rushed to meet him frantic with joy i suppose he thought jem would be there too after the first moment he paid no attention to walter and his pats but just stood there wagging his tail nervously and looking past walter at the other people coming out with eyes that made me choke up for i couldnt help thinking that for all we knew monday might never see jem come off that train again then when all the people were out monday looked up at walter gave his hand a little lick as if to say i know it isnt your fault he didnt comeexcuse me for feeling disappointed and then he trotted back to his shed with that funny little sidelong waggle of his that always makes it seem that his hind legs are travelling directly away from the point at which his forelegs are aiming  we tried to coax him home with usdi even got down and kissed him between the eyes and said monday old duck wont you come up with us just for the evening and monday saidhe didi am very sorry but i cant ive got a date to meet jem here you know and theres a train goes through at eight  its lovely to have walter back again though he seems quiet and sad just as he was at christmas but im going to love him hard and cheer him up and make him laugh as he used to it seems to me that every day of my life walter means more to me  the other evening susan happened to say that the mayflowers were out in rainbow valley i chanced to be looking at mother when susan spoke her face changed and she gave a queer little choked cry most of the time mother is so spunky and gay you would never guess what she feels inside but now and then some little thing is too much for her and we see under the surface mayflowers she said jem brought me mayflowers last year and she got up and went out of the room i would have rushed off to rainbow valley and brought her an armful of mayflowers but i knew that wasnt what she wanted and after walter got home last night he slipped away to the valley and brought mother home all the mayflowers he could find nobody had said a word to him about ithe just remembered himself that jem used to bring mother the first mayflowers and so he brought them in jems place it shows how tender and thoughtful he is and yet there are people who send him cruel letters  it seems strange that we can go in with ordinary life just as if nothing were happening overseas that concerned us just as if any day might not bring us awful news but we can and do susan is putting in the garden and mother and she are housecleaning and we junior reds are getting up a concert in aid of the belgians we have been practising for a month and having no end of trouble and bother with cranky people miranda pryor promised to help with a dialogue and when she had her part all learnt her father put his foot down and refused to allow her to help at all i am not blaming miranda exactly but i do think she might have a little more spunk sometimes if she put her foot down once in a while she might bring her father to terms for she is all the housekeeper he has and what would he do if she struck if i were in mirandas shoes id find some way of managing whiskersonthemoon i would horsewhip him or bite him if nothing else would serve but miranda is a meek and obedient daughter whose days should be long in the land  i couldnt get anyone else to take the part because nobody liked it so finally i had to take it myself olive kirk is on the concert committee and goes against me in every single thing but i got my way in asking mrs channing to come out from town and sing for us anyhow she is a beautiful singer and will draw such a crowd that we will make more than we will have to pay her olive kirk thought our local talent good enough and minnie clow wont sing at all now in the choruses because she would be so nervous before mrs channing and minnie is the only good alto we have there are times when i am so exasperated that i feel tempted to wash my hands of the whole affair but after i dance round my room a few times in sheer rage i cool down and have another whack at it just at present i am racked with worry for fear the isaac reeses are taking whoopingcough they have all got a dreadful cold and there are five of them who have important parts in the programme and if they go and develop whoopingcough what shall i do dick reeses violin solo is to be one of our titbits and kit reese is in every tableau and the three small girls have the cutest flagdrill ive been toiling for weeks to train them in it and now it seems likely that all my trouble will go for nothing  jims cut his first tooth today i am very glad for he is nearly nine months old and mary vance has been insinuating that he is awfully backward about cutting his teeth he has begun to creep but doesnt crawl as most babies do he trots about on all fours and carries things in his mouth like a little dog nobody can say he isnt up to schedule time in the matter of creeping anywayaway ahead of it indeed since ten months is morgans average for creeping he is so cute it will be a shame if his dad never sees him his hair is coming on nicely too and i am not without hope that it will be curly  just for a few minutes while ive been writing of jims and the concert ive forgotten ypres and the poison gas and the casualty lists now it all rushes back worse than ever oh if we could just know that jem is all right i used to be so furious with jem when he called me spider and now if he would just come whistling through the hall and call out hello spider as he used to do i would think it the loveliest name in the world  rilla put away her diary and went out to the garden the spring evening was very lovely the long green seawardlooking glen was filled with dusk and beyond it were meadows of sunset the harbour was radiant purple here azure there opal elsewhere the maple grove was beginning to be misty green rilla looked about her with wistful eyes who said that spring was the joy of the year it was the heartbreak of the year and the palepurply mornings and the daffodil stars and the wind in the old pine were so many separate pangs of the heartbreak would life ever be free from dread again  its good to see pei twilight once more said walter joining her i didnt really remember that the sea was so blue and the roads so red and the wood nooks so wild and fairy haunted yes the fairies still abide here i vow i could find scores of them under the violets in rainbow valley  rilla was momentarily happy this sounded like the walter of yore she hoped he was forgetting certain things that had troubled him  and isnt the sky blue over rainbow valley she said responding to his mood blueblueyoud have to say blue a hundred times before you could express how blue it is  susan wandered by her head tied up with a shawl her hands full of garden implements doc stealthy and wildeyed was shadowing her steps among the spirea bushes  the sky may be blue said susan but that cat has been hyde all day so we will likely have rain tonight and by the same token i have rheumatism in my shoulder  it may rainbut dont think rheumatism susanthink violets said walter gailyrather too gaily rilla thought  susan considered him unsympathetic  indeed walter dear i do not know what you mean by thinking violets she responded stiffly and rheumatism is not a thing to be joked about as you may some day realize for yourself i hope i am not of the kind that is always complaining of their aches and pains especially now when the news is so terrible rheumatism is bad enough but i realize and none better that it is not to be compared to being gassed by the huns  oh my god no exclaimed walter passionately he turned and went back to the house  susan shook her head she disapproved entirely of such ejaculations i hope he will not let his mother hear him talking like that she thought as she stacked the hoes and rake away  rilla was standing among the budding daffodils with tearfilled eyes her evening was spoiled she detested susan who had somehow hurt walter and jemhad jem been gassed had he died in torture  i cant endure this suspense any longer said rilla desperately  but she endured it as the others did for another week then a letter came from jem he was all right  ive come through without a scratch dad dont know how i or any of us did it youll have seen all about it in the papersi cant write of it but the huns havent got throughthey wont get through jerry was knocked stiff by a shell one time but it was only the shock he was all right in a few days grant is safe too  nan had a letter from jerry meredith i came back to consciousness at dawn he wrote couldnt tell what had happened to me but thought that i was done for i was all alone and afraidterribly afraid dead men were all around me lying on the horrible grey slimy fields i was woefully thirstyand i thought of david and the bethlehem waterand of the old spring in rainbow valley under the maples i seemed to see it just before meand you standing laughing on the other side of itand i thought it was all over with me and i didnt care honestly i didnt care i just felt a dreadful childish fear of loneliness and of those dead men around me and a sort of wonder how this could have happened to me then they found me and carted me off and before long i discovered that there wasnt really anything wrong with me im going back to the trenches tomorrow every man is needed there that can be got  laughter is gone out of the world said faith meredith who had come over to report on her letters i remember telling old mrs taylor long ago that the world was a world of laughter but it isnt so any longer  its a shriek of anguish said gertrude oliver  we must keep a little laughter girls said mrs blythe a good laugh is as good as a prayer sometimesonly sometimes she added under her breath she had found it very hard to laugh during the three weeks she had just lived throughshe anne blythe to whom laughter had always come so easily and freshly and what hurt most was that rillas laughter had grown so rarerilla whom she used to think laughed overmuch was all the childs girlhood to be so clouded yet how strong and clever and womanly she was growing how patiently she knitted and sewed and manipulated those uncertain junior reds and how wonderful she was with jims  she really could not do better for that child than if she had raised a bakers dozen mrs dr dear susan had avowed solemnly little did i ever expect it of her on the day she landed here with that soup tureen    chapter xiii  a slice of humble pie  i am very much afraid mrs dr dear said susan who had been on a pilgrimage to the station with some choice bones for dog monday that something terrible has happened whiskersonthemoon came off the train from charlottetown and he was looking pleased i do not remember that i ever saw him with a smile on in public before of course he may have just been getting the better of somebody in a cattle deal but i have an awful presentiment that the huns have broken through somewhere  perhaps susan was unjust in connecting mr pryors smile with the sinking of the lusitania news of which circulated an hour later when the mail was distributed but the glen boys turned out that night in a body and broke all his windows in a fine frenzy of indignation over the kaisers doings  i do not say they did right and i do not say they did wrong said susan when she heard of it but i will say that i wouldnt have minded throwing a few stones myself one thing is certainwhiskersonthemoon said in the post office the day the news came in the presence of witnesses that folks who could not stay home after they had been warned deserved no better fate norman douglas is fairly foaming at the mouth over it all if the devil doesnt get those men who sunk the lusitania then there is no use in there being a devil he was shouting in carters store last night norman douglas always has believed that anybody who opposed him was on the side of the devil but a man like that is bound to be right once in a while bruce meredith is worrying over the babies who were drowned and it seems he prayed for something very special last friday night and didnt get it and was feeling quite disgruntled over it but when he heard about the lusitania he told his mother that he understood now why god didnt answer his prayerhe was too busy attending to the souls of all the people who went down on the lusitania that childs brain is a hundred years older than his body mrs dr dear as for the lusitania it is an awful occurrence whatever way you look at it but woodrow wilson is going to write a note about it so why worry a pretty president and susan banged her pots about wrathfully president wilson was rapidly becoming anathema in susans kitchen  mary vance dropped in one evening to tell the ingleside folks that she had withdrawn all opposition to miller douglass enlisting  this lusitania business was too much for me said mary brusquely when the kaiser takes to drowning innocent babies its high time somebody told him where he gets off at this thing must be fought to a finish its been soaking into my mind slow but im on now so i up and told miller he could go as far as i was concerned old kitty alec wont be converted though if every ship in the world was submarined and every baby drowned kitty wouldnt turn a hair but i flatter myself that it was me kept miller back all along and not the fair kitty i may have deceived myselfbut we shall see  they did see the next sunday miller douglas walked into the glen church beside mary vance in khaki and mary was so proud of him that her white eyes fairly blazed joe milgrave back under the gallery looked at miller and mary and then at miranda pryor and sighed so heavily that every one within a radius of three pews heard him and knew what his trouble was walter blythe did not sigh but rilla scanning his face anxiously saw a look that cut into her heart it haunted her for the next week and made an undercurrent of soreness in her soul which was externally being harrowed up by the near approach of the red cross concert and the worries connected therewith the reese cold had not developed into whoopingcough so that tangle was straightened out but other things were hanging in the balance and on the very day before the concert came a regretful letter from mrs channing saying that she could not come to sing her son who was in kingsport with his regiment was seriously ill with pneumonia and she must go to him at once  the members of the concert committee looked at each other in blank dismay what was to be done  this comes of depending on outside help said olive kirk disagreeably  we must do something said rilla too desperate to care for olives manner weve advertised the concert everywhereand crowds are comingtheres even a big party coming out from townand we were short enough of music as it was we must get some one to sing in mrs channings place  i dont know who you can get at this late date said olive irene howard could do it but it is not likely she will after the way she was insulted by our society  how did our society insult her asked rilla in what she called her coldpale tone its coldness and pallor did not daunt olive  you insulted her she answered sharply irene told me all about itshe was literally heartbroken you told her never to speak to you againand irene told me she simply could not imagine what she had said or done to deserve such treatment that was why she never came to our meetings again but joined in with the lowbridge red cross i do not blame her in the least and i for one will not ask her to lower herself by helping us out of this scrape  you dont expect me to ask her giggled amy macallister the other member of the committee irene and i havent spoken for a hundred years irene is always getting insulted by somebody but she is a lovely singer ill admit that and people would just as soon hear her as mrs channing  it wouldnt do any good if you did ask her said olive significantly soon after we began planning this concert back in april i met irene in town one day and asked her if she wouldnt help us out she said shed love to but she really didnt see how she could when rilla blythe was running the programme after the strange way rilla had behaved to her so there it is and here we are and a nice failure our concert will be  rilla went home and shut herself up in her room her soul in a turmoil she would not humiliate herself by apologizing to irene howard irene had been as much in the wrong as she had been and she had told such mean distorted versions of their quarrel everywhere posing as a puzzled injured martyr rilla could never bring herself to tell her side of it the fact that a slur at walter was mixed up in it tied her tongue so most people believed that irene had been badly used except a few girls who had never liked her and sided with rilla and yetthe concert over which she had worked so hard was going to be a failure mrs channings four solos were the feature of the whole programme  miss oliver what do you think about it she asked in desperation  i think irene is the one who should apologize said miss oliver but unfortunately my opinion will not fill the blanks in your programme  if i went and apologized meekly to irene she would sing i am sure sighed rilla she really loves to sing in public but i know shell be nasty about iti feel id rather do anything than go i suppose i should goif jem and jerry can face the huns surely i can face irene howard and swallow my pride to ask a favour of her for the good of the belgians just at present i feel that i cannot do it but for all that i have a presentiment that after supper youll see me meekly trotting through rainbow valley on my way to the upper glen road  rillas presentiment proved correct after supper she dressed herself carefully in her blue beaded crepefor vanity is harder to quell than pride and irene always saw any flaw or shortcoming in another girls appearance besides as rilla had told her mother one day when she was nine years old it is easier to behave nicely when you have your good clothes on  rilla did her hair very becomingly and donned a long raincoat for fear of a shower but all the while her thoughts were concerned with the coming distasteful interview and she kept rehearsing mentally her part in it she wished it were overshe wished she had never tried to get up a belgian relief concertshe wished she had not quarreled with irene after all disdainful silence would have been much more effective in meeting the slur upon walter it was foolish and childish to fly out as she had donewell she would be wiser in the future but meanwhile a large and very unpalatable slice of humble pie had to be eaten and rilla blythe was no fonder of that wholesome article of diet than the rest of us  by sunset she was at the door of the howard housea pretentious abode with white scrollwork round the eaves and an eruption of baywindows on all its sides mrs howard a plump voluble dame met rilla gushingly and left her in the parlour while she went to call irene rilla threw off her raincoat and looked at herself critically in the mirror over the mantel hair hat and dress were satisfactorynothing there for miss irene to make fun of rilla remembered how clever and amusing she used to think irenes biting little comments about other girls well it had come home to her now  presently irene skimmed down elegantly gowned with her pale strawcoloured hair done in the latest and most extreme fashion and an overluscious atmosphere of perfume enveloping her  why how do you do miss blythe she said sweetly this is a very unexpected pleasure  rilla had risen to take irenes chilly fingertips and now as she sat down again she saw something that temporarily stunned her irene saw it too as she sat down and a little amused impertinent smile appeared on her lips and hovered there during the rest of the interview  on one of rillas feet was a smart little steelbuckled shoe and a filmy blue silk stocking the other was clad in a stout and rather shabby boot and black lisle  poor rilla she had changed or begun to change her boots and stockings after she had put on her dress this was the result of doing one thing with your hands and another with your brain oh what a ridiculous position to be inand before irene howard of all peopleirene who was staring at rillas feet as if she had never seen feet before and once she had thought irenes manner perfection everything that rilla had prepared to say vanished from her memory vainly trying to tuck her unlucky foot under her chair she blurted out a blunt statement  i have come to athk a favour of you irene  therelisping oh she had been prepared for humiliation but not to this extent really there were limits  yes said irene in a cool questioning tone lifting her shallowlyset insolent eyes to rillas crimson face for a moment and then dropping them again as if she could not tear them from their fascinated gaze at the shabby boot and the gallant shoe  rilla gathered herself together she would not lispshe would be calm and composed  mrs channing cannot come because her son is ill in kingsport and i have come on behalf of the committee to ask you if you will be so kind as to sing for us in her place rilla enunciated every word so precisely and carefully that she seemed to be reciting a lesson  its something of a fiddlers invitation isnt it said irene with one of her disagreeable smiles  olive kirk asked you to help when we first thought of the concert and you refused said rilla  why i could hardly helpthencould i asked irene plaintively after you ordered me never to speak to you again it would have been very awkward for us both dont you think  now for the humble pie  i want to apologize to you for saying that irene said rilla steadily i should not have said it and i have been very sorry ever since will you forgive me  and sing at your concert said irene sweetly and insultingly  if you mean said rilla miserably that i would not be apologizing to you if it were not for the concert perhaps that is true but it is also true that i have felt ever since it happened that i should not have said what i did and that i have been sorry for it all winter that is all i can say if you feel you cant forgive me i suppose there is nothing more to be said  oh rilla dear dont snap me up like that pleaded irene of course ill forgive youthough i did feel awfully about ithow awfully i hope youll never know i cried for weeks over it and i hadnt said or done a thing  rilla choked back a retort after all there was no use in arguing with irene and the belgians were starving  dont you think you can help us with the concert she forced herself to say oh if only irene would stop looking at that boot rilla could just hear her giving olive kirk an account of it  i dont see how i really can at the last moment like this protested irene there isnt time to learn anything new  oh you have lots of lovely songs that nobody in the glen ever heard before said rilla who knew irene had been going to town all winter for lessons and that this was only a pretext they will all be new down there  but i have no accompanist protested irene  una meredith can accompany you said rilla  oh i couldnt ask her sighed irene we havent spoken since last fall she was so hateful to me the time of our sundayschool concert that i simply had to give her up  dear dear was irene at feud with everybody as for una meredith being hateful to anybody the idea was so farcical that rilla had much ado to keep from laughing in irenes very face  miss oliver is a beautiful pianist and can play any accompaniment at sight said rilla desperately she will play for you and you could run over your songs easily tomorrow evening at ingleside before the concert  but i havent anything to wear my new eveningdress isnt home from charlottetown yet and i simply cannot wear my old one at such a big affair it is too shabby and oldfashioned  our concert said rilla slowly is in aid of belgian children who are starving to death dont you think you could wear a shabby dress once for their sake irene  oh dont you think those accounts we get of the conditions of the belgians are very much exaggerated said irene im sure they cant be actually starving you know in the twentieth century the newspapers always colour things so highly  rilla concluded that she had humiliated herself enough there was such a thing as selfrespect no more coaxing concert or no concert she got up boot and all  i am sorry you cant help us irene but since you cannot we must do the best we can  now this did not suit irene at all she desired exceedingly to sing at that concert and all her hesitations were merely by way of enhancing the boon of her final consent besides she really wanted to be friends with rilla again rillas wholehearted ungrudging adoration had been very sweet incense to her and ingleside was a very charming house to visit especially when a handsome college student like walter was home she stopped looking at rillas feet  rilla darling dont be so abrupt i really want to help you if i can manage it just sit down and lets talk it over  im sorry but i cant i have to be home soonjims has to be settled for the night you know  oh yesthe baby you are bringing up by the book its perfectly sweet of you to do it when you hate children so how cross you were just because i kissed him but well forget all that and be chums again wont we now about the concerti dare say i can run into town on the morning train after my dress and out again on the afternoon one in plenty of time for the concert if youll ask miss oliver to play for me i couldntshes so dreadfully haughty and supercilious that she simply paralyses poor little me  rilla did not waste time or breath defending miss oliver she coolly thanked irene who had suddenly become very amiable and gushing and got away she was very thankful the interview was over but she knew now that she and irene could never be the friends they had been friendly yesbut friends no nor did she wish it all winter she had felt under her other and more serious worries a little feeling of regret for her lost chum now it was suddenly gone irene was not as mrs elliott would say of the race that knew joseph rilla did not say or think that she had outgrown irene had the thought occurred to her she would have considered it absurd when she was not yet seventeen and irene was twenty but it was the truth irene was just what she had been a year agojust what she would always be rilla blythes nature in that year had changed and matured and deepened she found herself seeing through irene with a disconcerting clearnessdiscerning under all her superficial sweetness her pettiness her vindictiveness her insincerity her essential cheapness irene had lost for ever her faithful worshipper  but not until rilla had traversed the upper glen road and found herself in the moondappled solitude of rainbow valley did she fully recover her composure of spirit then she stopped under a tall wild plum that was ghostly white and fair in its misty spring bloom and laughed  there is only one thing of importance just nowand that is that the allies win the war she said aloud therefore it follows without dispute that the fact that i went to see irene howard with odd shoes and stockings on is of no importance whatever nevertheless i bertha marilla blythe swear solemnly with the moon as witnessrilla lifted her hand dramatically to the said moonthat i will never leave my room again without looking carefully at both my feet    chapter xiv  the valley of decision  susan kept the flag flying at ingleside all the next day in honour of italys declaration of war  and not before it was time mrs dr dear considering the way things have begun to go on the russian front say what you will those russians are kittle cattle the grand duke nicholas to the contrary notwithstanding it is a fortunate thing for italy that she has come in on the right side but whether it is as fortunate for the allies i will not predict until i know more about italians than i do now however she will give that old reprobate of a francis joseph something to think about a pretty emperor indeedwith one foot in the grave and yet plotting wholesale murderand susan thumped and kneaded her bread with as much vicious energy as she could have expended in punching francis joseph himself if he had been so unlucky as to fall into her clutches  walter had gone to town on the early train and nan offered to look after jims for the day and so set rilla free rilla was wildly busy all day helping to decorate the glen hall and seeing to a hundred last things the evening was beautiful in spite of the fact that mr pryor was reported to have said that he hoped it would rain pitch forks points down and to have wantonly kicked mirandas dog as he said it rilla rushing home from the hall dressed hurriedly everything had gone surprisingly well at the last irene was even then downstairs practising her songs with miss oliver rilla was excited and happy forgetful even of the western front for the moment it gave her a sense of achievement and victory to have brought her efforts of weeks to such a successful conclusion she knew that there had not lacked people who thought and hinted that rilla blythe had not the tact or patience to engineer a concert programme she had shown them little snatches of song bubbled up from her lips as she dressed she thought she was looking very well excitement brought a faint becoming pink into her round creamy cheeks quite drowning out her few freckles and her hair gleamed with redbrown lustre should she wear crabapple blossoms in it or her little fillet of pearls after some agonised wavering she decided on the crabapple blossoms and tucked the white waxen cluster behind her left ear now for a final look at her feet yes both slippers were on she gave the sleeping jims a kisswhat a dear little warm rosy satin face he hadand hurried down the hill to the hall already it was fillingsoon it was crowded her concert was going to be a brilliant success  the first three numbers were successfully over rilla was in the little dressingroom behind the platform looking out on the moonlit harbour and rehearsing her own recitations she was alone the rest of the performers being in the larger room on the other side suddenly she felt two soft bare arms slipping round her waist then irene howard dropped a light kiss on her cheek  rilla you sweet thing youre looking simply angelic tonight you have spunki thought you would feel so badly over walters enlisting that youd hardly be able to bear up at all and here you are as cool as a cucumber i wish i had half your nerve  rilla stood perfectly still she felt no emotion whatevershe felt nothing the world of feeling had just gone blank  walterenlistingshe heard herself sayingthen she heard irenes affected little laugh  why didnt you know i thought you did of course or i wouldnt have mentioned it i am always putting my foot in it arent i yes that is what he went to town for todayhe told me coming out on the train tonight i was the first person he told he isnt in khaki yetthey were out of uniformsbut he will be in a day or two i always said walter had as much pluck as anybody i assure you i felt proud of him rilla when he told me what hed done oh theres an end of rick macallisters reading i must fly i promised id play for the next chorusalice clow has such a headache  she was goneoh thank god she was gone rilla was alone again staring out at the unchanged dreamlike beauty of moonlit four winds feeling was coming back to hera pang of agony so acute as to be almost physical seemed to rend her apart  i cannot bear it she said and then came the awful thought that perhaps she could bear it and that there might be years of this hideous suffering before her  she must get awayshe must rush homeshe must be alone she could not go out there and play for drills and give readings and take part in dialogues now it would spoil half the concert but that did not matternothing mattered was this she rilla blythethis tortured thing who had been quite happy a few minutes ago outside a quartette was singing well never let the old flag fallthe music seemed to be coming from some remote distance why couldnt she cry as she had cried when jem told them he must go if she could cry perhaps this horrible something that seemed to have seized on her very life might let go but no tears came where were her scarf and coat she must get away and hide herself like an animal hurt to the death  was it a cowards part to run away like this the question came to her suddenly as if someone else had asked it she thought of the shambles of the flanders frontshe thought of her brother and her playmate helping to hold those fireswept trenches what would they think of her if she shirked her little duty herethe humble duty of carrying the programme through for her red cross but she couldnt stayshe couldntyet what was it mother had said when jem went when our women fail in courage shall our men be fearless still but thisthis was unbearable  still she stopped halfway to the door and went back to the window irene was singing now her beautiful voicethe only real thing about hersoared clear and sweet through the building rilla knew that the girls fairy drill came next could she go out there and play for it her head was aching nowher throat was burning oh why had irene told her just then when telling could do no good irene had been very cruel rilla remembered now that more than once that day she had caught her mother looking at her with an odd expression she had been too busy to wonder what it meant she understood now mother had known why walter went to town but wouldnt tell her until the concert was over what spirit and endurance mother had  i must stay here and see things through said rilla clasping her cold hands together  the rest of the evening always seemed like a fevered dream to her her body was crowded by people but her soul was alone in a torturechamber of its own yet she played steadily for the drills and gave her readings without faltering she even put on a grotesque old irish womans costume and acted the part in the dialogue which miranda pryor had not taken but she did not give her brogue the inimitable twist she had given it in the practices and her readings lacked their usual fire and appeal as she stood before the audience she saw one face onlythat of the handsome darkhaired lad sitting beside her motherand she saw that same face in the trenchessaw it lying cold and dead under the starssaw it pining in prisonsaw the light of its eyes blotted outsaw a hundred horrible things as she stood there on the beflagged platform of the glen hall with her own face whiter than the milky crabblossoms in her hair between her numbers she walked restlessly up and down the little dressingroom would the concert never end  it ended at last olive kirk rushed up and told her exultantly that they had made a hundred dollars thats good rilla said mechanically then she was away from them alloh thank god she was away from them allwalter was waiting for her at the door he put his arm through hers silently and they went together down the moonlit road the frogs were singing in the marshes the dim ensilvered fields of home lay all around them the spring night was lovely and appealing rilla felt that its beauty was an insult to her pain she would hate moonlight for ever  you know said walter  yes irene told me answered rilla chokingly  we didnt want you to know till the evening was over i knew when you came out for the drill that you had heard little sister i had to do it i couldnt live any longer on such terms with myself as i have been since the lusitania was sunk when i pictured those dead women and children floating about in that pitiless icecold waterwell at first i just felt a sort of nausea with life i wanted to get out of the world where such a thing could happenshake its accursed dust from my feet for ever then i knew i had to go  there areplentywithout you  that isnt the point rillamyrilla im going for my own saketo save my soul alive it will shrink to something small and mean and lifeless if i dont go that would be worse than blindness or mutilation or any of the things ive feared  you maybekilled rilla hated herself for saying itshe knew it was a weak and cowardly thing to saybut she had rather gone to pieces after the tension of the evening    comes he slow or comes he fast   it is but death who comes at last  quoted walter its not death i feari told you that long ago one can pay too high a price for mere life little sister theres so much hideousness in this warive got to go and help wipe it out of the world im going to fight for the beauty of life rillamyrillathat is my duty there may be a higher duty perhapsbut that is mine i owe life and canada that and ive got to pay it rilla tonight for the first time since jem left ive got back my selfrespect i could write poetry walter laughed ive never been able to write a line since last august tonight im full of it little sister be braveyou were so plucky when jem went  thisisdifferent rilla had to stop after every word to fight down a wild outburst of sobs i lovedjemof coursebutwhenhe wentawaywe thoughtthe warwould soonbe overand you areeverything to me walter  you must be brave to help me rillamyrilla im exalted tonightdrunk with the excitement of victory over myselfbut there will be other times when it wont be like thisill need your help then  whendoyougo she must know the worst at once  not for a weekthen we go to kingsport for training i suppose well go overseas about the middle of julywe dont know  one weekonly one week more with walter the eyes of youth did not see how she was to go on living  when they turned in at the ingleside gate walter stopped in the shadows of the old pines and drew rilla close to him  rillamyrilla there were girls as sweet and pure as you in belgium and flanders youeven youknow what their fate was we must make it impossible for such things to happen again while the world lasts youll help me wont you  ill try walter she said oh i will try  as she clung to him with her face pressed against his shoulder she knew that it had to be she accepted the fact then and there he must goher beautiful walter with his beautiful soul and dreams and ideals and she had known all along that it would come sooner or later she had seen it coming to hercomingcomingas one sees the shadow of a cloud drawing near over a sunny field swiftly and inescapably amid all her pain she was conscious of an odd feeling of relief in some hidden part of her soul where a little dull unacknowledged soreness had been lurking all winter no oneno one could ever call walter a slacker now  rilla did not sleep that night perhaps no one at ingleside did except jims the body grows slowly and steadily but the soul grows by leaps and bounds it may come to its full stature in an hour from that night rilla blythes soul was the soul of a woman in its capacity for suffering for strength for endurance  when the bitter dawn came she rose and went to her window below her was a big appletree a great swelling cone of rosy blossom walter had planted it years ago when he was a little boy beyond rainbow valley there was a cloudy shore of morning with little ripples of sunrise breaking over it the far cold beauty of a lingering star shone above it why in this world of springtime loveliness must hearts break  rilla felt arms go about her lovingly protectingly it was motherpale largeeyed mother  oh mother how can you bear it she cried wildly rilla dear ive known for several days that walter meant to go ive had time toto rebel and grow reconciled we must give him up there is a call greater and more insistent than the call of our lovehe has listened to it we must not add to the bitterness of his sacrifice  our sacrifice is greater than his cried rilla passionately our boys give only themselves we give them  before mrs blythe could reply susan stuck her head in at the door never troubling over such frills of etiquette as knocking her eyes were suspiciously red but all she said was  will i bring up your breakfast mrs dr dear  no no susan we will all be down presently do you knowthat walter has joined up  yes mrs dr dear the doctor told me last night i suppose the almighty has his own reasons for allowing such things we must submit and endeavour to look on the bright side it may cure him of being a poet at leastsusan still persisted in thinking that poets and tramps were tarred with the same brushand that would be something but thank god she muttered in a lower tone that shirley is not old enough to go  isnt that the same thing as thanking him that some other womans son has to go in shirleys place asked the doctor pausing on the threshold  no it is not doctor dear said susan defiantly as she picked up jims who was opening his big dark eyes and stretching up his dimpled paws do not you put words in my mouth that i would never dream of uttering i am a plain woman and cannot argue with you but i do not thank god that anybody has to go i only know that it seems they do have to go unless we all want to be kaiserisedfor i can assure you that the monroe doctrine whatever it is is nothing to tie to with woodrow wilson behind it the huns dr dear will never be brought to brook by notes and now concluded susan tucking jims in the crook of her gaunt arms and marching downstairs having cried my cry and said my say i shall take a brace and if i cannot look pleasant i will look as pleasant as i can    chapter xv  until the day break  the germans have recaptured premysl said susan despairingly looking up from her newspaper and now i suppose we will have to begin calling it by that uncivilised name again cousin sophia was in when the mail came and when she heard the news she hove a sigh up from the depths of her stomach mrs dr dear and said ah yes and they will get petrograd next i have no doubt i said to her my knowledge of geography is not so profound as i wish it was but i have an idea that it is quite a walk from premysl to petrograd cousin sophia sighed again and said the grand duke nicholas is not the man i took him to be do not let him know that said i it might hurt his feelings and he has likely enough to worry him as it is but you cannot cheer cousin sophia up no matter how sarcastic you are mrs dr dear she sighed for the third time and groaned out but the russians are retreating fast and i said well what of it they have plenty of room for retreating have they not but all the same mrs dr dear though i would never admit it to cousin sophia i do not like the situation on the eastern front  nobody else liked it either but all summer the russian retreat went ona longdrawnout agony  i wonder if i shall ever again be able to await the coming of the mail with feelings of composurenever to speak of pleasure said gertrude oliver the thought that haunts me night and day iswill the germans smash russia completely and then hurl their eastern army flushed with victory against the western front  they will not miss oliver dear said susan assuming the role of prophetess  in the first place the almighty will not allow it in the second grand duke nicholas though he may have been a disappointment to us in some respects knows how to run away decently and in order and that is a very useful knowledge when germans are chasing you norman douglas declares he is just luring them on and killing ten of them to one he loses but i am of the opinion he cannot help himself and is just doing the best he can under the circumstances the same as the rest of us so do not go so far afield to borrow trouble miss oliver dear when there is plenty of it already camping on our very doorstep  walter had gone to kingsport the first of june nan di and faith had gone also to do red cross work in their vacation in midjuly walter came home for a weeks leave before going overseas rilla had lived through the days of his absence on the hope of that week and now that it had come she drank every minute of it thirstily hating even the hours she had to spend in sleep they seemed such a waste of precious moments in spite of its sadness it was a beautiful week full of poignant unforgettable hours when she and walter had long walks and talks and silences together he was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy and understanding it was very wonderful to know she meant so much to himthe knowledge helped her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable and gave her power to smileand even to laugh a little when walter had gone she might indulge in the comfort of tears but not while he was here she would not even let herself cry at night lest her eyes should betray her to him in the morning  on his last evening at home they went together to rainbow valley and sat down on the bank of the brook under the white lady where the gay revels of olden days had been held in the cloudless years rainbow valley was roofed over with a sunset of unusual splendour that night a wonderful grey dusk just touched with starlight followed it and then came moonshine hinting hiding revealing lighting up little dells and hollows here leaving others in dark velvet shadow  when i am somewhere in france said walter looking around him with eager eyes on all the beauty his soul loved i shall remember these still dewy moondrenched places the balsam of the firtrees the peace of those white pools of moonshine the strength of the hillswhat a beautiful old biblical phrase that is rilla look at those old hills around usthe hills we looked up at as children wondering what lay for us in the great world beyond them how calm and strong they arehow patient and changelesslike the heart of a good woman rillamyrilla do you know what you have been to me the past year i want to tell you before i go i could not have lived through it if it had not been for you little loving believing heart  rilla dared not try to speak she slipped her hand into walters and pressed it hard  and when im over there rilla in that hell upon earth which men who have forgotten god have made it will be the thought of you that will help me most i know youll be as plucky and patient as you have shown yourself to be this past yearim not afraid for you i know that no matter what happens youll be rillamyrillano matter what happens  rilla repressed tear and sigh but she could not repress a little shiver and walter knew that he had said enough after a moment of silence in which each made an unworded promise to each other he said now we wont be sober any more well look beyond the yearsto the time when the war will be over and jem and jerry and i will come marching home and well all be happy again  we wont behappyin the same way said rilla  no not in the same way nobody whom this war has touched will ever be happy again in quite the same way but it will be a better happiness i think little sistera happiness weve earned we were very happy before the war werent we with a home like ingleside and a father and mother like ours we couldnt help being happy but that happiness was a gift from life and love it wasnt really ourslife could take it back at any time it can never take away the happiness we win for ourselves in the way of duty ive realised that since i went into khaki in spite of my occasional funks when i fall to living over things beforehand ive been happy since that night in may rilla be awfully good to mother while im away it must be a horrible thing to be a mother in this warthe mothers and sisters and wives and sweethearts have the hardest times rilla you beautiful little thing are you anybodys sweetheart if you are tell me before i go  no said rilla then impelled by a wish to be absolutely frank with walter in this talk that might be the last they would ever have she added blushing wildly in the moonlight but ifkenneth fordwanted me to be  i see said walter and kens in khaki too poor little girlie its a bit hard for you all round well im not leaving any girl to break her heart about methank god for that  rilla glanced up at the manse on the hill she could see a light in una merediths window she felt tempted to say somethingthen she knew she must not it was not her secret and anyway she did not knowshe only suspected  walter looked about him lingeringly and lovingly this spot had always been so dear to him what fun they all had had here lang syne phantoms of memory seemed to pace the dappled paths and peep merrily through the swinging boughsjem and jerry barelegged sunburned schoolboys fishing in the brook and frying trout over the old stone fireplace nan and di and faith in their dimpled fresheyed childish beauty una the sweet and shy carl poring over ants and bugs little slangy sharptongued goodhearted mary vancethe old walter that had been himself lying on the grass reading poetry or wandering through palaces of fancy they were all there around himhe could see them almost as plainly as he saw rillaas plainly as he had once seen the pied piper piping down the valley in a vanished twilight and they said to him those gay little ghosts of other days we were the children of yesterday walterfight a good fight for the children of today and tomorrow  where are you walter cried rilla laughing a little come backcome back  walter came back with a long breath he stood up and looked about him at the beautiful valley of moonlight as if to impress on his mind and heart every charm it possessedthe great dark plumes of the firs against the silvery sky the stately white lady the old magic of the dancing brook the faithful tree lovers the beckoning tricksy paths  i shall see it so in my dreams he said as he turned away  they went back to ingleside mr and mrs meredith were there with gertrude oliver who had come from lowbridge to say goodbye everybody was quite cheerful and bright but nobody said much about the war being soon over as they had said when jem went away they did not talk about the war at alland they thought of nothing else at last they gathered around the piano and sang the grand old hymn    oh god our help in ages past     our hope for years to come   our shelter from the stormy blast     and our eternal home  we all come back to god in these days of soulsifting said gertrude to john meredith there have been many days in the past when i didnt believe in godnot as godonly as the impersonal great first cause of the scientists i believe in him nowi have totheres nothing else to fall back on but godhumbly starkly unconditionally  our help in ages pastthe same yesterday today and for ever said the minister gently when we forget godhe remembers us  there was no crowd at the glen station the next morning to see walter off it was becoming a commonplace for a khaki clad boy to board that early morning train after his last leave besides his own only the manse folk were there and mary vance mary had sent her miller off the week before with a determined grin and now considered herself entitled to give expert opinion on how such partings should be conducted  the main thing is to smile and act as if nothing was happening she informed the ingleside group the boys all hate the sob act like poison miller told me i wasnt to come near the station if i couldnt keep from bawling so i got through with my crying beforehand and at the last i said to him good luck miller and if you come back youll find i havent changed any and if you dont come back ill always be proud you went and in any case dont fall in love with a french girl miller swore he wouldnt but you never can tell about those fascinating foreign hussies anyhow the last sight he had of me i was smiling to my limit gee all the rest of the day my face felt as if it had been starched and ironed into a smile  in spite of marys advice and example mrs blythe who had sent jem off with a smile could not quite manage one for walter but at least no one cried dog monday came out of his lair in the shippingshed and sat down close to walter thumping his tail vigorously on the boards of the platform whenever walter spoke to him and looking up with confident eyes as if to say i know youll find jem and bring him back to me  so long old fellow said carl meredith cheerfully when the goodbyes had to be said tell them over there to keep their spirits upi am coming along presently  me too said shirley laconically proffering a brown paw susan heard him and her face turned very grey  una shook hands quietly looking at him with wistful sorrowful darkblue eyes but then unas eyes had always been wistful walter bent his handsome black head in its khaki cap and kissed her with the warm comradely kiss of a brother he had never kissed her before and for a fleeting moment unas face betrayed her if anyone had noticed but nobody did the conductor was shouting all aboard everybody was trying to look very cheerful walter turned to rilla she held his hands and looked up at him she would not see him again until the day broke and the shadows vanishedand she knew not if that daybreak would be on this side of the grave or beyond it  goodbye she said  on her lips it lost all the bitterness it had won through the ages of parting and bore instead all the sweetness of the old loves of all the women who had ever loved and prayed for the beloved  write me often and bring jims up faithfully according to the gospel of morgan walter said lightly having said all his serious things the night before in rainbow valley but at the last moment he took her face between his hands and looked deep into her gallant eyes god bless you rillamyrilla he said softly and tenderly after all it was not a hard thing to fight for a land that bore daughters like this  he stood on the rear platform and waved to them as the train pulled out rilla was standing by herself but una meredith came to her and the two girls who loved him most stood together and held each others cold hands as the train rounded the curve of the wooded hill  rilla spent an hour in rainbow valley that morning about which she never said a word to anyone she did not even write in her diary about it when it was over she went home and made rompers for jims in the evening she went to a junior red cross committee meeting and was severely businesslike  you would never suppose said irene howard to olive kirk afterwards that walter had left for the front only this morning but some people really have no depth of feeling i often wish i could take things as lightly as rilla blythe    chapter xvi  realism and romance  warsaw has fallen said dr blythe with a resigned air as he brought the mail in one warm august day  gertrude and mrs blythe looked dismally at each other and rilla who was feeding jims a morganized diet from a carefully sterilized spoon laid the said spoon down on his tray utterly regardless of germs and said oh dear me in as tragic a tone as if the news had come as a thunderbolt instead of being a foregone conclusion from the preceding weeks dispatches they had thought they were quite resigned to warsaws fall but now they knew they had as always hoped against hope  now let us take a brace said susan it is not the terrible thing we have been thinking i read a dispatch three columns long in the montreal herald yesterday that proved that warsaw was not important from a military point of view at all so let us take the military point of view doctor dear  i read that dispatch too and it has encouraged me immensely said gertrude i knew then and i know now that it was a lie from beginning to end but i am in that state of mind where even a lie is a comfort providing it is a cheerful lie  in that case miss oliver dear the german official reports ought to be all you need said susan sarcastically i never read them now because they make me so mad i cannot put my thoughts properly on my work after a dose of them even this news about warsaw has taken the edge off my afternoons plans misfortunes never come singly i spoiled my baking of bread todayand now warsaw has fallenand here is little kitchener bent on choking himself to death  jims was evidently trying to swallow his spoon germs and all rilla rescued him mechanically and was about to resume the operation of feeding him when a casual remark of her fathers sent such a shock and thrill over her that for the second time she dropped that doomed spoon  kenneth ford is down at martin wests overharbour the doctor was saying his regiment was on its way to the front but was held up in kingsport for some reason and ken got leave of absence to come over to the island  i hope he will come up to see us exclaimed mrs blythe  he only has a day or two off i believe said the doctor absently  nobody noticed rillas flushed face and trembling hands even the most thoughtful and watchful of parents do not see everything that goes on under their very noses rilla made a third attempt to give the longsuffering jims his dinner but all she could think of was the questionwould ken come to see her before he went away she had not heard from him for a long while had he forgotten her completely if he did not come she would know that he had perhaps there was evensome other girl back there in toronto of course there was she was a little fool to be thinking about him at all she would not think about him if he came well and good it would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at ingleside where he had often been a guest if he did not comewell and good too it did not matter very much nobody was going to fret that was all settled comfortablyshe was quite indifferentbut meanwhile jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of morgan with horror jims himself didnt like it being a methodical baby accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each he protested but his protests availed him nothing rilla as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned was utterly demoralized  then the telephonebell rang there was nothing unusual about the telephone ringing it rang on an average every ten minutes at ingleside but rilla dropped jims spoon againon the carpet this timeand flew to the phone as if life depended on her getting there before anybody else jims his patience exhausted lifted up his voice and wept  hello is this ingleside  yes  that you rilla yethyeth oh why couldnt jims stop howling for just one little minute why didnt somebody come in and choke him  know whos speaking  oh didnt she know wouldnt she know that voice anywhereat any time  its kenisnt it  sure thing im here for a lookin can i come up to ingleside tonight and see you  of courthe  had he used you in the singular or plural sense presently she would wring jims neckoh what was ken saying  see here rilla can you arrange that there wont be more than a few dozen people round understand i cant make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line there are a dozen receivers down  did she understand yes she understood  ill try she said  ill be up about eight then byby  rilla hung up the phone and flew to jims but she did not wring that injured infants neck instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair crushed him against her face kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms after this jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity gave him the rest of his dinner properly and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all she sewed at red cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams all aquiver with rainbows ken wanted to see herto see her alone that could be easily managed shirley wouldnt bother them father and mother were going to the manse miss oliver never played gooseberry and jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven she would entertain ken on the verandait would be moonlightshe would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair upyes she wouldat least in a low knot at the nape of her neck mother couldnt object to that surely oh how wonderful and romantic it would be would ken say anythinghe must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone what if it rainedsusan had been complaining about mr hyde that morning what if some officious junior red called to discuss belgians and shirts or worst of all what if fred arnold dropped in he did occasionally  the evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening the doctor and his wife went to the manse shirley and miss oliver went they alone knew where susan went to the store for household supplies and jims went to dreamland rilla put on her georgette gown knotted up her hair and bound a little double string of pearls around it then she tucked a cluster of pale pink baby roses at her belt would ken ask her for a rose for a keepsake she knew that jem had carried to the trenches in flanders a faded rose that faith meredith had kissed and given him the night before he left  rilla looked very sweet when she met ken in the mingled moonlight and vine shadows of the big veranda the hand she gave him was cold and she was so desperately anxious not to lisp that her greeting was prim and precise how handsome and tall kenneth looked in his lieutenants uniform it made him seem older tooso much so that rilla felt rather foolish hadnt it been the height of absurdity for her to suppose that this splendid young officer had anything special to say to her little rilla blythe of glen st mary likely she hadnt understood him after allhe had only meant that he didnt want a mob of folks around making a fuss over him and trying to lionize him as they had probably done overharbour yes of course that was all he meantand she little idiot had gone and vainly imagined that he didnt want anybody but her and he would think she had manoeuvred everybody away so that they could be alone together and he would laugh to himself at her  this is better luck than i hoped for said ken leaning back in his chair and looking at her with very unconcealed admiration in his eloquent eyes i was sure someone would be hanging about and it was just you i wanted to see rillamyrilla  rillas dream castle flashed into the landscape again this was unmistakable enough certainlynot much doubt as to his meaning here  there arentso many of usto poke around as there used to be she said softly  no thats so said ken gently jem and walter and the girls awayit makes a big blank doesnt it but he leaned forward until his dark curls almost brushed her hairdoesnt fred arnold try to fill the blank occasionally ive been told so  at this moment before rilla could make any reply jims began to cry at the top of his voice in the room whose open window was just above themjims who hardly ever cried in the evening moreover he was crying as rilla knew from experience with a vim and energy that betokened that he had been already whimpering softly unheard for some time and was thoroughly exasperated when jims started in crying like that he made a thorough job of it rilla knew that there was no use to sit still and pretend to ignore him he wouldnt stop and conversation of any kind was out of the question when such shrieks and howls were floating over your head besides she was afraid kenneth would think she was utterly unfeeling if she sat still and let a baby cry like that he was not likely acquainted with morgans invaluable volume  she got up jims has had a nightmare i think he sometimes has one and he is always badly frightened by it excuse me for a moment  rilla flew upstairs wishing quite frankly that soup tureens had never been invented but when jims at sight of her lifted his little arms entreatingly and swallowed several sobs with tears rolling down his cheeks resentment went out of her heart after all the poor darling was frightened she picked him up gently and rocked him soothingly until his sobs ceased and his eyes closed then she essayed to lay him down in his crib jims opened his eyes and shrieked a protest this performance was repeated twice rilla grew desperate she couldnt leave ken down there alone any longershe had been away nearly half an hour already with a resigned air she marched downstairs carrying jims and sat down on the veranda it was no doubt a ridiculous thing to sit and cuddle a contrary warbaby when your best young man was making his farewell call but there was nothing else to be done  jims was supremely happy he kicked his little pinksoled feet rapturously out under his white nighty and gave one of his rare laughs he was beginning to be a very pretty baby his golden hair curled in silken ringlets all over his little round head and his eyes were beautiful  hes a decorative kiddy all right isnt he said ken  his looks are very well said rilla bitterly as if to imply that they were much the best of him jims being an astute infant sensed trouble in the atmosphere and realized that it was up to him to clear it away he turned his face up to rilla smiled adorably and said clearly and beguilingly willwill  it was the very first time he had spoken a word or tried to speak rilla was so delighted that she forgot her grudge against him she forgave him with a hug and kiss jims understanding that he was restored to favour cuddled down against her just where a gleam of light from the lamp in the livingroom struck across his hair and turned it into a halo of gold against her breast  kenneth sat very still and silent looking at rillaat the delicate girlish silhouette of her her long lashes her dented lip her adorable chin in the dim moonlight as she sat with her head bent a little over jims the lamplight glinting on her pearls until they glistened like a slender nimbus he thought she looked exactly like the madonna that hung over his mothers desk at home he carried that picture of her in his heart to the horror of the battlefields of france he had had a strong fancy for rilla blythe ever since the night of the four winds dance but it was when he saw her there with little jims in her arms that he loved her and realized it and all the while poor rilla was sitting disappointed and humiliated feeling that her last evening with ken was spoiled and wondering why things always had to go so contrarily outside of books she felt too absurd to try to talk evidently ken was completely disgusted too since he was sitting there in such stony silence  hope revived momentarily when jims went so thoroughly asleep that she thought it would be safe to lay him down on the couch in the livingroom but when she came out again susan was sitting on the veranda loosening her bonnet strings with the air of one who meant to stay where she was for some time  have you got your baby to sleep she asked kindly  your baby really susan might have more tact  yes said rilla shortly  susan laid her parcels on the reed table as one determined to do her duty she was very tired but she must help rilla out here was kenneth ford who had come to call on the family and they were all unfortunately out and the poor child had had to entertain him alone but susan had come to her rescuesusan would do her part no matter how tired she was  dear me how you have grown up she said looking at kens six feet of khaki uniform without the least awe susan had grown used to khaki now and at sixtyfour even a lieutenants uniform is just clothes and nothing else it is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up rilla here now is almost fifteen  im going on seventeen susan cried rilla almost passionately she was a whole month past sixteen it was intolerable of susan  it seems just the other day that you were all babies said susan ignoring rillas protest you were really the prettiest baby i ever saw ken though your mother had an awful time trying to cure you of sucking your thumb do you remember the day i spanked you  no said ken  oh well i suppose you would be too youngyou were only about four and you were here with your mother and you insisted on teasing nan until she cried i had tried several ways of stopping you but none availed and i saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve so i picked you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well you howled at the top of your voice but you left nan alone after that  rilla was writhing hadnt susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the canadian army apparently she had not oh what would ken think i suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either continued susan who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening i shall never no never forget it she was up here one night with you when you were about three and you and walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten i had a big puncheon of rainwater by the spout which i was reserving for making soap and you and walter began quarrelling over the kitten walter was at one side of the puncheon standing on a chair holding the kitten and you were standing on a chair at the other side you leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled you were always a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony walter held on tight and the poor kitten yelled but you dragged walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost your balance and tumbled into that puncheon kitten and all if i had not been on the spot you would both have been drowned i flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before much harm was done and your mother who had seen it all from the upstairs window came down and picked you up dripping as you were and gave you a beautiful spanking ah said susan with a sigh those were happy old days at ingleside  must have been said ken his voice sounded queer and stiff rilla supposed he was hopelessly enraged the truth was he dared not trust his voice lest it betray his frantic desire to laugh  rilla here now said susan looking affectionately at that unhappy damsel never was much spanked she was a real wellbehaved child for the most part but her father did spank her once she got two bottles of pills out of his office and dared alice clow to see which of them could swallow all the pills first and if her father had not happened in the nick of time those two children would have been corpses by night as it was they were both sick enough shortly after but the doctor spanked rilla then and there and he made such a thorough job of it that she never meddled with anything in his office afterwards we hear a great deal nowadays of something that is called moral persuasion but in my opinion a good spanking and no nagging afterwards is a much better thing  rilla wondered viciously whether susan meant to relate all the family spankings but susan had finished with the subject and branched off to another cheerful one  i remember little tod macallister overharbour killed himself that very way eating up a whole box of fruitatives because he thought they were candy it was a very sad affair he was said susan earnestly the very cutest little corpse i ever laid my eyes on it was very careless of his mother to leave the fruitatives where he could get them but she was wellknown to be a heedless creature one day she found a nest of five eggs as she was going across the fields to church with a brand new blue silk dress on so she put them in the pocket of her petticoat and when she got to church she forgot all about them and sat down on them and her dress was ruined not to speak of the petticoat let me seewould not tod be some relation of yours your great grandmother west was a macallister her brother amos was a macdonaldite in religion i am told he used to take the jerks something fearful but you look more like your great grandfather west than the macallisters he died of a paralytic stroke quite early in life  did you see anybody at the store asked rilla desperately in the faint hope of directing susans conversation into more agreeable channels  nobody except mary vance said susan and she was stepping round as brisk as the irishmans flea  what terrible similes susan used would kenneth think she acquired them from the family  to hear mary talk about miller douglas you would think he was the only glen boy who had enlisted susan went on but of course she always did brag and she has some good qualities i am willing to admit though i did not think so that time she chased rilla here through the village with a dried codfish till the poor child fell heels over head into the puddle before carter flaggs store  rilla went cold all over with wrath and shame were there any more disgraceful scenes in her past that susan could rake up as for ken he could have howled over susans speeches but he would not so insult the duenna of his lady so he sat with a preternaturally solemn face which seemed to poor rilla a haughty and offended one  i paid eleven cents for a bottle of ink tonight complained susan ink is twice as high as it was last year perhaps it is because woodrow wilson has been writing so many notes it must cost him considerable my cousin sophia says woodrow wilson is not the man she expected him to bebut then no man ever was being an old maid i do not know much about men and have never pretended to but my cousin sophia is very hard on them although she married two of them which you might think was a fair share albert crawfords chimney blew down in that big gale we had last week and when sophia heard the bricks clattering on the roof she thought it was a zeppelin raid and went into hysterics and mrs albert crawford says that of the two things she would have preferred the zeppelin raid  rilla sat limply in her chair like one hypnotized she knew susan would stop talking when she was ready to stop and that no earthly power could make her stop any sooner as a rule she was very fond of susan but just now she hated her with a deadly hatred it was ten oclock ken would soon have to gothe others would soon be homeand she had not even had a chance to explain to ken that fred arnold filled no blank in her life nor ever could her rainbow castle lay in ruins round her  kenneth got up at last he realized that susan was there to stay as long as he did and it was a three mile walk to martin wests overharbour he wondered if rilla had put susan up to this not wanting to be left alone with him lest he say something fred arnolds sweetheart did not want to hear rilla got up too and walked silently the length of the veranda with him they stood there for a moment ken on the lower step the step was half sunk into the earth and mint grew thickly about and over its edge often crushed by so many passing feet it gave out its essence freely and the spicy odour hung round them like a soundless invisible benediction ken looked up at rilla whose hair was shining in the moonlight and whose eyes were pools of allurement all at once he felt sure there was nothing in that gossip about fred arnold  rilla he said in a sudden intense whisper you are the sweetest thing  rilla flushed and looked at susan ken looked too and saw that susans back was turned he put his arm about rilla and kissed her it was the first time rilla had ever been kissed she thought perhaps she ought to resent it but she didnt instead she glanced timidly into kenneths seeking eyes and her glance was a kiss  rillamyrilla said ken will you promise that you wont let anyone else kiss you until i come back  yes said rilla trembling and thrilling  susan was turning round ken loosened his hold and stepped to the walk  goodbye he said casually rilla heard herself saying it just as casually she stood and watched him down the walk out of the gate and down the road when the fir wood hid him from her sight she suddenly said oh in a choked way and ran down to the gate sweet blossomy things catching at her skirts as she ran leaning over the gate she saw kenneth walking briskly down the road over the bars of tree shadows and moonlight his tall erect figure grey in the white radiance as he reached the turn he stopped and looked back and saw her standing amid the tall white lilies by the gate he waved his handshe waved hershe was gone around the turn  rilla stood there for a little while gazing across the fields of mist and silver she had heard her mother say that she loved turns in roadsthey were so provocative and alluring rilla thought she hated them she had seen jem and jerry vanish from her around a bend in the roadthen walterand now ken brothers and playmate and sweetheartthey were all gone never it might be to return yet still the piper piped and the dance of death went on  when rilla walked slowly back to the house susan was still sitting by the veranda table and susan was sniffing suspiciously  i have been thinking rilla dear of the old days in the house of dreams when kenneths mother and father were courting and jem was a little baby and you were not born or thought of it was a very romantic affair and she and your mother were such chums to think i should have lived to see her son going to the front as if she had not had enough trouble in her early life without this coming upon her but we must take a brace and see it through  all rillas anger against susan had evaporated with kens kiss still burning on her lips and the wonderful significance of the promise he had asked thrilling heart and soul she could not be angry with anyone she put her slim white hand into susans brown workhardened one and gave it a squeeze susan was a faithful old dear and would lay down her life for any one of them  you are tired rilla dear and had better go to bed susan said patting her hand i noticed you were too tired to talk tonight i am glad i came home in time to help you out it is very tiresome trying to entertain young men when you are not accustomed to it  rilla carried jims upstairs and went to bed but not before she had sat for a long time at her window reconstructing her rainbow castle with several added domes and turrets  i wonder she said to herself if i am or am not engaged to kenneth ford    chapter xvii  the weeks wear by  rilla read her first love letter in her rainbow valley firshadowed nook and a girls first love letter whatever blase older people may think of it is an event of tremendous importance in the teens after kenneths regiment had left kingsport there came a fortnight of dullyaching anxiety and when the congregation sang in church on sunday evenings    oh hear us when we cry to thee   for those in peril on the sea  rillas voice always failed her for with the words came a horribly vivid mind picture of a submarined ship sinking beneath pitiless waves amid the struggles and cries of drowning men then word came that kenneths regiment had arrived safely in england and now at last here was his letter it began with something that made rilla supremely happy for the moment and ended with a paragraph that crimsoned her cheeks with the wonder and thrill and delight of it between beginning and ending the letter was just such a jolly newsy epistle as ken might have written to anyone but for the sake of that beginning and ending rilla slept with the letter under her pillow for weeks sometimes waking in the night to slip her fingers under and just touch it and looked with secret pity on other girls whose sweethearts could never have written them anything half so wonderful and exquisite kenneth was not the son of a famous novelist for nothing he had a way of expressing things in a few poignant significant words that seemed to suggest far more than they uttered and never grew stale or flat or foolish with ever so many scores of readings rilla went home from rainbow valley as if she flew rather than walked  but such moments of uplift were rare that autumn to be sure there was one day in september when great news came of a big allied victory in the west and susan ran out to hoist the flagthe first time she had hoisted it since the russian line broke and the last time she was to hoist it for many dismal moons  likely the big push has begun at last mrs dr dear she exclaimed and we will soon see the finish of the huns our boys will be home by christmas now hurrah  susan was ashamed of herself for hurrahing the minute she had done it and apologized meekly for such an outburst of juvenility but indeed mrs dr dear this good news has gone to my head after this awful summer of russian slumps and gallipoli setbacks  good news said miss oliver bitterly i wonder if the women whose men have been killed for it will call it good news just because our own men are not on that part of the front we are rejoicing as if the victory had cost no lives  now miss oliver dear do not take that view of it deprecated susan we have not had much to rejoice over of late and yet men were being killed just the same do not let yourself slump like poor cousin sophia she said when the word came ah it is nothing but a rift in the clouds we are up this week but we will be down the next well sophia crawford said ifor i will never give in to her mrs dr deargod himself cannot make two hills without a hollow between them as i have heard it said but that is no reason why we should not take the good of the hills when we are on them but cousin sophia moaned on here is the gallipolly expedition a failure and the grand duke nicholas sent off and everyone knows the czar of rooshia is a progerman and the allies have no ammunition and bulgaria is going against us and the end is not yet for england and france must be punished for their deadly sins until they repent in sackcloth and ashes i think myself i said that they will do their repenting in khaki and trench mud and it seems to me that the huns should have a few sins to repent of also they are instruments in the hands of the almighty to purge the garner said sophia and then i got mad mrs dr dear and told her i did not and never would believe that the almighty ever took such dirty instruments in hand for any purpose whatever and that i did not consider it decent for her to be using the words of holy writ as glibly as she was doing in ordinary conversation she was not i told her a minister or even an elder and for the time being i squelched her mrs dr dear cousin sophia has no spirit she is very different from her niece mrs dean crawford overharbour you know the dean crawfords had five boys and now the new baby is another boy all the connection and especially dean crawford were much disappointed because their hearts had been set on a girl but mrs dean just laughed and said everywhere i went this summer i saw the sign men wanted staring me in the face do you think i could go and have a girl under such circumstances there is spirit for you mrs dr dear but cousin sophia would say the child was just so much more cannon fodder  cousin sophia had full range for her pessimism that gloomy autumn and even susan incorrigible old optimist as she was was hard put to it for cheer when bulgaria lined up with germany susan only remarked scornfully one more nation anxious for a licking but the greek tangle worried her beyond her powers of philosophy to endure calmly  constantine of greece has a german wife mrs dr dear and that fact squelches hope to think that i should have lived to care what kind of a wife constantine of greece had the miserable creature is under his wifes thumb and that is a bad place for any man to be i am an old maid and an old maid has to be independent or she will be squashed out but if i had been a married woman mrs dr dear i would have been meek and humble it is my opinion that this sophia of greece is a minx  susan was furious when the news came that venizelos had met with defeat i could spank constantine and skin him alive afterwards that i could she exclaimed bitterly  oh susan im surprised at you said the doctor pulling a long face have you no regard for the proprieties skin him alive by all means but omit the spanking  if he had been well spanked in his younger days he might have more sense now retorted susan but i suppose princes are never spanked more is the pity i see the allies have sent him an ultimatum i could tell them that it will take more than ultimatums to skin a snake like constantine perhaps the allied blockade will hammer sense into his head but that will take some time i am thinking and in the meantime what is to become of poor serbia  they saw what became of serbia and during the process susan was hardly to be lived with in her exasperation she abused everything and everybody except kitchener and she fell upon poor president wilson tooth and claw  if he had done his duty and gone into the war long ago we should not have seen this mess in serbia she avowed  it would be a serious thing to plunge a great country like the united states with its mixed population into the war susan said the doctor who sometimes came to the defence of the president not because he thought wilson needed it especially but from an unholy love of baiting susan  maybe doctor dearmaybe but that makes me think of the old story of the girl who told her grandmother she was going to be married it is a solemn thing to be married said the old lady yes but it is a solemner thing not to be said the girl and i can testify to that out of my own experience doctor dear and i think it is a solemner thing for the yankees that they have kept out of the war than it would have been if they had gone into it however though i do not know much about them i am of the opinion that we will see them starting something yet woodrow wilson or no woodrow wilson when they get it into their heads that this war is not a correspondence school they will not said susan energetically waving a saucepan with one hand and a soup ladle with the other be too proud to fight then  on a paleyellow windy evening in october carl meredith went away he had enlisted on his eighteenth birthday john meredith saw him off with a set face his two boys were gonethere was only little bruce left now he loved bruce and bruces mother dearly but jerry and carl were the sons of the bride of his youth and carl was the only one of all his children who had cecilias very eyes as they looked lovingly out at him above carls uniform the pale minister suddenly remembered the day when for the first and last time he had tried to whip carl for his prank with the eel that was the first time he had realised how much carls eyes were like cecilias now he realised it again once more would he ever again see his dead wifes eyes looking at him from his sons face what a bonny clean handsome lad he was it washardto see him go john meredith seemed to be looking at a torn plain strewed with the bodies of ablebodied men between the ages of eighteen and fortyfive only the other day carl had been a little scrap of a boy hunting bugs in rainbow valley taking lizards to bed with him and scandalizing the glen by carrying frogs to sunday school it seemed hardlyrightsomehow that he should be an ablebodied man in khaki yet john meredith had said no word to dissuade him when carl had told him he must go  rilla felt carls going keenly they had always been cronies and playmates he was only a little older than she was and they had been children in rainbow valley together she recalled all their old pranks and escapades as she walked slowly home alone the full moon peeped through the scudding clouds with sudden floods of weird illumination the telephone wires sang a shrill weird song in the wind and the tall spikes of withered greyheaded goldenrod in the fence corners swayed and beckoned wildly to her like groups of old witches weaving unholy spells on such a night as this long ago carl would come over to ingleside and whistle her out to the gate lets go on a moonspree rilla he would say and the two of them would scamper off to rainbow valley rilla had never been afraid of his beetles and bugs though she drew a hard and fast line at snakes they used to talk together of almost everything and were teased about each other at school but one evening when they were about ten years of age they had solemnly promised by the old spring in rainbow valley that they would never marry each other alice clow had crossed out their names on her slate in school that day and it came out that both married they did not like the idea at all hence the mutual vow in rainbow valley there was nothing like an ounce of prevention rilla laughed over the old memoryand then sighed that very day a dispatch from some london paper had contained the cheerful announcement that the present moment is the darkest since the war began it was dark enough and rilla wished desperately that she could do something besides waiting and serving at home as day after day the glen boys she had known went away if she were only a boy speeding in khaki by carls side to the western front she had wished that in a burst of romance when jem had gone without perhaps really meaning it she meant it now there were moments when waiting at home in safety and comfort seemed an unendurable thing  the moon burst triumphantly through an especially dark cloud and shadow and silver chased each other in waves over the glen rilla remembered one moonlit evening of childhood when she had said to her mother the moon just looks like a sorry sorry face she thought it looked like that stillan agonised careworn face as though it looked down on dreadful sights what did it see on the western front in broken serbia on shellswept gallipoli  i am tired miss oliver had said that day in a rare outburst of impatience of this horrible rack of strained emotions when every day brings a new horror or the dread of it no dont look reproachfully at me mrs blythe theres nothing heroic about me today ive slumped i wish england had left belgium to her fatei wish canada had never sent a mani wish wed tied our boys to our apron strings and not let one of them go ohi shall be ashamed of myself in half an hourbut at this very minute i mean every word of it will the allies never strike  patience is a tired mare but she jogs on said susan  while the steeds of armageddon thunder trampling over our hearts retorted miss oliver susan tell medont you everdidnt you evertake spells of feeling that you must screamor swearor smash somethingjust because your torture reaches a point when it becomes unbearable  i have never sworn or desired to swear miss oliver dear but i will admit said susan with the air of one determined to make a clean breast of it once and for all that i have experienced occasions when it was a relief to do considerable banging  dont you think that is a kind of swearing susan what is the difference between slamming a door viciously and saying d  miss oliver dear interrupted susan desperately determined to save gertrude from herself if human power could do it you are all tired out and unstrungand no wonder teaching those obstreperous youngsters all day and coming home to bad war news but just you go upstairs and lie down and i will bring you up a cup of hot tea and a bite of toast and very soon you will not want to slam doors or swear  susan youre a good soula very pearl of susans but susan it would be such a reliefto say just one soft low little tiny d  i will bring you a hotwater bottle for the soles of your feet also interposed susan resolutely and it would not be any relief to say that word you are thinking of miss oliver and that you may tie to  well ill try the hotwater bottle first said miss oliver repenting herself on teasing susan and vanishing upstairs to susans intense relief susan shook her head ominously as she filled the hotwater bottle the war was certainly relaxing the standards of behaviour woefully here was miss oliver admittedly on the point of profanity  we must draw the blood from her brain said susan and if this bottle is not effective i will see what can be done with a mustard plaster  gertrude rallied and carried on lord kitchener went to greece whereat susan foretold that constantine would soon experience a change of heart lloyd george began to heckle the allies regarding equipment and guns and susan said you would hear more of lloyd george yet the gallant anzacs withdrew from gallipoli and susan approved the step with reservations the siege of kutelamara began and susan pored over maps of mesopotamia and abused the turks henry ford started for europe and susan flayed him with sarcasm sir john french was superseded by sir douglas haig and susan dubiously opined that it was poor policy to swap horses crossing a stream though to be sure haig was a good name and french had a foreign sound say what you might not a move on the great chessboard of king or bishop or pawn escaped susan who had once read only glen st mary notes there was a time she said sorrowfully when i did not care what happened outside of pe island and now a king cannot have a toothache in russia or china but it worries me it may be broadening to the mind as the doctor said but it is very painful to the feelings  when christmas came again susan did not set any vacant places at the festive board two empty chairs were too much even for susan who had thought in september that there would not be one  this is the first christmas that walter was not home rilla wrote in her diary that night jem used to be away for christmases up in avonlea but walter never was i had letters from ken and him today they are still in england but expect to be in the trenches very soon and thenbut i suppose well be able to endure it somehow to me the strangest of all the strange things since 1914 is how we have all learned to accept things we never thought we couldto go on with life as a matter of course i know that jem and jerry are in the trenchesthat ken and walter will be soonthat if one of them does not come back my heart will breakyet i go on and work and planyes and even enjoy life by times there are moments when we have real fun because just for the moment we dont think about things and thenwe rememberand the remembering is worse than thinking of it all the time would have been  today was dark and cloudy and tonight is wild enough as gertrude says to please any novelist in search of suitable matter for a murder or elopement the raindrops streaming over the panes look like tears running down a face and the wind is shrieking through the maple grove  this hasnt been a nice christmas day in any way nan had toothache and susan had red eyes and assumed a weird and gruesome flippancy of manner to deceive us into thinking she hadnt and jims had a bad cold all day and im afraid of croup he has had croup twice since october the first time i was nearly frightened to death for father and mother were both awayfather always is away it seems to me when any of this household gets sick but susan was cool as a fish and knew just what to do and by morning jims was all right that child is a cross between a duck and an imp hes a year and four months old trots about everywhere and says quite a few words he has the cutest little way of calling me willawill it always brings back that dreadful ridiculous delightful night when ken came to say goodbye and i was so furious and happy jims is pink and white and bigeyed and curlyhaired and every now and then i discover a new dimple in him i can never quite believe he is really the same creature as that scrawny yellow ugly little changeling i brought home in the soup tureen nobody has ever heard a word from jim anderson if he never comes back i shall keep jims always everybody here worships and spoils himor would spoil him if morgan and i didnt stand remorselessly in the way susan says jims is the cleverest child she ever saw and can recognize old nick when he sees himthis because jims threw poor doc out of an upstairs window one day doc turned into mr hyde on his way down and landed in a currant bush spitting and swearing i tried to console his inner cat with a saucer of milk but he would have none of it and remained mr hyde the rest of the day jimss latest exploit was to paint the cushion of the big armchair in the sun parlour with molasses and before anybody found it out mrs fred clow came in on red cross business and sat down on it her new silk dress was ruined and nobody could blame her for being vexed but she went into one of her tempers and said nasty things and gave me such slams about spoiling jims that i nearly boiled over too but i kept the lid on till she had waddled away and then i exploded  the fat clumsy horrid old thing i saidand oh what a satisfaction it was to say it  she has three sons at the front mother said rebukingly  i suppose that covers all her shortcomings in manners i retorted but i was ashamedfor it is true that all her boys have gone and she was very plucky and loyal about it too and she is a perfect tower of strength in the red cross its a little hard to remember all the heroines just the same it was her second new silk dress in one year and that when everybody isor should betrying to save and serve  i had to bring out my green velvet hat again lately and begin wearing it i hung on to my blue straw sailor as long as i could how i hate the green velvet hat it is so elaborate and conspicuous i dont see how i could ever have liked it but i vowed to wear it and wear it i will  shirley and i went down to the station this morning to take little dog monday a bangup christmas dinner dog monday waits and watches there still with just as much hope and confidence as ever sometimes he hangs around the station house and talks to people and the rest of his time he sits at his little kennel door and watches the track unwinkingly we never try to coax him home now we know it is of no use when jem comes back monday will come home with him and if jemnever comes backmonday will wait there for him as long as his dear dog heart goes on beating  fred arnold was here last night he was eighteen in november and is going to enlist just as soon as his mother is over an operation she has to have he has been coming here very often lately and though i like him so much it makes me uncomfortable because i am afraid he is thinking that perhaps i could care something for him i cant tell him about kenbecause after all what is there to tell and yet i dont like to behave coldly and distantly when he will be going away so soon it is very perplexing i remember i used to think it would be such fun to have dozens of beauxand now im worried to death because two are too many  i am learning to cook susan is teaching me i tried to learn long agobut no let me be honestsusan tried to teach me which is a very different thing i never seemed to succeed with anything and i got discouraged but since the boys have gone away i wanted to be able to make cake and things for them myself and so i started in again and this time im getting on surprisingly well susan says it is all in the way i hold my mouth and father says my subconscious mind is desirous of learning now and i dare say theyre both right anyhow i can make dandy shortbread and fruitcake i got ambitious last week and attempted cream puffs but made an awful failure of them they came out of the oven flat as flukes i thought maybe the cream would fill them up again and make them plump but it didnt i think susan was secretly pleased she is past mistress in the art of making cream puffs and it would break her heart if anyone else here could make them as well i wonder if susan tamperedbut no i wont suspect her of such a thing  miranda pryor spent an afternoon here a few days ago helping me cut out certain red cross garments known by the charming name of vermin shirts susan thinks that name is not quite decent so i suggested she call them cootie sarks which is old highland sandys version of it but she shook her head and i heard her telling mother later that in her opinion cooties and sarks were not proper subjects for young girls to talk about she was especially horrified when jem wrote in his last letter to mother tell susan i had a fine cootie hunt this morning and caught fiftythree susan positively turned peagreen mrs dr dear she said when i was young if decent people were so unfortunate as to getthose insectsthey kept it a secret if possible i do not want to be narrowminded mrs dr dear but i still think it is better not to mention such things  miranda grew confidential over our vermin shirts and told me all her troubles she is desperately unhappy she is engaged to joe milgrave and joe joined up in october and has been training in charlottetown ever since her father was furious when he joined and forbade miranda ever to have any dealing or communication with him again poor joe expects to go overseas any day and wants miranda to marry him before he goes which shows that there have been communications in spite of whiskersonthemoon miranda wants to marry him but cannot and she declares it will break her heart  why dont you run away and marry him i said it didnt go against my conscience in the least to give her such advice joe milgrave is a splendid fellow and mr pryor fairly beamed on him until the war broke out and i know mr pryor would forgive miranda very quickly once it was over and he wanted his housekeeper back but miranda shook her silvery head dolefully  joe wants me to but i cant mothers last words to me as she lay on her dyingbed were never never run away miranda and i promised  mirandas mother died two years ago and it seems according to miranda that her mother and father actually ran away to be married themselves to picture whiskersonthemoon as the hero of an elopement is beyond my power but such was the case and mrs pryor at least lived to repent it she had a hard life of it with mr pryor and she thought it was a punishment on her for running away so she made miranda promise she would never for any reason whatever do it  of course you cannot urge a girl to break a promise made to a dying mother so i did not see what miranda could do unless she got joe to come to the house when her father was away and marry her there but miranda said that couldnt be managed her father seemed to suspect she might be up to something of the sort and he never went away for long at a time and of course joe couldnt get leave of absence at an hours notice  no i shall just have to let joe go and he will be killedi know he will be killedand my heart will break said miranda her tears running down and copiously bedewing the vermin shirts  i am not writing like this for lack of any real sympathy with poor miranda ive just got into the habit of giving things a comical twist if i can when im writing to jem and walter and ken to make them laugh i really felt sorry for miranda who is as much in love with joe as a chinablue girl can be with anyone and who is dreadfully ashamed of her fathers progerman sentiments i think she understood that i did for she said she had wanted to tell me all about her worries because i had grown so sympathetic this past year i wonder if i have i know i used to be a selfish thoughtless creaturehow selfish and thoughtless i am ashamed to remember now so i cant be quite so bad as i was  i wish i could help miranda it would be very romantic to contrive a warwedding and i should dearly love to get the better of whiskersonthemoon but at present the oracle has not spoken    chapter xviii  a warwedding  i can tell you this dr dear said susan pale with wrath that germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous  they were all in the big ingleside kitchen susan was mixing biscuits for supper mrs blythe was making shortbread for jem and rilla was compounding candy for ken and walterit had once been walter and ken in her thoughts but somehow quite unconsciously this had changed until kens name came naturally first cousin sophia was also there knitting all the boys were going to be killed in the long run so cousin sophia felt in her bones but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones so cousin sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily  into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor wrathful and excited over the burning of the parliament buildings in ottawa and susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited  what will those huns do next she demanded coming over here and burning our parliament building did anyone ever hear of such an outrage  we dont know that the germans are responsible for this said the doctormuch as if he felt quite sure they were fires do start without their agency sometimes and uncle mark macallisters barn was burnt last week you can hardly accuse the germans of that susan  indeed dr dear i do not know susan nodded slowly and portentously whiskersonthemoon was there that very day the fire broke out half an hour after he was gone so much is a factbut i shall not accuse a presbyterian elder of burning anybodys barn until i have proof however everybody knows dr dear that both uncle marks boys have enlisted and that uncle mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings so no doubt germany is anxious to get square with him  i could never speak at a recruiting meeting said cousin sophia solemnly i could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another womans son to go to murder and be murdered  could you not said susan well sophia crawford i felt as if i could ask anyone to go when i read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in poland think of that sophia crawfordsusan shook a floury finger at sophianotonechildundereightyearsofage  i suppose the germans has et em all sighed cousin sophia  well nooo said susan reluctantly as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the huns couldnt be accused of the germans have not turned cannibal yetas far as i know they have died of starvation and exposure the poor little creatures there is murdering for you cousin sophia crawford the thought of it poisons every bite and sup i take  i see that fred carson of lowbridge has been awarded a distinguished conduct medal remarked the doctor over his local paper  i heard that last week said susan he is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring his letter telling his folks about it came when his old grandmother carson was on her dyingbed she had only a few minutes more to live and the episcopal minister who was there asked her if she would not like him to pray oh yes yes you can pray she said impatientlikeshe was a dean dr dear and the deans were always highspiritedyou can pray but for pitys sake pray low and dont disturb me i want to think over this splendid news and i have not much time left to do it that was almira carson all over fred was the apple of her eye she was seventyfive years of age and had not a grey hair in her head they tell me  by the way that reminds mei found a grey hair this morningmy very first said mrs blythe  i have noticed that grey hair for some time mrs dr dear but i did not speak of it thought i to myself she has enough to bear but now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable  i must be getting old gilbert mrs blythe laughed a trifle ruefully people are beginning to tell me i look so young they never tell you that when you are young but i shall not worry over my silver thread i never liked red hair gilbert did i ever tell you of that time years ago at green gables when i dyed my hair nobody but marilla and i knew about it  was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone  yes i bought a bottle of dye from a german jew pedlar i fondly expected it would turn my hair blackand it turned it green so it had to be cut off  you had a narrow escape mrs dr dear exclaimed susan of course you were too young then to know what a german was it was a special mercy of providence that it was only green dye and not poison  it seems hundreds of years since those green gables days sighed mrs blythe they belonged to another world altogether life has been cut in two by the chasm of war what is ahead i dont knowbut it cant be a bit like the past i wonder if those of us who have lived half our lives in the old world will ever feel wholly at home in the new  have you noticed asked miss oliver glancing up from her book how everything written before the war seems so far away now too one feels as if one was reading something as ancient as the iliad this poem of wordsworthsthe senior class have it in their entrance workive been glancing over it its classic calm and repose and the beauty of the lines seem to belong to another planet and to have as little to do with the present worldwelter as the evening star  the only thing that i find much comfort in reading nowadays is the bible remarked susan whisking her biscuits into the oven there are so many passages in it that seem to me exactly descriptive of the huns old highland sandy declares that there is no doubt that the kaiser is the antichrist spoken of in revelations but i do not go as far as that it would in my humble opinion mrs dr dear be too great an honour for him  early one morning several days later miranda pryor slipped up to ingleside ostensibly to get some red cross sewing but in reality to talk over with sympathetic rilla troubles that were past bearing alone she brought her dog with heran overfed bandylegged little animal very dear to her heart because joe milgrave had given it to her when it was a puppy mr pryor regarded all dogs with disfavour but in those days he had looked kindly upon joe as a suitor for mirandas hand and so he had allowed her to keep the puppy miranda was so grateful that she endeavoured to please her father by naming her dog after his political idol the great liberal chieftain sir wilfrid laurierthough his title was soon abbreviated to wilfy sir wilfrid grew and flourished and waxed fat but miranda spoiled him absurdly and nobody else liked him rilla especially hated him because of his detestable trick of lying flat on his back and entreating you with waving paws to tickle his sleek stomach when she saw that mirandas pale eyes bore unmistakable testimony of her having cried all night rilla asked her to come up to her room knowing miranda had a tale of woe to tell but she ordered sir wilfrid to remain below  oh cant he come too said miranda wistfully poor wilfy wont be any botherand i wiped his paws so carefully before i brought him in he is always so lonesome in a strange place without meand very soon hell beallill have leftto remind meof joe  rilla yielded and sir wilfrid with his tail curled at a saucy angle over his brindled back trotted triumphantly up the stairs before them  oh rilla sobbed miranda when they had reached sanctuary im so unhappy i cant begin to tell you how unhappy i am truly my heart is breaking  rilla sat down on the lounge beside her sir wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out and listened what is the trouble miranda  joe is coming home tonight on his last leave i had a letter from him on saturdayhe sends my letters in care of bob crawford you know because of fatherand oh rilla he will only have four dayshe has to go away friday morningand i may never see him again  does he still want you to marry him asked rilla  oh yes he implored me in his letter to run away and be married but i cannot do that rilla not even for joe my only comfort is that i will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon father has to go to charlottetown on business at least we will have one good farewell talk but ohafterwardswhy rilla i know father wont even let me go to the station friday morning to see joe off  why in the world dont you and joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home demanded rilla  miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked  whywhythat is impossible rilla  why briefly demanded the organizer of the junior red cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens  whywhywe never thought of such a thingjoe hasnt a licensei have no dressi couldnt be married in blackiiweyouyou miranda lost herself altogether and sir wilfrid seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp  rilla blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes then she said miranda if you will put yourself into my hands ill have you married to joe before four oclock tomorrow afternoon  oh you couldnt  i can and i will but youll have to do exactly as i tell you  ohidont thinkoh father will kill me  nonsense hell be very angry i suppose but are you more afraid of your fathers anger than you are of joes never coming back to you  no said miranda with sudden firmness im not  will you do as i tell you then  yes i will  then get joe on the longdistance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight  oh i couldnt wailed the aghast miranda itit would be soso indelicate  rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap heaven grant me patience she said under her breath ill do it then she said aloud and meanwhile you go home and make what preparations you can when i phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once  as soon as miranda pallid scared but desperately resolved had gone rilla flew to the telephone and put in a longdistance call for charlottetown she got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced providence approved of her undertaking but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with joe milgrave at his camp meanwhile she paced impatiently about and prayed that when she did get joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to whiskersonthemoon  is that you joe rilla blythe is speakingrillarillaoh never mind listen to this before you come home tonight get a marriage licensea marriage licenseyes a marriage licenseand a weddingring did you get that and will you do it very well be sure you do itit is your only chance  flushed with triumphfor her only fear was that she might not be able to locate joe in timerilla rang the pryor ring this time she had not such good luck for she drew whiskersonthemoon  is that miranda ohmr pryor well mr pryor will you kindly ask miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing it is very important or i would not trouble her ohthank you  mr pryor had consented somewhat grumpily but he had consentedhe did not want to offend dr blythe and he knew that if he refused to allow miranda to do any red cross work public opinion would make the glen too hot for comfort rilla went out to the kitchen shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed susan and then said solemnly susan can you make a weddingcake this afternoon  a weddingcake susan stared rilla had without any warning brought her a warbaby once upon a time was she now with equal suddenness going to produce a husband  yes a weddingcakea scrumptious weddingcake susana beautiful plummy eggy citronpeely weddingcake and we must make other things too ill help you in the morning but i cant help you in the afternoon for i have to make a weddingdress and time is the essence of the contract susan  susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks  who are you going to marry rilla she asked feebly  susan darling i am not the happy bride miranda pryor is going to marry joe milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town a warwedding susanisnt that thrilling and romantic i never was so excited in my life  the excitement soon spread over ingleside infecting even mrs blythe and susan  ill go to work on that cake at once vowed susan with a glance at the clock mrs dr dear will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs if you will i can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things i will work all night if necessary to get the better of whiskersonthemoon  miranda arrived tearful and breathless  we must fix over my white dress for you to wear said rilla it will fit you very nicely with a little alteration  to work went the two girls ripping fitting basting sewing for dear life by dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven oclock and miranda tried it on in rillas room  its very prettybut oh if i could just have a veil sighed miranda ive always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil  some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of warbrides the door opened and mrs blythe came in her arms full of a filmy burden  miranda dear she said i want you to wear my weddingveil tomorrow it is twentyfour years since i was a bride at old green gablesthe happiest bride that ever wasand the weddingveil of a happy bride brings good luck they say  oh how sweet of you mrs blythe said miranda the ready tears starting to her eyes  the veil was tried on and draped susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger  ive got that cake in the oven she said and i am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting the evening news is that the grand duke has captured erzerum that is a pill for the turks i wish i had a chance to tell the czar just what a mistake he made when he turned nicholas down  susan disappeared downstairs to the kitchen whence a dreadful thud and a piercing shriek presently sounded everybody rushed to the kitchenthe doctor and miss oliver mrs blythe rilla miranda in her weddingveil susan was sitting flatly in the middle of the kitchen floor with a dazed bewildered look on her face while doc evidently in his hyde incarnation was standing on the dresser with his back up his eyes blazing and his tail the size of three tails  susan what has happened cried mrs blythe in alarm did you fall are you hurt  susan picked herself up  no she said grimly i am not hurt though i am jarred all over do not be alarmed as for what has happenedi tried to kick that darned cat with both feet that is what happened  everybody shrieked with laughter the doctor was quite helpless  oh susan susan he gasped that i should live to hear you swear  i am sorry said susan in real distress that i used such an expression before two young girls but i said that beast was darned and darned it is it belongs to old nick  do you expect it will vanish some of these days with a bang and the odour of brimstone susan  it will go to its own place in due time and that you may tie to said susan dourly shaking out her raddled bones and going to her oven i suppose my plunking down like that has shaken my cake so that it will be as heavy as lead  but the cake was not heavy it was all a brides cake should be and susan iced it beautifully next day she and rilla worked all the forenoon making delicacies for the weddingfeast and as soon as miranda phoned up that her father was safely off everything was packed in a big hamper and taken down to the pryor house joe soon arrived in his uniform and a state of violent excitement accompanied by his best man sergeant malcolm crawford there were quite a few guests for all the manse and ingleside folk were there and a dozen or so of joes relatives including his mother mrs dead angus milgrave so called cheerfully to distinguish her from another lady whose angus was living mrs dead angus wore a rather disapproving expression not caring overmuch for this alliance with the house of whiskersonthemoon  so miranda pryor was married to private joseph milgrave on his last leave it should have been a romantic wedding but it was not there were too many factors working against romance as even rilla had to admit in the first place miranda in spite of her dress and veil was such a flatfaced commonplace uninteresting little bride in the second place joe cried bitterly all through the ceremony and this vexed miranda unreasonably long afterwards she told rilla i just felt like saying to him then and there if you feel so bad over having to marry me you dont have to but it was just because he was thinking all the time of how soon he would have to leave me  in the third place jims who was usually so wellbehaved in public took a fit of shyness and contrariness combined and began to cry at the top of his voice for willa nobody wanted to take him out because everybody wanted to see the marriage so rilla who was a bridesmaid had to take him and hold him during the ceremony  in the fourth place sir wilfrid laurier took a fit  sir wilfrid was entrenched in a corner of the room behind mirandas piano during his seizure he made the weirdest most unearthly noises he would begin with a series of choking spasmodic sounds continuing into a gruesome gurgle and ending up with a strangled howl nobody could hear a word mr meredith was saying except now and then when sir wilfrid stopped for breath nobody looked at the bride except susan who never dragged her fascinated eyes from mirandas faceall the others were gazing at the dog miranda had been trembling with nervousness but as soon as sir wilfrid began his performance she forgot it all that she could think of was that her dear dog was dying and she could not go to him she never remembered a word of the ceremony  rilla who in spite of jims had been trying her best to look rapt and romantic as beseemed a war bridesmaid gave up the hopeless attempt and devoted her energies to choking down untimely merriment she dared not look at anybody in the room especially mrs dead angus for fear all her suppressed mirth should suddenly explode in a most unyoungladylike yell of laughter  but married they were and then they had a weddingsupper in the diningroom which was so lavish and bountiful that you would have thought it was the product of a months labour everybody had brought something mrs dead angus had brought a large applepie which she placed on a chair in the diningroom and then absently sat down on it neither her temper nor her black silk wedding garment was improved thereby but the pie was never missed at the gay bridal feast mrs dead angus eventually took it home with her again whiskersonthemoons pacifist pig should not get it anyhow  that evening mr and mrs joe accompanied by the recovered sir wilfrid departed for the four winds lighthouse which was kept by joes uncle and in which they meant to spend their brief honeymoon una meredith and rilla and susan washed the dishes tidied up left a cold supper and mirandas pitiful little note on the table for mr pryor and walked home while the mystic veil of dreamy haunted winter twilight wrapped itself over the glen  i would really not have minded being a warbride myself remarked susan sentimentally  but rilla felt rather flatperhaps as a reaction to all the excitement and rush of the past thirtysix hours she was disappointed somehowthe whole affair had been so ludicrous and miranda and joe so lachrymose and commonplace  if miranda hadnt given that wretched dog such an enormous dinner he wouldnt have had that fit she said crossly i warned herbut she said she couldnt starve the poor doghe would soon be all she had left etc i could have shaken her  the best man was more excited than joe was said susan he wished miranda many happy returns of the day she did not look very happy but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances  anyhow thought rilla i can write a perfectly killing account of it all to the boys how jem will howl over sir wilfrids part in it  but if rilla was rather disappointed in the war wedding she found nothing lacking on friday morning when miranda said goodbye to her bridegroom at the glen station the dawn was white as a pearl clear as a diamond behind the station the balsamy copse of young firs was frostmisted the cold moon of dawn hung over the westering snow fields but the golden fleeces of sunrise shone above the maples up at ingleside joe took his pale little bride in his arms and she lifted her face to his rilla choked suddenly it did not matter that miranda was insignificant and commonplace and flatfeatured it did not matter that she was the daughter of whiskersonthemoon all that mattered was that rapt sacrificial look in her eyesthat everburning sacred fire of devotion and loyalty and fine courage that she was mutely promising joe she and thousands of other women would keep alive at home while their men held the western front rilla walked away realising that she must not spy on such a moment she went down to the end of the platform where sir wilfrid and dog monday were sitting looking at each other  sir wilfrid remarked condescendingly why do you haunt this old shed when you might lie on the hearthrug at ingleside and live on the fat of the land is it a pose or a fixed idea  whereat dog monday laconically i have a tryst to keep  when the train had gone rilla rejoined the little trembling miranda well hes gone said miranda and he may never come backbut im his wife and im going to be worthy of him im going home  dont you think you had better come with me now asked rilla doubtfully nobody knew yet how mr pryor had taken the matter  no if joe can face the huns i guess i can face father said miranda daringly a soldiers wife cant be a coward come on wilfy ill go straight home and meet the worst  there was nothing very dreadful to face however perhaps mr pryor had reflected that housekeepers were hard to get and that there were many milgrave homes open to mirandaalso that there was such a thing as a separation allowance at all events though he told her grumpily that she had made a nice fool of herself and would live to regret it he said nothing worse and mrs joe put on her apron and went to work as usual while sir wilfrid laurier who had a poor opinion of lighthouses for winter residences went to sleep in his pet nook behind the woodbox a thankful dog that he was done with warweddings    chapter xix  they shall not pass  one cold grey morning in february gertrude oliver wakened with a shiver slipped into rillas room and crept in beside her  rillaim frightenedfrightened as a babyive had another of my strange dreams something terrible is before usi know  what was it asked rilla  i was standing again on the veranda stepsjust as i stood in that dream on the night before the lighthouse dance and in the sky a huge black menacing thunder cloud rolled up from the east i could see its shadow racing before it and when it enveloped me i shivered with icy cold then the storm brokeand it was a dreadful stormblinding flash after flash and deafening peal after peal driving torrents of rain i turned in panic and tried to run for shelter and as i did so a mana soldier in the uniform of a french army officerdashed up the steps and stood beside me on the threshold of the door his clothes were soaked with blood from a wound in his breast he seemed spent and exhausted but his white face was set and his eyes blazed in his hollow face they shall not pass he said in low passionate tones which i heard distinctly amid all the turmoil of the storm then i awakened rilla im frightenedthe spring will not bring the big push weve all been hoping forinstead it is going to bring some dreadful blow to france i am sure of it the germans will try to smash through somewhere  but he told you that they would not pass said rilla seriously she never laughed at gertrudes dreams as the doctor did  i do not know if that was prophecy or desperation rilla the horror of that dream holds me yet in an icy grip we shall need all our courage before long  dr blythe did laugh at the breakfast tablebut he never laughed at miss olivers dreams again for that day brought news of the opening of the verdun offensive and thereafter through all the beautiful weeks of spring the ingleside family one and all lived in a trance of dread there were days when they waited in despair for the end as foot by foot the germans crept nearer and nearer to the grim barrier of desperate france  susans deeds were in her spotless kitchen at ingleside but her thoughts were on the hills around verdun mrs dr dear she would stick her head in at mrs blythes door the last thing at night to remark i do hope the french have hung onto the crows wood today and she woke at dawn to wonder if dead mans hillsurely named by some prophetwas still held by the poyloos susan could have drawn a map of the country around verdun that would have satisfied a chief of staff  if the germans capture verdun the spirit of france will be broken miss oliver said bitterly  but they will not capture it staunchly said susan who could not eat her dinner that day for fear lest they do that very thing in the first place you dreamed they would notyou dreamed the very thing the french are saying before they ever said itthey shall not pass i declare to you miss oliver dear when i read that in the paper and remembered your dream i went cold all over with awe it seemed to me like biblical times when people dreamed things like that quite frequently  i knowi know said gertrude walking restlessly about i cling to a persistent faith in my dream toobut every time bad news comes it fails me then i tell myself mere coincidencesubconscious memory and so forth  i do not see how any memory could remember a thing before it was ever said at all persisted susan though of course i am not educated like you and the doctor i would rather not be if it makes anything as simple as that so hard to believe but in any case we need not worry over verdun even if the huns get it joffre says it has no military significance  that old sop of comfort has been served up too often already when reverses came retorted gertrude it has lost its power to charm  was there ever a battle like this in the world before said mr meredith one evening in midapril  its such a titanic thing we cant grasp it said the doctor what were the scraps of a few homeric handfuls compared to this the whole trojan war might be fought around a verdun fort and a newspaper correspondent would give it no more than a sentence i am not in the confidence of the occult powersthe doctor threw gertrude a twinklebut i have a hunch that the fate of the whole war hangs on the issue of verdun as susan and joffre say it has no real military significance but it has the tremendous significance of an idea if germany wins there she will win the war if she loses the tide will set against her  lose she will said mr meredith emphatically the idea cannot be conquered france is certainly very wonderful it seems to me that in her i see the white form of civilization making a determined stand against the black powers of barbarism i think our whole world realizes this and that is why we all await the issue so breathlessly it isnt merely the question of a few forts changing hands or a few miles of bloodsoaked ground lost and won  i wonder said gertrude dreamily if some great blessing great enough for the price will be the meed of all our pain is the agony in which the world is shuddering the birthpang of some wondrous new era or is it merely a futile    struggle of ants   in the gleam of a million million of suns  we think very lightly mr meredith of a calamity which destroys an anthill and half its inhabitants does the power that runs the universe think us of more importance than we think ants  you forget said mr meredith with a flash of his dark eyes that an infinite power must be infinitely little as well as infinitely great we are neither therefore there are things too little as well as too great for us to apprehend to the infinitely little an ant is of as much importance as a mastodon we are witnessing the birthpangs of a new erabut it will be born a feeble wailing life like everything else i am not one of those who expect a new heaven and a new earth as the immediate result of this war that is not the way god works but work he does miss oliver and in the end his purpose will be fulfilled  sound and orthodoxsound and orthodox muttered susan approvingly in the kitchen susan liked to see miss oliver sat upon by the minister now and then susan was very fond of her but she thought miss oliver liked saying heretical things to ministers far too well and deserved an occasional reminder that these matters were quite beyond her province  in may walter wrote home that he had been awarded a dc medal he did not say what for but the other boys took care that the glen should know the brave thing walter had done in any war but this wrote jerry meredith it would have meant a vc but they cant make vcs as common as the brave things done every day here  he should have had the vc said susan and was very indignant over it she was not quite sure who was to blame for his not getting it but if it were general haig she began for the first time to entertain serious doubts as to his fitness for being commanderinchief  rilla was beside herself with delight it was her dear walter who had done this thingwalter to whom someone had sent a white feather at redmondit was walter who had dashed back from the safety of the trench to drag in a wounded comrade who had fallen on nomansland oh she could see his white beautiful face and wonderful eyes as he did it what a thing to be the sister of such a hero and he hadnt thought it worth while writing about his letter was full of other thingslittle intimate things that they two had known and loved together in the dear old cloudless days of a century ago  ive been thinking of the daffodils in the garden at ingleside he wrote by the time you get this they will be out blowing there under that lovely rosy sky are they really as bright and golden as ever rilla it seems to me that they must be dyed red with bloodlike our poppies here and every whisper of spring will be falling as a violet in rainbow valley  there is a young moon tonighta slender silver lovely thing hanging over these pits of torment will you see it tonight over the maple grove  im enclosing a little scrap of verse rilla i wrote it one evening in my trench dugout by the light of a bit of candleor rather it came to me therei didnt feel as if i were writing itsomething seemed to use me as an instrument ive had that feeling once or twice before but very rarely and never so strongly as this time that was why i sent it over to the london spectator it printed it and the copy came today i hope youll like it its the only poem ive written since i came overseas  the poem was a short poignant little thing in a month it had carried walters name to every corner of the globe everywhere it was copiedin metropolitan dailies and little village weekliesin profound reviews and agony columns in red cross appeals and government recruiting propaganda mothers and sisters wept over it young lads thrilled to it the whole great heart of humanity caught it up as an epitome of all the pain and hope and pity and purpose of the mighty conflict crystallized in three brief immortal verses a canadian lad in the flanders trenches had written the one great poem of the war the piper by pte walter blythe was a classic from its first printing  rilla copied it in her diary at the beginning of an entry in which she poured out the story of the hard week that had just passed  it has been such a dreadful week she wrote and even though it is over and we know that it was all a mistake that does not seem to do away with the bruises left by it and yet it has in some ways been a very wonderful week and i have had some glimpses of things i never realized beforeof how fine and brave people can be even in the midst of horrible suffering i am sure i could never be as splendid as miss oliver was  just a week ago today she had a letter from mr grants mother in charlottetown and it told her that a cable had just come saying that major robert grant had been killed in action a few days before  oh poor gertrude at first she was crushed then after just a day she pulled herself together and went back to her school she did not cryi never saw her shed a tearbut oh her face and her eyes  i must go on with my work she said that is my duty just now  i could never have risen to such a height  she never spoke bitterly except once when susan said something about spring being here at last and gertrude said  can the spring really come this year  then she laughedsuch a dreadful little laugh just as one might laugh in the face of death i think and said  observe my egotism because i gertrude oliver have lost a friend it is incredible that the spring can come as usual the spring does not fail because of the million agonies of othersbut for mineoh can the universe go on  dont feel bitter with yourself dear mother said gently it is a very natural thing to feel as if things couldnt go on just the same when some great blow has changed the world for us we all feel like that  then that horrid old cousin sophia of susans piped up she was sitting there knitting and croaking like an old raven of bode and woe as walter used to call her  you aint as bad off as some miss oliver she said and you shouldnt take it so hard theres some as has lost their husbands thats a hard blow and theres some as has lost their sons you havent lost either husband or son  no said gertrude more bitterly still its true i havent lost a husbandi have only lost the man who would have been my husband i have lost no sononly the sons and daughters who might have been born to mewho will never be born to me now  it isnt ladylike to talk like that said cousin sophia in a shocked tone and then gertrude laughed right out so wildly that cousin sophia was really frightened and when poor tortured gertrude unable to endure it any longer hurried out of the room cousin sophia asked mother if the blow hadnt affected miss olivers mind  i suffered the loss of two good kind partners she said but it did not affect me like that  i should think it wouldnt those poor men must have been thankful to die  i heard gertrude walking up and down her room most of the night she walked like that every night but never so long as that night and once i heard her give a dreadful sudden little cry as if she had been stabbed i couldnt sleep for suffering with her and i couldnt help her i thought the night would never end but it did and then joy came in the morning as the bible says only it didnt come exactly in the morning but well along in the afternoon the telephone rang and i answered it it was old mrs grant speaking from charlottetown and her news was that it was all a mistakerobert wasnt killed at all he had only been slightly wounded in the arm and was safe in the hospital out of harms way for a time anyhow they hadnt learned yet how the mistake had happened but supposed there must have been another robert grant  i hung up the telephone and flew to rainbow valley im sure i did flyi cant remember my feet ever touching the ground i met gertrude on her way home from school in the glade of spruces where we used to play and i just gasped out the news to her i ought to have had more sense of course but i was so crazy with joy and excitement that i never stopped to think gertrude just dropped there among the golden young ferns as if she had been shot the fright it gave me ought to make me sensiblein this respect at leastfor the rest of my life i thought i had killed heri remembered that her mother had died very suddenly from heart failure when quite a young woman it seemed years to me before i discovered that her heart was still beating a pretty time i had i never saw anybody faint before and i knew there was nobody up at the house to help because everybody else had gone to the station to meet di and nan coming home from redmond but i knewtheoreticallyhow people in a faint should be treated and now i know it practically luckily the brook was handy and after i had worked frantically over her for a while gertrude came back to life she never said one word about my news and i didnt dare to refer to it again i helped her walk up through the maple grove and up to her room and then she said robisliving as if the words were torn out of her and flung herself on her bed and cried and cried and cried i never saw anyone cry so before all the tears that she hadnt shed all that week came then she cried most of last night i think but her face this morning looked as if she had seen a vision of some kind and we were all so happy that we were almost afraid  di and nan are home for a couple of weeks then they go back to red cross work in the training camp at kingsport i envy them father says im doing just as good work here with jims and my junior reds but it lacks the romance theirs must have  kut has fallen it was almost a relief when it did fall we had been dreading it so long it crushed us flat for a day and then we picked up and put it behind us cousin sophia was as gloomy as usual and came over and groaned that the british were losing everywhere  theyre good losers said susan grimly when they lose a thing they keep on looking till they find it again anyhow my king and country need me now to cut potato sets for the back garden so get you a knife and help me sophia crawford it will divert your thoughts and keep you from worrying over a campaign that you are not called upon to run  susan is an old brick and the way she flattens out poor cousin sophia is beautiful to behold  as for verdun the battle goes on and on and we seesaw between hope and fear but i know that strange dream of miss olivers foretold the victory of france they shall not pass    chapter xx  norman douglas speaks out in meeting  where are you wandering anne o mine asked the doctor who even yet after twentyfour years of marriage occasionally addressed his wife thus when nobody was about anne was sitting on the veranda steps gazing absently over the wonderful bridal world of spring blossom beyond the white orchard was a copse of dark young firs and creamy wild cherries where the robins were whistling madly for it was evening and the fire of early stars was burning over the maple grove  anne came back with a little sigh  i was just taking relief from intolerable realities in a dream gilberta dream that all our children were home againand all small againplaying in rainbow valley it is always so silent nowbut i was imagining i heard clear voices and gay childish sounds coming up as i used to i could hear jems whistle and walters yodel and the twins laughter and for just a few blessed minutes i forgot about the guns on the western front and had a little false sweet happiness  the doctor did not answer sometimes his work tricked him into forgetting for a few moments the western front but not often there was a good deal of grey now in his still thick curls that had not been there two years ago yet he smiled down into the starry eyes he lovedthe eyes that had once been so full of laughter and now seemed always full of unshed tears  susan wandered by with a hoe in her hand and her second best bonnet on her head  i have just finished reading a piece in the enterprise which told of a couple being married in an aeroplane do you think it would be legal doctor dear she inquired anxiously  i think so said the doctor gravely  well said susan dubiously it seems to me that a wedding is too solemn for anything so giddy as an aeroplane but nothing is the same as it used to be well it is half an hour yet before prayermeeting time so i am going around to the kitchen garden to have a little evening hate with the weeds but all the time i am strafing them i will be thinking about this new worry in the trentino i do not like this austrian caper mrs dr dear  nor i said mrs blythe ruefully all the forenoon i preserved rhubarb with my hands and waited for the war news with my soul when it came i shrivelled well i suppose i must go and get ready for the prayermeeting too  every village has its own little unwritten history handed down from lip to lip through the generations of tragic comic and dramatic events they are told at weddings and festivals and rehearsed around winter firesides and in these oral annals of glen st mary the tale of the union prayermeeting held that night in the methodist church was destined to fill an imperishable place  the union prayermeeting was mr arnolds idea the county battalion which had been training all winter in charlottetown was to leave shortly for overseas the four winds harbour boys belonging to it from the glen and overharbour and harbour head and upper glen were all home on their last leave and mr arnold thought properly enough that it would be a fitting thing to hold a union prayermeeting for them before they went away mr meredith having agreed the meeting was announced to be held in the methodist church glen prayermeetings were not apt to be too well attended but on this particular evening the methodist church was crowded everybody who could go was there even miss cornelia cameand it was the first time in her life that miss cornelia had ever set foot inside a methodist church it took no less than a world conflict to bring that about  i used to hate methodists said miss cornelia calmly when her husband expressed surprise over her going but i dont hate them now there is no sense in hating methodists when there is a kaiser or a hindenburg in the world  so miss cornelia went norman douglas and his wife went too and whiskersonthemoon strutted up the aisle to a front pew as if he fully realized what a distinction he conferred upon the building people were somewhat surprised that he should be there since he usually avoided all assemblages connected in any way with the war but mr meredith had said that he hoped his session would be well represented and mr pryor had evidently taken the request to heart he wore his best black suit and white tie his thick tight irongrey curls were neatly arranged and his broad red round face looked as susan most uncharitably thought more sanctimonious than ever  the minute i saw that man coming into the church looking like that i felt that mischief was brewing mrs dr dear she said afterwards what form it would take i could not tell but i knew from face of him that he had come there for no good  the prayermeeting opened conventionally and continued quietly mr meredith spoke first with his usual eloquence and feeling mr arnold followed with an address which even miss cornelia had to confess was irreproachable in taste and subjectmatter  and then mr arnold asked mr pryor to lead in prayer  miss cornelia had always averred that mr arnold had no gumption miss cornelia was not apt to err on the side of charity in her judgment of methodist ministers but in this case she did not greatly overshoot the mark the rev mr arnold certainly did not have much of that desirable indefinable quality known as gumption or he would never have asked whiskersonthemoon to lead in prayer at a khaki prayermeeting he thought he was returning the compliment to mr meredith who at the conclusion of his address had asked a methodist deacon to lead  some people expected mr pryor to refuse grumpilyand that would have made enough scandal but mr pryor bounded briskly to his feet unctuously said let us pray and forthwith prayed in a sonorous voice which penetrated to every corner of the crowded building mr pryor poured forth a flood of fluent words and was well on in his prayer before his dazed and horrified audience awakened to the fact that they were listening to a pacifist appeal of the rankest sort mr pryor had at least the courage of his convictions or perhaps as people afterwards said he thought he was safe in a church and that it was an excellent chance to air certain opinions he dared not voice elsewhere for fear of being mobbed he prayed that the unholy war might ceasethat the deluded armies being driven to slaughter on the western front might have their eyes opened to their iniquity and repent while yet there was timethat the poor young men present in khaki who had been hounded into a path of murder and militarism should yet be rescued  mr pryor had got this far without let or hindrance and so paralysed were his hearers and so deeply imbued with their bornandbred conviction that no disturbance must ever be made in a church no matter what the provocation that it seemed likely that he would continue unchecked to the end but one man at least in that audience was not hampered by inherited or acquired reverence for the sacred edifice norman douglas was as susan had often vowed crisply nothing more or less than a pagan but he was a rampantly patriotic pagan and when the significance of what mr pryor was saying fully dawned on him norman douglas suddenly went berserk with a positive roar he bounded to his feet in his side pew facing the audience and shouted in tones of thunder  stopstopstop that abominable prayer what an abominable prayer  every head in the church flew up a boy in khaki at the back gave a faint cheer mr meredith raised a deprecating hand but norman was past caring for anything like that eluding his wifes restraining grasp he gave one mad spring over the front of the pew and caught the unfortunate whiskersonthemoon by his coat collar mr pryor had not stopped when so bidden but he stopped now perforce for norman his long red beard literally bristling with fury was shaking him until his bones fairly rattled and punctuating his shakes with a lurid assortment of abusive epithets  you blatant beastshakeyou malignant carrionshakeyou pigheaded varmintshakeyou putrid pupshakeyou pestilential parasiteshakeyouhunnish scumshakeyou indecent reptileyouyou norman choked for a moment everybody believed that the next thing he would say church or no church would be something that would have to be spelt with asterisks but at that moment norman encountered his wifes eye and he fell back with a thud on holy writ you whited sepulchre he bellowed with a final shake and cast whiskersonthemoon from him with a vigour which impelled that unhappy pacifist to the very verge of the choir entrance door mr pryors once ruddy face was ashen but he turned at bay ill have the law on you for this he gasped  dodo roared norman making another rush but mr pryor was gone he had no desire to fall a second time into the hands of an avenging militarist norman turned to the platform for one graceless triumphant moment  dont look so flabbergasted parsons he boomed you couldnt do itnobody would expect it of the clothbut somebody had to do it you know youre glad i threw him outhe couldnt be let go on yammering and yodelling and yawping sedition and treason sedition and treasonsomebody had to deal with it i was born for this hourive had my innings in church at last i can sit quiet for another sixty years now go ahead with your meeting parsons i reckon you wont be troubled with any more pacifist prayers  but the spirit of devotion and reverence had fled both ministers realized it and realized that the only thing to do was to close the meeting quietly and let the excited people go mr meredith addressed a few earnest words to the boys in khakiwhich probably saved mr pryors windows from a second onslaughtand mr arnold pronounced an incongruous benediction at least he felt it was incongruous for he could not at once banish from his memory the sight of gigantic norman douglas shaking the fat pompous little whiskersonthemoon as a huge mastiff might shake an overgrown puppy and he knew that the same picture was in everybodys mind altogether the union prayermeeting could hardly be called an unqualified success but it was remembered in glen st mary when scores of orthodox and undisturbed assemblies were totally forgotten  you will never no never mrs dr dear hear me call norman douglas a pagan again said susan when she reached home if ellen douglas is not a proud woman this night she should be  norman douglas did a wholly indefensible thing said the doctor pryor should have been let severely alone until the meeting was over then later on his own minister and session should deal with him that would have been the proper procedure normans performance was utterly improper and scandalous and outrageous but by georgethe doctor threw back his head and chuckled by george annegirl it was satisfying    chapter xxi  love affairs are horrible  ingleside   20th june 1916  we have been so busy and day after day has brought such exciting news good and bad that i havent had time and composure to write in my diary for weeks i like to keep it up regularly for father says a diary of the years of the war should be a very interesting thing to hand down to ones children the trouble is i like to write a few personal things in this blessed old book that might not be exactly what id want my children to read i feel that i shall be a far greater stickler for propriety in regard to them than i am for myself  the first week in june was another dreadful one the austrians seemed just on the point of overrunning italy and then came the first awful news of the battle of jutland which the germans claimed as a great victory susan was the only one who carried on you need never tell me that the kaiser has defeated the british navy she said with a contemptuous sniff it is all a german lie and that you may tie to and when a couple of days later we found out that she was right and that it had been a british victory instead of a british defeat we had to put up with a great many i told you sos but we endured them very comfortably  it took kitcheners death to finish susan for the first time i saw her down and out we all felt the shock of it but susan plumbed the depths of despair the news came at night by phone but susan wouldnt believe it until she saw the enterprise headline the next day she did not cry or faint or go into hysterics but she forgot to put salt in the soup and that is something susan never did in my recollection mother and miss oliver and i cried but susan looked at us in stony sarcasm and said the kaiser and his six sons are all alive and thriving so the world is not left wholly desolate why cry mrs dr dear susan continued in this stony hopeless condition for twentyfour hours and then cousin sophia appeared and began to condole with her  this is terrible news aint it susan we might as well prepare for the worst for it is bound to come you said onceand well do i remember the words susan bakerthat you had complete confidence in god and kitchener ah well susan baker there is only god left now  whereat cousin sophia put her handkerchief to her eyes pathetically as if the world were indeed in terrible straits as for susan cousin sophia was the salvation of her she came to life with a jerk  sophia crawford hold your peace she said sternly you may be an idiot but you need not be an irreverent idiot it is no more than decent to be weeping and wailing because the almighty is the sole stay of the allies now as for kitchener his death is a great loss and i do not dispute it but the outcome of this war does not depend on one mans life and now that the russians are coming on again you will soon see a change for the better  susan said this so energetically that she convinced herself and cheered up immediately but cousin sophia shook her head  alberts wife wants to call the baby after brusiloff she said but i told her to wait and see what becomes of him first them russians has such a habit of petering out  the russians are doing splendidly however and they have saved italy but even when the daily news of their sweeping advance comes we dont feel like running up the flag as we used to do as gertrude says verdun has slain all exultation we would all feel more like rejoicing if the victories were on the western front when will the british strike gertrude sighed this morning we have waited so longso long  our greatest local event in recent weeks was the route march the county battalion made through the county before it left for overseas they marched from charlottetown to lowbridge then round the harbour head and through the upper glen and so down to the st mary station everybody turned out to see them except old aunt fannie clow who is bedridden and mr pryor who hadnt been seen out even in church since the night of the union prayer meeting the previous week  it was wonderful and heartbreaking to see that battalion marching past there were young men and middleaged men in it there was laurie mcallister from overharbour who is only sixteen but swore he was eighteen so that he could enlist and there was angus mackenzie from the upper glen who is fiftyfive if he is a day and swore he was fortyfour there were two south african veterans from lowbridge and the three eighteenyearold baxter triplets from harbour head everybody cheered as they went by and they cheered foster booth who is forty walking side by side with his son charley who is twenty charleys mother died when he was born and when charley enlisted foster said hed never yet let charley go anywhere he darent go himself and he didnt mean to begin with the flanders trenches at the station dog monday nearly went out of his head he tore about and sent messages to jem by them all mr meredith read an address and reta crawford recited the piper the soldiers cheered her like mad and cried well followwell followwe wont break faith and i felt so proud to think that it was my dear brother who had written such a wonderful heartstirring thing and then i looked at the khaki ranks and wondered if those tall fellows in uniform could be the boys ive laughed with and played with and danced with and teased all my life something seems to have touched them and set them apart they have heard the pipers call  fred arnold was in the battalion and i felt dreadfully about him for i realized that it was because of me that he was going away with such a sorrowful expression i couldnt help it but i felt as badly as if i could  the last evening of his leave fred came up to ingleside and told me he loved me and asked me if i would promise to marry him some day if he ever came back he was desperately in earnest and i felt more wretched than i ever did in my life i couldnt promise him thatwhy even if there was no question of ken i dont care for fred that way and never couldbut it seemed so cruel and heartless to send him away to the front without any hope of comfort i cried like a baby and yetoh i am afraid that there must be something incurably frivolous about me because right in the middle of it all with me crying and fred looking so wild and tragic the thought popped into my head that it would be an unendurable thing to see that nose across from me at the breakfast table every morning of my life there that is one of the entries i wouldnt want my descendants to read in this journal but it is the humiliating truth and perhaps its just as well that thought did come or i might have been tricked by pity and remorse into giving him some rash assurance if freds nose were as handsome as his eyes and mouth some such thing might have happened and then what an unthinkable predicament i should have been in  when poor fred became convinced that i couldnt promise him he behaved beautifullythough that rather made things worse if he had been nasty about it i wouldnt have felt so heartbroken and remorsefulthough why i should feel remorseful i dont know for i never encouraged fred to think i cared a bit about him yet feel remorseful i didand do if fred arnold never comes back from overseas this will haunt me all my life  then fred said if he couldnt take my love with him to the trenches at least he wanted to feel that he had my friendship and would i kiss him just once in goodbye before he wentperhaps for ever  i dont know how i could ever had imagined that love affairs were delightful interesting things they are horrible i couldnt even give poor heartbroken fred one little kiss because of my promise to ken it seemed so brutal i had to tell fred that of course he would have my friendship but that i couldnt kiss him because i had promised somebody else i wouldnt  he said it isis itken ford  i nodded it seemed dreadful to have to tell itit was such a sacred little secret just between me and ken  when fred went away i came up here to my room and cried so long and so bitterly that mother came up and insisted on knowing what was the matter i told her she listened to my tale with an expression that clearly said can it be possible that anyone has been wanting to marry this baby but she was so nice and understanding and sympathetic oh just so raceofjosephythat i felt indescribably comforted mothers are the dearest things  but oh mother i sobbed he wanted me to kiss him goodbyeand i couldntand that hurt me worse than all the rest  well why didnt you kiss him asked mother coolly considering the circumstances i think you might have  but i couldnt motheri promised ken when he went away that i wouldnt kiss anybody else until he came back  this was another high explosive for poor mother she exclaimed with the queerest little catch in her voice rilla are you engaged to kenneth ford  idontknow i sobbed  youdontknow repeated mother  then i had to tell her the whole story too and every time i tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that ken meant anything serious i felt idiotic and ashamed by the time i got through  mother sat a little while in silence then she came over sat down beside me and took me in her arms  dont cry dear little rillamyrilla you have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to fred and if leslie wests son asked you to keep your lips for him i think you may consider yourself engaged to him butoh my babymy last little babyi have lost youthe war has made a woman of you too soon  i shall never be too much of a woman to find comfort in mothers hugs nevertheless when i saw fred marching by two days later in the parade my heart ached unbearably  but im glad mother thinks im really engaged to ken    chapter xxii  little dog monday knows  it is two years tonight since the dance at the light when jack elliott brought us news of the war do you remember miss oliver  cousin sophia answered for miss oliver oh indeed rilla i remember that evening only too well and you aprancing down here to show off your party clothes didnt i warn you that we could not tell what was before us little did you think that night what was before you  little did any of us think that said susan sharply not being gifted with the power of prophecy it does not require any great foresight sophia crawford to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over i could do as much myself  we all thought the war would be over in a few months then said rilla wistfully when i look back it seems so ridiculous that we ever could have supposed it  and now two years later it is no nearer the end than it was then said miss oliver gloomily  susan clicked her knittingneedles briskly  now miss oliver dear you know that is not a reasonable remark you know we are just two years nearer the end whenever the end is appointed to be  albert read in a montreal paper today that a war expert gives it as his opinion that it will last five years more was cousin sophias cheerful contribution  it cant cried rilla then she added with a sigh two years ago we would have said it cant last two years but five more years of this  if rumania comes in as i have strong hopes now of her doing you will see the end in five months instead of five years said susan  ive no faith in furriners sighed cousin sophia  the french are foreigners retorted susan and look at verdun and think of all the somme victories this blessed summer the big push is on and the russians are still going well why general haig says that the german officers he has captured admit that they have lost the war  you cant believe a word the germans say protested cousin sophia there is no sense in believing a thing just because youd like to believe it susan baker the british have lost millions of men at the somme and how far have they got look facts in the face susan baker look facts in the face  they are wearing the germans out and so long as that happens it does not matter whether it is done a few miles east or a few miles west i am not admitted susan in tremendous humility i am not a military expert sophia crawford but even i can see that and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything the huns have not got all the cleverness in the world have you not heard the story of alistair maccallums son roderick from the upper glen he is a prisoner in germany and his mother got a letter from him last week he wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on till you would have supposed everything was lovely but when he signed his name right in between roderick and maccallum he wrote two gaelic words that meant all lies and the german censor did not understand gaelic and thought it was all part of roddys name so he let it pass never dreaming how he was diddled well i am going to leave the war to haig for the rest of the day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake and when it is made i shall put it on the top shelf the last one i made i left it on the lower shelf and little kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it we had company for tea that night and when i went to get my cake what a sight did i behold  has that pore orphans father never been heerd from yet asked cousin sophia  yes i had a letter from him in july said rilla he said that when he got word of his wifes death and of my taking the babymr meredith wrote him you knowhe wrote right away but as he never got any answer he had begun to think his letter must have been lost  it took him two years to begin to think it said susan scornfully some people think very slow jim anderson has not got a scratch for all he has been two years in the trenches a fool for luck as the old proverb says  he wrote very nicely about jims and said hed like to see him said rilla so i wrote and told him all about the wee man and sent him snapshots jims will be two years old next week and he is a perfect duck  you didnt used to be very fond of babies said cousin sophia  im not a bit fonder of babies in the abstract than ever i was said rilla frankly but i do love jims and im afraid i wasnt really half as glad as i should have been when jim andersons letter proved that he was safe and sound  you wasnt hoping the man would be killed cried cousin sophia in horrified accents  nonono i just hoped he would go on forgetting about jims mrs crawford  and then your pa would have the expense of raising him said cousin sophia reprovingly you young creeturs are terrible thoughtless  jims himself ran in at this juncture so rosy and curly and kissable that he extorted a qualified compliment even from cousin sophia  hes a reel healthylooking child now though mebbee his colour is a mite too highsorter consumptive looking as you might say i never thought youd raise him when i saw him the day after you brung him home i reely did not think it was in you and i told alberts wife so when i got home alberts wife says says she theres more in rilla blythe than youd think for aunt sophia them was her very words more in rilla blythe than youd think for alberts wife always had a good opinion of you  cousin sophia sighed as if to imply that alberts wife stood alone in this against the world but cousin sophia really did not mean that she was quite fond of rilla in her own melancholy way but young creeturs had to be kept down if they were not kept down society would be demoralized  do you remember your walk home from the light two years ago tonight whispered gertrude oliver to rilla teasingly  i should think i do smiled rilla and then her smile grew dreamy and absent she was remembering something elsethat hour with kenneth on the sandshore where would ken be tonight and jem and jerry and walter and all the other boys who had danced and moonlighted on the old four winds point that evening of mirth and laughtertheir last joyous unclouded evening in the filthy trenches of the somme front with the roar of the guns and the groans of stricken men for the music of ned burrs violin and the flash of star shells for the silver sparkles on the old blue gulf two of them were sleeping under the flanders poppiesalec burr from the upper glen and clark manley of lowbridge others were wounded in the hospitals but so far nothing had touched the manse and the ingleside boys they seemed to bear charmed lives yet the suspense never grew any easier to bear as the weeks and months of war went by  it isnt as if it were some sort of fever to which you might conclude they were immune when they hadnt taken it for two years sighed rilla the danger is just as great and just as real as it was the first day they went into the trenches i know this and it tortures me every day and yet i cant help hoping that since theyve come this far unhurt theyll come through oh miss oliver what would it be like not to wake up in the morning feeling afraid of the news the day would bring i cant picture such a state of things somehow and two years ago this morning i woke wondering what delightful gift the new day would give me these are the two years i thought would be filled with fun  would you exchange themnowfor two years filled with fun  no said rilla slowly i wouldnt its strangeisnt itthey have been two terrible yearsand yet i have a queer feeling of thankfulness for themas if they had brought me something very precious with all their pain i wouldnt want to go back and be the girl i was two years ago not even if i could not that i think ive made any wonderful progressbut im not quite the selfish frivolous little doll i was then i suppose i had a soul then miss oliverbut i didnt know it i know it nowand that is worth a great dealworth all the suffering of the past two years and stillrilla gave a little apologetic laugh i dont want to suffer any morenot even for the sake of more soul growth at the end of two more years i might look back and be thankful for the development they had brought me too but i dont want it now  we never do said miss oliver that is why we are not left to choose our own means and measure of development i suppose no matter how much we value what our lessons have brought us we dont want to go on with the bitter schooling well let us hope for the best as susan says things are really going well now and if rumania lines up the end may come with a suddenness that will surprise us all  rumania did come inand susan remarked approvingly that its king and queen were the finest looking royal couple she had seen pictures of so the summer passed away early in september word came that the canadians had been shifted to the somme front and anxiety grew tenser and deeper for the first time mrs blythes spirit failed her a little and as the days of suspense wore on the doctor began to look gravely at her and veto this or that special effort in red cross work  oh let me worklet me work gilbert she entreated feverishly while im working i dont think so much if im idle i imagine everythingrest is only torture for me my two boys are on the frightful somme frontand shirley pores day and night over aviation literature and says nothing but i see the purpose growing in his eyes no i cannot restdont ask it of me gilbert  but the doctor was inexorable  i cant let you kill yourself annegirl he said when the boys come back i want a mother here to welcome them why youre getting transparent it wont doask susan there if it will do  oh if susan and you are both banded together against me said anne helplessly  one day the glorious news came that the canadians had taken courcelette and martenpuich with many prisoners and guns susan ran up the flag and said it was plain to be seen that haig knew what soldiers to pick for a hard job the others dared not feel exultant who knew what price had been paid  rilla woke that morning when the dawn was beginning to break and went to her window to look out her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time the air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and rainbow valley were full of mystery and wonder over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silverypink shallows there was no wind and rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down in the direction of the station was it dog monday and if it were why was he howling like that rilla shivered the sound had something boding and grievous in it she remembered that miss oliver said once when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl when a dog cries like that the angel of death is passing rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart it was dog mondayshe felt sure of it whose dirge was he howlingto whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell  rilla went back to bed but she could not sleep all day she watched and waited in a dread of which she did not speak to anyone she went down to see dog monday and the stationmaster said that dog of yours howled from midnight to sunrise something weird i dunno what got into him i got up once and went out and hollered at him but he paid no tention to me he was sitting all alone in the moonlight out there at the end of the platform and every few minutes the poor lonely little beggard lift his nose and howl as if his heart was breaking he never did it aforealways slept in his kennel real quiet and canny from train to train but he sure had something on his mind last night  dog monday was lying in his kennel he wagged his tail and licked rillas hand but he would not touch the food she brought for him  im afraid hes sick she said anxiously she hated to go away and leave him but no bad news came that daynor the nextnor the next rillas fear lifted dog monday howled no more and resumed his routine of train meeting and watching when five days had passed the ingleside people began to feel that they might be cheerful again rilla dashed about the kitchen helping susan with the breakfast and singing so sweetly and clearly that cousin sophia across the road heard her and croaked out to mrs albert  sing before eating cry before sleeping ive always heard  but rilla blythe shed no tears before the nightfall when her father his face grey and drawn and old came to her that afternoon and told her that walter had been killed in action at courcelette she crumpled up in a pitiful little heap of merciful unconsciousness in his arms nor did she waken to her pain for many hours    chapter xxiii  and so goodnight  the fierce flame of agony had burned itself out and the grey dust of its ashes was over all the world rillas younger life recovered physically sooner than her mother for weeks mrs blythe lay ill from grief and shock rilla found it was possible to go on with existence since existence had still to be reckoned with there was work to be done for susan could not do all for her mothers sake she had to put on calmness and endurance as a garment in the day but night after night she lay in her bed weeping the bitter rebellious tears of youth until at last tears were all wept out and the little patient ache that was to be in her heart until she died took their place  she clung to miss oliver who knew what to say and what not to say so few people did kind wellmeaning callers and comforters gave rilla some terrible moments  youll get over it in time mrs william reese said cheerfully mrs reese had three stalwart sons not one of whom had gone to the front  its such a blessing it was walter who was taken and not jem said miss sarah clow walter was a member of the church and jem wasnt ive told mr meredith many a time that he should have spoken seriously to jem about it before he went away  pore pore walter sighed mrs reese  do not you come here calling him poor walter said susan indignantly appearing in the kitchen door much to the relief of rilla who felt that she could endure no more just then he was not poor he was richer than any of you it is you who stay at home and will not let your sons go who are poorpoor and naked and mean and smallpisen poor and so are your sons with all their prosperous farms and fat cattle and their souls no bigger than a fleasif as big  i came here to comfort the afflicted and not to be insulted said mrs reese taking her departure unregretted by anyone then the fire went out of susan and she retreated to her kitchen laid her faithful old head on the table and wept bitterly for a time then she went to work and ironed jimss little rompers rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself came in to do it  i am not going to have you kill yourself working for any warbaby susan said obstinately  oh i wish i could just keep on working all the time susan cried poor rilla and i wish i didnt have to go to sleep it is hideous to go to sleep and forget it for a little while and wake up and have it all rush over me anew the next morning do people ever get used to things like this susan and oh susan i cant get away from what mrs reese said did walter suffer muchhe was always so sensitive to pain oh susan if i knew that he didnt i think i could gather up a little courage and strength  this merciful knowledge was given to rilla a letter came from walters commanding officer telling them that he had been killed instantly by a bullet during a charge at courcelette the same day there was a letter for rilla from walter himself  rilla carried it unopened to rainbow valley and read it there in the spot where she had had her last talk with him it is a strange thing to read a letter after the writer is deada bittersweet thing in which pain and comfort are strangely mingled for the first time since the blow had fallen rilla felta different thing from tremulous hope and faiththat walter of the glorious gift and the splendid ideals still lived with just the same gift and just the same ideals that could not be destroyedthese could suffer no eclipse the personality that had expressed itself in that last letter written on the eve of courcelette could not be snuffed out by a german bullet it must carry on though the earthly link with things of earth were broken  were going over the top tomorrow rillamyrilla wrote walter i wrote mother and di yesterday but somehow i feel as if i must write you tonight i hadnt intended to do any writing tonightbut ive got to do you remember old mrs tom crawford overharbour who was always saying that it was laid on her to do such and such a thing well that is just how i feel its laid on me to write you tonightyou sister and chum of mine there are some things i want to say beforewell before tomorrow  you and ingleside seem strangely near me tonight its the first time ive felt this since i came always home has seemed so far awayso hopelessly far away from this hideous welter of filth and blood but tonight it is quite close to meit seems to me i can almost see youhear you speak and i can see the moonlight shining white and still on the old hills of home it has seemed to me ever since i came here that it was impossible that there could be calm gentle nights and unshattered moonlight anywhere in the world but tonight somehow all the beautiful things i have always loved seem to have become possible againand this is good and makes me feel a deep certain exquisite happiness it must be autumn at home nowthe harbour is adream and the old glen hills blue with haze and rainbow valley a haunt of delight with wild asters blowing all over itour old farewellsummers i always liked that name better than asterit was a poem in itself  rilla you know ive always had premonitions you remember the pied piperbut no of course you wouldntyou were too young one evening long ago when nan and di and jem and the merediths and i were together in rainbow valley i had a queer vision or presentimentwhatever you like to call it rilla i saw the piper coming down the valley with a shadowy host behind him the others thought i was only pretendingbut i saw him for just one moment and rilla last night i saw him again i was doing sentrygo and i saw him marching across nomansland from our trenches to the german trenchesthe same tall shadowy form piping weirdlyand behind him followed boys in khaki rilla i tell you i saw himit was no fancyno illusion i heard his music and thenhe was gone but i had seen himand i knew what it meanti knew that i was among those who followed him  rilla the piper will pipe me west tomorrow i feel sure of this and rilla im not afraid when you hear the news remember that ive won my own freedom herefreedom from all fear i shall never be afraid of anything againnot of deathnor of life if after all i am to go on living and life i think would be the harder of the two to facefor it could never be beautiful for me again there would always be such horrible things to rememberthings that would make life ugly and painful always for me i could never forget them but whether its life or death im not afraid rillamyrilla and i am not sorry that i came im satisfied ill never write the poems i once dreamed of writingbut ive helped to make canada safe for the poets of the futurefor the workers of the futureay and the dreamers toofor if no man dreams there will be nothing for the workers to fulfilthe future not of canada only but of the worldwhen the red rain of langemarck and verdun shall have brought forth a golden harvestnot in a year or two as some foolishly think but a generation later when the seed sown now shall have had time to germinate and grow yes im glad i came rilla it isnt only the fate of the little seaborn island i love that is in the balancenor of canada nor of england its the fate of mankind that is what were fighting for and we shall winnever for a moment doubt that rilla for it isnt only the living who are fightingthe dead are fighting too such an army cannot be defeated  is there laughter in your face yet rilla i hope so the world will need laughter and courage more than ever in the years that will come next i dont want to preachthis isnt any time for it but i just want to say something that may help you over the worst when you hear that ive gone west ive a premonition about you rilla as well as about myself i think ken will go back to youand that there are long years of happiness for you byandby and you will tell your children of the idea we fought and died forteach them it must be lived for as well as died for else the price paid for it will have been given for nought this will be part of your work rilla and if youall you girls back in the homelanddo it then we who dont come back will know that you have not broken faith with us  i meant to write to una tonight too but i wont have time now read this letter to her and tell her its really meant for you bothyou two dear fine loyal girls tomorrow when we go over the topill think of you bothof your laughter rillamyrilla and the steadfastness in unas blue eyessomehow i see those eyes very plainly tonight too yes youll both keep faithim sure of thatyou and una and sogoodnight we go over the top at dawn  rilla read her letter over many times there was a new light on her pale young face when she finally stood up amid the asters walter had loved with the sunshine of autumn around her for the moment at least she was lifted above pain and loneliness  i will keep faith walter she said steadily i will workand teachand learnand laugh yes i will even laughthrough all my years because of you and because of what you gave when you followed the call  rilla meant to keep walters letter as a a sacred treasure but seeing the look on una merediths face when una had read it and held it back to her she thought of something could she do it oh no she could not give up walters letterhis last letter surely it was not selfishness to keep it a copy would be such a soulless thing but unauna had so littleand her eyes were the eyes of a woman stricken to the heart who yet must not cry out or ask for sympathy  una would you like to have this letterto keep she asked slowly  yesif you can give it to me una said dully  thenyou may have it said rilla hurriedly  thank you said una it was all she said but there was something in her voice which repaid rilla for her bit of sacrifice  una took the letter and when rilla had gone she pressed it against her lonely lips una knew that love would never come into her life nowit was buried for ever under the bloodstained soil somewhere in france no one but herselfand perhaps rillaknew itwould ever know it she had no right in the eyes of her world to grieve she must hide and bear her long pain as best she couldalone but she too would keep faith    chapter xxiv  mary is just in time  the autumn of 1916 was a bitter season for ingleside mrs blythes return to health was slow and sorrow and loneliness were in all hearts every one tried to hide it from the others and carry on cheerfully rilla laughed a good deal nobody at ingleside was deceived by her laughter it came from her lips only never from her heart but outsiders said some people got over trouble very easily and irene howard remarked that she was surprised to find how shallow rilla blythe really was why after all her pose of being so devoted to walter she doesnt seem to mind his death at all nobody has ever seen her shed a tear or heard her mention his name she has evidently quite forgotten him poor fellowyoud really think his family would feel it more i spoke of him to rilla at the last junior red meetingof how fine and brave and splendid he wasand i said life could never be just the same to me again now that walter had gonewe were such friends you knowwhy i was the very first person he told about having enlistedand rilla answered as coolly and indifferently as if she were speaking of an entire stranger he was just one of many fine and splendid boys who have given everything for their country well i wish i could take things as calmlybut im not made like that im so sensitivethings hurt me terriblyi really never get over them i asked rilla right out why she didnt put on mourning for walter she said her mother didnt wish it but every one is talking about it  rilla doesnt wear coloursnothing but white protested betty mead  white becomes her better than anything else said irene significantly and we all know black doesnt suit her complexion at all but of course im not saying that is the reason she doesnt wear it only its funny if my brother had died id have gone into deep mourning i wouldnt have had the heart for anything else i confess im disappointed in rilla blythe  i am not then cried betty meade loyally i think rilla is just a wonderful girl a few years ago i admit i did think she was rather too vain and gigglesome but now she is nothing of the sort i dont think there is a girl in the glen who is so unselfish and plucky as rilla or who has done her bit as thoroughly and patiently our junior red cross would have gone on the rocks a dozen times if it hadnt been for her tact and perseverance and enthusiasmyou know that perfectly well irene  why i am not running rilla down said irene opening her eyes widely it was only her lack of feeling i was criticizing i suppose she cant help it of course shes a born managereveryone knows that shes very fond of managing tooand people like that are very necessary i admit so dont look at me as if id said something perfectly dreadful betty please im quite willing to agree that rilla blythe is the embodiment of all the virtues if that will please you and no doubt it is a virtue to be quite unmoved by things that would crush most people  some of irenes remarks were reported to rilla but they did not hurt her as they would once have done they didnt matter that was all life was too big to leave room for pettiness she had a pact to keep and a work to do and through the long hard days and weeks of that disastrous autumn she was faithful to her task the war news was consistently bad for germany marched from victory to victory over poor rumania foreignersforeigners susan muttered dubiously russians or rumanians or whatever they may be they are foreigners and you cannot tie to them but after verdun i shall not give up hope and can you tell me mrs dr dear if the dobruja is a river or a mountain range or a condition of the atmosphere  the presidential election in the united states came off in november and susan was redhot over thatand quite apologetic for her excitement  i never thought i would live to see the day when i would be interested in a yankee election mrs dr dear it only goes to show we can never know what we will come to in this world and therefore we should not be proud  susan stayed up late on the evening of the eleventh ostensibly to finish a pair of socks but she phoned down to carter flaggs store at intervals and when the first report came through that hughes had been elected she stalked solemnly upstairs to mrs blythes room and announced it in a thrilling whisper from the foot of the bed  i thought if you were not asleep you would be interested in knowing it i believe it is for the best perhaps he will just fall to writing notes too mrs dr dear but i hope for better things i never was very partial to whiskers but one cannot have everything  when news came in the morning that after all wilson was reelected susan tacked to catch another breeze of optimism  well better a fool you know than a fool you do not know as the old proverb has it she remarked cheerfully not that i hold woodrow to be a fool by any means though by times you would not think he has the sense he was born with but he is a good letter writer at least and we do not know if the hughes man is even that all things being considered i commend the yankees they have shown good sense and i do not mind admitting it cousin sophia wanted them to elect roosevelt and is much disgruntled because they would not give him a chance i had a hankering for him myself but we must believe that providence overrules these matters and be satisfiedthough what the almighty means in this affair of rumania i cannot fathomsaying it with all reverence  susan fathomed itor thought she didwhen the asquith ministry went down and lloyd george became premier  mrs dr dear lloyd george is at the helm at last i have been praying for this for many a day now we shall soon see a blessed change it took the rumanian disaster to bring it about no less and that is the meaning of it though i could not see it before there will be no more shillyshallying i consider that the war is as good as won and that i shall tie to whether bucharest falls or not  bucharest did falland germany proposed peace negotiations whereat susan scornfully turned a deaf ear and absolutely refused to listen to such proposals when president wilson sent his famous december peace note susan waxed violently sarcastic  woodrow wilson is going to make peace i understand first henry ford had a try at it and now comes wilson but peace is not made with ink woodrow and that you may tie to said susan apostrophizing the unlucky president out of the kitchen window nearest the united states lloyd georges speech will tell the kaiser what is what and you may keep your peace screeds at home and save postage  what a pity president wilson cant hear you susan said rilla slyly  indeed rilla dear it is a pity that he has no one near him to give him good advice as it is clear he has not in all those democrats and republicans retorted susan i do not know the difference between them for the politics of the yankees is a puzzle i cannot solve study it as i may but as far as seeing through a grindstone goes i am afraid susan shook her head dubiously that they are all tarred with the same brush  i am thankful christmas is over rilla wrote in her diary during the last week of a stormy december we had dreaded it sothe first christmas since courcelette but we had all the merediths down for dinner and nobody tried to be gay or cheerful we were all just quiet and friendly and that helped then too i was so thankful that jims had got betterso thankful that i almost felt gladalmost but not quite i wonder if i shall ever feel really glad over anything again it seems as if gladness were killed in meshot down by the same bullet that pierced walters heart perhaps some day a new kind of gladness will be born in my soulbut the old kind will never live again  winter set in awfully early this year ten days before christmas we had a big snowstormat least we thought it big at the time as it happened it was only a prelude to the real performance it was fine the next day and ingleside and rainbow valley were wonderful with the trees all covered with snow and big drifts everywhere carved into the most fantastic shapes by the chisel of the northeast wind father and mother went up to avonlea father thought the change would do mother good and they wanted to see poor aunt diana whose son jock had been seriously wounded a short time before they left susan and me to keep house and father expected to be back the next day but he never got back for a week that night it began to storm again and it stormed unbrokenly for four days it was the worst and longest storm that prince edward island has known for years everything was disorganizedthe roads were completely choked up the trains blockaded and the telephone wires put entirely out of commission  and then jims took ill  he had a little cold when father and mother went away and he kept getting worse for a couple of days but it didnt occur to me that there was danger of anything serious i never even took his temperature and i cant forgive myself because it was sheer carelessness the truth is i had slumped just then mother was away so i let myself go all at once i was tired of keeping up and pretending to be brave and cheerful and i just gave up for a few days and spent most of the time lying on my face on my bed crying i neglected jimsthat is the hateful truthi was cowardly and false to what i promised walterand if jims had died i could never have forgiven myself  then the third night after father and mother went away jims suddenly got worseoh so much worseall at once susan and i were all alone gertrude had been at lowbridge when the storm began and had never got back at first we were not much alarmed jims has had several bouts of croup and susan and morgan and i have always brought him through without much trouble but it wasnt very long before we were dreadfully alarmed  i never saw croup like this before said susan  as for me i knew when it was too late what kind of croup it was i knew it was not the ordinary croupfalse croup as doctors call itbut the true croupand i knew that it was a deadly and dangerous thing and father was away and there was no doctor nearer than lowbridgeand we could not phone and neither horse nor man could get through the drifts that night  gallant little jims put up a good fight for his lifesusan and i tried every remedy we could think of or find in fathers books but he continued to grow worse it was heartrending to see and hear him he gasped so horribly for breaththe poor little souland his face turned a dreadful bluish colour and had such an agonized expression and he kept struggling with his little hands as if he were appealing to us to help him somehow i found myself thinking that the boys who had been gassed at the front must have looked like that and the thought haunted me amid all my dread and misery over jims and all the time the fatal membrane in his wee throat grew and thickened and he couldnt get it up  oh i was just wild i never realized how dear jims was to me until that moment and i felt so utterly helpless  and then susan gave up we cannot save him oh if your father was herelook at him the poor little fellow i know not what to do  i looked at jims and i thought he was dying susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath but it didnt seem as if he could breathe at all my little warbaby with his dear ways and sweet roguish face was choking to death before my very eyes and i couldnt help him i threw down the hot poultice i had ready in despair of what use was it jims was dying and it was my faulti hadnt been careful enough  just thenat eleven oclock at nightthe door bell rang such a ringit pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm susan couldnt goshe dared not lay jims downso i rushed downstairs in the hall i paused just a minutei was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread i thought of a weird story gertrude had told me once an aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband she heard a knock at the door and when she went and opened it there was nothing therenothing that could be seen at least but when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs although it was a calm warm summer night outside immediately she heard a cry she ran upstairsand her husband was dead and she always believed so gertrude said that when she opened that door she let death in  it was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened but i was distracted and worn out and i simply felt for a moment that i dared not open the doorthat death was waiting outside then i remembered that i had no time to wastemust not be so foolishi sprang forward and opened the door  certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow but there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and bloodmary vance coated from head to foot with snowand she brought life not death with her though i didnt know that then i just stared at her  i havent been turned out grinned mary as she stepped in and shut the door i came up to carter flaggs two days ago and ive been stormedstayed there ever since but old abbie flagg got on my nerves at last and tonight i just made up my mind to come up here i thought i could wade this far but i can tell you it was as much as a bargain once i thought i was stuck for keeps aint it an awful night  i came to myself and knew i must hurry upstairs i explained as quickly as i could to mary and left her trying to brush the snow off upstairs i found that jims was over that paroxysm but almost as soon as i got back to the room he was in the grip of another i couldnt do anything but moan and cryoh how ashamed i am when i think of it and yet what could i dowe had tried everything we knewand then all at once i heard mary vance saying loudly behind me why that child is dying  i whirled around didnt i know he was dyingmy little jims i could have thrown mary vance out of the door or the windowanywhereat that moment there she stood cool and composed looking down at my baby with those weird white eyes of hers as she might look at a choking kitten i had always disliked mary vanceand just then i hated her  we have tried everything said poor susan dully it is not ordinary croup  no its the dipthery croup said mary briskly snatching up an apron and theres mighty little time to losebut i know what to do when i lived overharbour with mrs wiley years ago will crawfords kid died of dipthery croup in spite of two doctors and when old aunt christina macallister heard of itshe was the one brought me round when i nearly died of pneumonia you knowshe was a wonderno doctor was a patch on herthey dont hatch her breed of cats nowadays let me tell youshe said she could have saved him with her grandmothers remedy if shed been there she told mrs wiley what it was and ive never forgot it ive the greatest memory evera thing just lies in the back of my head till the time comes to use it got any sulphur in the house susan  yes we had sulphur susan went down with mary to get it and i held jims i hadnt any hopenot the least mary vance might brag as she likedshe was always braggingbut i didnt believe any grandmothers remedy could save jims now presently mary came back she had tied a piece of thick flannel over her mouth and nose and she carried susans old tin chip pan half full of burning coals  you watch me she said boastfully ive never done this but its kill or cure that child is dying anyway  she sprinkled a spoonful of sulphur over the coals and then she picked up jims turned him over and held him face downward right over those choking blinding fumes i dont know why i didnt spring forward and snatch him away susan says it was because it was foreordained that i shouldnt and i think she is right because it did really seem that i was powerless to move susan herself seemed transfixed watching mary from the doorway jims writhed in those big firm capable hands of maryoh yes she is capable all rightand choked and wheezedand choked and wheezedand i felt that he was being tortured to deathand then all at once after what seemed to me an hour though it really wasnt long he coughed up the membrane that was killing him mary turned him over and laid him back on his bed he was white as marble and the tears were pouring out of his brown eyesbut that awful livid look was gone from his face and he could breathe quite easily  wasnt that some trick said mary gaily i hadnt any idea how it would work but i just took a chance ill smoke his throat out again once or twice before morning just to kill all the germs but youll see hell be all right now  jims went right to sleepreal sleep not coma as i feared at first mary smoked him as she called it twice through the night and at daylight his throat was perfectly clear and his temperature was almost normal when i made sure of that i turned and looked at mary vance she was sitting on the lounge laying down the law to susan on some subject about which susan must have known forty times as much as she did but i didnt mind how much law she laid down or how much she bragged she had a right to bragshe had dared to do what i would never have dared and had saved jims from a horrible death it didnt matter any more that she had once chased me through the glen with a codfish it didnt matter that she had smeared goosegrease all over my dream of romance the night of the lighthouse dance it didnt matter that she thought she knew more than anybody else and always rubbed it ini would never dislike mary vance again i went over to her and kissed her  whats up now she said  nothingonly im so grateful to you mary  well i think you ought to be thats a fact you two would have let that baby die on your hands if i hadnt happened along said mary just beaming with complacency she got susan and me a tiptop breakfast and made us eat it and bossed the life out of us as susan says for two days until the roads were opened so that she could get home jims was almost well by that time and father turned up he heard our tale without saying much father is rather scornful generally about what he calls old wives remedies he laughed a little and said after this mary vance will expect me to call her in for consultation in all my serious cases  so christmas was not so hard as i expected it to be and now the new year is comingand we are still hoping for the big push that will end the warand little dog monday is getting stiff and rheumatic from his cold vigils but still he carries on and shirley continues to read the exploits of the aces oh nineteenseventeen what will you bring    chapter xxv  shirley goes  no woodrow there will be no peace without victory said susan sticking her knitting needle viciously through president wilsons name in the newspaper column we canadians mean to have peace and victory too you if it pleases you woodrow can have the peace without the victoryand susan stalked off to bed with the comfortable consciousness of having got the better of the argument with the president but a few days later she rushed to mrs blythe in redhot excitement  mrs dr dear what do you think a phone message has just come through from charlottetown that woodrow wilson has sent that german ambassador man to the right about at last they tell me that means war so i begin to think that woodrows heart is in the right place after all wherever his head may be and i am going to commandeer a little sugar and celebrate the occasion with some fudge despite the howls of the food board i thought that submarine business would bring things to a crisis i told cousin sophia so when she said it was the beginning of the end for the allies  dont let the doctor hear of the fudge susan said anne with a smile you know he has laid down very strict rules for us along the lines of economy the government has asked for  yes mrs dr dear and a man should be master in his own household and his women folk should bow to his decrees i flatter myself that i am becoming quite efficient in economizingsusan had taken to using certain german terms with killing effectbut one can exercise a little gumption on the quiet now and then shirley was wishing for some of my fudge the other daythe susan brand as he called itand i said the first victory there is to celebrate i shall make you some i consider this news quite equal to a victory and what the doctor does not know will never grieve him i take the whole responsibility mrs dr dear so do not you vex your conscience  susan spoiled shirley shamelessly that winter he came home from queens every weekend and susan had all his favourite dishes for him in so far as she could evade or wheedle the doctor and waited on him hand and foot though she talked war constantly to everyone else she never mentioned it to him or before him but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse and when the german retreat from the bapaume salient began and continued susans exultation was linked up with something deeper than anything she expressed surely the end was in sightwould come now beforeanyone elsecould go  things are coming our way at last we have got the germans on the run she boasted the united states has declared war at last as i always believed they would in spite of woodrows gift for letter writing and you will see they will go into it with a vim since i understand that is their habit when they do start and we have got the germans on the run too  the states mean well moaned cousin sophia but all the vim in the world cannot put them on the fighting line this spring and the allies will be finished before that the germans are just luring them on that man simonds says their retreat has put the allies in a hole  that man simonds has said more than he will ever live to make good retorted susan i do not worry myself about his opinion as long as lloyd george is premier of england he will not be bamboozled and that you may tie to things look good to me the u s is in the war and we have got kut and bagdad backand i would not be surprised to see the allies in berlin by juneand the russians too since they have got rid of the czar that in my opinion was a good piece of work  time will show if it is said cousin sophia who would have been very indignant if anyone had told her that she would rather see susan put to shame as a seer than a successful overthrow of tyranny or even the march of the allies down unter den linden but then the woes of the russian people were quite unknown to cousin sophia while this aggravating optimistic susan was an everpresent thorn in her side  just at that moment shirley was sitting on the edge of the table in the livingroom swinging his legsa brown ruddy wholesome lad from top to toe every inch of himand saying coolly mother and dad i was eighteen last monday dont you think its about time i joined up  the pale mother looked at him  two of my sons have gone and one will never return must i give you too shirley  the ageold cryjoseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away how the mothers of the great war echoed the old patriarchs moan of so many centuries agone  you wouldnt have me a slacker mother i can get into the flyingcorps what say dad  the doctors hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for abbie flaggs rheumatism he had known this moment was coming yet he was not altogether prepared for it he answered slowly i wont try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty but you must not go unless your mother says you may  shirley said nothing more he was not a lad of many words anne did not say anything more just then either she was thinking of little joyces grave in the old buryingground overharbourlittle joyce who would have been a woman now had she livedof the white cross in france and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her kneeof jem in the terrible trenchesof nan and di and rilla waitingwaitingwaiting while the golden years of youth passed byand she wondered if she could bear any more she thought not surely she had given enough  yet that night she told shirley that he might go  they did not tell susan right away she did not know it until a few days later shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform susan didnt make half the fuss she had made when jem and walter had gone she said stonily so theyre going to take you too  take me no im going susangot to  susan sat down by the table folded her knotted old hands that had grown warped and twisted working for the ingleside children to still their shaking and said  yes you must go i did not see once why such things must be but i can see now  youre a brick susan said shirley he was relieved that she took it so coollyhe had been a little afraid with a boys horror of a scene he went out whistling gaily but half an hour later when pale anne blythe came in susan was still sitting there  mrs dr dear said susan making an admission she would once have died rather than make i feel very old jem and walter were yours but shirley is mine and i cannot bear to think of him flyinghis machine crashing downthe life crushed out of his bodythe dear little body i nursed and cuddled when he was a wee baby  susandont cried anne  oh mrs dr dear i beg your pardon i ought not to have said anything like that out loud i sometimes forget that i resolved to be a heroine thisthis has shaken me a little but i will not forget myself again only if things do not go as smoothly in the kitchen for a few days i hope you will make due allowance for me at least said poor susan forcing a grim smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing at least flying is a clean job he will not get so dirty and messed up as he would in the trenches and that is well for he has always been a tidy child  so shirley wentnot radiantly as to a high adventure like jem not in a white flame of sacrifice like walter but in a cool businesslike mood as of one doing something rather dirty and disagreeable that had just got to be done he kissed susan for the first time since he was five years old and said goodbye susanmother susan  my little brown boymy little brown boy said susan i wonder she thought bitterly as she looked at the doctors sorrowful face if you remember how you spanked him once when he was a baby i am thankful i have nothing like that on my conscience now  the doctor did not remember the old discipline but before he put on his hat to go out on his round of calls he stood for a moment in the great silent livingroom that had once been full of childrens laughter  our last sonour last son he said aloud a good sturdy sensible lad too always reminded me of my father i suppose i ought to be proud that he wanted to goi was proud when jem wenteven when walter wentbut our house is left us desolate  i have been thinking doctor old sandy of the upper glen said to him that afternoon that your house will be seeming very big the day  highland sandys quaint phrase struck the doctor as perfectly expressive ingleside did seem very big and empty that night yet shirley had been away all winter except for weekends and had always been a quiet fellow even when home was it because he had been the only one left that his going seemed to leave such a huge blankthat every room seemed vacant and desertedthat the very trees on the lawn seemed to be trying to comfort each other with caresses of freshlybudding boughs for the loss of the last of the little lads who had romped under them in childhood  susan worked very hard all day and late into the night when she had wound the kitchen clock and put dr jekyll out none too gently she stood for a little while on the doorstep looking down the glen which lay tranced in faint silvery light from a sinking young moon but susan did not see the familiar hills and harbour she was looking at the aviation camp in kingsport where shirley was that night  he called me mother susan she was thinking well all our men folk have gone nowjem and walter and shirley and jerry and carl and none of them had to be driven to it so we have a right to be proud but pride susan sighed bitterlypride is cold company and that there is no gainsaying  the moon sank lower into a black cloud in the west the glen went out in an eclipse of sudden shadowand thousands of miles away the canadian boys in khakithe living and the deadwere in possession of vimy ridge  vimy ridge is a name written in crimson and gold on the canadian annals of the great war the british couldnt take it and the french couldnt take it said a german prisoner to his captors but you canadians are such fools that you dont know when a place cant be taken  so the fools took itand paid the price  jerry meredith was seriously wounded at vimy ridgeshot in the back the telegram said  poor nan said mrs blythe when the news came she thought of her own happy girlhood at old green gables there had been no tragedy like this in it how the girls of today had to suffer when nan came home from redmond two weeks later her face showed what those weeks had meant to her john meredith too seemed to have grown old suddenly in them faith did not come home she was on her way across the atlantic as a vad di had tried to wring from her father consent to her going also but had been told that for her mothers sake it could not be given so di after a flying visit home went back to her red cross work in kingsport  the mayflowers bloomed in the secret nooks of rainbow valley rilla was watching for them jem had once taken his mother the earliest mayflowers walter brought them to her when jem was gone last spring shirley had sought them out for her now rilla thought she must take the boys place in this but before she had discovered any bruce meredith came to ingleside one twilight with his hands full of delicate pink sprays he stalked up the steps of the veranda and laid them on mrs blythes lap  because shirley isnt here to bring them he said in his funny shy blunt way  and you thought of this you darling said anne her lips quivering as she looked at the stocky blackbrowed little chap standing before her with his hands thrust into his pockets  i wrote jem today and told him not to worry bout you not getting your mayflowers said bruce seriously cause id see to that and i told him i would be ten pretty soon now so it wont be very long before ill be eighteen and then ill go to help him fight and maybe let him come home for a rest while i took his place i wrote jerry too jerrys getting better you know  is he have you had any good news about him  yes mother had a letter today and it said he was out of danger  oh thank god murmured mrs blythe in a halfwhisper  bruce looked at her curiously  that is what father said when mother told him but when l said it the other day when i found out mr meads dog hadnt hurt my kitteni thought he had shooken it to death you knowfather looked awful solemn and said i must never say that again about a kitten but i couldnt understand why mrs blythe i felt awful thankful and it must have been god that saved stripey because that mead dog had normous jaws and oh how it shook poor stripey and so why couldnt i thank him course added bruce reminiscently maybe i said it too loudcause i was awful glad and excited when i found stripey was all right i most shouted it mrs blythe maybe if id said it sort of whispery like you and father it would have been all right do you know mrs blythebruce dropped to a whispery tone edging a little nearer to annewhat i would like to do to the kaiser if i could  what would you like to do laddie  norman reese said in school today that he would like to tie the kaiser to a tree and set cross dogs to worrying him said bruce gravely and emily flagg said she would like to put him in a cage and poke sharp things into him and they all said things like that but mrs blythebruce took a little square paw out of his pocket and put it earnestly on annes kneei would like to turn the kaiser into a good mana very good manall at once if i could that is what i would do dont you think mrs blythe that would be the very worstest punishment of all  bless the child said susan how do you make out that would be any kind of a punishment for that wicked fiend  dont you see said bruce looking levelly at susan out of his blackly blue eyes if he was turned into a good man he would understand how dreadful the things he has done are and he would feel so terrible about it that he would be more unhappy and miserable than he could ever be in any other way he would feel just awfuland he would go on feeling like that forever yesbruce clenched his hands and nodded his head emphatically yes i would make the kaiser a good manthat is what i would doit would serve him zackly right    chapter xxvi  susan has a proposal of marriage  an aeroplane was flying over glen st mary like a great bird poised against the western skya sky so clear and of such a pale silvery yellow that it gave an impression of a vast windfreshened space of freedom the little group on the ingleside lawn looked up at it with fascinated eyes although it was by no means an unusual thing to see an occasional hovering plane that summer susan was always intensely excited who knew but that it might be shirley away up there in the clouds flying over to the island from kingsport but shirley had gone overseas now so susan was not so keenly interested in this particular aeroplane and its pilot nevertheless she looked at it with awe  i wonder mrs dr dear she said solemnly what the old folks down there in the graveyard would think if they could rise out of their graves for one moment and behold that sight i am sure my father would disapprove of it for he was a man who did not believe in newfangled ideas of any sort he always cut his grain with a reaping hook to the day of his death a mower he would not have what was good enough for his father was good enough for him he used to say i hope it is not unfilial to say that i think he was wrong in that point of view but i am not sure i go so far as to approve of aeroplanes though they may be a military necessity if the almighty had meant us to fly he would have provided us with wings since he did not it is plain he meant us to stick to the solid earth at any rate you will never see me mrs dr dear cavorting through the sky in an aeroplane  but you wont refuse to cavort a bit in fathers new automobile when it comes will you susan teased rilla  i do not expect to trust my old bones in automobiles either retorted susan but i do not look upon them as some narrowminded people do whiskersonthemoon says the government should be turned out of office for permitting them to run on the island at all he foams at the mouth they tell me when he sees one the other day he saw one coming along that narrow sideroad by his wheatfield and whiskers bounded over the fence and stood right in the middle of the road with his pitchfork the man in the machine was an agent of some kind and whiskers hates agents as much as he hates automobiles he made the car come to a halt because there was not room to pass him on either side and the agent could not actually run over him then he raised his pitchfork and shouted get out of this with your devilmachine or i will run this pitchfork clean through you and mrs dr dear if you will believe me that poor agent had to back his car clean out to the lowbridge road nearly a mile whiskers following him every step shaking his pitchfork and bellowing insults now mrs dr dear i call such conduct unreasonable but all the same added susan with a sigh what with aeroplanes and automobiles and all the rest of it this island is not what it used to be  the aeroplane soared and dipped and circled and soared again until it became a mere speck far over the sunset hills  with the majesty of pinion which the theban eagles bear sailing with supreme dominion through the azure fields of air  quoted anne blythe dreamily  i wonder said miss oliver if humanity will be any happier because of aeroplanes it seems to me that the sum of human happiness remains much the same from age to age no matter how it may vary in distribution and that all the many inventions neither lessen nor increase it  after all the kingdom of heaven is within you said mr meredith gazing after the vanishing speck which symbolized mans latest victory in a worldold struggle it does not depend on material achievements and triumphs  nevertheless an aeroplane is a fascinating thing said the doctor it has always been one of humanitys favourite dreamsthe dream of flying dream after dream comes trueor rather is made true by persevering effort i should like to have a flight in an aeroplane myself  shirley wrote me that he was dreadfully disappointed in his first flight said rilla he had expected to experience the sensation of soaring up from the earth like a birdand instead he just had the feeling that he wasnt moving at all but that the earth was dropping away under him and the first time he went up alone he suddenly felt terribly homesick he had never felt like that before but all at once he said he felt as if he were adrift in spaceand he had a wild desire to get back home to the old planet and the companionship of fellow creatures he soon got over that feeling but he says his first flight alone was a nightmare to him because of that dreadful sensation of ghastly loneliness  the aeroplane disappeared the doctor threw back his head with a sigh  when i have watched one of those birdmen out of sight i come back to earth with an odd feeling of being merely a crawling insect anne he said turning to his wife do you remember the first time i took you for a buggy ride in avonleathat night we went to the carmody concert the first fall you taught in avonlea i had out little black mare with the white star on her forehead and a shining brandnew buggyand i was the proudest fellow in the world barring none i suppose our grandson will be taking his sweetheart out quite casually for an evening fly in his aeroplane  an aeroplane wont be as nice as little silverspot was said anne a machine is simply a machinebut silverspot why she was a personality gilbert a drive behind her had something in it that not even a flight among sunset clouds could have no i dont envy my grandsons sweetheart after all mr meredith is right the kingdom of heavenand of loveand of happinessdoesnt depend on externals  besides said the doctor gravely our said grandson will have to give most of his attention to the aeroplanehe wont be able to let the reins lie on its back while he gazes into his ladys eyes and i have an awful suspicion that you cant run an aeroplane with one arm nothe doctor shook his headi believe id still prefer silverspot after all  the russian line broke again that summer and susan said bitterly that she had expected it ever since kerensky had gone and got married  far be it from me to decry the holy state of matrimony mrs dr dear but i felt that when a man was running a revolution he had his hands full and should have postponed marriage until a more fitting season the russians are done for this time and there would be no sense in shutting our eyes to the fact but have you seen woodrow wilsons reply to the popes peace proposals it is magnificent i really could not have expressed the rights of the matter better myself i feel that i can forgive wilson everything for it he knows the meaning of words and that you may tie to speaking of meanings have you heard the latest story about whiskersonthemoon mrs dr dear it seems he was over at the lowbridge road school the other day and took a notion to examine the fourth class in spelling they have the summer term there yet you know with the spring and fall vacations being rather backward people on that road my niece ella baker goes to that school and she it was who told me the story the teacher was not feeling well having a dreadful headache and she went out to get a little fresh air while mr pryor was examining the class the children got along all right with the spelling but when whiskers began to question them about the meanings of the words they were all at sea because they had not learned them ella and the other big scholars felt terrible over it they love their teacher so and it seems mr pryors brother abel pryor who is trustee of that school is against her and has been trying to turn the other trustees over to his way of thinking and ella and the rest were afraid that if the fourth class couldnt tell whiskers the meanings of the words he would think the teacher was no good and tell abel so and abel would have a fine handle but little sandy logan saved the situation he is a home boy but he is as smart as a steel trap and he sized up whiskersonthemoon right off what does anatomy mean whiskers demanded a pain in your stomach sandy replied quick as a flash and never batting an eyelid whiskersonthemoon is a very ignorant man mrs dr dear he didnt know the meaning of the words himself and he said very goodvery good the class caught right onat least three or four of the brighter ones didand they kept up the fun jean blane said that acoustic meant a religious squabble and muriel baker said that an agnostic was a man who had indigestion and jim carter said that acerbity meant that you ate nothing but vegetable food and so on all down the list whiskers swallowed it all and kept saying very goodvery good until ella thought that die she would trying to keep a straight face when the teacher came in whiskers complimented her on the splendid understanding the children had of their lesson and said he meant to tell the trustees what a jewel they had it was very unusual he said to find a fourth class who could answer up so prompt when it came to explaining what words meant he went off beaming but ella told me this as a great secret mrs dr dear and we must keep it as such for the sake of the lowbridge road teacher it would likely be the ruin of her chances of keeping the school if whiskers should ever find out how he had been bamboozled  mary vance came up to ingleside that same afternoon to tell them that miller douglas who had been wounded when the canadians took hill 70 had had to have his leg amputated the ingleside folk sympathized with mary whose zeal and patriotism had taken some time to kindle but now burned with a glow as steady and bright as any ones  some folks have been twitting me about having a husband with only one leg but said mary rising to a lofty height i would rather miller with only one leg than any other man in the world with a dozenunless she added as an afterthought unless it was lloyd george well i must be going i thought youd be interested in hearing about miller so i ran up from the store but i must hustle home for i promised luke macallister id help him build his grain stack this evening its up to us girls to see that the harvest is got in since the boys are so scarce ive got overalls and i can tell you theyre real becoming mrs alec douglas says theyre indecent and shouldnt be allowed and even mrs elliott kinder looks askance at them but bless you the world moves and anyhow theres no fun for me like shocking kitty alec  by the way father said rilla im going to take jack flaggs place in his fathers store for a month i promised him today that i would if you didnt object then he can help the farmers get the harvest in i dont think id be much use in a harvest myselfthough lots of the girls arebut i can set jack free while i do his work jims isnt much bother in the daytime now and ill always be home at night  do you think youll like weighing out sugar and beans and trafficking in butter and eggs said the doctor twinkling  probably not that isnt the question its just one way of doing my bit so rilla went behind mr flaggs counter for a month and susan went into albert crawfords oatfields  i am as good as any of them yet she said proudly not a man of them can beat me when it comes to building a stack when i offered to help albert looked doubtful i am afraid the work will be too hard for you he said try me for a day and see said i i will do my darnedest  none of the ingleside folks spoke for just a moment their silence meant that they thought susans pluck in working out quite wonderful but susan mistook their meaning and her sunburned face grew red  this habit of swearing seems to be growing on me mrs dr dear she said apologetically to think that i should be acquiring it at my age it is such a dreadful example to the young girls i am of the opinion it comes of reading the newspapers so much they are so full of profanity and they do not spell it with stars either as used to be done in my young days this war is demoralizing everybody  susan standing on a load of grain her grey hair whipping in the breeze and her skirt kilted up to her knees for safety and convenienceno overalls for susan if you pleaseneither a beautiful nor a romantic figure but the spirit that animated her gaunt arms was the selfsame one that captured vimy ridge and held the german legions back from verdun  it is not the least likely however that this consideration was the one which appealed most strongly to mr pryor when he drove past one afternoon and saw susan pitching sheaves gamely  smart woman that he reflected worth two of many a younger one yet i might do worsei might do worse if milgrave comes home alive ill lose miranda and hired housekeepers cost more than a wife and are liable to leave a man in the lurch any time ill think it over  a week later mrs blythe coming up from the village late in the afternoon paused at the gate of ingleside in an amazement which temporarily bereft her of the power of motion an extraordinary sight met her eyes round the end of the kitchen burst mr pryor running as stout pompous mr pryor had not run in years with terror imprinted on every lineamenta terror quite justifiable for behind him like an avenging fate came susan with a huge smoking iron pot grasped in her hands and an expression in her eye that boded ill to the object of her indignation if she should overtake him pursuer and pursued tore across the lawn mr pryor reached the gate a few feet ahead of susan wrenched it open and fled down the road without a glance at the transfixed lady of ingleside  susan gasped anne  susan halted in her mad career set down her pot and shook her fist after mr pryor who had not ceased to run evidently believing that susan was still full cry after him  susan what does this mean demanded anne a little severely  you may well ask that mrs dr dear susan replied wrathfully i have not been so upset in years thatthatthat pacifist has actually had the audacity to come up here and in my own kitchen to ask me to marry him him  anne choked back a laugh  butsusan couldnt you have found awell a less spectacular method of refusing him think what a gossip this would have made if anyone had been going past and had seen such a performance  indeed mrs dr dear you are quite right i did not think of it because i was quite past thinking rationally i was just clean mad come in the house and i will tell you all about it  susan picked up her pot and marched into the kitchen still trembling with wrathful excitement she set her pot on the stove with a vicious thud wait a moment until i open all the windows to air this kitchen well mrs dr dear there that is better and i must wash my hands too because i shook hands with whiskersonthemoon when he came innot that i wanted to but when he stuck out his fat oily hand i did not know just what else to do at the moment i had just finished my afternoon cleaning and thanks be everything was shining and spotless and thought i now that dye is boiling and i will get my rug rags and have them nicely out of the way before supper  just then a shadow fell over the floor and looking up i saw whiskersonthemoon standing in the doorway dressed up and looking as if he had just been starched and ironed i shook hands with him as aforesaid mrs dr dear and told him you and the doctor were both away but he said  i have come to see you miss baker  i asked him to sit down for the sake of my own manners and then i stood there right in the middle of the floor and gazed at him as contemptuously as i could in spite of his brazen assurance this seemed to rattle him a little but he began trying to look sentimental at me out of his little piggy eyes and all at once an awful suspicion flashed into my mind something told me mrs dr dear that i was about to receive my first proposal i have always thought that i would like to have just one offer of marriage to reject so that i might be able to look other women in the face but you will not hear me bragging of this i consider it an insult and if i could have thought of any way of preventing it i would but just then mrs dr dear you will see i was at a disadvantage being taken so completely by surprise some men i am told consider a little preliminary courting the proper thing before a proposal if only to give fair warning of their intentions but whiskersonthemoon probably thought it was any port in a storm for me and that i would jump at him well he is undeceivedyes he is undeceived mrs dr dear i wonder if he has stopped running yet  i understand that you dont feel flattered susan but couldnt you have refused him a little more delicately than by chasing him off the premises in such a fashion  well maybe i might have mrs dr dear and i intended to but one remark he made aggravated me beyond my powers of endurance if it had not been for that i would not have chased him with my dyepot i will tell you the whole interview whiskers sat down as i have said and right beside him on another chair doc was lying the animal was pretending to be asleep but i knew very well he was not for he has been hyde all day and hyde never sleeps by the way mrs dr dear have you noticed that that cat is far oftener hyde than jekyll now the more victories germany wins the hyder he becomes i leave you to draw your own conclusions from that i suppose whiskers thought he might curry favour with me by praising the creature little dreaming what my real sentiments towards it were so he stuck out his pudgy hand and stroked mr hydes back what a nice cat he said the nice cat flew at him and bit him then it gave a fearful yowl and bounded out of the door whiskers looked after it quite amazed that is a queer kind of a varmint he said i agreed with him on that point but i was not going to let him see it besides what business had he to call our cat a varmint it may be a varmint or it may not i said but it knows the difference between a canadian and a hun you would have thought would you not mrs dr dear that a hint like that would have been enough for him but it went no deeper than his skin i saw him settling back quite comfortable as if for a good talk and thought i if there is anything coming it may as well come soon and be done with for with all these rags to dye before supper i have no time to waste in flirting so i spoke right out if you have anything particular to discuss with me mr pryor i would feel obliged if you would mention it without loss of time because i am very busy this afternoon he fairly beamed at me out of that circle of red whisker and said you are a businesslike woman and i agree with you there is no use in wasting time beating around the bush i came up here today to ask you to marry me so there it was mrs dr dear i had a proposal at last after waiting sixtyfour years for one  i just glared at that presumptuous creature and i said i would not marry you if you were the last man on earth josiah pryor so there you have my answer and you can take it away forthwith you never saw a man so taken aback as he was mrs dr dear he was so flabbergasted that he just blurted out the truth why i thought youd be only too glad to get a chance to be married he said that was when i lost my head mrs dr dear do you think i had a good excuse when a hun and a pacifist made such an insulting remark to me go i thundered and i just caught up that iron pot i could see that he thought i had suddenly gone insane and i suppose he considered an iron pot full of boiling dye was a dangerous weapon in the hands of a lunatic at any rate he went and stood not upon the order of his going as you saw for yourself and i do not think we will see him back here proposing to us again in a hurry no i think he has learned that there is at least one single woman in glen st mary who has no hankering to become mrs whiskersonthemoon    chapter xxvii  waiting  ingleside   1st november 1917  it is novemberand the glen is all grey and brown except where the lombardy poplars stand up here and there like great golden torches in the sombre landscape although every other tree has shed its leaves it has been very hard to keep our courage alight of late the caporetto disaster is a dreadful thing and not even susan can extract much consolation out of the present state of affairs the rest of us dont try gertrude keeps saying desperately they must not get venicethey must not get venice as if by saying it often enough she can prevent them but what is to prevent them from getting venice i cannot see yet as susan fails not to point out there was seemingly nothing to prevent them from getting to paris in 1914 yet they did not get it and she affirms they shall not get venice either oh how i hope and pray they will notvenice the beautiful queen of the adriatic although ive never seen it i feel about it just as byron didive always loved itit has always been to me a fairy city of the heart perhaps i caught my love of it from walter who worshipped it it was always one of his dreams to see venice i remember we planned oncedown in rainbow valley one evening just before the war broke outthat some time we would go together to see it and float in a gondola through its moonlit streets  every fall since the war began there has been some terrible blow to our troopsantwerp in 1914 serbia in 1915 last fall rumania and now italy the worst of all i think i would give up in despair if it were not for what walter said in his dear last letterthat the dead as well as the living were fighting on our side and such an army cannot be defeated no it cannot we will win in the end i will not doubt it for one moment to let myself doubt would be to break faith  we have all been campaigning furiously of late for the new victory loan we junior reds canvassed diligently and landed several tough old customers who had at first flatly refused to invest ieven itackled whiskersonthemoon i expected a bad time and a refusal but to my amazement he was quite agreeable and promised on the spot to take a thousand dollar bond he may be a pacifist but he knows a good investment when it is handed out to him five and a half per cent is finve and a half per cent even when a militaristic government pays it  father to tease susan says it was her speech at the victory loan campaign meeting that converted mr pryor i dont think that at all likely since mr pryor has been publicly very bitter against susan ever since her quite unmistakable rejection of his loverlike advances but susan did make a speechand the best one made at the meeting too it was the first time she ever did such a thing and she vows it will be the last everybody in the glen was at the meeting and quite a number of speeches were made but somehow things were a little flat and no especial enthusiasm could be worked up susan was quite dismayed at the lack of zeal because she had been burningly anxious that the island should go over the top in regard to its quota she kept whispering viciously to gertrude and me that there was no ginger in the speeches and when nobody went forward to subscribe to the loan at the close susan lost her head at least that is how she describes it herself she bounded to her feet her face grim and set under her bonnetsusan is the only woman in glen st mary who still wears a bonnetand said sarcastically and loudly no doubt it is much cheaper to talk patriotism than it is to pay for it and we are asking charity of coursewe are asking you to lend us your money for nothing no doubt the kaiser will feel quite downcast when he hears of this meeting  susan has an unshaken belief that the kaisers spiespresumably represented by mr pryorpromptly inform him of every happening in our glen  norman douglas shouted out hear hear and some boy at the back said what about lloyd george in a tone susan didnt like lloyd george is her pet hero now that kitchener is gone  i stand behind lloyd george every time retorted susan  i suppose that will hearten him up greatly said warren mead with one of his disagreeable hawhaws  warrens remark was spark to powder susan just sailed in as she puts it and said her say she said it remarkably well too there was no lack of ginger in her speech anyhow when susan is warmed up she has no mean powers of oratory and the way she trimmed those men down was funny and wonderful and effective all at once she said it was the likes of her millions of her that did stand behind lloyd george and did hearten him up that was the keynote of her speech dear old susan she is a perfect dynamo of patriotism and loyalty and contempt for slackers of all kinds and when she let it loose on that audience in her one grand outburst she electrified it susan always vows she is no suffragette but she gave womanhood its due that night and she literally made those men cringe when she finished with them they were ready to eat out of her hand she wound up by ordering themyes ordering themto march up to the platform forthwith and subscribe for victory bonds and after wild applause most of them did it even warren mead when the total amount subscribed came out in the charlottetown dailies the next day we found that the glen led every district on the islandand certainly susan has the credit for it she herself after she came home that night was quite ashamed and evidently feared that she had been guilty of unbecoming conduct she confessed to mother that she had been rather unladylike  we were allexcept susanout for a trial ride in fathers new automobile tonight a very good one we had too though we did get ingloriously ditched at the end owing to a certain grim old dameto wit miss elizabeth carr of the upper glenwho wouldnt rein her horse out to let us pass honk as we might father was quite furious but in my heart i believe i sympathized with miss elizabeth if i had been a spinster lady driving along behind my own old nag in maiden meditation fancy free i wouldnt have lifted a rein when an obstreperous car hooted blatantly behind me i should just have sat up as dourly as she did and said take the ditch if you are determined to pass  we did take the ditchand got up to our axles in sandand sat foolishly there while miss elizabeth clucked up her horse and rattled victoriously away  jem will have a laugh when i write him this he knows miss elizabeth of old  butwillvenicebesaved   19th november 1917  it is not saved yetit is still in great danger but the italians are making a stand at last on the piave line to be sure military critics say they cannot possibly hold it and must retreat to the adige but susan and gertrude and i say they must hold it because venice must be saved so what are the military critics to do  oh if i could only believe that they can hold it  our canadian troops have won another great victorythey have stormed the passchendaele ridge and held it in the face of all counter attacks none of our boys were in the battlebut oh the casualty list of other peoples boys joe milgrave was in it but came through safe miranda had some bad days until she got word from him but it is wonderful how miranda has bloomed out since her marriage she isnt the same girl at all even her eyes seem to have darkened and deepenedthough i suppose that is just because they glow with the greater intensity that has come to her she makes her father stand round in a perfectly amazing fashion she runs up the flag whenever a yard of trench on the western front is taken and she comes up regularly to our junior red cross and she doesyes she doesput on funny little married woman airs that are quite killing but she is the only warbride in the glen and surely nobody need grudge her the satisfaction she gets out of it  the russian news is bad tookerenskys government has fallen and lenin is dictator of russia somehow it is very hard to keep up courage in the dull hopelessness of these grey autumn days of suspense and boding news but we are beginning to get in a low as old highland sandy says over the approaching election conscription is the real issue at stake and it will be the most exciting election we ever had all the women who have got de ageto quote jo poirier and who have husbands sons and brothers at the front can vote oh if i were only twentyone gertrude and susan are both furious because they cant vote  it is not fair gertrude says passionately there is agnes carr who can vote because her husband went she did everything she could to prevent him from going and now she is going to vote against the union government yet i have no vote because my man at the front is only my sweetheart and not my husband  as for susan when she reflects that she cannot vote while a rank old pacifist like mr pryor canand willher comments are sulphurous  i really feel sorry for the elliotts and crawfords and macallisters overharbour they have always lined up in clearly divided camps of liberal and conservative and now they are torn from their mooringsi know im mixing my metaphors dreadfullyand set hopelessly adrift it will kill some of those old grits to vote for sir robert bordens sideand yet they have to because they believe the time has come when we must have conscription and some poor conservatives who are against conscription must vote for laurier who always has been anathema to them some of them are taking it terribly hard others seem to be in much the same attitude as mrs marshall elliott has come to be regarding church union  she was up here last night she doesnt come as often as she used to she is growing too old to walk this fardear old miss cornelia i hate to think of her growing oldwe have always loved her so and she has always been so good to us ingleside young fry  she used to be so bitterly opposed to church union but last night when father told her it was practically decided she said in a resigned tone well in a world where everything is being rent and torn what matters one more rending and tearing anyhow compared with germans even methodists seem attractive to me  our junior rc goes on quite smoothly in spite of the fact that irene has come back to ithaving fallen out with the lowbridge society i understand she gave me a sweet little jab last meetingabout knowing me across the square in charlottetown by my green velvet hat everybody knows me by that detestable and detested hat this will be my fourth season for it even mother wanted me to get a new one this fall but i said no as long as the war lasts so long do i wear that velvet hat in winter   23rd november 1917  the piave line still holdsand general byng has won a splendid victory at cambrai i did run up the flag for thatbut susan only said i shall set a kettle of water on the kitchen range tonight i notice little kitchener always has an attack of croup after any british victory i do hope he has no progerman blood in his veins nobody knows much about his fathers people  jims has had a few attacks of croup this falljust the ordinary croupnot that terrible thing he had last year but whatever blood runs in his little veins it is good healthy blood he is rosy and plump and curly and cute and he says such funny things and asks such comical questions he likes very much to sit in a special chair in the kitchen but that is susans favourite chair too and when she wants it out jims must go the last time she put him out of it he turned around and asked solemnly when you are dead susan can i sit in that chair susan thought it quite dreadful and i think that was when she began to feel anxiety about his possible ancestry the other night i took jims with me for a walk down to the store it was the first time he had ever been out so late at night and when he saw the stars he exclaimed oh willa see the big moon and all the little moons and last wednesday morning when he woke up my little alarm clock had stopped because i had forgotten to wind it up jims bounded out of his crib and ran across to me his face quite aghast above his little blue flannel pyjamas the clock is dead he gasped oh willa the clock is dead  one night he was quite angry with both susan and me because we would not give him something he wanted very much when he said his prayers he plumped down wrathfully and when he came to the petition make me a good boy he tacked on emphatically and please make willa and susan good cause theyre not  i dont go about quoting jimss speeches to all i meet that always bores me when other people do it i just enshrine them in this old hotchpotch of a journal  this very evening as i put jims to bed he looked up and asked me gravely why cant yesterday come back willa  oh why cant it jims that beautiful yesterday of dreams and laughterwhen our boys were homewhen walter and i read and rambled and watched new moons and sunsets together in rainbow valley if it could just come back but yesterdays never come back little jimsand the todays are dark with cloudsand we dare not think about the tomorrows   11th december 1917  wonderful news came today the british troops captured jerusalem yesterday we ran up the flag and some of gertrudes old sparkle came back to her for a moment  after all she said it is worth while to live in the days which see the object of the crusades attained the ghosts of all the crusaders must have crowded the walls of jerusalem last night with coeurdelion at their head  susan had cause for satisfaction also  i am so thankful i can pronounce jerusalem and hebron she said they give me a real comfortable feeling after przemysl and brestlitovsk well we have got the turks on the run at least and venice is safe and lord lansdowne is not to be taken seriously and i see no reason why we should be downhearted  jerusalem the meteor flag of england floats over youthe crescent is gone how walter would have thrilled over that   18th december 1917  yesterday the election came off in the evening mother and susan and gertrude and i forgathered in the livingroom and waited in breathless suspense father having gone down to the village we had no way of hearing the news for carter flaggs store is not on our line and when we tried to get it central always answered that the line was busyas no doubt it was for everybody for miles around was trying to get carters store for the same reason we were  about ten oclock gertrude went to the phone and happened to catch someone from overharbour talking to carter flagg gertrude shamelessly listened in and got for her comforting what eavesdroppers are proverbially supposed to getto wit unpleasant hearing the union government had done nothing in the west  we looked at each other in dismay if the government had failed to carry the west it was defeated  canada is disgraced in the eyes of the world said gertrude bitterly  if everybody was like the mark crawfords overharbour this would not have happened groaned susan yhey locked their uncle up in the barn this morning and would not let him out until he promised to vote union that is what i call effective argument mrs dr dear  gertrude and i couldnt rest after all that we walked the floor until our legs gave out and we had to sit down perforce mother knitted away as steadily as clockwork and pretended to be calm and serenepretended so well that we were all deceived and envious until the next day when i caught her ravelling out four inches of her sock she had knit that far past where the heel should have begun  it was twelve before father came home he stood in the doorway and looked at us and we looked at him we did not dare ask him what the news was then he said that it was laurier who had done nothing in the west and that the union government was in with a big majority gertrude clapped her hands i wanted to laugh and cry mothers eyes flashed with their oldtime starriness and susan emitted a queer sound between a gasp and a whoop  this will not comfort the kaiser much she said  then we went to bed but were too excited to sleep really as susan said solemnly this morning mrs dr dear i think politics are too strenuous for women   31st december 1917  our fourth war christmas is over we are trying to gather up some courage wherewith to face another year of it germany has for the most part been victorious all summer and now they say she has all her troops from the russian front ready for a big push in the spring sometimes it seems to me that we just cannot live through the winter waiting for that  i had a great batch of letters from overseas this week shirley is at the front now too and writes about it all as coolly and matteroffactly as he used to write of football at queens carl wrote that it had been raining for weeks and that nights in the trenches always made him think of the night of long ago when he did penance in the graveyard for running away from henry warrens ghost carls letters are always full of jokes and bits of fun they had a great rathunt the night before he wrotespearing rats with their bayonetsand he got the best bag and won the prize he has a tame rat that knows him and sleeps in his pocket at night rats dont worry carl as they do some peoplehe was always chummy with all little beasts he says he is making a study of the habits of the trench rat and means to write a treatise on it some day that will make him famous  ken wrote a short letter his letters are all rather short nowand he doesnt often slip in those dear little sudden sentences i love so much sometimes i think he has forgotten all about the night he was here to say goodbyeand then there will be just a line or a word that makes me think he remembers and always will remember for instance todays letter hadnt a thing in it that mightnt have been written to any girl except that he signed himself your kenneth instead of yours kenneth as he usually does now did he leave that s off intentionally or was it only carelessness i shall lie awake half the night wondering he is a captain now i am glad and proudand yet captain ford sounds so horribly far away and high up ken and captain ford seem like two different persons i may be practically engaged to kenmothers opinion on that point is my stay and bulwarkbut i cant be to captain ford  and jem is a lieutenant nowwon his promotion on the field he sent me a snapshot taken in his new uniform he looked thin and oldoldmy boybrother jem i cant forget mothers face when i showed it to her thatmy little jemthe baby of the old house of dreams was all she said  there was a letter from faith too she is doing vad work in england and writes hopefully and brightly i think she is almost happyshe saw jem on his last leave and she is so near him she could go to him if he were wounded that means so much to her oh if i were only with her but my work is here at home i know walter wouldnt have wanted me to leave mother and in everything i try to keep faith with him even to the little details of daily life walter died for canadai must live for her that is what he asked me to do   28th january 1918  i shall anchor my stormtossed soul to the british fleet and make a batch of bran biscuits said susan today to cousin sophia who had come in with some weird tale of a new and allconquering submarine just launched by germany but susan is a somewhat disgruntled woman at present owing to the regulations regarding cookery her loyalty to the union government is being sorely tried it surmounted the first strain gallantly when the order about flour came susan said quite cheerfully i am an old dog to be learning new tricks but i shall learn to make war bread if it will help defeat the huns  but the later suggestions went against susans grain had it not been for fathers decree i think she would have snapped her fingers at sir robert borden  talk about trying to make bricks without straw mrs dr dear how am i to make a cake without butter or sugar it cannot be donenot cake that is cake of course one can make a slab mrs dr dear and we cannot even camooflash it with a little icing to think that i should have lived to see the day when a government at ottawa should step into my kitchen and put me on rations  susan would give the last drop of her blood for her king and country but to surrender her beloved recipes is a very different and much more serious matter  i had letters from nan and di tooor rather notes they are too busy to write letters for exams are looming up they will graduate in arts this spring i am evidently to be the dunce of the family but somehow i never had any hankering for a college course and even now it doesnt appeal to me im afraid im rather devoid of ambition there is only one thing i really want to beand i dont know if ill be it or not if noti dont want to be anything but i shant write it down it is all right to think it but as cousin sophia would say it might be brazen to write it down  i will write it down i wont be cowed by the conventions and cousin sophia i want to be kenneth fords wife there now  ive just looked in the glass and i hadnt the sign of a blush on my face i suppose im not a properly constructed damsel at all  i was down to see little dog monday today he has grown quite stiff and rheumatic but there he sat waiting for the train he thumped his tail and looked pleadingly into my eyes when will jem come he seemed to say oh dog monday there is no answer to that question and there is as yet no answer to the other which we are all constantly asking what will happen when germany strikes again on the western fronther one great last blow for victory   1st march 1918  what will spring bring gertrude said today i dread it as i never dreaded spring before do you suppose there will ever again come a time when life will be free from fear for almost four years we have lain down with fear and risen up with it it has been the unbidden guest at every meal the unwelcome companion at every gathering  hindenburg says he will be in paris on 1st april sighed cousin sophia  hindenburg there is no power in pen and ink to express the contempt which susan infused into that name has he forgotten what day the first of april is  hindenburg has kept his word hitherto said gertrude as gloomily as cousin sophia herself could have said it  yes fighting against the russians and rumanians retorted susan wait you till he comes up against the british and french not to speak of the yankees who are getting there as fast as they can and will no doubt give a good account of themselves  you said just the same thing before mons susan i reminded her  hindenburg says he will spend a million lives to break the allied front said gertrude at such a price he must purchase some successes and how can we live through them even if he is baffled in the end these past two months when we have been crouching and waiting for the blow to fall have seemed as long as all the preceding months of the war put together i work all day feverishly and waken at three oclock at night to wonder if the iron legions have struck at last it is then i see hindenburg in paris and germany triumphant i never see her so at any other time than that accursed hour  susan looked dubious over gertrudes adjective but evidently concluded that the a saved the situation  i wish it were possible to take some magic draught and go to sleep for the next three monthsand then waken to find armageddon over said mother almost impatiently  it is not often that mother slumps into a wish like thator at least the verbal expression of it mother has changed a great deal since that terrible day in september when we knew that walter would not come back but she has always been brave and patient now it seemed as if even she had reached the limit of her endurance  susan went over to mother and touched her shoulder  do not you be frightened or downhearted mrs dr dear she said gently i felt somewhat that way myself last night and i rose from my bed and lighted my lamp and opened my bible and what do you think was the first verse my eyes lighted upon it was and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee saith the lord of hosts to deliver thee i am not gifted in the way of dreaming as miss oliver is but i knew then and there mrs dr dear that it was a manifest leading and that hindenburg will never see paris so i read no further but went back to my bed and i did not waken at three oclock or at any other hour before morning  i say that verse susan read over and over again to myself the lord of hosts is with usand the spirits of all just men made perfectand even the legions and guns that germany is massing on the western front must break against such a barrier this is in certain uplifted moments but when other moments come i feel like gertrude that i cannot endure any longer this awful and ominous hush before the coming storm   23rd march 1918  armageddon has begunthe last great fight of all is it i wonder yesterday i went down to the post office for the mail it was a dull bitter day the snow was gone but the grey lifeless ground was frozen hard and a biting wind was blowing the whole glen landscape was ugly and hopeless  then i got the paper with its big black headlines germany struck on the twentyfirst she makes big claims of guns and prisoners taken general haig reports that severe fighting continues i dont like the sound of that last expression  we all find we cannot do any work that requires concentration of thought so we all knit furiously because we can do that mechanically at least the dreadful waiting is overthe horrible wondering where and when the blow will fall it has fallenbut they shall not prevail against us  oh what is happening on the western front tonight as i write this sitting here in my room with my journal before me jims is asleep in his crib and the wind is wailing around the window over my desk hangs walters picture looking at me with his beautiful deep eyes the mona lisa he gave me the last christmas he was home hangs on one side of it and on the other a framed copy of the piper it seems to me that i can hear walters voice repeating itthat little poem into which he put his soul and which will therefore live for ever carrying walters name on through the future of our land everything about me is calm and peaceful and homey walter seems very near meif i could just sweep aside the thin wavering little veil that hangs between i could see himjust as he saw the pied piper the night before courcelette  over there in france tonightdoes the line hold    chapter xxviii  black sunday  in march of the year of grace 1918 there was one week into which must have crowded more of searing human agony than any seven days had ever held before in the history of the world and in that week there was one day when all humanity seemed nailed to the cross on that day the whole planet must have been agroan with universal convulsion everywhere the hearts of men were failing them for fear  it dawned calmly and coldly and greyly at ingleside mrs blythe and rilla and miss oliver made ready for church in a suspense tempered by hope and confidence the doctor was away having been summoned during the wee smas to the marwood household in upper glen where a little warbride was fighting gallantly on her own battleground to give life not death to the world susan announced that she meant to stay home that morninga rare decision for susan  but i would rather not go to church this morning mrs dr dear she explained if whiskersonthemoon were there and i saw him looking holy and pleased as he always looks when he thinks the huns are winning i fear i would lose my patience and my sense of decorum and hurl a bible or hymnbook at him thereby disgracing myself and the sacred edifice no mrs dr dear i shall stay home from church till the tide turns and pray hard here  i think i might as well stay home too for all the good church will do me today miss oliver said to rilla as they walked down the hardfrozen red road to the church i can think of nothing but the question does the line still hold  next sunday will be easter said rilla will it herald death or life to our cause  mr meredith preached that morning from the text he that endureth to the end shall be saved and hope and confidence rang through his inspiring sentences rilla looking up at the memorial tablet on the wall above their pew sacred to the memory of walter cuthbert blythe felt herself lifted out of her dread and filled anew with courage walter could not have laid down his life for naught his had been the gift of prophetic vision and he had foreseen victory she would cling to that beliefthe line would hold  in this renewed mood she walked home from church almost gaily the others too were hopeful and all went smiling into ingleside there was no one in the livingroom save jims who had fallen asleep on the sofa and doc who sat hushed in grim repose on the hearthrug looking very hydeish indeed no one was in the diningroom eitherand stranger still no dinner was on the table which was not even set where was susan  can she have taken ill exclaimed mrs blythe anxiously i thought it strange that she did not want to go to church this morning  the kitchen door opened and susan appeared on the threshold with such a ghastly face that mrs blythe cried out in sudden panic  susan what is it  the british line is broken and the german shells are falling on paris said susan dully  the three women stared at each other stricken  its not trueits not gasped rilla  the thing would beridiculous said gertrude oliverand then she laughed horribly  susan who told you thiswhen did the news come asked mrs blythe  i got it over the longdistance phone from charlottetown half an hour ago said susan the news came to town late last night it was dr holland phoned it out and he said it was only too true since then i have done nothing mrs dr dear i am very sorry dinner is not ready it is the first time i have been so remiss if you will be patient i will soon have something for you to eat but i am afraid i let the potatoes burn  dinner nobody wants any dinner susan said mrs blythe wildly oh this thing is unbelievableit must be a nightmare  paris is lostfrance is lostthe war is lost gasped rilla amid the utter ruins of hope and confidence and belief  oh godoh god moaned gertrude oliver walking about the room and wringing her hands ohgod  nothing elseno other wordsnothing but that age old pleathe old old cry of supreme agony and appeal from the human heart whose every human staff has failed it  is god dead asked a startled little voice from the doorway of the livingroom jims stood there flushed from sleep his big brown eyes filled with dread oh willaoh willa is god dead  miss oliver stopped walking and exclaiming and stared at jims in whose eyes tears of fright were beginning to gather rilla ran to his comforting while susan bounded up from the chair upon which she had dropped  no she said briskly with a sudden return of her real self no god isnt deadnor lloyd george either we were forgetting that mrs dr dear dont cry little kitchener bad as things are they might be worse the british line may be broken but the british navy is not let us tie to that i will take a brace and get up a bite to eat for strength we must have  they made a pretence of eating susans bite but it was only a pretence nobody at ingleside ever forgot that black afternoon gertrude oliver walked the floorthey all walked the floor except susan who got out her grey war sock  mrs dr dear i must knit on sunday at last i have never dreamed of doing it before for say what might be said i have considered it was a violation of the third commandment but whether it is or whether it is not i must knit today or i shall go mad  knit if you can susan said mrs blythe restlessly i would knit if i couldbut i cannoti cannot  if we could only get fuller information moaned rilla there might be something to encourage usif we knew all  we know that the germans are shelling paris said miss oliver bitterly in that case they must have smashed through everywhere and be at the very gates no we have lostlet us face the fact as other peoples in the past have had to face it other nations with right on their side have given their best and bravestand gone down to defeat in spite of it ours is but one more to baffled millions who have gone before  i wont give up like that cried rilla her pale face suddenly flushing i wont despair we are not conqueredno if germany overruns all france we are not conquered i am ashamed of myself for this hour of despair you wont see me slump again like that im going to ring up town at once and ask for particulars  but town could not be got the longdistance operator there was submerged by similar calls from every part of the distracted country rilla finally gave up and slipped away to rainbow valley there she knelt down on the withered grey grasses in the little nook where she and walter had had their last talk together with her head bowed against the mossy trunk of a fallen tree the sun had broken through the black clouds and drenched the valley with a pale golden splendour the bells on the tree lovers twinkled elfinly and fitfully in the gusty march wind  oh god give me strength rilla whispered just strengthand courage then like a child she clasped her hands together and said as simply as jims could have done please send us better news tomorrow  she knelt there a long time and when she went back to ingleside she was calm and resolute the doctor had arrived home tired but triumphant little douglas haig marwood having made a safe landing on the shores of time gertrude was still pacing restlessly but mrs blythe and susan had reacted from the shock and susan was already planning a new line of defence for the channel ports  as long as we can hold them she declared the situation is saved paris has really no military significance  dont said gertrude sharply as if susan had run something into her she thought the old worn phrase no military significance nothing short of ghastly mockery under the circumstances and more terrible to endure than the voice of despair would have been  i heard up at marwoods of the line being broken said the doctor but this story of the germans shelling paris seems to be rather incredible even if they broke through they were fifty miles from paris at the nearest point and how could they get their artillery close enough to shell it in so short a time depend upon it girls that part of the message cant be true im going to try to try a longdistance call to town myself  the doctor was no more successful than rilla had been but his point of view cheered them all a little and helped them through the evening and at nine oclock a longdistance message came through at last that helped them through the night  the line broke only in one place before st quentin said the doctor as he hung up the receiver and the british troops are retreating in good order thats not so bad as for the shells that are falling on paris they are coming from a distance of seventy milesfrom some amazing longrange gun the germans have invented and sprung with the opening offensive that is all the news to date and dr holland says it is reliable  it would have been dreadful news yesterday said gertrude but compared to what we heard this morning it is almost like good news but still she added trying to smile i am afraid i will not sleep much tonight  there is one thing to be thankful for at any rate miss oliver dear said susan and that is that cousin sophia did not come in today i really could not have endured her on top of all the rest    chapter xxix  wounded and missing  battered but not broken was the headline in mondays paper and susan repeated it over and over to herself as she went about her work the gap caused by the st quentin disaster had been patched up in time but the allied line was being pushed relentlessly back from the territory they had purchased in 1917 with half a million lives on wednesday the headline was british and french check germans but still the retreat went on backand backand back where would it end would the line break againthis time disastrously  on saturday the headline was even berlin admits offensive checked and for the first time in that terrible week the ingleside folk dared to draw a long breath  well we have got one week overnow for the next said susan staunchly  i feel like a prisoner on the rack when they stopped turning it miss oliver said to rilla as they went to church on easter morning but i am not off the rack the torture may begin again at any time  i doubted god last sunday said rilla but i dont doubt him today evil cannot win spirit is on our side and it is bound to outlast flesh  nevertheless her faith was often tried in the dark spring that followed armageddon was not as they had hoped a matter of a few days it stretched out into weeks and months again and again hindenburg struck his savage sudden blows with alarming though futile success again and again the military critics declared the situation extremely perilous again and again cousin sophia agreed with the military critics  if the allies go back three miles more the war is lost she wailed  is the british navy anchored in those three miles demanded susan scornfully  it is the opinion of a man who knows all about it said cousin sophia solemnly  there is no such person retorted susan as for the military critics they do not know one blessed thing about it any more than you or i they have been mistaken times out of number why do you always look on the dark side sophia crawford  because there aint any bright side susan baker  oh is there not it is the twentieth of april and hindy is not in paris yet although he said he would be there by april first is that not a bright spot at least  it is my opinion that the germans will be in paris before very long and more than that susan baker they will be in canada  not in this part of it the huns shall never set foot in prince edward island as long as i can handle a pitchfork declared susan looking and feeling quite equal to routing the entire german army singlehanded no sophia crawford to tell you the plain truth i am sick and tired of your gloomy predictions i do not deny that some mistakes have been made the germans would never have got back passchendaele if the canadians had been left there and it was bad business trusting to those portuguese at the lys river but that is no reason why you or anyone should go about proclaiming the war is lost i do not want to quarrel with you least of all at such a time as this but our morale must be kept up and i am going to speak my mind out plainly and tell you that if you cannot keep from such croaking your room is better than your company  cousin sophia marched home in high dudgeon to digest her affront and did not reappear in susans kitchen for many weeks perhaps it was just as well for they were hard weeks when the germans continued to strike now here now there and seemingly vital points fell to them at every blow and one day in early may when wind and sunshine frolicked in rainbow valley and the maple grove was goldengreen and the harbour all blue and dimpled and whitecapped the news came about jem  there had been a trench raid on the canadian fronta little trench raid so insignificant that it was never even mentioned in the dispatches and when it was over lieutenant james blythe was reported wounded and missing  i think this is even worse than the news of his death would have been moaned rilla through her white lips that night  nonomissing leaves a little hope rilla urged gertrude oliver  yestorturing agonized hope that keeps you from ever becoming quite resigned to the worst said rilla oh miss olivermust we go for weeks and monthsnot knowing whether jem is alive or dead perhaps we will never know ii cannot bear iti cannot walterand now jem this will kill motherlook at her face miss oliver and you will see that and faithpoor faithhow can she bear it  gertrude shivered with pain she looked up at the pictures hanging over rillas desk and felt a sudden hatred of mona lisas endless smile  will not even this blot it off your face she thought savagely  but she said gently no it wont kill your mother shes made of finer mettle than that besides she refuses to believe jem is dead she will cling to hope and we must all do that faith you may be sure will do it  i cannot moaned rilla jem was woundedwhat chance would he have even if the germans found himwe know how they have treated wounded prisoners i wish i could hope miss oliverit would help i suppose but hope seems dead in me i cant hope without some reason for itand there is no reason  when miss oliver had gone to her own room and rilla was lying on her bed in the moonlight praying desperately for a little strength susan stepped in like a gaunt shadow and sat down beside her  rilla dear do not you worry little jem is not dead  oh how can you believe that susan  because i know listen you to me when that word came this morning the first thing i thought of was dog monday and tonight as soon as i got the supper dishes washed and the bread set i went down to the station there was dog monday waiting for the train just as patient as usual now rilla dear that trench raid was four days agolast mondayand i said to the stationagent can you tell me if that dog howled or made any kind of a fuss last monday night he thought it over a bit and then he said no he did not are you sure i said theres more depends on it than you think dead sure he said i was up all night last monday night because my mare was sick and there was never a sound out of him i would have heard if there had been for the stable door was open all the time and his kennel is right across from it now rilla dear those were the mans very words and you know how that poor little dog howled all night after the battle of courcelette yet he did not love walter as much as he loved jem if he mourned for walter like that do you suppose he would sleep sound in his kennel the night after jem had been killed no rilla dear little jem is not dead and that you may tie to if he were dog monday would have known just as he knew before and he would not be still waiting for the trains  it was absurdand irrationaland impossible but rilla believed it for all that and mrs blythe believed it and the doctor though he smiled faintly in pretended derision felt an odd confidence replace his first despair and foolish and absurd or not they all plucked up heart and courage to carry on just because a faithful little dog at the glen station was still watching with unbroken faith for his master to come home common sense might scornincredulity might mutter mere superstitionbut in their hearts the folk of ingleside stood by their belief that dog monday knew    chapter xxx  the turning of the tide  susan was very sorrowful when she saw the beautiful old lawn of ingleside ploughed up that spring and planted with potatoes yet she made no protest even when her beloved peony bed was sacrificed but when the government passed the daylight saving law susan balked there was a higher power than the union government to which susan owed allegiance  do you think it right to meddle with the arrangements of the almighty she demanded indignantly of the doctor the doctor quite unmoved responded that the law must be observed and the ingleside clocks were moved on accordingly but the doctor had no power over susans little alarm  i bought that with my own money mrs dr dear she said firmly and it shall go on gods time and not bordens time  susan got up and went to bed by gods time and regulated her own goings and comings by it she served the meals under protest by bordens time and she had to go to church by it which was the crowning injury but she said her prayers by her own clock and fed the hens by it so that there was always a furtive triumph in her eye when she looked at the doctor she had got the better of him by so much at least  whiskersonthemoon is very much delighted with this daylight saving business she told him one evening of course he naturally would be since i understand that the germans invented it i hear he came near losing his entire wheatcrop lately warren meads cows broke into the field one day last weekit was the very day the germans captured the chemangdedam which may have been a coincidence or may notand were making fine havoc of it when mrs dick clow happened to see them from her attic window at first she had no intention of letting mr pryor know she told me she had just gloated over the sight of those cows pasturing on his wheat she felt it served him exactly right but presently she reflected that the wheatcrop was a matter of great importance and that save and serve meant that those cows must be routed out as much as it meant anything so she went down and phoned over to whiskers about the matter all the thanks she got was that he said something queer right out to her she is not prepared to state that it was actually swearing for you cannot be sure just what you hear over the phone but she has her own opinion and so have i but i will not express it for here comes mr meredith and whiskers is one of his elders so we must be discreet  are you looking for the new star asked mr meredith joining miss oliver and rilla who were standing among the blossoming potatoes gazing skyward  yeswe have found itsee it is just above the tip of the tallest old pine  its wonderful to be looking at something that happened three thousand years ago isnt it said rilla that is when astronomers think the collision took place which produced this new star it makes me feel horribly insignificant she added under her breath  even this event cannot dwarf into what may be the proper perspective in star systems the fact that the germans are again only one leap from paris said gertrude restlessly  i think i would like to have been an astronomer said mr meredith dreamily gazing at the star  there must be a strange pleasure in it agreed miss oliver an unearthly pleasure in more senses than one i would like to have a few astronomers for my friends  fancy talking the gossip of the hosts of heaven laughed rilla  i wonder if astronomers feel a very deep interest in earthly affairs said the doctor perhaps students of the canals of mars would not be so keenly sensitive to the significance of a few yards of trenches lost or won on the western front  i have read somewhere said mr meredith that ernest renan wrote one of his books during the siege of paris in 1870 and enjoyed the writing of it very much i suppose one would call him a philosopher  i have read also said miss oliver that shortly before his death he said that his only regret in dying was that he must die before he had seen what that extremely interesting young man the german emperor would do in his life if ernest renan walked today and saw what that interesting young man had done to his beloved france not to speak of the world i wonder if his mental detachment would be as complete as it was in 1870  i wonder where jem is tonight thought rilla in a sudden bitter inrush of remembrance  it was over a month since the news had come about jem nothing had been discovered concerning him in spite of all efforts two or three letters had come from him written before the trench raid and since then there had been only unbroken silence now the germans were again at the marne pressing nearer and nearer paris now rumours were coming of another austrian offensive against the piave line rilla turned away from the new star sick at heart it was one of the moments when hope and courage failed her utterlywhen it seemed impossible to go on even one more day if only they knew what had happened to jemyou can face anything you know but a beleaguerment of fear and doubt and suspense is a hard thing for the morale surely if jem were alive some word would have come through he must be dead onlythey would never knowthey could never be quite sure and dog monday would wait for the train until he died of old age monday was only a poor faithful rheumatic little dog who knew nothing more of his masters fate than they did  rilla had a white night and did not fall asleep until late when she wakened gertrude oliver was sitting at her window leaning out to meet the silver mystery of the dawn her clever striking profile with the masses of black hair behind it came out clearly against the pallid gold of the eastern sky rilla remembered jems admiration of the curve of miss olivers brow and chin and she shuddered everything that reminded her of jem was beginning to give intolerable pain walters death had inflicted on her heart a terrible wound but it had been a clean wound and had healed slowly as such wounds do though the scar must remain for ever but the torture of jems disappearance was another thing there was a poison in it that kept it from healing the alternations of hope and despair the endless watching each day for the letter that never camethat might never comethe newspaper tales of illusage of prisonersthe bitter wonder as to jems woundall were increasingly hard to bear  gertrude oliver turned her head there was an odd brilliancy in her eyes  rilla ive had another dream  oh nono cried rilla shrinking miss olivers dreams had always foretold coming disaster  rilla it was a good dream listeni dreamed just as i did four years ago that i stood on the veranda steps and looked down the glen and it was still covered by waves that lapped about my feet but as i looked the waves began to ebband they ebbed as swiftly as four years ago they rolled inebbed out and out to the gulf and the glen lay before me beautiful and green with a rainbow spanning rainbow valleya rainbow of such splendid colour that it dazzled meand i woke rillarilla blythethe tide has turned  i wish i could believe it sighed rilla    sooth was my prophecy of fear    believe it when it augurs cheer  quoted gertrude almost gaily i tell you i have no doubt  yet in spite of the great italian victory at the piave that came a few days later she had doubt many a time in the hard month that followed and when in midjuly the germans crossed the marne again despair came sickeningly it was idle they all felt to hope that the miracle of the marne would be repeated but it was again as in 1914 the tide turned at the marne the french and the american troops struck their sudden smashing blow on the exposed flank of the enemy and with the almost inconceivable rapidity of a dream the whole aspect of the war changed  the allies have won two tremendous victories said the doctor on 20th july  it is the beginning of the endi feel iti feel it said mrs blythe  thank god said susan folding her trembling old hands then she added under her breath but it wont bring our boys back  nevertheless she went out and ran up the flag for the first time since the fall of jerusalem as it caught the breeze and swelled gallantly out above her susan lifted her hand and saluted it as she had seen shirley do weve all given something to keep you flying she said four hundred thousand of our boys gone overseasfifty thousand of them killed butyou are worth it the wind whipped her grey hair about her face and the gingham apron that shrouded her from head to foot was cut on lines of economy not of grace yet somehow just then susan made an imposing figure she was one of the womencourageous unquailing patient heroicwho had made victory possible in her they all saluted the symbol for which their dearest had fought something of this was in the doctors mind as he watched her from the door  susan he said when she turned to come in from first to last of this business you have been a brick    chapter xxxi  mrs matilda pittman  rilla and jims were standing on the rear platform of their car when the train stopped at the little millward siding the august evening was so hot and close that the crowded cars were stifling nobody ever knew just why trains stopped at millward siding nobody was ever known to get off there or get on there was only one house nearer to it than four miles and it was surrounded by acres of blueberry barrens and scrub sprucetrees  rilla was on her way into charlottetown to spend the night with a friend and the next day in red cross shopping she had taken jims with her partly because she did not want susan or her mother to be bothered with his care partly because of a hungry desire in her heart to have as much of him as she could before she might have to give him up forever james anderson had written to her not long before this he was wounded and in the hospital he would not be able to go back to the front and as soon as he was able he would be coming home for jims  rilla was heavyhearted over this and worried also she loved jims dearly and would feel deeply giving him up in any case but if jim anderson were a different sort of a man with a proper home for the child it would not be so bad but to give jims up to a roving shiftless irresponsible father however kind and goodhearted he might beand she knew jim anderson was kind and goodhearted enoughwas a bitter prospect to rilla it was not even likely anderson would stay in the glen he had no ties there now he might even go back to england she might never see her dear sunshiny carefully broughtup little jims again with such a father what might his fate be rilla meant to beg jim anderson to leave him with her but from his letter she had not much hope that he would  if he would only stay in the glen where i could keep an eye on jims and have him often with me i wouldnt feel so worried over it she reflected but i feel sure he wontand jims will never have any chance and he is such a bright little chaphe has ambition wherever he got itand he isnt lazy but his father will never have a cent to give him any education or start in life jims my little warbaby whatever is going to become of you  jims was not in the least concerned over what was to become of him he was gleefully watching the antics of a striped chipmunk that was frisking over the roof of the little siding as the train pulled out jims leaned eagerly forward for a last look at chippy pulling his hand from rillas rilla was so engrossed in wondering what was to become of jims in the future that she forgot to take notice of what was happening to him in the present what did happen was that jims lost his balance shot headlong down the steps hurtled across the little siding platform and landed in a clump of bracken fern on the other side  rilla shrieked and lost her head she sprang down the steps and jumped off the train  fortunately the train was still going at a comparatively slow speed fortunately also rilla retained enough sense to jump the way it was going nevertheless she fell and sprawled helplessly down the embankment landing in a ditch full of a rank growth of goldenrod and fireweed  nobody had seen what had happened and the train whisked briskly away round a curve in the barrens rilla picked herself up dizzy but unhurt scrambled out of the ditch and flew wildly across the platform expecting to find jims dead or broken in pieces but jims except for a few bruises and a big fright was quite uninjured he was so badly scared that he didnt even cry but rilla when she found that he was safe and sound burst into tears and sobbed wildly  nasty old twain remarked jims in disgust and nasty old god he added with a scowl at the heavens  a laugh broke into rillas sobbing producing something very like what her father would have called hysterics but she caught herself up before the hysteria could conquer her  rilla blythe im ashamed of you pull yourself together immediately jims you shouldnt have said anything like that  god frew me off the twain declared jims defiantly somebody frew me you didnt frow me so it was god  no it wasnt you fell because you let go of my hand and bent too far forward i told you not to do that so that it was your own fault  jims looked to see if she meant it then glanced up at the sky again  excuse me then god he remarked airily  rilla scanned the sky also she did not like its appearance a heavy thundercloud was appearing in the northwest what in the world was to be done there was no other train that night since the nine oclock special ran only on saturdays would it be possible for them to reach hannah brewsters house two miles away before the storm broke rilla thought she could do it alone easily enough but with jims it was another matter were his little legs good for it  weve got to try it said rilla desperately we might stay in the siding until the thunderstorm is over but it may keep on raining all night and anyway it will be pitch dark if we can get to hannahs she will keep us all night  hannah brewster when she had been hannah crawford had lived in the glen and gone to school with rilla they had been good friends then though hannah had been three years the older she had married very young and had gone to live in millward what with hard work and babies and a neerdowell husband her life had not been an easy one and hannah seldom revisited her old home rilla had visited her once soon after her marriage but had not seen her or even heard of her for years she knew however that she and jims would find welcome and harbourage in any house where rosyfaced openhearted generous hannah lived  for the first mile they got on very well but the second one was harder the road seldom used was rough and deeprutted jims grew so tired that rilla had to carry him for the last quarter she reached the brewster house almost exhausted and dropped jims on the walk with a sigh of thankfulness the sky was black with clouds the first heavy drops were beginning to fall and the rumble of thunder was growing very loud then she made an unpleasant discovery the blinds were all down and the doors locked evidently the brewsters were not at home rilla ran to the little barn it too was locked no other refuge presented itself the bare whitewashed little house had not even a veranda or porch  it was almost dark now and her plight seemed desperate  im going to get in if i have to break a window said rilla resolutely hannah would want me to do that shed never get over it if she heard i came to her house for refuge in a thunderstorm and couldnt get in  luckily she did not have to go to the length of actual housebreaking the kitchen window went up quite easily rilla lifted jims in and scrambled through herself just as the storm broke in good earnest  oh see all the little pieces of thunder cried jims in delight as the hail danced in after them rilla shut the window and with some difficulty found and lighted a lamp they were in a very snug little kitchen opening off it on one side was a trim nicely furnished parlour and on the other a pantry which proved to be well stocked  im going to make myself at home said rilla i know that is just what hannah would want me to do ill get a little snack for jims and me and then if the rain continues and nobody comes home ill just go upstairs to the spare room and go to bed there is nothing like acting sensibly in an emergency if i had not been a goose when i saw jims fall off the train id have rushed back into the car and got some one to stop it then i wouldnt have been in this scrape since i am in it ill make the best of it  this house she added looking around is fixed up much nicer than when i was here before of course hannah and ted were just beginning housekeeping then but somehow ive had the idea that ted hasnt been very prosperous he must have done better than ive been led to believe when they can afford furniture like this im awfully glad for hannahs sake  the thunderstorm passed but the rain continued to fall heavily at eleven oclock rilla decided that nobody was coming home jims had fallen asleep on the sofa she carried him up to the spare room and put him to bed then she undressed put on a nightgown she found in the washstand drawer and scrambled sleepily in between very nice lavenderscented sheets she was so tired after her adventures and exertions that not even the oddity of her situation could keep her awake she was sound asleep in a few minutes  rilla slept until eight oclock the next morning and then wakened with startling suddenness somebody was saying in a harsh gruff voice here you two wake up i want to know what this means  rilla did wake up promptly and effectually she had never in all her life wakened up so thoroughly before standing in the room were three people one of them a man who were absolute strangers to her the man was a big fellow with a bushy black beard and an angry scowl beside him was a womana tall thin angular person with violently red hair and an indescribable hat she looked even crosser and more amazed than the man if that were possible in the background was another womana tiny old lady who must have been at least eighty she was in spite of her tinyness a very strikinglooking personage she was dressed in unrelieved black had snowwhite hair a deadwhite face and snapping vivid coalblack eyes she looked as amazed as the other two but rilla realized that she didnt look cross  rilla also was realizing that something was wrongfearfully wrong then the man said more gruffly than ever come now who are you and what business have you here  rilla raised herself on one elbow looking and feeling hopelessly bewildered and foolish she heard the old blackandwhite lady in the background chuckle to herself she must be real rilla thought i cant be dreaming her aloud she gasped  isnt this theodore brewsters place  no said the big woman speaking for the first time this place belongs to us we bought it from the brewsters last fall they moved to greenvale our name is chapley  poor rilla fell back on her pillow quite overcome  i beg your pardon she said iithought the brewsters lived here mrs brewster is a friend of mine i am rilla blythedr blythes daughter from glen st mary ii was going to town with mymythis little boyand he fell off the trainand i jumped off after himand nobody knew of it i knew we couldnt get home last night and a storm was coming upso we came here and when we found nobody at homewewejust got in through the window andandmade ourselves at home  so it seems said the woman sarcastically  a likely story said the man  we werent born yesterday added the woman  madam blackandwhite didnt say anything but when the other two made their pretty speeches she doubled up in a silent convulsion of mirth shaking her head from side to side and beating the air with her hands  rilla stung by the disagreeable attitude of the chapleys regained her selfpossession and lost her temper she sat up in bed and said in her haughtiest voice i do not know when you were born or where but it must have been somewhere where very peculiar manners were taught if you will have the decency to leave my roomerthis roomuntil i can get up and dress i shall not transgress upon your hospitalityrilla was killingly sarcasticany longer and i shall pay you amply for the food we have eaten and the nights lodging i have taken  the blackandwhite apparition went through the motion of clapping her hands but not a sound did she make perhaps mr chapley was cowed by rillas toneor perhaps he was appeased at the prospect of payment at all events he spoke more civilly  well thats fair if you pay up its all right  she shall do no such thing as pay you said madam blackandwhite in a surprisingly clear resolute authoritative tone of voice if you havent got any shame for yourself robert chapley youve got a motherinlaw who can be ashamed for you no strangers shall be charged for room and lodging in any house where mrs matilda pitman lives remember that though i may have come down in the world i havent quite forgot all decency for all that i knew you was a skinflint when amelia married you and youve made her as bad as yourself but mrs matilda pitman has been boss for a long time and mrs matilda pitman will remain boss here you robert chapley take yourself out of here and let that girl get dressed and you amelia go downstairs and cook a breakfast for her  never in all her life had rilla seen anything like the abject meekness with which those two big people obeyed that mite they went without word or look of protest as the door closed behind them mrs matilda pitman laughed silently and rocked from side to side in her merriment  aint it funny she said i mostly lets them run the length of their tether but sometimes i has to pull them up and then i does it with a jerk they dont dast aggravate me because ive got considerable hard cash and theyre afraid i wont leave it all to them neither i will ill leave em some but some i wont just to vex em i havent made up my mind where i will leave it but ill have to soon for at eighty a body is living on borrowed time now you can take your time about dressing my dear and ill go down and keep them mean scallawags in order thats a handsome child you have there is he your brother  no hes a little warbaby ive been taking care of because his mother died and his father was overseas answered rilla in a subdued tone  warbaby humph well id better skin out before he wakes up or hell likely start crying children dont like menever did i cant recollect any youngster ever coming near me of its own accord never had any of my own amelia was my stepdaughter well its saved me a world of bother if kids dont like me i dont like them so thats an even score but that certainly is a handsome child  jims chose this moment for waking up he opened his big brown eyes and looked at mrs matilda pitman unblinkingly then he sat up dimpled deliciously pointed to her and said solemnly to rilla pwitty lady willa pwitty lady  mrs matilda pitman smiled even eightyodd is sometimes vulnerable in vanity ive heard that children and fools tell the truth she said i was used to compliments when i was youngbut theyre scarcer when you get as far along as i am i havent had one for years it tastes good i spose now you monkey you wouldnt give me a kiss  then jims did a quite surprising thing he was not a demonstrative youngster and was chary with kisses even to the ingleside people but without a word he stood up in bed his plump little body encased only in his undershirt ran to the footboard flung his arms about mrs matilda pitmans neck and gave her a bear hug accompanied by three or four hearty ungrudging smacks  jims protested rilla aghast at this liberty  you leave him be ordered mrs matilda pitman setting her bonnet straight  laws i like to see some one that isnt skeered of me everybody isyou are though youre trying to hide it and why of course robert and amelia are because i make em skeered on purpose but folks always areno matter how civil i be to them are you going to keep this child  im afraid not his father is coming home before long  is he any goodthe father i mean  wellhes kind and nicebut hes poorand im afraid he always will be faltered rilla  i seeshiftlesscant make or keep well ill seeill see i have an idea its a good idea and besides it will make robert and amelia squirm thats its main merit in my eyes though i like that child mind you because he aint skeered of me hes worth some bother now you get dressed as i said before and come down when youre good and ready  rilla was stiff and sore after her tumble and walk of the night before but she was not long in dressing herself and jims when she went down to the kitchen she found a smoking hot breakfast on the table mr chapley was nowhere in sight and mrs chapley was cutting bread with a sulky air mrs matilda pitman was sitting in an armchair knitting a grey army sock she still wore her bonnet and her triumphant expression  set right in dears and make a good breakfast she said  i am not hungry said rilla almost pleadingly i dont think i can eat anything and it is time i was starting for the station the morning train will soon be along please excuse me and let us goill take a piece of bread and butter for jims  mrs matilda pitman shook a knittingneedle playfully at rilla  sit down and take your breakfast she said mrs matilda pitman commands you everybody obeys mrs matilda pitmaneven robert and amelia you must obey her too  rilla did obey her she sat down and such was the influence of mrs matilda pitmans mesmeric eye she ate a tolerable breakfast the obedient amelia never spoke mrs matilda pitman did not speak either but she knitted furiously and chuckled when rilla had finished mrs matilda pitman rolled up her sock  now you can go if you want to she said but you dont have to go you can stay here as long as you want to and ill make amelia cook your meals for you  the independent miss blythe whom a certain clique of junior red cross girls accused of being domineering and bossy was thoroughly cowed  thank you she said meekly but we must really go  well then said mrs matilda pitman throwing open the door your conveyance is ready for you i told robert he must hitch up and drive you to the station i enjoy making robert do things its almost the only sport i have left im over eighty and most things have lost their flavour except bossing robert  robert sat before the door on the front seat of a trim doubleseated rubbertired buggy he must have heard every word his motherinlaw said but he gave no sign  i do wish said rilla plucking up what little spirit she had left that you would let meohah then she quailed again before mrs matilda pitmans eyerecompense you forfor  mrs matilda pitman said beforeand meant itthat she doesnt take pay for entertaining strangers nor let other people where she lives do it much as their natural meanness would like to do it you go along to town and dont forget to call the next time you come this way dont be scared not that you are scared of much i reckon considering the way you sassed robert back this morning i like your spunk most girls nowadays are such timid skeery creeturs when i was a girl i wasnt afraid of nothing nor nobody mind you take good care of that boy he aint any common child and make robert drive round all the puddles in the road i wont have that new buggy splashed  as they drove away jims threw kisses at mrs matilda pitman as long as he could see her and mrs matilda pitman waved her sock back at him robert spoke no word either good or bad all the way to the station but he remembered the puddles when rilla got out at the siding she thanked him courteously the only response she got was a grunt as robert turned his horse and started for home  wellrilla drew a long breathi must try to get back into rilla blythe again ive been somebody else these past few hoursi dont know just whosome creation of that extraordinary old persons i believe she hypnotized me what an adventure this will be to write the boys  and then she sighed bitter remembrance came that there were only jerry ken carl and shirley to write it to now jemwho would have appreciated mrs matilda pitman keenlywhere was jem    chapter xxxii  word from jem  4th august 1918  it is four years tonight since the dance at the lighthousefour years of war it seems like three times four i was fifteen then i am nineteen now i expected that these past four years would be the most delightful years of my life and they have been years of waryears of fear and grief and worrybut i humbly hope of a little growth in strength and character as well  today i was going through the hall and i heard mother saying something to father about me i didnt mean to listeni couldnt help hearing her as i went along the hall and upstairsso perhaps that is why i heard what listeners are said never to hearsomething good of myself and because it was mother who said it im going to write it here in my journal for my comforting when days of discouragement come upon me in which i feel that i am vain and selfish and weak and that there is no good thing in me  rilla has developed in a wonderful fashion these past four years she used to be such an irresponsible young creature she has changed into a capable womanly girl and she is such a comfort to me nan and di have grown a little away from methey have been so little at homebut rilla has grown closer and closer to me we are chums i dont see how i could have got through these terrible years without her gilbert  there that is just what mother saidand i feel gladand sorryand proudand humble its beautiful to have my mother think that about mebut i dont deserve it quite im not as good and strong as all that there are heaps of times when i have felt cross and impatient and woeful and despairing it is mother and susan who have been this familys backbone but i have helped a little i believe and i am so glad and thankful  the war news has been good right along the french and americans are pushing the germans back and back and back sometimes i am afraid it is too good to lastafter nearly four years of disasters one has a feeling that this constant success is unbelievable we dont rejoice noisily over it susan keeps the flag up but we go softly the price paid has been too high for jubilation we are just thankful that it has not been paid in vain  no word has come from jem we hopebecause we dare not do anything else but there are hours when we all feelthough we never say sothat such hoping is foolishness these hours come more and more frequently as the weeks go by and we may never know that is the most terrible thought of all i wonder how faith is bearing it to judge from her letters she has never for a moment given up hope but she must have had her dark hours of doubt like the rest of us   20th august 1918  the canadians have been in action again and mr meredith had a cable today saying that carl had been slightly wounded and is in the hospital it did not say where the wound was which is unusual and we all feel worried there is news of a fresh victory every day now   30th august 1918  the merediths had a letter from carl today his wound was only a slight onebut it was in his right eye and the sight is gone for ever  one eye is enough to watch bugs with carl writes cheerfully and we know it might have been oh so much worse if it had been both eyes but i cried all the afternoon after i saw carls letter those beautiful fearless blue eyes of his  there is one comforthe will not have to go back to the front he is coming home as soon as he is out of the hospitalthe first of our boys to return when will the others come  and there is one who will never come at least we will not see him if he does but oh i think he will be therewhen our canadian soldiers return there will be a shadow army with themthe army of the fallen we will not see thembut they will be there   1st september 1918  mother and i went into charlottetown yesterday to see the moving picture hearts of the world i made an awful goose of myselffather will never stop teasing me about it for the rest of my life but it all seemed so horribly realand i was so intensely interested that i forgot everything but the scenes i saw enacted before my eyes and then quite near the last came a terribly exciting one the heroine was struggling with a horrible german soldier who was trying to drag her away i knew she had a knifei had seen her hide it to have it in readinessand i couldnt understand why she didnt produce it and finish the brute i thought she must have forgotten it and just at the tensest moment of the scene i lost my head altogether i just stood right up on my feet in that crowded house and shrieked at the top of my voicethe knife is in your stockingthe knife is in your stocking  i created a sensation  the funny part was that just as i said it the girl did snatch out the knife and stab the soldier with it  everybody in the house laughed i came to my senses and fell back in my seat overcome with mortification mother was shaking with laughter i could have shaken her why hadnt she pulled me down and choked me before i had made such an idiot of myself she protests that there wasnt time  fortunately the house was dark and i dont believe there was anybody there who knew me and i thought i was becoming sensible and selfcontrolled and womanly it is plain i have some distance to go yet before i attain that devoutly desired consummation   20th september 1918  in the east bulgaria has asked for peace and in the west the british have smashed the hindenburg line and right here in glen st mary little bruce meredith has done something that i think wonderfulwonderful because of the love behind it mrs meredith was here tonight and told us about itand mother and i cried and susan got up and clattered the things about the stove  bruce always loved jem very devotedly and the child has never forgotten him in all these years he has been as faithful in his way as dog monday was in his we have always told him that jem would come back but it seems that he was in carter flaggs store last night and he heard his uncle norman flatly declaring that jem blythe would never come back and that the ingleside folk might as well give up hoping he would bruce went home and cried himself to sleep this morning his mother saw him going out of the yard with a very sorrowful and determined look carrying his pet kitten she didnt think much more about it until later on he came in with the most tragic little face and told her his little body shaking with sobs that he had drowned stripey  why did you do that mrs meredith exclaimed  to bring jem back sobbed bruce i thought if i sacrificed stripey god would send jem back so i drownded himand oh mother it was awful hardbut surely god will send jem back now cause stripey was the dearest thing i had i just told god i would give him stripey if he would send jem back and he will wont he mother  mrs meredith didnt know what to say to the poor child she just could not tell him that perhaps his sacrifice wouldnt bring jem backthat god didnt work that way she told him that he mustnt expect it right awaythat perhaps it would be quite a long time yet before jem came back  but bruce said it oughtnt to take longern a week mother oh mother stripey was such a nice little cat he purred so pretty dont you think god ought to like him enough to let us have jem  mr meredith is worried about the effect on bruces faith in god and mrs meredith is worried about the effect on bruce himself if his hope isnt fulfilled and i feel as if i must cry every time i think of it it was so splendidand sadand beautiful the dear devoted little fellow he worshipped that kitten and if it all goes for nothingas so many sacrifices seem to go for nothinghe will be brokenhearted for he isnt old enough to understand that god doesnt answer our prayers just as we hopeand doesnt make bargains with us when we yield something we love up to him   24th september 1918  i have been kneeling at my window in the moonshine for a long time just thanking god over and over again the joy of last night and today has been so great that it seemed half painas if our hearts werent big enough to hold it  last night i was sitting here in my room at eleven oclock writing a letter to shirley every one else was in bed except father who was out i heard the telephone ring and i ran out to the hall to answer it before it should waken mother it was longdistance calling and when i answered it said this is the telegraph companys office in charlottetown there is an overseas cable for dr blythe  i thought of shirleymy heart stood stilland then i heard him saying its from holland  the message was    just arrived escaped from germany quite well writing                         james blythe  i didnt faint or fall or scream i didnt feel glad or surprised i didnt feel anything i felt numb just as i did when i heard walter had enlisted i hung up the receiver and turned round mother was standing in her doorway she wore her old rose kimono and her hair was hanging down her back in a long thick braid and her eyes were shining she looked just like a young girl  there is word from jem she said  how did she know i hadnt said a word at the phone except yesyesyes she says she doesnt know how she knew but she did know she was awake and she heard the ring and she knew that there was word from jem  hes alivehes wellhes in holland i said  mother came out into the hall and said i must get your father on the phone and tell him he is in the upper glen  she was very calm and quietnot a bit like i would have expected her to be but then i wasnt either i went and woke up gertrude and susan and told them susan said thank god firstly and secondly she said did i not tell you dog monday knew and thirdly ill go down and make a cup of teaand she stalked down in her nightdress to make it she did make itand made mother and gertrude drink itbut i went back to my room and shut my door and locked it and i knelt by my window and criedjust as gertrude did when her great news came  i think i know at last exactly what i shall feel like on the resurrection morning   4th october 1918  today jems letter came it has been in the house only six hours and it is almost read to pieces the postmistress told everybody in the glen it had come and everybody came up to hear the news  jem was badly wounded in the thighand he was picked up and taken to prison so delirious with fever that he didnt know what was happening to him or where he was it was weeks before he came to his senses and was able to write then he did writebut it never came he wasnt treated at all badly at his camponly the food was poor he had nothing to eat but a little black bread and boiled turnips and now and then a little soup with black peas in it and we sat down every one of those days to three good square luxurious meals he wrote us as often as he could but he was afraid we were not getting his letters because no reply came as soon as he was strong enough he tried to escape but was caught and brought back a month later he and a comrade made another attempt and succeeded in reaching holland  jem cant come home right away he isnt quite so well as his cable said for his wound has not healed properly and he has to go into a hospital in england for further treatment but he says he will be all right eventually and we know he is safe and will be back home sometime and oh the difference it makes in everything  i had a letter from jim anderson today too he has married an english girl got his discharge and is coming right home to canada with his bride i dont know whether to be glad or sorry it will depend on what kind of a woman she is i had a second letter also of a somewhat mysterious tenor it is from a charlottetown lawyer asking me to go in to see him at my earliest convenience in regard to a certain matter connected with the estate of the late mrs matilda pitman  i read a notice of mrs pitmans deathfrom heart failurein the enterprise a few weeks ago i wonder if this summons has anything to do with jims   5th october 1918  i went into town this morning and had an interview with mrs pitmans lawyera little thin wispy man who spoke of his late client with such a profound respect that it is evident that he as was much under her thumb as robert and amelia were he drew up a new will for her a short time before her death she was worth thirty thousand dollars the bulk of which was left to amelia chapley but she left five thousand to me in trust for jims the interest is to be used as i see fit for his education and the principal is to be paid over to him on his twentieth birthday certainly jims was born lucky i saved him from slow extinction at the hands of mrs conovermary vance saved him from death by diptheritic crouphis star saved him when he fell off the train and he tumbled not only into a clump of bracken but right into this nice little legacy  evidently as mrs matilda pitman said and as i have always believed he is no common child and he has no common destiny in store for him  at all events he is provided for and in such a fashion that jim anderson cant squander his inheritance if he wanted to now if the new english stepmother is only a good sort i shall feel quite easy about the future of my warbaby  i wonder what robert and amelia think of it i fancy they will nail down their windows when they leave home after this    chapter xxxiii  victory  a day of chilling winds and gloomy skies rilla quoted one sunday afternoonthe sixth of october to be exact it was so cold that they had lighted a fire in the livingroom and the merry little flames were doing their best to counteract the outside dourness its more like november than octobernovember is such an ugly month  cousin sophia was there having again forgiven susan and mrs martin clow who was not visiting on sunday but had dropped in to borrow susans cure for rheumatismthat being cheaper than getting one from the doctor im afeared were going to have an airly winter foreboded cousin sophia the muskrats are building awful big houses round the pond and thats a sign that never fails dear me how that child has grown cousin sophia sighed again as if it were an unhappy circumstance that a child should grow when do you expect his father  next week said rilla  well i hope the stepmother wont abuse the pore child sighed cousin sophia but i have my doubtsi have my doubts anyhow hell be sure to feel the difference between his usage here and what hell get anywhere else youve spoiled him so rilla waiting on him hand and foot the way youve always done  rilla smiled and pressed her cheek to jims curls she knew sweettempered sunny little jims was not spoiled nevertheless her heart was anxious behind her smile she too thought much about the new mrs anderson and wondered uneasily what she would be like  i cant give jims up to a woman who wont love him she thought rebelliously  i blieve its going to rain said cousin sophia we have had an awful lot of rain this fall already its going to make it awful hard for people to get their roots in it wasnt so in my young days we ginrally had beautiful octobers then but the seasons is altogether different now from what they used to be clear across cousin sophias doleful voice cut the telephone bell gertrude oliver answered it yeswhat what is it trueis it official thank youthank you  gertrude turned and faced the room dramatically her dark eyes flashing her dark face flushed with feeling all at once the sun broke through the thick clouds and poured through the big crimson maple outside the window its reflected glow enveloped her in a weird immaterial flame she looked like a priestess performing some mystic splendid rite  germany and austria are suing for peace she said  rilla went crazy for a few minutes she sprang up and danced around the room clapping her hands laughing crying  sit down child said mrs clow who never got excited over anything and so had missed a tremendous amount of trouble and delight in her journey through life  oh cried rilla i have walked the floor for hours in despair and anxiety in these past four years now let me walk in joy it was worth living long dreary years for this minute and it would be worth living them again just to look back to it susan lets run up the flagand we must phone the news to every one in the glen  can we have as much sugar as we want to now asked jims eagerly  it was a nevertobeforgotten afternoon as the news spread excited people ran about the village and dashed up to ingleside the merediths came over and stayed to supper and everybody talked and nobody listened cousin sophia tried to protest that germany and austria were not to be trusted and it was all part of a plot but nobody paid the least attention to her  this sunday makes up for that one in march said susan  i wonder said gertrude dreamily apart to rilla if things wont seem rather flat and insipid when peace really comes after being fed for four years on horrors and fears terrible reverses amazing victories wont anything less be tame and uninteresting how strangeand blessedand dull it will be not to dread the coming of the mail every day  we must dread it for a little while yet i suppose said rilla peace wont comecant comefor some weeks yet and in those weeks dreadful things may happen my excitement is over we have won the victorybut oh what a price we have paid  not too high a price for freedom said gertrude softly do you think it was rilla  no said rilla under her breath she was seeing a little white cross on a battlefield of france nonot if those of us who live will show ourselves worthy of itif we keep faith  we will keep faith said gertrude she rose suddenly a silence fell around the table and in the silence gertrude repeated walters famous poem the piper when she finished mr meredith stood up and held up his glass let us drink he said to the silent armyto the boys who followed when the piper summoned for our tomorrow they gave their todaytheirs is the victory    chapter xxxiv  mr hyde goes to his own place and susan takes a honeymoon  early in november jims left ingleside rilla saw him go with many tears but a heart free from boding mrs jim anderson number two was such a nice little woman that one was rather inclined to wonder at the luck which bestowed her on jim she was rosyfaced and blueeyed and wholesome with the roundness and trigness of a geranium leaf rilla saw at first glance that she was to be trusted with jims  im fond of children miss she said heartily im used to themive left six little brothers and sisters behind me jims is a dear child and i must say youve done wonders in bringing him up so healthy and handsome ill be as good to him as if he was my own miss and ill make jim toe the line all right hes a good workerall he needs is some one to keep him at it and to take charge of his money weve rented a little farm just out of the village and were going to settle down there jim wanted to stay in england but i says no i hankered to try a new country and ive always thought canada would suit me  im so glad you are going to live near us youll let jims come here often wont you i love him dearly  no doubt you do miss for a lovabler child i never did see we understand jim and me what youve done for him and you wont find us ungrateful he can come here whenever you want him and ill always be glad of any advice from you about his bringing up he is more your baby than anyone elses i should say and ill see that you get your fair share of him miss  so jims went awaywith the soup tureen though not in it then the news of the armistice came and even glen st mary went mad that night the village had a bonfire and burned the kaiser in effigy the fishing village boys turned out and burned all the sandhills off in one grand glorious conflagration that extended for seven miles up at ingleside rilla ran laughing to her room  now im going to do a most unladylike and inexcusable thing she said as she pulled her green velvet hat out of its box im going to kick this hat about the room until it is without form and void and i shall never as long as i live wear anything of that shade of green again  youve certainly kept your vow pluckily laughed miss oliver  it wasnt pluckit was sheer obstinacyim rather ashamed of it said rilla kicking joyously i wanted to show mother its mean to want to show your own mothermost unfilial conduct but i have shown her and ive shown myself a few things oh miss oliver just for one moment im really feeling quite young againyoung and frivolous and silly did i ever say november was an ugly month why its the most beautiful month in the whole year listen to the bells ringing in rainbow valley i never heard them so clearly theyre ringing for peaceand new happinessand all the dear sweet sane homey things that we can have again now miss oliver not that i am sane just nowi dont pretend to be the whole world is having a little crazy spell today soon well sober downand keep faithand begin to build up our new world but just for today lets be mad and glad  susan came in from the outdoor sunlight looking supremely satisfied  mr hyde is gone she announced  gone do you mean he is dead susan  no mrs dr dear that beast is not dead but you will never see him again i feel sure of that  dont be so mysterious susan what has happened to him  well mrs dr dear he was sitting out on the back steps this afternoon it was just after the news came that the armistice had been signed and he was looking his hydest i can assure you he was an awesome looking beast all at once mrs dr dear bruce meredith came around the corner of the kitchen walking on his stilts he has been learning to walk on them lately and came over to show me how well he could do it mr hyde just took a look and one bound carried him over the yard fence then he went tearing through the maple grove in great leaps with his ears laid back you never saw a creature so terrified mrs dr dear he has never returned  oh hell come back susan probably chastened in spirit by his fright  we will see mrs dr dearwe will see remember the armistice has been signed and that reminds me that whiskersonthemoon had a paralytic stroke last night i am not saying it is a judgment on him because i am not in the counsels of the almighty but one can have ones own thoughts about it neither whiskersonthemoon or mr hyde will be much more heard of in glen st mary mrs dr dear and that you may tie to  mr hyde certainly was heard of no more as it could hardly have been his fright that kept him away the ingleside folk decided that some dark fate of shot or poison had descended on himexcept susan who believed and continued to affirm that he had merely gone to his own place rilla lamented him for she had been very fond of her stately golden pussy and had liked him quite as well in his weird hyde moods as in his tame jekyll ones  and now mrs dr dear said susan since the fall housecleaning is over and the garden truck is all safe in cellar i am going to take a honeymoon to celebrate the peace  a honeymoon susan  yes mrs dr dear a honeymoon repeated susan firmly i shall never be able to get a husband but i am not going to be cheated out of everything and a honeymoon i intend to have i am going to charlottetown to visit my married brother and his family his wife has been ailing all the fall but nobody knows whether she is going to die not she never did tell anyone what she was going to do until she did it that is the main reason why she was never liked in our family but to be on the safe side i feel that i should visit her i have not been in town for over a day for twenty years and i have a feeling that i might as well see one of those moving pictures there is so much talk of so as not to be wholly out of the swim but have no fear that i shall be carried away with them mrs dr dear i shall be away a fortnight if you can spare me so long  you certainly deserve a good holiday susan better take a monththat is the proper length for a honeymoon  no mrs dr dear a fortnight is all i require besides i must be home for at least three weeks before christmas to make the proper preparations we will have a christmas that is a christmas this year mrs dr dear do you think there is any chance of our boys being home for it  no i think not susan both jem and shirley write that they dont expect to be home before springit may be even midsummer before shirley comes but carl meredith will be home and nan and di and we will have a grand celebration once more well set chairs for all susan as you did our first war christmasyes for allfor my dear lad whose chair must always be vacant as well as for the others susan  it is not likely i would forget to set his place mrs dr dear said susan wiping her eyes as she departed to pack up for her honeymoon    chapter xxxv  rillamyrilla  carl meredith and miller douglas came home just before christmas and glen st mary met them at the station with a brass band borrowed from lowbridge and speeches of home manufacture miller was brisk and beaming in spite of his wooden leg he had developed into a broadshouldered imposing looking fellow and the d c medal he wore reconciled miss cornelia to the shortcomings of his pedigree to such a degree that she tacitly recognized his engagement to mary  the latter put on a few airsespecially when carter flagg took miller into his store as head clerkbut nobody grudged them to her  of course farmings out of the question for us now she told rilla but miller thinks hell like storekeeping fine once he gets used to a quiet life again and carter flagg will be a more agreeable boss than old kitty were going to be married in the fall and live in the old mead house with the bay windows and the mansard roof ive always thought that the handsomest house in the glen but never did i dream id ever live there were only renting it of course but if things go as we expect and carter flagg takes miller into partnership well own it some day say ive got on some in society havent i considering what i come from i never aspired to being a storekeepers wife but millers real ambitious and hell have a wife thatll back him up he says he never saw a french girl worth looking at twice and that his heart beat true to me every moment he was away  jerry meredith and joe milgrave came back in january and all winter the boys from the glen and its environs came home by twos and threes none of them came back just as they went away not even those who had been so fortunate as to escape injury  one spring day when the daffodils were blowing on the ingleside lawn and the banks of the brook in rainbow valley were sweet with white and purple violets the little lazy afternoon accommodation train pulled into the glen station it was very seldom that passengers for the glen came by that train so nobody was there to meet it except the new station agent and a small blackandyellow dog who for four and a half years had met every train that had steamed into glen st mary thousands of trains had dog monday met and never had the boy he waited and watched for returned yet still dog monday watched on with eyes that never quite lost hope perhaps his dogheart failed him at times he was growing old and rheumatic when he walked back to his kennel after each train had gone his gait was very sober nowhe never trotted but went slowly with a drooping head and a depressed tail that had quite lost its old saucy uplift  one passenger stepped off the traina tall fellow in a faded lieutenants uniform who walked with a barely perceptible limp he had a bronzed face and there were some grey hairs in the ruddy curls that clustered around his forehead the new station agent looked at him anxiously he was used to seeing the khakiclad figures come off the train some met by a tumultuous crowd others who had sent no word of their coming stepping off quietly like this one but there was a certain distinction of bearing and features in this soldier that caught his attention and made him wonder a little more interestedly who he was  a blackandyellow streak shot past the station agent dog monday stiff dog monday rheumatic dog monday old never believe it dog monday was a young pup gone clean mad with rejuvenating joy  he flung himself against the tall soldier with a bark that choked in his throat from sheer rapture he flung himself on the ground and writhed in a frenzy of welcome he tried to climb the soldiers khaki legs and slipped down and groveled in an ecstasy that seemed as if it must tear his little body in pieces he licked his boots and when the lieutenant had with laughter on his lips and tears in his eyes succeeded in gathering the little creature up in his arms dog monday laid his head on the khaki shoulder and licked the sunburned neck making queer sounds between barks and sobs  the station agent had heard the story of dog monday he knew now who the returned soldier was dog mondays long vigil was ended jem blythe had come home  we are all very happyand sadand thankful wrote rilla in her diary a week later though susan has not yet recoverednever will recover i believefrom the shock of having jem come home the very night she had owing to a strenuous day prepared a pick up supper i shall never forget the sight of her tearing madly about from pantry to cellar hunting out stored away goodies just as if anybody cared what was on the tablenone of us could eat anyway it was meat and drink just to look at jem mother seemed afraid to take her eyes off him lest he vanish out of her sight it is wonderful to have jem backand little dog monday monday refuses to be separated from jem for a moment he sleeps on the foot of his bed and squats beside him at mealtimes and on sunday he went to church with him and insisted on going right into our pew where he went to sleep on jems feet in the middle of the sermon he woke up and seemed to think he must welcome jem all over again for he bounded up with a series of barks and wouldnt quiet down until jem took him up in his arms but nobody seemed to mind and mr meredith came and patted his head after the service and said faith and affection and loyalty are precious things wherever they are found that little dogs love is a treasure jem  one night when jem and i were talking things over in rainbow valley i asked him if he had ever felt afraid at the front  jem laughed  afraid i was afraid scores of timessick with feari who used to laugh at walter when he was frightened do you know walter was never frightened after he got to the front realities never scared himonly his imagination could do that his colonel told me that walter was the bravest man in the regiment rilla i never realized that walter was dead till i came back home you dont know how i miss him nowyou folks here have got used to it in a sensebut its all fresh to me walter and i grew up togetherwe were chums as well as brothersand now here in this old valley we loved when we were children it has come home to me that im not to see him again  jem is going back to college in the fall and so are jerry and carl i suppose shirley will too he expects to be home in july nan and di will go on teaching faith doesnt expect to be home before september i suppose she will teach then too for she and jem cant be married until he gets through his course in medicine una meredith has decided i think to take a course in household science at kingsportand gertrude is to be married to her major and is frankly happy about itshamelessly happy she says but i think her attitude is very beautiful they are all talking of their plans and hopesmore soberly than they used to do long ago but still with interest and a determination to carry on and make good in spite of lost years  were in a new world jem says and weve got to make it a better one than the old that isnt done yet though some folks seem to think it ought to be the job isnt finishedit isnt really begun the old world is destroyed and we must build up the new one it will be the task of years ive seen enough of war to realize that weve got to make a world where wars cant happen weve given prussianism its mortal wound but it isnt dead yet and it isnt confined to germany either it isnt enough to drive out the old spiritweve got to bring in the new  im writing down those words of jems in my diary so that i can read them over occasionally and get courage from them when moods come when i find it not so easy to keep faith  rilla closed her journal with a little sigh just then she was not finding it easy to keep faith all the rest seemed to have some special aim or ambition about which to build up their livesshe had none and she was very lonely horribly lonely jem had come backbut he was not the laughing boybrother who had gone away in 1914 and he belonged to faith walter would never come back she had not even jims left all at once her world seemed wide and emptythat is it had seemed wide and empty from the moment yesterday when she had read in a montreal paper a fortnightold list of returned soldiers in which was the name of captain kenneth ford  so ken was homeand he had not even written her that he was coming he had been in canada two weeks and she had not had a line from him of course he had forgottenif there was ever anything to forgeta handclaspa kissa looka promise asked under the influence of a passing emotion it was all absurdshe had been a silly romantic inexperienced goose well she would be wiser in the futurevery wiseand very discreetand very contemptuous of men and their ways  i suppose id better go with una and take up household science too she thought as she stood by her window and looked down through a delicate emerald tangle of young vines on rainbow valley lying in a wonderful lilac light of sunset there did not seem anything very attractive just then about household science but with a whole new world waiting to be built a girl must do something  the door bell rang rilla turned reluctantly stairwards she must answer itthere was no one else in the house but she hated the idea of callers just then she went downstairs slowly and opened the front door  a man in khaki was standing on the stepsa tall fellow with dark eyes and hair and a narrow white scar running across his brown cheek rilla stared at him foolishly for a moment who was it  she ought to know himthere was certainly something very familiar about himrillamyrilla he said  ken gasped rilla of course it was kenbut he looked so much olderhe was so much changedthat scarthe lines about his eyes and lipsher thoughts went whirling helplessly  ken took the uncertain hand she held out and looked at her the slim rilla of four years ago had rounded out into symmetry he had left a school girl and he found a womana woman with wonderful eyes and a dented lip and rosebloom cheeka woman altogether beautiful and desirablethe woman of his dreams  is it rillamyrilla he asked meaningly  emotion shook rilla from head to foot joyhappinesssorrowfearevery passion that had wrung her heart in those four long years seemed to surge up in her soul for a moment as the deeps of being were stirred she had tried to speak at first voice would not come thenyeth said rilla
