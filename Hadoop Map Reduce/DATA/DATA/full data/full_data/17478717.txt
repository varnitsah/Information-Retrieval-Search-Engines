17478717	ships company  by ww jacobs    illustration can i ave it took off while i eat my bloater mother   fine feathers   mr jobson awoke with a sundayish feeling probably due to the fact that it was bank holiday  he had been aware in a dim fashion of the rising of mrs jobson some time before and in a semiconscious condition had taken over a large slice of unoccupied territory  he stretched himself and yawned and then by an effort of will threw off the clothes and springing out of bed reached for his trousers  he was an orderly man and had hung them every night for over twenty years on the brass knob on his side of the bed  he had hung them there the night before and now they had absconded with a pair of red braces just entering their teens  instead on a chair at the foot of the bed was a collection of garments that made him shudder  with trembling fingers he turned over a black tailcoat a white waistcoat and a pair of light check trousers  a white shirt a collar and tie kept them company and greatest outrage of all a tall silk hat stood on its own bandbox beside the chair  mr jobson fingering his bristly chin stood regarding the collection with a wan smile  so thats their little game is it  he muttered  want to make a toff of me  wheres my clothes got to i wonder  a hasty search satisfied him that they were not in the room and pausing only to drape himself in the counterpane he made his way into the next he passed on to the others and then with a growing sense of alarm stole softly downstairs and making his way to the shop continued the search  with the shutters up the place was almost in darkness and in spite of his utmost care apples and potatoes rolled on to the floor and travelled across it in a succession of bumps  then a sudden turn brought the scales clattering down  good gracious alf  said a voice  whatever are you adoing of  mr jobson turned and eyed his wife who was standing at the door  im looking for my clothes mother he replied briefly  clothes  said mrs jobson with an obvious attempt at unconcerned speech  clothes  why theyre on the chair  i mean clothes fit for a christian to wearfit for a greengrocer to wear said mr jobson raising his voice  it was a little surprise for you dear said his wife  me and bert and gladys and dorothy ave all been saving up for it for ever so long  its very kind of you all said mr jobson feeblyvery but  theyve all been doing without things themselves to do it interjected his wife  as for gladys im sure nobody knows what shes given up  well if nobody knows it dont matter said mr jobson  as i was saying its very kind of you all but i cant wear em  wheres my others  mrs jobson hesitated  wheres my others  repeated her husband  theyre being took care of replied his wife with spirit  aunt emmas minding em for youand you know what she is  hsh  alf  alf im surprised at you  mr jobson coughed  its the collar mother he said at last  i aint wore a collar for over twenty years not since we was walking out together  and then i didnt like it  more shame for you said his wife  im sure theres no other respectable tradesman goes about with a handkerchief knotted round his neck  praps their skins aint as tender as what mine is urged mr jobson and besides fancy me in a topat  why i shall be the laughingstock of the place  nonsense  said his wife  its only the lower classes what would laugh and nobody minds what they think  mr jobson sighed  well i shall ave to go back to bed again then he said ruefully  so long mother  hope you have a pleasant time at the palace  he took a reef in the counterpane and with a fair amount of dignity considering his appearance stalked upstairs again and stood gloomily considering affairs in his bedroom  ever since gladys and dorothy had been big enough to be objects of interest to the young men of the neighbourhood the clothes nuisance had been rampant  he peeped through the windowblind at the bright sunshine outside and then looked back at the tumbled bed  a murmur of voices downstairs apprised him that the conspirators were awaiting the result  he dressed at last and stood like a lamba redfaced bullnecked lamb while mrs jobson fastened his collar for him  bert wanted to get a taller one she remarked but i said this would do to begin with  wanted it to come over my mouth i spose said the unfortunate mr jobson  well ave it your own way  dont mind about me  what with the trousers and the collar i couldnt pick up a sovereign if i saw one in front of me  if you see one ill pick it up for you said his wife taking up the hat and moving towards the door  come along  mr jobson with his arms standing out stiffly from his sides and his head painfully erect followed her downstairs and a sudden hush as he entered the kitchen testified to the effect produced by his appearance it was followed by a hum of admiration that sent the blood flying to his head  why he couldnt have done it before i dont know said the dutiful gladys  why there aint a man in the street looks a quarter as smart  fits him like a glove  said dorothy walking round him  just the right length said bert scrutinizing the coat  and he stands as straight as a soldier said gladys clasping her hands gleefully  collar said mr jobson briefly  can i ave it took off while i eat my bloater mother  dont be silly alf said his wife  gladys pour your father out a nice strong pot cup o tea and dont forget that the train starts at ha past ten  itll start all right when it sees me observed mr jobson squinting down at his trousers  mother and children delighted with the success of their scheme laughed applause and mr jobson somewhat gratified at the success of his retort sat down and attacked his breakfast  a short clay pipe smoked as a digestive was impounded by the watchful mrs jobson the moment he had finished it  hed smoke it along the street if i didnt she declared  and why not  demanded her husbandalways do  not in a topat said mrs jobson shaking her head at him  or a tailcoat said dorothy  one would spoil the other said gladys  i wish something would spoil the hat said mr jobson wistfully its no good i must smoke mother  mrs jobson smiled and going to the cupboard produced with a smile of triumph an envelope containing seven dangerouslooking cigars  mr jobson whistled and taking one up examined it carefully  what do they call em mother  he inquired  the cut and try again smokes  mrs jobson smiled vaguely  me and the girls are going upstairs to get ready now she said  keep your eye on him bert  father and son grinned at each other and to pass the time took a cigar apiece  they had just finished them when a swish and rustle of skirts sounded from the stairs and mrs jobson and the girls beautifully attired entered the room and stood buttoning their gloves  a strong smell of scent fought with the aroma of the cigars  you get round me like so as to hide me a bit entreated mr jobson as they quitted the house  i dont mind so much when we get out of our street  mrs jobson laughed his fears to scorn  well cross the road then said mr jobson urgently  theres bill foley standing at his door  his wife sniffed  let him stand she said haughtily  mr foley failed to avail himself of the permission  he regarded mr jobson with dilated eyeballs and as the party approached sank slowly into a sitting position on his doorstep and as the door opened behind him rolled slowly over onto his back and presented an enormous pair of hobnailed soles to the gaze of an interested world  i told you ow it would be said the blushing mr jobson  you know what bills like as well as i do  his wife tossed her head and they all quickened their pace  the voice of the ingenious mr foley calling piteously for his mother pursued them to the end of the road  i knew what it ud be said mr jobson wiping his hot face  bill will never let me ear the end of this  nonsense  said his wife bridling  do you mean to tell me youve got to ask bill foley ow youre to dress  hell soon get tired of it and besides its just as well to let him see who you are  theres not many tradesmen as would lower themselves by mixing with a plasterer  mr jobson scratched his ear but wisely refrained from speech  once clear of his own district mental agitation subsided but bodily discomfort increased at every step  the hat and the collar bothered him most but every article of attire contributed its share  his uneasiness was so manifest that mrs jobson after a little womanly sympathy suggested that besides sundays it might be as well to wear them occasionally of an evening in order to get used to them  what ave i got to wear them every sunday  demanded the unfortunate blankly why i thought they was only for bank holidays  mrs jobson told him not to be silly  straight i did said her husband earnestly  youve no idea ow im suffering ive got a headache im arf choked and theres a feeling about my waist as though im being cuddled by somebody i dont like  mrs jobson said it would soon wear off and seated in the train that bore them to the crystal palace put the hat on the rack  her husbands attempt to leave it in the train was easily frustrated and his explanation that he had forgotten all about it received in silence  it was evident that he would require watching and under the clear gaze of his children he seldom had a button undone for more than three minutes at a time  the day was hot and he perspired profusely  his collar lost its starch a thing to be grateful forand for the greater part of the day he wore his tie under the left ear  by the time they had arrived home again he was in a state of open mutiny  never again he said loudly as he tore the collar off and hung his coat on a chair  there was a chorus of lamentation but he remained firm  dorothy began to sniff ominously and gladys spoke longingly of the fathers possessed by other girls  it was not until mrs jobson sat eyeing her supper instead of eating it that he began to temporize  he gave way bit by bit garment by garment  when he gave way at last on the great hat question his wife took up her knife and fork  his workaday clothes appeared in his bedroom next morning but the others still remained in the clutches of aunt emma  the suit provided was of considerable antiquity and at closing time mr jobson after some hesitation donned his new clothes and with a sheepish glance at his wife went out mrs jobson nodded delight at her daughters  hes coming round she whispered  he liked that ticketcollector calling him sir yesterday  i noticed it  hes put on everything but the topper  dont say nothing about it take it as a matter of course  it became evident as the days wore on that she was right  bit by bit she obtained the other clotheswith some difficultyfrom aunt emma but her husband still wore his best on sundays and sometimes of an evening and twice on going into the bedroom suddenly she had caught him surveying himself at different angles in the glass  and moreover he had spoken with some heatfor such a goodtempered manon the shortcomings of dorothys laundry work  wed better put your collars out said his wife  and the shirts said mr jobson  nothing looks worse than a bad gotup cuff  youre getting quite dressy said his wife with a laugh  mr jobson eyed her seriously  no mother no he replied  all ive done is to find out that youre right as you always ave been  a man in my persition has got no right to dress as if he kept a stall on the kerb  it aint fair to the gals or to young bert  i dont want em to be ashamed of their father  they wouldnt be that said mrs jobson  im trying to improve said her husband  o course its no use dressing up and behaving wrong and yesterday i bought a book what tells you all about behaviour  well done  said the delighted mrs jobson  mr jobson was glad to find that her opinion on his purchase was shared by the rest of the family  encouraged by their approval he told them of the benefit he was deriving from it and at teatime that day after a little hesitation ventured to affirm that it was a book that might do them all good  hear hear  said gladys  for one thing said mr jobson slowly i didnt know before that it was wrong to blow your tea and as for drinking it out of a saucer the book says its a thing that is only done by the lower orders  if youre in a hurry  demanded mr bert jobson pausing with his saucer half way to his mouth  if youre in anything responded his father  a gentleman would rather go without his tea than drink it out of a saucer  thats the sort o thing bill foley would do  mr bert jobson drained his saucer thoughtfully  picking your teeth with your finger is wrong too said mr jobson taking a breath  food should be removed in aaunundemonstrative fashion with the tip of the tongue  i wasnt said gladys  a knife pursued her fathera knife should never in any circumstances be allowed near the mouth  youve made mother cut herself said gladys sharply thats what youve done  i thought it was my fork said mrs jobson  i was so busy listening i wasnt thinking what i was doing  silly of me  we shall all do better in time said mr jobson  but what i want to know is what about the gravy  you cant eat it with a fork and it dont say nothing about a spoon  oh and what about our cold tubs mother  cold tubs  repeated his wife staring at him  what cold tubs  the cold tubs me and bert ought to ave said mr jobson  it says in the book that an englishman would just as soon think of going without his breakfus as his cold tub and you know how fond i am of my breakfus  and what about me and the gals  said the amazed mrs jobson  dont you worry about me ma said gladys hastily  the book dont say nothing about gals it says englishmen said mr jobson  but we aint got a bathroom said his son  it dont signify said mr jobson  a washtubll do  me and bertll ave a washtub each brought up overnight and itll be exercise for the gals bringing the water up of a morning to us  well i dont know im sure said the bewildered mrs jobson anyway you and bertll ave to carry the tubs up and down  messy i call it  its got to be done mother said mr jobson cheerfully  its only the lower orders what dont ave their cold tub reglar  the book says so  he trundled the tub upstairs the same night and after his wife had gone downstairs next morning opened the door and took in the can and pail that stood outside  he poured the contents into the tub and after eyeing it thoughtfully for some time agitated the surface with his right foot  he dipped and dried that much enduring member some ten times and after regarding the damp condition of the towels with great satisfaction dressed himself and went downstairs  im all of a glow he said seating himself at the table  i believe i could eat a elephant  i feel as fresh as a daisy dont you bert  mr jobson junior who had just come in from the shop remarked shortly that he felt more like a blooming snowdrop  and somebody slopped a lot of water over the stairs carrying it up said mrs jobson  i dont believe as everybody has cold baths of a morning  it dont seem wholesome to me  mr jobson took a book from his pocket and opening it at a certain page handed it over to her  if im going to do the thing at all i must do it properly he said gravely  i dont suppose bill foley ever ad a cold tub in his life he dont know no better  gladys  halloa  said that young lady with a start  are youare you eating that kipper with your fingers  gladys turned and eyed her mother appealingly  pagepage one hundred and something i think it is said her father with his mouth full  manners at the dinner table its near the end of the book i know  if i never do no worse than that i shant come to no harm said his daughter  mr jobson shook his head at her and after eating his breakfast with great care wiped his mouth on his handkerchief and went into the shop  i suppose its all right said mrs jobson looking after him but hes taking it very seriousvery  he washed his hands five times yesterday morning said dorothy who had just come in from the shop to her breakfast and kept customers waiting while he did it too  its the coldtub business i cant get over said her mother  im sure its more trouble to empty them than what it is to fill them theres quite enough work in the ouse as it is  too much said bert with unwonted consideration  i wish hed leave me alone said gladys  my food dont do me no good when hes watching every mouthful i eat  of murmurings such as these mr jobson heard nothing and in view of the great improvement in his dress and manners a strong resolution was passed to avoid the faintest appearance of discontent  even when satisfied with his own appearance he set to work to improve that of mrs jobson that admirable woman made no complaint  hitherto the brightness of her attire and the size of her hats had been held to atone for her lack of figure and the roomy comfort of her boots but mr jobson infected with new ideas refused to listen to such sophistry  he went shopping with dorothy and the sunday after when mrs jobson went for an airing with him she walked in boots with heels two inches high and toes that ended in a point  a waist that had disappeared some years before was recaptured and placed in durance vile and a hat which called for a new style of hairdressing completed the effect  you look splendid ma  said gladys as she watched their departure splendid  i dont feel splendid sighed mrs jobson to her husband  these ere boots feel redot  your usual size said mr jobson looking across the road  and the clothes seem just a teenyweeny bit tight praps continued his wife  mr jobson regarded her critically  praps they might have been let out a quarter of an inch he said thoughtfully  theyre the best fit youve ad for a long time mother  i only ope the galsll ave such good figgers  his wife smiled faintly but with little breath for conversation walked on for some time in silence  a growing redness of face testified to her distress  ii feel awful she said at last pressing her hand to her side awful  youll soon get used to it said mr jobson gently  look at me  i felt like you do at first and now i wouldnt go back to old clothesand comfortfor anything  youll get to love them boots  if i could only take em off i should love em better said his wife panting and i cant breathe properlyi cant breathe  you look ripping mother said her husband simply  his wife essayed another smile but failed  she set her lips together and plodded on mr jobson chatting cheerily and taking no notice of the fact that she kept lurching against him  two miles from home she stopped and eyed him fixedly  if i dont get these boots off alf i shall be a elpless cripple for the rest of my days she murmured  my ankles gone over three times  but you cant take em off here said mr jobson hastily  think ow it would look  i must ave a cab or something said his wife hysterically  if i dont get em off soon i shall scream  she leaned against the iron palings of a house for support while mr jobson standing on the kerb looked up and down the road for a cab  a fourwheeler appeared just in time to prevent the scandalof mrs jobson removing her boots in the street  thank goodness she gasped as she climbed in  never mind about untying em alf cut the laces and get em off quick  they drove home with the boots standing side by side on the seat in front of them  mr jobson got out first and knocked at the door and as soon as it opened mrs jobson pattered across the intervening space with the boots dangling from her hand  she had nearly reached the door when mr foley who had a diabolical habit of always being on hand when he was least wanted appeared suddenly from the offside of the cab  been paddlin  he inquired  mrs jobson safe in her doorway drew herself up and holding the boots behind her surveyed him with a stare of highbred disdain  been paddlin  he inquired  i see you going down the road in em said the unabashed mr foley and i says to myself i says pridell bear a pinch but shes going too far  if she thinks that she can squeedge those little tootsywootsies of ers into them boo  the door slammed violently and left him exchanging grins with mr jobson  hows the at  he inquired  mr jobson winked  bet you a level arfdollar i aint wearing it next sunday he said in a hoarse whisper  mr foley edged away  not good enough he said shaking his head  ive had a good many bets with you first and last alf but i cant remember as i ever won one yet so long
