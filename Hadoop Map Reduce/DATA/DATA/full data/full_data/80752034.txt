80752034	you never can tell  by george bernard shaw     act i  in a dentists operating room on a fine august morning in 1896  not the usual tiny london den but the best sitting room of a furnished lodging in a terrace on the sea front at a fashionable watering place the operating chair with a gas pump and cylinder beside it is half way between the centre of the room and one of the corners  if you look into the room through the window which lights it you will see the fireplace in the middle of the wall opposite you with the door beside it to your left an mrcs diploma in a frame hung on the chimneypiece an easy chair covered in black leather on the hearth a neat stool and bench with vice tools and a mortar and pestle in the corner to the right near this bench stands a slender machine like a whip provided with a stand a pedal and an exaggerated winch recognising this as a dental drill you shudder and look away to your left where you can see another window underneath which stands a writing table with a blotter and a diary on it and a chair next the writing table towards the door is a leather covered sofa the opposite wall close on your right is occupied mostly by a bookcase the operating chair is under your nose facing you with the cabinet of instruments handy to it on your left you observe that the professional furniture and apparatus are new and that the wall paper designed with the taste of an undertaker in festoons and urns the carpet with its symmetrical plans of rich cabbagy nosegays the glass gasalier with lustres the ornamental gilt rimmed blue candlesticks on the ends of the mantelshelf also glass draped with lustres and the ormolu clock under a glasscover in the middle between them its uselessness emphasized by a cheap american clock disrespectfully placed beside it and now indicating 12 oclock noon all combine with the black marble which gives the fireplace the air of a miniature family vault to suggest early victorian commercial respectability belief in money bible fetichism fear of hell always at war with fear of poverty instinctive horror of the passionate character of art love and roman catholic religion and all the first fruits of plutocracy in the early generations of the industrial revolution  there is no shadow of this on the two persons who are occupying the room just now  one of them a very pretty woman in miniature her tiny figure dressed with the daintiest gaiety is of a later generation being hardly eighteen yet  this darling little creature clearly does not belong to the room or even to the country for her complexion though very delicate has been burnt biscuit color by some warmer sun than englands and yet there is for a very subtle observer a link between them  for she has a glass of water in her hand and a rapidly clearing cloud of spartan obstinacy on her tiny firm set mouth and quaintly squared eyebrows if the least line of conscience could be traced between those eyebrows an evangelical might cherish some faint hope of finding her a sheep in wolfs clothing  for her frock is recklessly pretty  but as the cloud vanishes it leaves her frontal sinus as smoothly free from conviction of sin as a kittens  the dentist contemplating her with the selfsatisfaction of a successful operator is a young man of thirty or thereabouts he does not give the impression of being much of a workman his professional manner evidently strikes him as being a joke and is underlain by a thoughtless pleasantry which betrays the young gentleman still unsettled and in search of amusing adventures behind the newly setup dentist in search of patients he is not without gravity of demeanor but the strained nostrils stamp it as the gravity of the humorist his eyes are clear alert of sceptically moderate size and yet a little rash his forehead is an excellent one with plenty of room behind it his nose and chin cavalierly handsome on the whole an attractive noticeable beginner of whose prospects a man of business might form a tolerably favorable estimate  the young lady handing him the glass thank you in spite of the biscuit complexion she has not the slightest foreign accent  the dentist putting it down on the ledge of his cabinet of instruments that was my first tooth  the young lady aghast your first do you mean to say that you began practising on me  the dentist  every dentist has to begin on somebody  the young lady  yes somebody in a hospital not people who pay  the dentist laughing  oh the hospital doesnt count i only meant my first tooth in private practice  why didnt you let me give you gas  the young lady  because you said it would be five shillings extra  the dentist shocked  oh dont say that  it makes me feel as if i had hurt you for the sake of five shillings  the young lady with cool insolence  well so you have she gets up why shouldnt you its your business to hurt people it amuses him to be treated in this fashion he chuckles secretly as he proceeds to clean and replace his instruments  she shakes her dress into order looks inquisitively about her and goes to the window you have a good view of the sea from these rooms  are they expensive  the dentist  yes  the young lady  you dont own the whole house do you  the dentist  no  the young lady taking the chair which stands at the writingtable and looking critically at it as she spins it round on one leg  your furniture isnt quite the latest thing is it  the dentist  its my landlords  the young lady  does he own that nice comfortable bath chair pointing to the operating chair  the dentist  no i have that on the hirepurchase system  the young lady disparagingly  i thought so looking about her again in search of further conclusions i suppose you havent been here long  the dentist  six weeks  is there anything else you would like to know  the young lady the hint quite lost on her  any family  the dentist  i am not married  the young lady  of course not anybody can see that  i meant sisters and mother and that sort of thing  the dentist  not on the premises  the young lady  hm  if youve been here six weeks and mine was your first tooth the practice cant be very large can it  the dentist  not as yet he shuts the cabinet having tidied up everything  the young lady  well good luck she takes our her purse five shillings you said it would be  the dentist  five shillings  the young lady producing a crown piece  do you charge five shillings for everything  the dentist  yes  the young lady  why  the dentist  its my system im whats called a five shilling dentist  the young lady  how nice well here holding up the crown piece a nice new five shilling piece your first fee  make a hole in it with the thing you drill peoples teeth with and wear it on your watchchain  the dentist  thank you  the parlor maid appearing at the door  the young ladys brother sir  a handsome man in miniature obviously the young ladys twin comes in eagerly he wears a suit of terracotta cashmere the elegantly cut frock coat lined in brown silk and carries in his hand a brown tall hat and tan gloves to match he has his sisters delicate biscuit complexion and is built on the same small scale but he is elastic and strong in muscle decisive in movement unexpectedly deeptoned and trenchant in speech and with perfect manners and a finished personal style which might be envied by a man twice his age suavity and self possession are points of honor with him and though this rightly considered is only the modern mode of boyish selfconsciousness its effect is none the less staggering to his elders and would be insufferable in a less prepossessing youth he is promptitude itself and has a question ready the moment he enters  the young gentleman  am i on time  the young lady  no its all over  the young gentleman  did you howl  the young lady  oh something awful  mr valentine this is my brother phil  phil this is mr valentine our new dentist  valentine and phil bow to one another  she proceeds all in one breath  hes only been here six weeks and hes a bachelor  the house isnt his and the furniture is the landlords but the professional plant is hired he got my tooth out beautifully at the first go and he and i are great friends  philip  been asking a lot of questions  the young lady as if incapable of doing such a thing  oh no  philip  glad to hear it  to valentine  so good of you not to mind us mr valentine  the fact is weve never been in england before and our mother tells us that the people here simply wont stand us  come and lunch with us  valentine bewildered by the leaps and bounds with which their acquaintanceship is proceeding gasps but he has no opportunity of speaking as the conversation of the twins is swift and continuous  the young lady  oh do mr valentine  philip  at the marine hotel  half past one  the young lady  we shall be able to tell mamma that a respectable englishman has promised to lunch with us  philip  say no more mr valentine youll come  valentine  say no more  i havent said anything  may i ask whom i have the pleasure of entertaining  its really quite impossible for me to lunch at the marine hotel with two perfect strangers  the young lady flippantly  ooooh what bosh  one patient in six weeks  what difference does it make to you  philip maturely  no dolly my knowledge of human nature confirms mr valentines judgment  he is right  let me introduce miss dorothy clandon commonly called dolly  valentine bows to dolly  she nods to him  im philip clandon  were from madeira but perfectly respectable so far  valentine  clandon  are you related to   dolly unexpectedly crying out in despair  yes we are  valentine astonished  i beg your pardon  dolly  oh we are we are  its all over phil they know all about us in england  to valentine  oh you cant think how maddening it is to be related to a celebrated person and never be valued anywhere for our own sakes  valentine  but excuse me the gentleman i was thinking of is not celebrated  dolly staring at him  gentleman  phil is also puzzled  valentine  yes  i was going to ask whether you were by any chance a daughter of mr densmore clandon of newbury hall  dolly vacantly  no  philip  well come dolly how do you know youre not  dolly cheered  oh i forgot  of course  perhaps i am  valentine  dont you know  philip  not in the least  dolly  its a wise child   philip cutting her short  sh  valentine starts nervously for the sound made by philip though but momentary is like cutting a sheet of silk in two with a flash of lightning  it is the result of long practice in checking dollys indiscretions  the fact is mr valentine we are the children of the celebrated mrs lanfrey clandon an authoress of great repute  in madeira  no household is complete without her works  we came to england to get away from them  the are called the twentieth century treatises  dolly   twentieth century cooking  philip  twentieth century creeds  dolly   twentieth century clothing  philip  twentieth century conduct  dolly   twentieth century children  philip  twentieth century parents  dolly   cloth limp half a dollar  philip  or mounted on linen for hard family use two dollars  no family should be without them  read them mr valentine theyll improve your mind  dolly  but not till weve gone please  philip  quite so we prefer people with unimproved minds  our own minds are in that fresh and unspoiled condition  valentine dubiously  hm  dolly echoing him inquiringly  hm  phil he prefers people whose minds are improved  philip  in that case we shall have to introduce him to the other member of the family the woman of the twentieth century our sister gloria  dolly dithyrambically  natures masterpiece  philip  learnings daughter  dolly  madeiras pride  philip  beautys paragon  dolly suddenly descending to prose bosh  no complexion  valentine desperately  may i have a word  philip politely  excuse us  go ahead  dolly very nicely  so sorry  valentine attempting to take them paternally  i really must give a hint to you young people  dolly breaking out again  oh come i like that  how old are you  philip  over thirty  dolly  hes not  philip confidently  he is  dolly emphatically  twentyseven  philip imperturbably  thirtythree  dolly  stuff  philip to valentine  i appeal to you mr valentine  valentine remonstrating  well reallyresigning himself thirtyone  philip to dolly  you were wrong  dolly  so were you  philip suddenly conscientious  were forgetting our manners dolly  dolly remorseful  yes so we are  philip apologetic  we interrupted you mr valentine  dolly  you were going to improve our minds i think  valentine  the fact is your  philip anticipating him  our appearance  dolly  our manners  valentine ad misericordiam  oh do let me speak  dolly  the old story  we talk too much  philip  we do  shut up both  he seats himself on the arm of the opposing chair  dolly  mum  she sits down in the writingtable chair and closes her lips tight with the tips of her fingers  valentine  thank you  he brings the stool from the bench in the corner places it between them and sits down with a judicial air  they attend to him with extreme gravity  he addresses himself first to dolly  now may i ask to begin with have you ever been in an english seaside resort before  she shakes her head slowly and solemnly  he turns to phil who shakes his head quickly and expressively  i thought so  well mr clandon our acquaintance has been short but it has been voluble and i have gathered enough to convince me that you are neither of you capable of conceiving what life in an english seaside resort is believe me its not a question of manners and appearance  in those respects we enjoy a freedom unknown in madeira  dolly shakes her head vehemently  oh yes i assure you  lord de crescis sister bicycles in knickerbockers and the rectors wife advocates dress reform and wears hygienic boots  dolly furtively looks at her own shoe valentine catches her in the act and deftly adds  no thats not the sort of boot i mean dollys shoe vanishes  we dont bother much about dress and manners in england because as a nation we dont dress well and weve no manners  but  and now will you excuse my frankness  they nod  thank you  well in a seaside resort theres one thing you must have before anybody can afford to be seen going about with you and thats a father alive or dead  he looks at them alternately with emphasis  they meet his gaze like martyrs  am i to infer that you have omitted that indispensable part of your social equipment  they confirm him by melancholy nods  them im sorry to say that if you are going to stay here for any length of time it will be impossible for me to accept your kind invitation to lunch  he rises with an air of finality and replaces the stool by the bench  philip rising with grave politeness  come dolly  he gives her his arm  dolly  good morning  they go together to the door with perfect dignity  valentine overwhelmed with remorse  oh stop stop  they halt and turn arm in arm  you make me feel a perfect beast  dolly  thats your conscience not us  valentine energetically throwing off all pretence of a professional manner  my conscience  my conscience has been my ruin  listen to me twice before i have set up as a respectable medical practitioner in various parts of england  on both occasions i acted conscientiously and told my patients the brute truth instead of what they wanted to be told  result ruin  now ive set up as a dentist a five shilling dentist and ive done with conscience forever  this is my last chance i spent my last sovereign on moving in and i havent paid a shilling of rent yet  im eating and drinking on credit my landlord is as rich as a jew and as hard as nails and ive made five shillings in six weeks if i swerve by a hairs breadth from the straight line of the most rigid respectability im done for  under such a circumstance is it fair to ask me to lunch with you when you dont know your own father  dolly  after all our grandfather is a canon of lincoln cathedral  valentine like a castaway mariner who sees a sail on the horizon what  have you a grandfather  dolly  only one  valentine  my dear good young friends why on earth didnt you tell me that before  a cannon of lincoln  that makes it all right of course  just excuse me while i change my coat  he reaches the door in a bound and vanishes  dolly and phil stare after him and then stare at one another  missing their audience they droop and become commonplace at once  philip throwing away dollys arm and coming illhumoredly towards the operating chair  that wretched bankrupt ivory snatcher makes a compliment of allowing us to stand him a lunch  probably the first square meal he has had for months  he gives the chair a kick as if it were valentine  dolly  its too beastly  i wont stand it any longer phil  here in england everybody asks whether you have a father the very first thing  philip  i wont stand it either  mamma must tell us who he was  dolly  or who he is  he may be alive  philip  i hope not  no man alive shall father me  dolly  he might have a lot of money though  philip  i doubt it  my knowledge of human nature leads me to believe that if he had a lot of money he wouldnt have got rid of his affectionate family so easily  anyhow lets look at the bright side of things  depend on it hes dead  he goes to the hearth and stands with his back to the fireplace spreading himself  the parlor maid appears  the twins under observation instantly shine out again with their former brilliancy  the parlor maid  two ladies for you miss  your mother and sister miss i think  mrs clandon and gloria come in  mrs clandon is between forty and fifty with a slight tendency to soft sedentary fat and a fair remainder of good looks none the worse preserved because she has evidently followed the old tribal matronly fashion of making no pretension in that direction after her marriage and might almost be suspected of wearing a cap at home  she carries herself artificially well as women were taught to do as a part of good manners by dancing masters and reclining boards before these were superseded by the modern artistic cult of beauty and health  her hair a flaxen hazel fading into white is crimped and parted in the middle with the ends plaited and made into a knot from which observant people of a certain age infer that mrs clandon had sufficient individuality and good taste to stand out resolutely against the now forgotten chignon in her girlhood  in short she is distinctly old fashioned for her age in dress and manners but she belongs to the forefront of her own period say 186080 in a jealously assertive attitude of character and intellect and in being a woman of cultivated interests rather than passionately developed personal affections  her voice and ways are entirely kindly and humane and she lends herself conscientiously to the occasional demonstrations of fondness by which her children mark their esteem for her but displays of personal sentiment secretly embarrass her passion in her is humanitarian rather than human she feels strongly about social questions and principles not about persons  only one observes that this reasonableness and intense personal privacy which leaves her relations with gloria and phil much as they might be between her and the children of any other woman breaks down in the case of dolly  though almost every word she addresses to her is necessarily in the nature of a remonstrance for some breach of decorum the tenderness in her voice is unmistakable and it is not surprising that years of such remonstrance have left dolly hopelessly spoiled  gloria who is hardly past twenty is a much more formidable person than her mother  she is the incarnation of haughty highmindedness raging with the impatience of an impetuous dominative character paralyzed by the impotence of her youth and unwillingly disciplined by the constant danger of ridicule from her lighterhanded juniors  unlike her mother she is all passion and the conflict of her passion with her obstinate pride and intense fastidiousness results in a freezing coldness of manner  in an ugly woman all this would be repulsive but gloria is an attractive woman  her deep chestnut hair olive brown skin long eyelashes shaded grey eyes that often flash like stars delicately turned full lips and compact and supple but muscularly plump figure appeal with disdainful frankness to the senses and imagination  a very dangerous girl one would say if the moral passions were not also marked and even nobly marked in a fine brow her tailormade skirtandjacket dress of saffron brown cloth seems conventional when her back is turned but it displays in front a blouse of seagreen silk which upsets its conventionality with one stroke and sets her apart as effectually as the twins from the ordinary run of fashionable seaside humanity  mrs clandon comes a little way into the room looking round to see who is present  gloria who studiously avoids encouraging the twins by betraying any interest in them wanders to the window and looks out with her thoughts far away  the parlor maid instead of withdrawing shuts the door and waits at it  mrs clandon  well children how is the toothache dolly  dolly  cured thank heaven  ive had it out  she sits down on the step of the operating chair  mrs clandon takes the writingtable chair  philip striking in gravely from the hearth  and the dentist a firstrate professional man of the highest standing is coming to lunch with us  mrs clandon looking round apprehensively at the servant  phil  the parlor maid  beg pardon maam  im waiting for mr valentine i have a message for him  dolly  who from  mrs clandon shocked  dolly  dolly catches her lips with her finger tips suppressing a little splutter of mirth  the parlor maid  only the landlord maam  valentine in a blue serge suit with a straw hat in his hand comes back in high spirits out of breath with the haste he has made  gloria turns from the window and studies him with freezing attention  philip  let me introduce you mr valentine  my mother mrs lanfrey clandon  mrs clandon bows  valentine bows selfpossessed and quite equal to the occasion  my sister gloria  gloria bows with cold dignity and sits down on the sofa  valentine falls in love at first sight and is miserably confused  he fingers his hat nervously and makes her a sneaking bow  mrs clandon  i understand that we are to have the pleasure of seeing you at luncheon today mr valentine  valentine  thank youerif you dont mindi mean if you will be so kind  to the parlor maid testily  what is it  the parlor maid  the landlord sir wishes to speak to you before you go out  valentine  oh tell him i have four patients here  the clandons look surprised except phil who is imperturbable  if he wouldnt mind waiting just two minutes iill slip down and see him for a moment throwing himself confidentially on her sense of the position  say im busy but that i want to see him  the parlor maid reassuringly  yes sir  she goes  mrs clandon on the point of rising  we are detaining you i am afraid  valentine  not at all not at all  your presence here will be the greatest help to me  the fact is i owe six weeks rent and ive had no patients until today  my interview with my landlord will be considerably smoothed by the apparent boom in my business  dolly vexed  oh how tiresome of you to let it all out  and weve just been pretending that you were a respectable professional man in a firstrate position  mrs clandon horrified  oh dolly dolly  my dearest how can you be so rude  to valentine  will you excuse these barbarian children of mine mr valentine  valentine  thank you im used to them  would it be too much to ask you to wait five minutes while i get rid of my landlord downstairs  dolly  dont be long  were hungry  mrs clandon again remonstrating  dolly dear  valentine to dolly  all right  to mrs clandon  thank you i shant be long  he steals a look at gloria as he turns to go  she is looking gravely at him  he falls into confusion  iereryes thank you he succeeds at last in blundering himself out of the room but the exhibition is a pitiful one  philip  did you observe  pointing to gloria  love at first sight  you can add his scalp to your collection gloria  mrs clandon  shsh pray phil  he may have heard you  philip  not he  bracing himself for a scene  and now look here mamma  he takes the stool from the bench and seats himself majestically in the middle of the room taking a leaf out of valentines book  dolly feeling that her position on the step of the operating chair is unworthy of the dignity of the occasion rises looking important and determined crosses to the window and stands with her back to the end of the writingtable her hands behind her and on the table  mrs clandon looks at them wondering what is coming  gloria becomes attentive  philip straightens his back places his knuckles symmetrically on his knees and opens his case  dolly and i have been talking over things a good deal lately and i dont think judging from my knowledge of human naturewe dont think that you speaking very staccato with the words detached quite appreciate the fact   dolly seating herself on the end of the table with a spring  that weve grown up  mrs clandon  indeed  in what way have i given you any reason to complain  philip  well there are certain matters upon which we are beginning to feel that you might take us a little more into your confidence  mrs clandon rising with all the placidity of her age suddenly broken up and a curious hard excitement dignified but dogged ladylike but implacablethe manner of the old guard of the womens rights movementcoming upon her  phil take care  remember what i have always taught you  there are two sorts of family life phil and your experience of human nature only extends so far to one of them rhetorically  the sort you know is based on mutual respect on recognition of the right of every member of the household to independence and privacy her emphasis on privacy is intense in their personal concerns  and because you have always enjoyed that it seems such a matter of course to you that you dont value it  but with biting acrimony there is another sort of family life a life in which husbands open their wives letters and call on them to account for every farthing of their expenditure and every moment of their time in which women do the same to their children in which no room is private and no hour sacred in which duty obedience affection home morality and religion are detestable tyrannies and life is a vulgar round of punishments and lies coercion and rebellion jealousy suspicion recriminationoh  i cannot describe it to you fortunately for you you know nothing about it  she sits down panting  gloria has listened to her with flashing eyes sharing all her indignation  dolly inaccessible to rhetoric  see twentieth century parents chapter on liberty passim  mrs clandon touching her shoulder affectionately soothed even by a gibe from her  my dear dolly if you only knew how glad i am that it is nothing but a joke to you though it is such bitter earnest to me more resolutely turning to philip  phil i never ask you questions about your private concerns  you are not going to question me are you  philip  i think it due to ourselves to say that the question we wanted to ask is as much our business as yours  dolly  besides it cant be good to keep a lot of questions bottled up inside you  you did it mamma but see how awfully its broken out again in me  mrs clandon  i see you want to ask your question  ask it  dolly and philip beginning simultaneously  who they stop  philip  now look here dolly am i going to conduct this business or are you  dolly  you  philip  then hold your mouth  dolly does so literally  the question is a simple one  when the ivory snatcher  mrs clandon remonstrating  phil  philip  dentist is an ugly word  the man of ivory and gold asked us whether we were the children of mr densmore clandon of newbury hall in pursuance of the precepts in your treatise on twentieth century conduct and your repeated personal exhortations to us to curtail the number of unnecessary lies we tell we replied truthfully the we didnt know  dolly  neither did we  philip  sh  the result was that the gum architect made considerable difficulties about accepting our invitation to lunch although i doubt if he has had anything but tea and bread and butter for a fortnight past  now my knowledge of human nature leads me to believe that we had a father and that you probably know who he was  mrs clandon her agitation returning  stop phil  your father is nothing to you nor to me vehemently  that is enough  the twins are silenced but not satisfied  their faces fall  but gloria who has been following the altercation attentively suddenly intervenes  gloria advancing  mother we have a right to know  mrs clandon rising and facing her  gloria  we  who is we  gloria steadfastly  we three  her tone is unmistakable she is pitting her strength against her mother for the first time  the twins instantly go over to the enemy  mrs clandon wounded  in your mouth we used to mean you and i gloria  philip rising decisively and putting away the stool  were hurting you lets drop it  we didnt think youd mind  i dont want to know  dolly coming off the table  im sure i dont  oh dont look like that mamma  she looks angrily at gloria  mrs clandon touching her eyes hastily with her handkerchief and sitting down again  thank you my dear  thanks phil  gloria inexorably  we have a right to know mother  mrs clandon indignantly  ah  you insist  gloria  do you intend that we shall never know  dolly  oh gloria dont  its barbarous  gloria with quiet scorn  what is the use of being weak  you see what has happened with this gentleman here mother  the same thing has happened to me  mrs clandon  all        what do you mean  dolly         together  oh tell us  philip                    what happened to you  gloria  oh nothing of any consequence  she turns away from them and goes up to the easy chair at the fireplace where she sits down almost with her back to them  as they wait expectantly she adds over her shoulder with studied indifference  on board the steamer the first officer did me the honor to propose to me  dolly  no it was to me  mrs clandon  the first officer  are you serious gloria  what did you say to him  correcting herself  excuse me i have no right to ask that  gloria  the answer is pretty obvious  a woman who does not know who her father was cannot accept such an offer  mrs clandon  surely you did not want to accept it  gloria turning a little and raising her voice  no but suppose i had wanted to  philip  did that difficulty strike you dolly  dolly  no i accepted him  gloria        all crying    accepted him  mrs clandon   out           dolly  philip         together     oh i say  dolly naively  he did look such a fool  mrs clandon  but why did you do such a thing dolly  dolly  for fun i suppose  he had to measure my finger for a ring youd have done the same thing yourself  mrs clandon  no dolly i would not  as a matter of fact the first officer did propose to me and i told him to keep that sort of thing for women were young enough to be amused by it  he appears to have acted on my advice  she rises and goes to the hearth  gloria i am sorry you think me weak but i cannot tell you what you want  you are all too young  philip  this is rather a startling departure from twentieth century principles  dolly quoting  answer all your childrens questions and answer them truthfully as soon as they are old enough to ask them  see twentieth century motherhood  philip  page one  dolly   chapter one  philip  sentence one  mrs clandon  my dears i did not say that you were too young to know  i said you were too young to be taken into my confidence  you are very bright children all of you but i am glad for your sakes that you are still very inexperienced and consequently very unsympathetic there are some experiences of mine that i cannot bear to speak of except to those who have gone through what i have gone through  i hope you will never be qualified for such confidences  but i will take care that you shall learn all you want to know  will that satisfy you  philip  another grievance dolly  dolly  were not sympathetic  gloria leaning forward in her chair and looking earnestly up at her mother  mother i did not mean to be unsympathetic  mrs clandon affectionately  of course not dear  do you think i dont understand  gloria rising  but mother  mrs clandon drawing back a little  yes  gloria obstinately  it is nonsense to tell us that our father is nothing to us  mrs clandon provoked to sudden resolution  do you remember your father  gloria meditatively as if the recollection were a tender one  i am not quite sure  i think so  mrs clandon grimly  you are not sure  gloria  no  mrs clandon with quiet force  gloria if i had ever struck you gloria recoils philip and dolly are disagreeably shocked all three start at her revolted as she continuesstruck you purposely deliberately with the intention of hurting you with a whip bought for the purpose  would you remember that do you think  gloria utters an exclamation of indignant repulsion  that would have been your last recollection of your father gloria if i had not taken you away from him  i have kept him out of your life keep him now out of mine by never mentioning him to me again  gloria with a shudder covers her face with her hands until hearing someone at the door she turns away and pretends to occupy herself looking at the names of the books in the bookcase  mrs clandon sits down on the sofa  valentine returns  valentine  i hope ive not kept you waiting  that landlord of mine is really an extraordinary old character  dolly eagerly  oh tell us  how long has he given you to pay  mrs clandon distracted by her childs bad manners  dolly dolly dolly dear  you must not ask questions  dolly demurely  so sorry  youll tell us wont you mr valentine  valentine  he doesnt want his rent at all  hes broken his tooth on a brazil nut and he wants me to look at it and to lunch with him afterwards  dolly  then have him up and pull his tooth out at once and well bring him to lunch too  tell the maid to fetch him along  she runs to the bell and rings it vigorously  then with a sudden doubt she turns to valentine and adds  i suppose hes respectablereally respectable  valentine  perfectly  not like me  dolly  honest injun  mrs clandon gasps faintly but her powers of remonstrance are exhausted  valentine  honest injun  dolly  then off with you and bring him up  valentine looking dubiously at mrs clandon  i daresay hed be delighted ifer  mrs clandon rising and looking at her watch  i shall be happy to see your friend at lunch if you can persuade him to come but i cant wait to see him now i have an appointment at the hotel at a quarter to one with an old friend whom i have not seen since i left england eighteen years ago  will you excuse me  valentine  certainly mrs clandon  gloria  shall i come  mrs clandon  no dear  i want to be alone  she goes out evidently still a good deal troubled  valentine opens the door for her and follows her out  philip significantlyto dolly  hmhm  dolly significantly to philip  ahah  the parlor maid answers the bell  dolly  show the old gentleman up  the parlor maid puzzled  madam  dolly  the old gentleman with the toothache  philip  the landlord  the parlor maid  mr crampton sir  philip  is his name crampton  dolly to philip  sounds rheumaticky doesnt it  philip  chalkstones probably  dolly over her shoulder to the parlor maid  show mr crampstones up  goes r to writingtable chair  the parlor maid correcting her  mr crampton miss  she goes  dolly repeating it to herself like a lesson  crampton crampton crampton crampton crampton  she sits down studiously at the writing table  i must get that name right or heaven knows what i shall call him  gloria  phil can you believe such a horrible thing as that about our fatherwhat mother said just now  philip  oh there are lots of people of that kind  old chalice used to thrash his wife and daughters with a cartwhip  dolly contemptuously  yes a portuguese  philip  when you come to men who are brutes there is much in common between the portuguese and the english variety doll  trust my knowledge of human nature  he resumes his position on the hearthrug with an elderly and responsible air  gloria with angered remorse  i dont think we shall ever play again at our old game of guessing what our father was to be like dolly are you sorry for your fatherthe father with lots of money  dolly  oh come  what about your fatherthe lonely old man with the tender aching heart  hes pretty well burst up i think  philip  there can be no doubt that the governor is an exploded superstition  valentine is heard talking to somebody outside the door  but hark he comes  gloria nervously  who  dolly  chalkstones  philip  sh  attention  they put on their best manners  philip adds in a lower voice to gloria  if hes good enough for the lunch ill nod to dolly and if she nods to you invite him straight away  valentine comes back with his landlord  mr fergus crampton is a man of about sixty tall hard and stringy with an atrociously obstinate ill tempered grasping mouth and a querulously dogmatic voice  withal he is highly nervous and sensitive judging by his thin transparent skin marked with multitudinous lines and his slender fingers  his consequent capacity for suffering acutely from all the dislike that his temper and obstinacy can bring upon him is proved by his wistful wounded eyes by a plaintive note in his voice a painful want of confidence in his welcome and a constant but indifferently successful effort to correct his natural incivility of manner and proneness to take offence  by his keen brows and forehead he is clearly a shrewd man and there is no sign of straitened means or commercial diffidence about him he is well dressed and would be classed at a guess as a prosperous master manufacturer in a business inherited from an old family in the aristocracy of trade  his navy blue coat is not of the usual fashionable pattern  it is not exactly a pilots coat but it is cut that way double breasted and with stout buttons and broad lappels a coat for a shipyard rather than a counting house  he has taken a fancy to valentine who cares nothing for his crossness of grain and treats him with a sort of disrespectful humanity for which he is secretly grateful  valentine  may i introducethis is mr cramptonmiss dorothy clandon mr philip clandon miss clandon  crampton stands nervously bowing  they all bow  sit down mr crampton  dolly pointing to the operating chair  that is the most comfortable chair mr chcrampton  crampton  thank you but wont this young ladyindicating gloria who is close to the chair  gloria  thank you mr crampton we are just going  valentine bustling him across to the chair with goodhumored peremptoriness  sit down sit down  youre tired  crampton  well perhaps as i am considerably the oldest person present i he finishes the sentence by sitting down a little rheumatically in the operating chair  meanwhile philip having studied him critically during his passage across the room nods to dolly and dolly nods to gloria  gloria  mr crampton we understand that we are preventing mr valentine from lunching with you by taking him away ourselves  my mother would be very glad indeed if you would come too  crampton gratefully after looking at her earnestly for a moment thank you  i will come with pleasure  gloria   politely   thank you very mucher  dolly    murmuring so glader  philip               delighted im sureer  the conversation drops  gloria and dolly look at one another then at valentine and philip  valentine and philip unequal to the occasion look away from them at one another and are instantly so disconcerted by catching one anothers eye that they look back again and catch the eyes of gloria and dolly  thus catching one another all round they all look at nothing and are quite at a loss  crampton looks about him waiting for them to begin  the silence becomes unbearable  dolly suddenly to keep things going  how old are you mr crampton  gloria hastily  i am afraid we must be going mr valentine  it is understood then that we meet at half past one  she makes for the door  philip goes with her  valentine retreats to the bell  valentine  half past one  he rings the bell  many thanks  he follows gloria and philip to the door and goes out with them  dolly who has meanwhile stolen across to crampton  make him give you gas  its five shillings extra but its worth it  crampton amused  very well  looking more earnestly at her  so you want to know my age do you  im fiftyseven  dolly with conviction  you look it  crampton grimly  i dare say i do  dolly  what are you looking at me so hard for  anything wrong she feels whether her hat is right  crampton  youre like somebody  dolly  who  crampton  well you have a curious look of my mother  dolly incredulously  your mother  quite sure you dont mean your daughter  crampton suddenly blackening with hate  yes im quite sure i dont mean my daughter  dolly sympathetically  tooth bad  crampton  no no nothing  a twinge of memory miss clandon not of toothache  dolly  have it out  pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow with gas five shillings extra  crampton vindicatively  no not a sorrow  an injury that was done me once thats all  i dont forget injuries and i dont want to forget them  his features settle into an implacable frown  reenter philip to look for dolly  he comes down behind her unobserved  dolly looking critically at cramptons expression  i dont think we shall like you when you are brooding over your sorrows  philip who has entered the room unobserved and stolen behind her my sister means well mr crampton but she is indiscreet  now dolly outside  he takes her towards the door  dolly in a perfectly audible undertone  he says hes only fifty seven and he thinks me the image of his mother and he hates his daughter and she is interrupted by the return of valentine  valentine  miss clandon has gone on  philip  dont forget half past one  dolly  mind you leave mr crampton with enough teeth to eat with they go out  valentine comes down to his cabinet and opens it  crampton  thats a spoiled child mr valentine  thats one of your modern products  when i was her age i had many a good hiding fresh in my memory to teach me manners  valentine taking up his dental mirror and probe from the shelf in front of the cabinet  what did you think of her sister  crampton  you liked her better eh  valentine rhapsodically  she struck me as being he checks himself and adds prosaically  however thats not business  he places himself behind cramptons right shoulder and assumes his professional tone  open please  crampton opens his mouth valentine puts the mirror in and examines his teeth  hm  you have broken that one  what a pity to spoil such a splendid set of teeth why do you crack nuts with them  he withdraws the mirror and comes forward to converse with crampton  crampton  ive always cracked nuts with them what else are they for  dogmatically  the proper way to keep teeth good is to give them plenty of use on bones and nuts and wash them every day with soap plain yellow soap  valentine  soap  why soap  crampton  i began using it as a boy because i was made to and ive used it ever since  and i never had toothache in my life  valentine  dont you find it rather nasty  crampton  i found that most things that were good for me were nasty but i was taught to put up with them and made to put up with them  im used to it now in fact i like the taste when the soap is really good  valentine making a wry face in spite of himself  you seem to have been very carefully educated mr crampton  crampton grimly  i wasnt spoiled at all events  valentine smiling a little to himself  are you quite sure  crampton  what dy mean  valentine  well your teeth are good i admit  but ive seen just as good in very selfindulgent mouths  he goes to the ledge of cabinet and changes the probe for another one  crampton  its not the effect on the teeth its the effect on the character  valentine placably  oh the character i see  he recommences operations  a little wider please  hm  that one will have to come out its past saving  he withdraws the probe and again comes to the side of the chair to converse  dont be alarmed you shant feel anything  ill give you gas  crampton  rubbish man i want none of your gas  out with it people were taught to bear necessary pain in my day  valentine  oh if you like being hurt all right  ill hurt you as much as you like without any extra charge for the beneficial effect on your character  crampton rising and glaring at him  young man you owe me six weeks rent  valentine  i do  crampton  can you pay me  valentine  no  crampton satisfied with his advantage  i thought not  how soon dy think youll be able to pay me if you have no better manners than to make game of your patients  he sits down again  valentine  my good sir my patients havent all formed their characters on kitchen soap  crampton suddenly gripping him by the arm as he turns away again to the cabinet  so much the worse for them  i tell you you dont understand my character  if i could spare all my teeth id make you pull them all out one after another to shew you what a properly hardened man can go through with when hes made up his mind to do it  he nods at him to enforce the effect of this declaration and releases him  valentine his careless pleasantry quite unruffled  and you want to be more hardened do you  crampton  yes  valentine strolling away to the bell  well youre quite hard enough for me alreadyas a landlord  crampton receives this with a growl of grim humor  valentine rings the bell and remarks in a cheerful casual way whilst waiting for it to be answered  why did you never get married mr crampton  a wife and children would have taken some of the hardness out of you  crampton with unexpected ferocity  what the devil is that to you the parlor maid appears at the door  valentine politely  some warm water please  she retires and valentine comes back to the cabinet not at all put out by cramptons rudeness and carries on the conversation whilst he selects a forceps and places it ready to his hand with a gag and a drinking glass  you were asking me what the devil that was to me  well i have an idea of getting married myself  crampton with grumbling irony  naturally sir naturally  when a young man has come to his last farthing and is within twentyfour hours of having his furniture distrained upon by his landlord he marries ive noticed that before  well marry and be miserable  valentine  oh come what do you know about it  crampton  im not a bachelor  valentine  then there is a mrs crampton  crampton wincing with a pang of resentment  yesdamn her  valentine unperturbed  hm  a father too perhaps as well as a husband mr crampton  crampton  three children  valentine politely  damn themeh  crampton jealously  no sir the children are as much mine as hers  the parlor maid brings in a jug of hot water  valentine  thank you  he takes the jug from her and brings it to the cabinet continuing in the same idle strain  i really should like to know your family mr crampton  the parlor maid goes out and he pours some hot water into the drinking glass  crampton  sorry i cant introduce you sir  im happy to say that i dont know where they are and dont care so long as they keep out of my way  valentine with a hitch of his eyebrows and shoulders drops the forceps with a clink into the glass of hot water  you neednt warm that thing to use on me  im not afraid of the cold steel  valentine stoops to arrange the gas pump and cylinder beside the chair  whats that heavy thing  valentine  oh never mind  something to put my foot on to get the necessary purchase for a good pull  crampton looks alarmed in spite of himself  valentine stands upright and places the glass with the forceps in it ready to his hand chatting on with provoking indifference  and so you advise me not to get married mr crampton  he stoops to fit the handle on the apparatus by which the chair is raised and lowered  crampton irritably  i advise you to get my tooth out and have done reminding me of my wife  come along man  he grips the arms of the chair and braces himself  valentine pausing with his hand on the lever to look up at him and say  what do you bet that i dont get that tooth out without your feeling it  crampton  your six weeks rent young man  dont you gammon me  valentine jumping at the bet and winding him aloft vigorously done  are you ready  crampton who has lost his grip of the chair in his alarm at its sudden ascent folds his arms sits stiffly upright and prepares for the worst  valentine lets down the back of the chair to an obtuse angle  crampton clutching at the arms of the chair as he falls back  take care man  im quite helpless in this po  valentine deftly stopping him with the gag and snatching up the mouthpiece of the gas machine  youll be more helpless presently  he presses the mouthpiece over cramptons mouth and nose leaning over his chest so as to hold his head and shoulders well down on the chair crampton makes an inarticulate sound in the mouthpiece and tries to lay hands on valentine whom he supposes to be in front of him  after a moment his arms wave aimlessly then subside and drop  he is quite insensible  valentine with an exclamation of somewhat preoccupied triumph throws aside the mouthpiece quickly picks up the forceps adroitly from the glass and the curtain falls  end of act i    act ii   on the terrace at the marine hotel it is a square flagged platform with a parapet of heavy oil jar pilasters supporting a broad stone coping on the outer edge which stands up over the sea like a cliff the head waiter of the establishment busy laying napkins on a luncheon table with his back to the sea has the hotel on his right and on his left in the corner nearest the sea the flight of steps leading down to the beach  when he looks down the terrace in front of him he sees a little to his left a solitary guest a middleaged gentleman sitting on a chair of iron laths at a little iron table with a bowl of lump sugar and three wasps on it reading the standard with his umbrella up to defend him from the sun which in august and at less than an hour after noon is toasting his protended insteps  just opposite him at the hotel side of the terrace there is a garden seat of the ordinary esplanade pattern access to the hotel for visitors is by an entrance in the middle of its facade reached by a couple of steps on a broad square of raised pavement  nearer the parapet there lurks a way to the kitchen masked by a little trellis porch  the table at which the waiter is occupied is a long one set across the terrace with covers and chairs for five two at each side and one at the end next the hotel  against the parapet another table is prepared as a buffet to serve from  the waiter is a remarkable person in his way  a silky old man whitehaired and delicate looking but so cheerful and contented that in his encouraging presence ambition stands rebuked as vulgarity and imagination as treason to the abounding sufficiency and interest of the actual  he has a certain expression peculiar to men who have been extraordinarily successful in their calling and who whilst aware of the vanity of success are untouched by envy  the gentleman at the iron table is not dressed for the seaside  he wears his london frock coat and gloves and his tall silk hat is on the table beside the sugar bowl  the excellent condition and quality of these garments the goldrimmed folding spectacles through which he is reading the standard and the times at his elbow overlaying the local paper all testify to his respectability  he is about fifty clean shaven and closecropped with the corners of his mouth turned down purposely as if he suspected them of wanting to turn up and was determined not to let them have their way  he has large expansive ears cod colored eyes and a brow kept resolutely wide open as if again he had resolved in his youth to be truthful magnanimous and incorruptible but had never succeeded in making that habit of mind automatic and unconscious  still he is by no means to be laughed at there is no sign of stupidity or infirmity of will about him on the contrary he would pass anywhere at sight as a man of more than average professional capacity and responsibility  just at present he is enjoying the weather and the sea too much to be out of patience but he has exhausted all the news in his papers and is at present reduced to the advertisements which are not sufficiently succulent to induce him to persevere with them   the gentleman yawning and giving up the paper as a bad job waiter  waiter  sir  coming down c  the gentleman  are you quite sure mrs clandon is coming back before lunch  waiter  quite sure sir  she expects you at a quarter to one sir the gentleman soothed at once by the waiters voice looks at him with a lazy smile  it is a quiet voice with a gentle melody in it that gives sympathetic interest to his most commonplace remark and he speaks with the sweetest propriety neither dropping his aitches nor misplacing them nor committing any other vulgarism  he looks at his watch as he continues  not that yet sir is it  1243 sir  only two minutes more to wait sir  nice morning sir  the gentleman  yes very fresh after london  waiter  yes sir so all our visitors say sir  very nice family mrs clandons sir  the gentleman  you like them do you  waiter  yes sir  they have a free way with them that is very taking sir very taking indeed sir especially the young lady and gentleman  the gentleman  miss dorothea and mr philip i suppose  waiter  yes sir  the young lady in giving an order or the like of that will say remember william we came to this hotel on your account having heard what a perfect waiter you are  the young gentleman will tell me that i remind him strongly of his father the gentleman starts at this and that he expects me to act by him as such soothing sunny cadence  oh very peasant sir very affable and pleasant indeed  the gentleman  you like his father  he laughs at the notion  waiter  oh we must not take what they say too seriously sir  of course sir if it were true the young lady would have seen the resemblance too sir  the gentleman  did she  waiter  no sir  she thought me like the bust of shakespear in stratford church sir  that is why she calls me william sir  my real name is walter sir  he turns to go back to the table and sees mrs clandon coming up to the terrace from the beach by the steps  here is mrs clandon sir  to mrs clandon in an unobtrusively confidential tone gentleman for you maam  mrs clandon   we shall have two more gentlemen at lunch william  waiter  right maam  thank you maam  he withdraws into the hotel  mrs clandon comes forward looking round for her visitor but passes over the gentleman without any sign of recognition  the gentleman  peering at her quaintly from under the umbrella dont you know me  mrs clandon incredulously looking hard at him  are you finch mccomas  mccomas  cant you guess  he shuts the umbrella puts it aside and jocularly plants himself with his hands on his hips to be inspected  mrs clandon  i believe you are  she gives him her hand  the shake that ensues is that of old friends after a long separation wheres your beard  mccomas with humorous solemnity  would you employ a solicitor with a beard  mrs clandon pointing to the silk hat on the table  is that your hat  mccomas  would you employ a solicitor with a sombrero  mrs clandon  i have thought of you all these eighteen years with the beard and the sombrero  she sits down on the garden seat  mccomas takes his chair again  do you go to the meetings of the dialectical society still  mccomas gravely  i do not frequent meetings now  mrs clandon  finch i see what has happened  you have become respectable  mccomas  havent you  mrs clandon  not a bit  mccomas  you hold to your old opinions still  mrs clandon  as firmly as ever  mccomas  bless me  and you are still ready to make speeches in public in spite of your sex mrs clandon nods to insist on a married womans right to her own separate property she nods again to champion darwins view of the origin of species and john stuart mills essay on liberty nod to read huxley tyndall and george eliot three nods and to demand university degrees the opening of the professions and the parliamentary franchise for women as well as men  mrs clandon resolutely  yes i have not gone back one inch and i have educated gloria to take up my work where i left it  that is what has brought me back to england i felt that i had no right to bury her alive in madeiramy st helena finch  i suppose she will be howled at as i was but she is prepared for that  mccomas  howled at  my dear good lady there is nothing in any of those views nowadays to prevent her from marrying a bishop  you reproached me just now for having become respectable  you were wrong i hold to our old opinions as strongly as ever  i dont go to church and i dont pretend i do  i call myself what i am a philosophic radical standing for liberty and the rights of the individual as i learnt to do from my master herbert spencer  am i howled at  no im indulged as an old fogey  im out of everything because ive refused to bow the knee to socialism  mrs clandon shocked  socialism  mccomas  yes socialism  thats what miss gloria will be up to her ears in before the end of the month if you let her loose here  mrs clandon emphatically  but i can prove to her that socialism is a fallacy  mccomas touchingly  it is by proving that mrs clandon that i have lost all my young disciples  be careful what you do let her go her own way  with some bitterness  were oldfashioned the world thinks it has left us behind  there is only one place in all england where your opinions would still pass as advanced  mrs clandon scornfully unconvinced  the church perhaps  mccomas  no the theatre  and now to business  why have you made me come down here  mrs clandon  well partly because i wanted to see you  mccomas with goodhumored irony  thanks  mrs clandon  and partly because i want you to explain everything to the children  they know nothing and now that we have come back to england it is impossible to leave them in ignorance any longer agitated  finch i cannot bring myself to tell them  i she is interrupted by the twins and gloria  dolly comes tearing up the steps racing philip who combines a terrific speed with unhurried propriety of bearing which however costs him the race as dolly reaches her mother first and almost upsets the garden seat by the precipitancy of her arrival  dolly breathless  its all right mamma  the dentist is coming and hes bringing his old man  mrs clandon  dolly dear dont you see mr mccomas  mr mccomas rises smilingly  dolly her face falling with the most disparagingly obvious disappointment  this  where are the flowing locks  philip seconding her warmly  where the beard the cloak the poetic exterior  dolly  oh mr mccomas youve gone and spoiled yourself  why didnt you wait till wed seen you  mccomas taken aback but rallying his humor to meet the emergency because eighteen years is too long for a solicitor to go without having his hair cut  gloria at the other side of mccomas  how do you do mr mccomas he turns and she takes his hand and presses it with a frank straight look into his eyes  we are glad to meet you at last  mccomas  miss gloria i presume  gloria smiles assent and releases his hand after a final pressure  she then retires behind the garden seat leaning over the back beside mrs clandon  and this young gentleman  philip  i was christened in a comparatively prosaic mood  my name is  dolly completing his sentence for him declamatorily  norval  on the grampian hills  philip declaiming gravely  my father feeds his flock a frugal swain  mrs clandon remonstrating  dear dear children dont be silly everything is so new to them here finch that they are in the wildest spirits  they think every englishman they meet is a joke  dolly  well so he is its not our fault  philip  my knowledge of human nature is fairly extensive mr mccomas but i find it impossible to take the inhabitants of this island seriously  mccomas  i presume sir you are master philip offering his hand  philip taking mccomass hand and looking solemnly at him  i was master philipwas so for many years just as you were once master finch  he gives his hand a single shake and drops it then turns away exclaiming meditatively  how strange it is to look back on our boyhood mccomas stares after him not at all pleased  dolly to mrs clandon  has finch had a drink  mrs clandon remonstrating  dearest mr mccomas will lunch with us  dolly  have you ordered for seven  dont forget the old gentleman  mrs clandon  i have not forgotten him dear  what is his name  dolly  chalkstones  hell be here at half past one  to mccomas are we like what you expected  mrs clandon changing her tone to a more earnest one  dolly mr mccomas has something more serious than that to tell you  children i have asked my old friend to answer the question you asked this morning he is your fathers friend as well as mine and he will tell you the story more fairly than i could  turning her head from them to gloria gloria are you satisfied  gloria gravely attentive  mr mccomas is very kind  mccomas nervously  not at all my dear young lady not at all  at the same time this is rather sudden  i was hardly prepareder  dolly suspiciously  oh we dont want anything prepared  philip exhorting him  tell us the truth  dolly emphatically  bald headed  mccomas nettled  i hope you intend to take what i have to say seriously  philip with profound mock gravity  i hope it will deserve it mr mccomas  my knowledge of human nature teaches me not to expect too much  mrs clandon remonstrating  phil  philip  yes mother all right  i beg your pardon mr mccomas dont mind us  dolly in conciliation  we mean well  philip  shut up both  dolly holds her lips  mccomas takes a chair from the luncheon table places it between the little table and the garden seat with dolly on his right and philip on his left and settles himself in it with the air of a man about to begin a long communication  the clandons match him expectantly  mccomas  ahem  your father  dolly interrupting  how old is he  philip  sh  mrs clandon softly  dear dolly dont let us interrupt mr mccomas  mccomas emphatically  thank you mrs clandon  thank you  to dolly  your father is fiftyseven  dolly with a bound startled and excited  fiftyseven  where does he live  mrs clandon remonstrating  dolly dolly  mccomas stopping her  let me answer that mrs clandon  the answer will surprise you considerably  he lives in this town  mrs clandon rises  she and gloria look at one another in the greatest consternation  dolly with conviction  i knew it  phil chalkstones is our father  mccomas  chalkstones  dolly  oh crampstones or whatever it is  he said i was like his mother  i knew he must mean his daughter  philip very seriously  mr mccomas i desire to consider your feelings in every possible way but i warn you that if you stretch the long arm of coincidence to the length of telling me that mr crampton of this town is my father i shall decline to entertain the information for a moment  mccomas  and pray why  philip  because i have seen the gentleman and he is entirely unfit to be my father or dollys father or glorias father or my mothers husband  mccomas  oh indeed  well sir let me tell you that whether you like it or not he is your father and your sister father and mrs clandons husband  now  what have you to say to that  dolly whimpering  you neednt be so cross  crampton isnt your father  philip  mr mccomas your conduct is heartless  here you find a family enjoying the unspeakable peace and freedom of being orphans  we have never seen the face of a relativenever known a claim except the claim of freely chosen friendship  and now you wish to thrust into the most intimate relationship with us a man whom we dont know  dolly vehemently  an awful old man  reproachfully  and you began as if you had quite a nice father for us  mccomas angrily  how do you know that he is not nice  and what right have you to choose your own father  raising his voice  let me tell you miss clandon that you are too young to  dolly interrupting him suddenly and eagerly  stop i forgot  has he any money  mccomas  he has a great deal of money  dolly delighted  oh what did i always say phil  philip  dolly we have perhaps been condemning the old man too hastily  proceed mr mccomas  mccomas  i shall not proceed sir  i am too hurt too shocked to proceed  mrs clandon urgently  finch do you realize what is happening do you understand that my children have invited that man to lunch and that he will be here in a few moments  mccomas completely upset  what  do you meanam i to understand is it  philip impressively  steady finch  think it out slowly and carefully  hes comingcoming to lunch  gloria  which of us is to tell him the truth  have you thought of that  mrs clandon  finch you must tell him  dolly  oh finch is no good at telling things  look at the mess he has made of telling us  mccomas  i have not been allowed to speak  i protest against this  dolly taking his arm coaxingly  dear finch dont be cross  mrs clandon  gloria let us go in  he may arrive at any moment  gloria proudly  do not stir mother  i shall not stir  we must not run away  mrs clandon delicately rebuking her  my dear we cannot sit down to lunch just as we are  we shall come back again  we must have no bravado  gloria winces and goes into the hotel without a word come dolly  as she goes into the hotel door the waiter comes out with plates etc for two additional covers on a tray  waiter  gentlemen come yet maam  mrs clandon  two more to come yet thank you  they will be here immediately  she goes into the hotel  the waiter takes his tray to the service table  philip  i have an idea  mr mccomas this communication should be made should it not by a man of infinite tact  mccomas  it will require tact certainly  philip  good  dolly whose tact were you noticing only this morning  dolly seizing the idea with rapture  oh yes i declare  william  philip  the very man  calling  william  waiter  coming sir  mccomas horrified  the waiter   stop stop  i will not permit this  i  waiter presenting himself between philip and mccomas  yes sir mccomass complexion fades into stone grey and all movement and expression desert his eyes  he sits down stupefied  philip  william you remember my request to you to regard me as your son  waiter with respectful indulgence  yes sir  anything you please sir  philip  william at the very outset of your career as my father a rival has appeared on the scene  waiter  your real father sir  well that was to be expected sooner or later sir wasnt it  turning with a happy smile to mccomas  is it you sir  mccomas renerved by indignation  certainly not  my children know how to behave themselves  philip  no william this gentleman was very nearly my father he wooed my mother but wooed her in vain  mccomas outraged  well of all the  philip  sh  consequently he is only our solicitor  do you know one crampton of this town  waiter  cockeyed crampton sir of the crooked billet is it  philip  i dont know  finch does he keep a public house  mccomas rising scandalized  no no no  your father sir is a wellknown yacht builder an eminent man here  waiter impressed  oh beg pardon sir im sure  a son of mr cramptons  dear me  philip  mr crampton is coming to lunch with us  waiter puzzled  yes sir  diplomatically  dont usually lunch with his family perhaps sir  philip impressively  william he does not know that we are his family  he has not seen us for eighteen years  he wont know us  to emphasize the communication he seats himself on the iron table with a spring and looks at the waiter with his lips compressed and his legs swinging  dolly  we want you to break the news to him william  waiter  but i should think hed guess when he sees your mother miss  philips legs become motionless at this elucidation  he contemplates the waiter raptly  dolly dazzled  i never thought of that  philip  nor i  coming off the table and turning reproachfully on mccomas  nor you  dolly  and you a solicitor  philip  finch your professional incompetence is appalling william your sagacity puts us all to shame  dolly  you really are like shakespear william  waiter  not at all sir  dont mention it miss  most happy im sure sir  goes back modestly to the luncheon table and lays the two additional covers one at the end next the steps and the other so as to make a third on the side furthest from the balustrade  philip abruptly  finch come and wash your hands  seizes his arm and leads him toward the hotel  mccomas  i am thoroughly vexed and hurt mr clandon  philip interrupting him  you will get used to us  come dolly mccomas shakes him off and marches into the hotel  philip follows with unruffled composure  dolly turning for a moment on the steps as she follows them  keep your wits about you william  there will be fireworks  waiter  right miss  you may depend on me miss  she goes into the hotel  valentine comes lightly up the steps from the beach followed doggedly by crampton  valentine carries a walking stick  crampton either because he is old and chilly or with some idea of extenuating the unfashionableness of his reefer jacket wears a light overcoat  he stops at the chair left by mccomas in the middle of the terrace and steadies himself for a moment by placing his hand on the back of it  crampton  those steps make me giddy  he passes his hand over his forehead  i have not got over that infernal gas yet  he goes to the iron chair so that he can lean his elbows on the little table to prop his head as he sits  he soon recovers and begins to unbutton his overcoat  meanwhile valentine interviews the waiter  valentine  waiter  waiter coming forward between them  yes sir  valentine  mrs lanfrey clandon  waiter with a sweet smile of welcome  yes sir  were expecting you sir  that is your table sir  mrs clandon will be down presently sir  the young lady and young gentleman were just talking about your friend sir  valentine  indeed  waiter smoothly melodious   yes sire  great flow of spirits sir  a vein of pleasantry as you might say sir  quickly to crampton who has risen to get the overcoat off  beg pardon sir but if youll allow me helping him to get the overcoat off and taking it from him  thank you sir  crampton sits down again and the waiter resumes the broken melody  the young gentlemans latest is that youre his father sir  crampton  what  waiter  only his joke sir his favourite joke  yesterday i was to be his father  today as soon as he knew you were coming sir he tried to put it up on me that you were his father his long lost father not seen you for eighteen years he said  crampton startled  eighteen years  waiter  yes sir  with gentle archness  but i was up to his tricks sir  i saw the idea coming into his head as he stood there thinking what new joke hed have with me  yes sir thats the sort he is very pleasant very off hand and affable indeed sir  again changing his tempo to say to valentine who is putting his

against the luncheon table and delicately shakes the coat out and holds it for crampton to put on  i seem to have done the young gentleman an injustice sir havent i sir  crampton  rrrh  he stops on the point of putting his arms into the sleeves and turns to valentine with sudden suspicion  valentine you are in this  you made this plot  you  valentine decisively  bosh  he throws the menu down and goes round the table to look out unconcernedly over the parapet  crampton angrily  what dye mccomas followed by philip and dolly comes out  he vacillates for a moment on seeing crampton  waiter softlyinterrupting crampton  steady sir  here they come sir  he takes up the stick and makes for the hotel throwing the coat across his arm  mccomas turns the corners of his mouth resolutely down and crosses to crampton who draws back and glares with his hands behind him  mccomas with his brow opener than ever confronts him in the majesty of a spotless conscience  waiter aside as he passes philip

wanders idly round the table exchanging a smile and a word of greeting with valentine on the way  philip  allow me to discharge my first duty as host by ordering your wine  he takes the wine list from the table  his polite attention and dollys unconcerned indifference leave crampton on the footing of the casual acquaintance picked up that morning at the dentists  the consciousness of it goes through the father with so keen a pang that he trembles all over his brow becomes wet and he stares dumbly at his son who just conscious enough of his own callousness to intensely enjoy the humor and adroitness of it proceeds pleasantly  finch some crusted old port for you as a respectable family solicitor eh  mccomas firmly  apollinaris only  i prefer to take nothing heating  he walks away to the side of the terrace like a man putting temptation behind him  philip  valentine  valentine  would lager be considered vulgar  philip  probably  well order some  dolly takes it  turning to crampton with cheerful politeness  and now mr crampton what can we do for you  crampton  what dye mean boy  philip  boy  very solemnly  whose fault is it that i am a boy  crampton snatches the wine list rudely from him and irresolutely pretends to read it  philip abandons it to him with perfect politeness  dolly looking over cramptons right shoulder  the whiskys on the last page but one  crampton  let me alone child  dolly  child  no no you may call me dolly if you like but you mustnt call me child  she slips her arm through philips and the two stand looking at crampton as if he were some eccentric stranger  crampton mopping his brow in rage and agony and yet relieved even by their playing with him  mccomas we arehagoing to have a pleasant meal  mccomas pusillanimously  there is no reason why it should not be pleasant  he looks abjectly gloomy  philip  finchs face is a feast in itself  mrs clandon and gloria come from the hotel  mrs clandon advances with courageous self possession and marked dignity of manner  she stops at the foot of the steps to address valentine who is in her path  gloria also stops looking at crampton with a certain repulsion  mrs clandon  glad to see you again mr valentine  he smiles she passes on and confronts crampton intending to address him with perfect composure but his aspect shakes her  she stops suddenly and says anxiously with a touch of remorse  fergus you are greatly changed  crampton grimly  i daresay  a man does change in eighteen years  mrs clandon troubled  ii did not mean that  i hope your health is good  crampton  thank you  no its not my health  its my happiness thats the change you meant i think  breaking out suddenly  look at her mccomas  look at her and look at me  he utters a half laugh half sob  philip  sh  pointing to the

to the service table and begins slicing it  crampton  you have learnt your lesson from your mother i see  mrs clandon  phil will you please remember that your jokes are apt to irritate people who are not accustomed to us and that your father is our guest today  crampton bitterly  yes a guest at the head of my own table  the soup plates are removed  dolly sympathetically  yes its embarrassing isnt

iererer  waiter tactfully  turbot sir  mccomas intensely grateful for the interruption  thank you waiter thank you  waiter sotto voce  dont mention it sir  he returns to the service table  crampton to phil  have you thought of choosing a profession yet  philip  i am keeping my mind open on that subject  william  waiter  yes sir  philip  how long do you think it would take me to learn to be a really smart waiter  waiter  cant be learnt sir  its in the character sir confidentially to valentine who is looking about for something bread for the lady sir yes sir  he serves bread to gloria and resumes at his former pitch  very few are born to it sir  philip  you dont happen to have such a thing as a son yourself have you  waiter  yes sir oh yes sir  to gloria again dropping his voice  a little more fish miss you wont care for the joint in the middle of the day  gloria  no thank you  the fish plates are removed  dolly  is your son a waiter too william  waiter serving gloria with fowl  oh no miss

sir  mccomas embarrassed  im sure i beg your pardon  waiter  not at all sir  very natural mistake im sure sir  ive often wished he was a potman sir  would have been off my hands ever so much sooner sir  aside to valentine who is again in difficulties salt at your elbow sir  resuming  yes sir had to support him until he was thirtyseven sir  but doing well now sir very satisfactory indeed sir  nothing less than fifty guineas sir  mccomas  democracy cramptonmodern democracy  waiter calmly  no sir not democracy only education sir scholarships sir  cambridge local sir  sidney sussex college sir dolly plucks his sleeve and whispers as he bends down  stone ginger miss  right miss  to mccomas  very good thing for him sir he never had any turn for real work sir  he goes into the hotel leaving the company somewhat overwhelmed by his sons eminence  valentine  which of us dare give that man an order again  dolly  i hope he wont mind my sending him for gingerbeer  crampton doggedly  while hes a waiter its his business to wait if you had treated him as a waiter ought to be treated hed have held his tongue  dolly  what a loss that would have been  perhaps hell give us an introduction to his son and get us into london society  the waiter reappears with the gingerbeer  crampton growling contemptuously  london society  london society  youre not fit for any society child  dolly losing her temper  now look here mr crampton  if you think  waiter softly at her elbow  stone ginger miss  dolly taken aback recovers her good humor after a long breath and says sweetly  thank you dear william  you were just in time  she drinks  mccomas making a fresh effort to lead the conversation into dispassionate regions  if i may be allowed to change the subject miss clandon what is the established religion in madeira  gloria  i suppose the portuguese religion  i never inquired  dolly  the servants come in lent and kneel down before you and confess all the things theyve done and you have to pretend to forgive them do they do that in england william  waiter  not usually miss  they may in some parts but it has not come under my notice miss  catching mrs clandons eye as the young waiter offers her the salad bowl  you like it without dressing maam yes maam i have some for you  to his young colleague motioning him to serve gloria  this side jo  he takes a special portion of salad from the service table and puts it beside mrs clandons plate  in doing so he observes that dolly is making a wry face  only a bit of watercress miss got in by mistake  he takes her salad away  thank you miss   to the young waiter admonishing him to serve dolly afresh  jo  resuming  mostly members of the church of england miss  dolly  members of the church of england  whats the subscription  crampton rising violently amid general consternation  you see how my children have been brought up mccomas  you see it you hear it  i call all of you to witness  he becomes inarticulate and is about to strike his fist recklessly on the table when the waiter considerately takes away his plate  mrs clandon firmly  sit down fergus  there is no occasion at all for this outburst  you must remember that dolly is just like a foreigner here  pray sit down  crampton subsiding unwillingly  i doubt whether i ought to sit here and countenance all this  i doubt it  waiter  cheese sir or would you like a cold sweet  crampton take aback  what  ohcheese cheese  dolly  bring a box of cigarets william  waiter  all ready miss  he takes a box of cigarets from the service table and places them before dolly who selects one and prepares to smoke  he then returns to his table for a box of vestas  crampton staring aghast at dolly  does she smoke  dolly out of patience  really mr crampton im afraid im spoiling your lunch  ill go and have my cigaret on the beach  she leaves the table with petulant suddenness and goes down the steps  the waiter attempts to give her the matches but she is gone before he can reach her  crampton furiously  margaret call that girl back  call her back i say  mccomas trying to make peace  come crampton never mind  shes her fathers daughter thats all  mrs clandon with deep resentment  i hope not finch  she rises they all rise a little  mr valentine will you excuse me i am afraid dolly is hurt and put out by what has passed  i must go to her  crampton  to take her part against me you mean  mrs clandon ignoring him  gloria will you take my place whilst i am away dear  she crosses to the steps  cramptons eyes follow her with bitter hatred  the rest watch her in embarrassed silence feeling the incident to be a very painful one  waiter intercepting her at the top of the steps and offering her a box of vestas  young lady forgot the matches maam  if you would be so good maam  mrs clandon surprised into grateful politeness by the witchery of his sweet and cheerful tones  thank you very much  she takes the matches and goes down to the beach  the waiter shepherds his assistant along with him into the hotel by the kitchen entrance leaving the luncheon party to themselves  crampton throwing himself back in his chair  theres a mother for you mccomas  theres a mother for you  gloria steadfastly  yes a good mother  crampton  and a bad father  thats what you mean eh  valentine rising indignantly and addressing gloria  miss clandon i  crampton turning on him  that girls name is crampton mr valentine not clandon  do you wish to join them in insulting me  valentine ignoring him  im overwhelmed miss clandon  its all my fault i brought him here im responsible for him  and im ashamed of him  crampton  what dy mean  gloria rising coldly  no harm has been done mr valentine  we have all been a little childish i am afraid  our party has been a failure let us break it up and have done with it  she puts her chair aside and turns to the steps adding with slighting composure as she passes crampton  goodbye father  she descends the steps with cold disgusted indifference  they all look after her and so do not notice the return of the waiter from the hotel laden with cramptons coat valentines stick a couple of shawls and parasols a white canvas umbrella and some camp stools  crampton to himself staring after gloria with a ghastly expression  father  father  he strikes his fist violently on the table  now  waiter offering the coat  this is yours sir i think sir crampton glares at him then snatches it rudely and comes down the terrace towards the garden seat struggling with the coat in his angry efforts to put it on  mccomas rises and goes to his assistance then takes his hat and umbrella from the little iron table and turns towards the steps  meanwhile the waiter after thanking crampton with unruffled sweetness for taking the coat offers some of his burden to phil  the ladies sunshades sir  nasty glare off the sea today sir very trying to the complexion sir  i shall carry down the camp stools myself sir  philip  you are old father william but you are the most considerate of men  no keep the sunshades and give me the camp stools taking them  waiter with flattering gratitude  thank you sir  philip  finch share with me giving him a couple  come along they go down the steps together  valentine to the waiter  leave me something to bring downone of these  offering to take a sunshade  waiter discreetly  thats the younger ladys sir  valentine lets it go  thank you sir  if youll allow me sir i think you had better have this  he puts down the sunshades on cramptons chair and produces from the tail pocket of his dress coat a book with a ladys handkerchief between the leaves marking the page  the eldest young lady is reading it at present  valentine takes it eagerly  thank you sir  schopenhauer sir you see  he takes up the sunshades again  very interesting author sir especially on the subject of ladies sir  he goes down the steps  valentine about to follow him recollects crampton and changes his mind  valentine coming rather excitedly to crampton  now look here crampton are you at all ashamed of yourself  crampton pugnaciously  ashamed of myself  what for  valentine  for behaving like a bear  what will your daughter think of me for having brought you here  crampton  i was not thinking of what my daughter was thinking of you  valentine  no you were thinking of yourself  youre a perfect maniac  crampton heartrent  she told you what i ama fathera father robbed of his children  what are the hearts of this generation like am i to come here after all these yearsto see what my children are for the first time  to hear their voicesand carry it all off like a fashionable visitor drop in to lunch be mr cramptonm i s t e r crampton  what right have they to talk to me like that  im their father do they deny that  im a man with the feelings of our common humanity have i no rights no claims  in all these years who have i had round me  servants clerks business acquaintances  ive had respect from themaye kindness  would one of them have spoken to me as that girl spokewould one of them have laughed at me as that boy was laughing at me all the time  frantically  my own children m i s t e r  crampton  my  valentine  come come theyre only children  the only one of them thats worth anything called you father  crampton wildly  yes goodbye father  oh yes she got at my feelingswith a stab  valentine taking this in very bad part  now look here crampton you just let her alone shes treated you very well  i had a much worse time of it at lunch than you  crampton  you  valentine with growing impetuosity  yes i  i sat next to her and i never said a single thing to her the whole timecouldnt think of a blessed word  and not a word did she say to me  crampton  well  valentine  well  well  tackling him very seriously and talking faster and faster  crampton do you know whats been the matter with me today  you dont suppose do you that im in the habit of playing such tricks on my patients as i played on you  crampton  i hope not  valentine  the explanation is that im stark mad or rather that ive never been in my real senses before  im capable of anything ive grown up at last im a man and its your daughter thats made a man of me  crampton incredulously  are you in love with my daughter  valentine his words now coming in a perfect torrent  love nonsense its something far above and beyond that  its life its faith its strength certainty paradise  crampton interrupting him with acrid contempt  rubbish man  what have you to keep a wife on  you cant marry her  valentine  who wants to marry her  ill kiss her hands ill kneel at her feet ill live for her ill die for her and thatll be enough for me  look at her book  see  he kisses the handkerchief  if you offered me all your money for this excuse for going down to the beach and speaking to her again id only laugh at you  he rushes buoyantly off to the steps where he bounces right into the arms of the waiter who is coming up form the beach  the two save themselves from falling by clutching one another tightly round the waist and whirling one another around  waiter delicately  steady sir steady  valentine shocked at his own violence  i beg your pardon  waiter  not at all sir not at all  very natural sir im sure sir at your age  the lady has sent me for her book sir  might i take the liberty of asking you to let her have it at once sir  valentine  with pleasure  and if you will allow me to present you with a professional mans earnings for six weeks offering him dollys crown piece  waiter as if the sum were beyond his utmost expectations  thank you sir much obliged  valentine dashes down the steps  very high spirited young gentleman sir very manly and straight set up  crampton in grumbling disparagement  and making his fortune in a hurry no doubt  i know what his six weeks earnings come to  he crosses the terrace to the iron table and sits down  waiter philosophically  well sir you never can tell  thats a principle in life with me sir if youll excuse my having such a thing sir  delicately sinking the philosopher in the waiter for a moment perhaps you havent noticed that you hadnt touched that seltzer and irish sir when the party broke up  he takes the tumbler from the luncheon table and sets if before crampton  yes sir you never can tell  there was my son sir who ever thought that he would rise to wear a silk gown sir  and yet today sir nothing less than fifty guineas sir  what a lesson sir  crampton  well i hope he is grateful to you and recognizes what he owes you  waiter  we get on together very well very well indeed sir considering the difference in our stations  with another of his irresistible transitions  a small lump of sugar sir will take the flatness out of the seltzer without noticeably sweetening the drink sir  allow me sir  he drops a lump of sugar into the tumbler  but as i say to him wheres the difference after all  if i must put on a dress coat to show what i am sir he must put on a wig and gown to show what he is  if my income is mostly tips and theres a pretence that i dont get them why his income is mostly fees sir and i understand theres a pretence that he dont get them  if he likes society and his profession brings him into contact with all ranks so does mine too sir  if its a little against a barrister to have a waiter for his father sir its a little against a waiter to have a barrister for a son many people consider it a great liberty sir i assure you sir can i get you anything else sir  crampton  no thank you  with bitter humility  i suppose thats no objection to my sitting here for a while i cant disturb the party on the beach here  waiter with emotion  very kind of you sir to put it as if it was not a compliment and an honour to us mr crampton very kind indeed the more you are at home here sir the better for us  crampton in poignant irony  home  waiter reflectively  well yes sir thats a way of looking at it too sir  i have always said that the great advantage of a hotel is that its a refuge from home life sir  crampton  i missed that advantage today i think  waiter  you did sir you did  dear me  its the unexpected that always happens isnt it  shaking his head  you never can tell sir you never can tell he goes into the hotel  crampton his eyes shining hardly as he props his drawn miserable face on his hands  home  home  he drops his arms on the table and bows his head on them but presently hears someone approaching and hastily sits bolt upright  it is gloria who has come up the steps alone with her sunshade and her book in her hands  he looks defiantly at her with the brutal obstinacy of his mouth and the wistfulness of his eyes contradicting each other pathetically  she comes to the corner of the garden seat and stands with her back to it leaning against the end of it and looking down at him as if wondering at his weakness too curious about him to be cold but supremely indifferent to their kinship  well  gloria  i want to speak with you for a moment  crampton looking steadily at her  indeed  thats surprising  you meet your father after eighteen years and you actually want to speak to him for a moment  thats touching isnt it  he rests his head on his hands and looks down and away from her in gloomy reflection  gloria  all that is what seems to me so nonsensical so uncalled for  what do you expect us to feel for youto do for you  what is it you want  why are you less civil to us than other people are  you are evidently not very fond of uswhy should you be  but surely we can meet without quarrelling  crampton a dreadful grey shade passing over his face  do you realize that i am your father  gloria  perfectly  crampton  do you know what is due to me as your father  gloria  for instance  crampton rising as if to combat a monster  for instance  for instance  for instance duty affection respect obedience  gloria quitting her careless leaning attitude and confronting him promptly and proudly  i obey nothing but my sense of what is right  i respect nothing that is not noble  that is my duty  she adds less firmly  as to affection it is not within my control  i am not sure that i quite know what affection means  she turns away with an evident distaste for that part of the subject and goes to the luncheon table for a comfortable chair putting down her book and sunshade  crampton following her with his eyes  do you really mean what you are saying  gloria turning on him quickly and severely  excuse me that is an uncivil question  i am speaking seriously to you and i expect you to take me seriously  she takes one of the luncheon chairs turns it away from the table and sits down a little wearily saying  can you not discuss this matter coolly and rationally  crampton  coolly and rationally  no i cant  do you understand that  i cant  gloria emphatically  no  that i  c a n n o t  understand  i have no sympathy with  crampton shrinking nervously  stop  dont say anything more yet you dont know what youre doing  do you want to drive me mad  she frowns finding such petulance intolerable  he adds hastily  no im not angry indeed im not  wait wait give me a little time to think he stands for a moment screwing and clinching his brows and hands in his perplexity then takes the end chair from the luncheon table and sits down beside her saying with a touching effort to be gentle and patient  now i think i have it  at least ill try  gloria firmly  you see  everything comes right if we only think it resolutely out  crampton in sudden dread  no dont think  i want you to feel thats the only thing that can help us  listen  do youbut firsti forgot  whats your name  i mean you pet name  they cant very well call you sophronia  gloria with astonished disgust  sophronia  my name is gloria  i am always called by it  crampton his temper rising again  your name is sophronia girl you were called after your aunt sophronia my sister she gave you your first bible with your name written in it  gloria  then my mother gave me a new name  crampton angrily  she had no right to do it  i will not allow this  gloria  you had no right to give me your sisters name  i dont know her  crampton  youre talking nonsense  there are bounds to what i will put up with  i will not have it  do you hear that  gloria rising warningly  are you resolved to quarrel  crampton terrified pleading  no no sit down  sit down wont you  she looks at him keeping him in suspense  he forces himself to utter the obnoxious name  gloria  she marks her satisfaction with a slight tightening of the lips and sits down  there  you see i only want to shew you that i am your father mymy dear child  the endearment is so plaintively inept that she smiles in spite of herself and resigns herself to indulge him a little  listen now  what i want to ask you is this  dont you remember me at all you were only a tiny child when you were taken away from me but you took plenty of notice of things  cant you remember someone whom you loved or shyly at least liked in a childish way  come someone who let you stay in his study and look at his toy boats as you thought them  he looks anxiously into her face for some response and continues less hopefully and more urgently  someone who let you do as you liked there and never said a word to you except to tell you that you must sit still and not speak someone who was something that no one else was to youwho was your father  gloria unmoved  if you describe things to me no doubt i shall presently imagine that i remember them  but i really remember nothing  crampton wistfully  has your mother never told you anything about me  gloria  she has never mentioned your name to me  he groans involuntarily  she looks at him rather contemptuously and continues except once and then she did remind me of something i had forgotten  crampton looking up hopefully  what was that  gloria mercilessly  the whip you bought to beat me with  crampton gnashing his teeth  oh  to bring that up against me  to turn from me  when you need never have known  under a grinding agonized breath  curse her  gloria springing up  you wretch  with intense emphasis  you wretch  you dare curse my mother  crampton  stop or youll be sorry afterwards  im your father  gloria  how i hate the name  how i love the name of mother  you had better go  crampton  iim choking  you want to kill me  somei his voice stifles he is almost in a fit  gloria going up to the balustrade with cool quick resourcefulness and calling over to the beach  mr valentine  valentine answering from below  yes  gloria  come here a moment please  mr crampton wants you  she returns to the table and pours out a glass of water  crampton recovering his speech  no let me alone  i dont want him  im all right i tell you  i need neither his help nor yours he rises and pulls himself together  as you say i had better go he puts on his hat  is that your last word  gloria  i hope so  he looks stubbornly at her for a moment nods grimly as if he agreed to that and goes into the hotel  she looks at him with equal steadiness until he disappears when she makes a gesture of relief and turns to speak to valentine who comes running up the steps  valentine panting  whats the matter  looking round  wheres crampton  gloria  gone  valentines face lights up with sudden joy dread and mischief  he has just realized that he is alone with gloria  she continues indifferently  i thought he was ill but he recovered himself  he wouldnt wait for you  i am sorry  she goes for her book and parasol  valentine  so much the better  he gets on my nerves after a while pretending to forget himself  how could that man have so beautiful a daughter  gloria taken aback for a moment then answering him with polite but intentional contempt  that seems to be an attempt at what is called a pretty speech  let me say at once mr valentine that pretty speeches make very sickly conversation  pray let us be friends if we are to be friends in a sensible and wholesome way  i have no intention of getting married and unless you are content to accept that state of things we had much better not cultivate each others acquaintance  valentine cautiously  i see  may i ask just this one question is your objection an objection to marriage as an institution or merely an objection to marrying me personally  gloria  i do not know you well enough mr valentine to have any opinion on the subject of your personal merits  she turns away from him with infinite indifference and sits down with her book on the garden seat  i do not think the conditions of marriage at present are such as any selfrespecting woman can accept  valentine instantly changing his tone for one of cordial sincerity as if he frankly accepted her terms and was delighted and reassured by her principles  oh then thats a point of sympathy between us already  i quite agree with you the conditions are most unfair  he takes off his hat and throws it gaily on the iron table  no what i want is to get rid of all that nonsense  he sits down beside her so naturally that she does not think of objecting and proceeds with enthusiasm  dont you think it a horrible thing that a man and a woman can hardly know one another without being supposed to have designs of that kind  as if there were no other interestsno other subjects of conversationas if women were capable of nothing better  gloria interested ah now you are beginning to talk humanly and sensibly mr valentine  valentine with a gleam in his eye at the success of his hunters guile  of coursetwo intelligent people like us  isnt it pleasant in this stupid conventionridden world to meet with someone on the same planesomeone with an unprejudiced enlightened mind  gloria earnestly  i hope to meet many such people in england  valentine dubiously  hm  there are a good many people here nearly forty millions  theyre not all consumptive members of the highly educated classes like the people in madeira  gloria now full of her subject  oh everybody is stupid and prejudiced in madeiraweak sentimental creatures  i hate weakness and i hate sentiment  valentine  thats what makes you so inspiring  gloria with a slight laugh  am i inspiring  valentine  yes  strengths infectious  gloria  weakness is i know  valentine with conviction  y o ure strong  do you know that you changed the world for me this morning  i was in the dumps thinking of my unpaid rent frightened about the future  when you came in i was dazzled  her brow clouds a little  he goes on quickly  that was silly of course but really and truly something happened to me explain it how you will my blood got he hesitates trying to think of a sufficiently unimpassioned word oxygenated my muscles braced my mind cleared my courage rose  thats odd isnt it  considering that i am not at all a sentimental man  gloria uneasily rising  let us go back to the beach  valentine darklylooking up at her  what  you feel it too  gloria  feel what  valentine  dread  gloria  dread  valentine  as if something were going to happen  it came over me suddenly just before you proposed that we should run away to the others  gloria amazed  thats strangevery strange  i had the same presentiment  valentine  how extraordinary  rising  well shall we run away  gloria  run away  oh no that would be childish  she sits down again  he resumes his seat beside her and watches her with a gravely sympathetic air  she is thoughtful and a little troubled as she adds i wonder what is the scientific explanation of those fancies that cross us occasionally  valentine  ah i wonder  its a curiously helpless sensation isnt it  gloria rebelling against the word  helpless  valentine  yes  as if nature after allowing us to belong to ourselves and do what we judged right and reasonable for all these years were suddenly lifting her great hand to take usher two little childrenby the scruffs of our little necks and use us in spite of ourselves for her own purposes in her own way  gloria  isnt that rather fanciful  valentine with a new and startling transition to a tone of utter recklessness  i dont know  i dont care  bursting out reproachfully  oh miss clandon miss clandon how could you  gloria  what have i done  valentine  thrown this enchantment on me  im honestly trying to be sensiblescientificeverything that you wish me to be  butbut oh dont you see what you have set to work in my imagination  gloria with indignant scornful sternness  i hope you are not going to be so foolishso vulgaras to say love  valentine with ironical haste to disclaim such a weakness  no no no  not love we know better than that  lets call it chemistry  you cant deny that there is such a thing as chemical action chemical affinity chemical combinationthe most irresistible of all natural forces  well youre attracting me irresistiblychemically  gloria contemptuously  nonsense  valentine  of course its nonsense you stupid girl  gloria recoils in outraged surprise  yes stupid girl  t h a ts  a scientific fact anyhow  youre a priga feminine prig thats what you are  rising  now i suppose youve done with me for ever  he goes to the iron table and takes up his hat  gloria with elaborate calm sitting up like a highschoolmistress posing to be photographed  that shows how very little you understand my real character  i am not in the least offended  he pauses and puts his hat down again  i am always willing to be told of my own defects mr valentine by my friends even when they are as absurdly mistaken about me as you are  i have many faultsvery serious faultsof character and temper but if there is one thing that i am not it is what you call a prig  she closes her lips trimly and looks steadily and challengingly at him as she sits more collectedly than ever  valentine returning to the end of the garden seat to confront her more emphatically  oh yes you are  my reason tells me so my knowledge tells me so my experience tells me so  gloria  excuse my reminding you that your reason and your knowledge and your experience are not infallible  at least i hope not  valentine  i must believe them  unless you wish me to believe my eyes my heart my instincts my imagination which are all telling me the most monstrous lies about you  gloria the collectedness beginning to relax  lies  valentine obstinately  yes lies  he sits down again beside her  do you expect me to believe that you are the most beautiful woman in the world  gloria  that is ridiculous and rather personal  valentine  of course its ridiculous  well thats what my eyes tell me  gloria makes a movement of contemptuous protest  no im not flattering  i tell you i dont believe it  she is ashamed to find that this does not quite please her either  do you think that if you were to turn away in disgust from my weakness i should sit down here and cry like a child  gloria beginning to find that she must speak shortly and pointedly to keep her voice steady  why should you pray  valentine with a stir of feeling beginning to agitate his voice of course not im not such an idiot  and yet my heart tells me i shouldmy fool of a heart  but ill argue with my heart and bring it to reason  if i loved you a thousand times ill force myself to look the truth steadily in the face  after all its easy to be sensible the facts are the facts  whats this place its not heaven its the marine hotel  whats the time its not eternity its about half past one in the afternoon  what am i a dentista five shilling dentist  gloria  and i am a feminine prig  valentine passionately  no no i cant face that i must have one illusion leftthe illusion about you  i love you  he turns towards her as if the impulse to touch her were ungovernable she rises and stands on her guard wrathfully  he springs up impatiently and retreats a step  oh what a fool i aman idiot  you dont understand i might as well talk to the stones on the beach  he turns away discouraged  gloria reassured by his withdrawal and a little remorseful  i am sorry  i do not mean to be unsympathetic mr valentine but what can i say  valentine returning to her with all his recklessness of manner replaced by an engaging and chivalrous respect  you can say nothing miss clandon  i beg your pardon it was my own fault or rather my own bad luck  you see it all depended on your naturally liking me  she is about to speak he stops her deprecatingly  oh i know you mustnt tell me whether you like me or not but  gloria her principles up in arms at once  must not  why not  i am a free woman why should i not tell you  valentine pleading in terror and retreating  dont  im afraid to hear  gloria no longer scornful  you need not be afraid  i think you are sentimental and a little foolish but i like you  valentine dropping into the iron chair as if crushed  then its all over  he becomes the picture of despair  gloria puzzled approaching him  but why  valentine  because liking is not enough  now that i think down into it seriously i dont know whether i like you or not  gloria looking down at him with wondering concern  im sorry  valentine in an agony of restrained passion  oh dont pity me your voice is tearing my heart to pieces  let me alone gloria  you go down into the very depths of me troubling and stirring mei cant struggle with iti cant tell you  gloria breaking down suddenly  oh stop telling me what you feel i cant bear it  valentine springing up triumphantly the agonized voice now solid ringing and jubilant  ah its come at lastmy moment of courage he seizes her hands she looks at him in terror  our moment of courage  he draws her to him kisses her with impetuous strength and laughs boyishly  now youve done it gloria  its all over were in love with one another  she can only gasp at him  but what a dragon you were  and how hideously afraid i was  philips voice calling from the beach  valentine  dollys voice  mr valentine  valentine  goodbye  forgive me  he rapidly kisses her hands and runs away to the steps where he meets mrs clandon ascending  gloria quite lost can only start after him  mrs clandon  the children want you mr valentine  she looks anxiously around  is he gone  valentine puzzled he  recollecting  oh crampton  gone this long time mrs clandon  he runs off buoyantly down the steps  gloria sinking upon the seat mother  mrs clandon hurrying to her in alarm  what is it dear  gloria with heartfelt appealing reproach  why didnt you educate me properly  mrs clandon amazed  my child i did my best  gloria  oh you taught me nothingnothing  mrs clandon  what is the matter with you  gloria with the most intense expression  only shameshame shame  blushing unendurably she covers her face with her hands and turns away from her mother  end of act ii    act iii   the clandons sitting room in the hotel  an expensive apartment on the ground floor with a french window leading to the gardens  in the centre of the room is a substantial table surrounded by chairs and draped with a maroon cloth on which opulently bound hotel and railway guides are displayed  a visitor entering through the window and coming down to this central table would have the fireplace on his left and a writing table against the wall on his right next the door which is further down  he would if his taste lay that way admire the wall decoration of lincrusta walton in plum color and bronze lacquer with dado and cornice the ormolu consoles in the corners the vases on pillar pedestals of veined marble with bases of polished black wood one on each side of the window the ornamental cabinet next the vase on the side nearest the fireplace its centre compartment closed by an inlaid door and its corners rounded off with curved panes of glass protecting shelves of cheap blue and white pottery the bamboo tea table with folding shelves in the corresponding space on the other side of the window the pictures of ocean steamers and landseers dogs the saddlebag ottoman in line with the door but on the other side of the room the two comfortable seats of the same pattern on the hearthrug and finally on turning round and looking up the massive brass pole above the window sustaining a pair of maroon rep curtains with decorated borders of staid green  altogether a room well arranged to flatter the occupants sense of importance and reconcile him to a charge of a pound a day for its use  mrs clandon sits at the writing table correcting proofs  gloria is standing at the window looking out in a tormented revery  the clock on the mantelpiece strikes five with a sickly clink the bell being unable to bear up against the black marble cenotaph in which it is immured  mrs clandon  five  i dont think we need wait any longer for the children  the are sure to get tea somewhere  gloria wearily  shall i ring  mrs clandon  do my dear  gloria goes to the hearth and rings i have finished these proofs at last thank goodness  gloria strolling listlessly across the room and coming behind her mothers chair  what proofs  mrs clandon  the new edition of twentieth century women  gloria with a bitter smile  theres a chapter missing  mrs clandon beginning to hunt among her proofs  is there  surely not  gloria  i mean an unwritten one  perhaps i shall write it for you when i know the end of it  she goes back to the window  mrs clandon  gloria  more enigmas  gloria  oh no  the same enigma  mrs clandon puzzled and rather troubled after watching her for a moment  my dear  gloria returning  yes  mrs clandon  you know i never ask questions  gloria kneeling beside her chair  i know i know  she suddenly throws her arms about her mother and embraces her almost passionately  mrs clandon gently smiling but embarrassed  my dear you are getting quite sentimental  gloria recoiling  ah no no  oh dont say that  oh  she rises and turns away with a gesture as if tearing herself  mrs clandon mildly  my dear what is the matter  what the waiter enters with the tea tray  waiter balmily  this was what you rang for maam i hope  mrs clandon  thank you yes  she turns her chair away from the writing table and sits down again  gloria crosses to the hearth and sits crouching there with her face averted  waiter placing the tray temporarily on the centre table  i thought so maam  curious how the nerves seem to give out in the afternoon without a cup of tea  he fetches the tea table and places it in front of mrs cladon conversing meanwhile  the young lady and gentleman have just come back maam they have been out in a boat maam  very pleasant on a fine afternoon like thisvery pleasant and invigorating indeed  he takes the tray from the centre table and puts it on the tea table  mr mccomas will not come to tea maam he has gone to call upon mr crampton  he takes a couple of chairs and sets one at each end of the tea table  gloria looking round with an impulse of terror  and the other gentleman  waiter reassuringly as he unconsciously drops for a moment into the measure of ive been roaming which he sang as a boy  oh hes coming miss hes coming  he has been rowing the boat miss and has just run down the road to the chemists for something to put on the blisters  but he will be here directly missdirectly  gloria in ungovernable apprehension rises and hurries towards the door  mrs clandon half rising  glo  gloria goes out  mrs clandon looks perplexedly at the waiter whose composure is unruffled  waiter cheerfully  anything more maam  mrs clandon  nothing thank you  waiter  thank you maam  as he withdraws phil and dolly in the highest spirits come tearing in  he holds the door open for them then goes out and closes it  dolly ravenously  oh give me some tea  mrs clandon pours out a cup for her  weve been out in a boat  valentine will be here presently  philip  he is unaccustomed to navigation  wheres gloria  mrs clandon anxiously as she pours out his tea  phil there is something the matter with gloria  has anything happened  phil and dolly look at one another and stifle a laugh  what is it  philip sitting down on her left  romeo  dolly sitting down on her right  and juliet  philip taking his cup of tea from mrs clandon  yes my dear mother the old old story  dolly dont take all the milk he deftly takes the jug from her  yes in the spring  dolly  a young mans fancy  philip lightly turns tothank you to mrs clandon who has passed the biscuits thoughts of love  it also occurs in the autumn the young man in this case is  dolly  valentine  philip  and his fancy has turned to gloria to the extent of  dolly   kissing her  philip  on the terrace  dolly correcting him  on the lips before everybody  mrs clandon incredulously  phil  dolly  are you joking  they shake their heads  did she allow it  philip  we waited to see him struck to earth by the lightning of her scorn  dolly  but he wasnt  philip  she appeared to like it  dolly  as far as we could judge  stopping phil who is about to pour out another cup  no youve sworn off two cups  mrs clandon much troubled  children you must not be here when mr valentine comes  i must speak very seriously to him about this  philip  to ask him his intentions  what a violation of twentieth century principles  dolly  quite right mamma bring him to book  make the most of the nineteenth century while it lasts  philip  sh  here he is  valentine comes in  valentine  very sorry to be late for tea mrs clandon  she takes up the teapot  no thank you i never take any  no doubt miss dolly and phil have explained what happened to me  philip momentously rising  yes valentine we have explained  dolly significantly also rising  we have explained very thoroughly  philip  it was our duty  very seriously  come dolly  he offers dolly his arm which she takes  they look sadly at him and go out gravely arm in arm  valentine stares after them puzzled then looks at mrs clandon for an explanation  mrs clandon rising and leaving the tea table  will you sit down mr valentine  i want to speak to you a little if you will allow me valentine sits down slowly on the ottoman his conscience presaging a bad quarter of an hour  mrs clandon takes phils chair and seats herself deliberately at a convenient distance from him  i must begin by throwing myself somewhat at your consideration  i am going to speak of a subject of which i know very littleperhaps nothing  i mean love  valentine  love  mrs clandon  yes love  oh you need not look so alarmed as that mr valentine i am not in love with you  valentine overwhelmed  oh really mrs recovering himself i should be only too proud if you were  mrs clandon  thank you mr valentine  but i am too old to begin  valentine  begin  have you never  mrs clandon  never  my case is a very common one mr valentine i married before i was old enough to know what i was doing  as you have seen for yourself the result was a bitter disappointment for both my husband and myself  so you see though i am a married woman i have never been in love i have never had a love affair and to be quite frank with you mr valentine what i have seen of the love affairs of other people has not led me to regret that deficiency in my experience valentine looking very glum glances sceptically at her and says nothing  her color rises a little and she adds with restrained anger you do not believe me  valentine confused at having his thought read  oh why not  why not  mrs clandon  let me tell you mr valentine that a life devoted to the cause of humanity has enthusiasms and passions to offer which far transcend the selfish personal infatuations and sentimentalities of romance those are not your enthusiasms and passions i take it valentine quite aware that she despises him for it answers in the negative with a melancholy shake of the head  i thought not  well i am equally at a disadvantage in discussing those socalled affairs of the heart in which you appear to be an expert  valentine restlessly  what are you driving at mrs clandon  mrs clandon  i think you know  valentine  gloria  mrs clandon  yes  gloria  valentine surrendering  well yes im in love with gloria interposing as she is about to speak  i know what youre going to say ive no money  mrs clandon  i care very little about money mr valentine  valentine  then youre very different to all the other mothers who have interviewed me  mrs clandon  ah now we are coming to it mr valentine  you are an old hand at this  he opens his mouth to protest she cuts him short with some indignation  oh do you think little as i understand these matters that i have not common sense enough to know that a man who could make as much way in one interview with such a woman as my daughter can hardly be a novice  valentine i assure you  mrs clandon stopping him  i am not blaming you mr valentine  it is glorias business to take care of herself and you have a right to amuse yourself as you please  but  valentine protesting  amuse myself  oh mrs clandon  mrs clandon relentlessly  on your honor mr valentine are you in earnest  valentine desperately  on my honor i am in earnest  she looks searchingly at him  his sense of humor gets the better of him and he adds quaintly  only i always have been in earnest and yethere i am you see  mrs clandon  this is just what i suspected  severely  mr valentine you are one of those men who play with womens affections  valentine  well why not if the cause of humanity is the only thing worth being serious about  however i understand  rising and taking his hat with formal politeness  you wish me to discontinue my visits  mrs clandon  no i am sensible enough to be well aware that glorias best chance of escape from you now is to become better acquainted with you  valentine unaffectedly alarmed  oh dont say that mrs clandon you dont think that do you  mrs clandon  i have great faith mr valentine in the sound training glorias mind has had since she was a child  valentine amazingly relieved  ooh  oh thats all right  he sits down again and throws his hat flippantly aside with the air of a man who has no longer anything to fear  mrs clandon indignant at his assurance  what do you mean  valentine turning confidentially to her  come shall i teach you something mrs clandon  mrs clandon stiffly  i am always willing to learn  valentine  have you ever studied the subject of gunneryartillery cannons and warships and so on  mrs clandon  has gunnery anything to do with gloria  valentine  a great dealby way of illustration  during this whole century my dear mrs clandon the progress of artillery has been a duel between the maker of cannons and the maker of armor plates to keep the cannon balls out  you build a ship proof against the best gun known somebody makes a better gun and sinks your ship  you build a heavier ship proof against that gun somebody makes a heavier gun and sinks you again  and so on  well the duel of sex is just like that  mrs clandon  the duel of sex  valentine  yes youve heard of the duel of sex havent you  oh i forgot youve been in madeira the expression has come up since your time  need i explain it  mrs clandon contemptuously  no  valentine  of course not  now what happens in the duel of sex  the old fashioned mother received an old fashioned education to protect her against the wiles of man  well you know the result the old fashioned man got round her  the old fashioned woman resolved to protect her daughter more effectuallyto find some armor too strong for the old fashioned man  so she gave her daughter a scientific educationyour plan  that was a corker for the old fashioned man he said it wasnt fairunwomanly and all the rest of it  but that didnt do him any good  so he had to give up his old fashioned plan of attackyou know going down on his knees and swearing to love honor and obey and so on  mrs clandon  excuse me that was what the woman swore  valentine  was it  ah perhaps youre rightyes of course it was  well what did the man do  just what the artillery man does went one better than the womaneducated himself scientifically and beat her at that game just as he had beaten her at the old game  i learnt how to circumvent the womens rights woman before i was twenty three its all been found out long ago  you see my methods are thoroughly modern  mrs clandon with quiet disgust  no doubt  valentine  but for that very reason theres one sort of girl against whom they are of no use  mrs clandon  pray which sort  valentine  the thoroughly old fashioned girl  if you had brought up gloria in the old way it would have taken me eighteen months to get to the point i got to this afternoon in eighteen minutes  yes mrs clandon the higher education of women delivered gloria into my hands and it was you who taught her to believe in the higher education of women  mrs clandon rising  mr valentine you are very clever  valentine rising also  oh mrs clandon  mrs clandon  and you have taught me  n o t h i n g  goodbye  valentine horrified  goodbye  oh maynt i see her before i go  mrs clandon  i am afraid she will not return until you have gone mr valentine  she left the room expressly to avoid you  valentine thoughtfully  thats a good sign  goodbye  he bows and makes for the door apparently well satisfied  mrs clandon alarmed  why do you think it a good sign  valentine turning near the door  because i am mortally afraid of her and it looks as if she were mortally afraid of me  he turns to go and finds himself face to face with gloria who has just entered  she looks steadfastly at him  he stares helplessly at her then round at mrs clandon then at gloria again completely at a loss  gloria white and controlling herself with difficulty  mother is what dolly told me true  mrs clandon  what did she tell you dear  gloria  that you have been speaking about me to this gentleman  valentine murmuring  this gentleman  oh  mrs clandon sharply  mr valentine can you hold your tongue for a moment  he looks piteously at them then with a despairing shrug goes  back to the ottoman and throws his hat on it  gloria confronting her mother with deep reproach  mother what right had you to do it  mrs clandon  i dont think i have said anything i have no right to say gloria  valentine confirming her officiously  nothing  nothing whatever gloria looks at him with unspeakable indignation  i beg your pardon he sits down ignominiously on the ottoman  gloria  i cannot believe that any one has any right even to think about things that concern me only  she turns away from them to conceal a painful struggle with her emotion  mrs clandon  my dear if i have wounded your pride  gloria turning on them for a moment  my  p r i d e  my pride oh its gone i have learnt now that i have no strength to be proud of turning away again  but if a woman cannot protect herself no one can protect her  no one has any right to trynot even her mother  i know i have lost your confidence just as i have lost this mans respect she stops to master a sob  valentine under his breath  this man  murmuring again  oh  mrs clandon in an undertone  pray be silent sir  gloria continuing  but i have at least the right to be left alone in my disgrace  i am one of those weak creatures born to be mastered by the first man whose eye is caught by them and i must fulfill my destiny i suppose  at least spare me the humiliation of trying to save me  she sits down with her handkerchief to her eyes at the farther end of the table  valentine jumping up  look here  mrs clandon  mr va  valentine recklessly  no i will speak ive been silent for nearly thirty seconds  he goes up to gloria  miss clandon  gloria bitterly  oh not miss clandon you have found that it is quite safe to call me gloria  valentine  no i wont youll throw it in my teeth afterwards and accuse me of disrespect  i say its a heartbreaking falsehood that i dont respect you  its true that i didnt respect your old pride why should i  it was nothing but cowardice  i didnt respect your intellect ive a better one myself its a masculine specialty  but when the depths stirredwhen my moment camewhen you made me braveah then then t h e n  gloria  then you respected me i suppose  valentine  no i didnt i adored you  she rises quickly and turns her back on him  and you can never take that moment away from me  so now i dont care what happens  he comes down the room addressing a cheerful explanation to nobody in particular  im perfectly aware that im talking nonsense  i cant help it  to mrs clandon  i love gloria and theres an end of it  mrs clandon emphatically  mr valentine you are a most dangerous man  gloria come here  gloria wondering a little at the command obeys and stands with drooping head on her mothers right hand valentine being on the opposite side  mrs clandon then begins with intense scorn  ask this man whom you have inspired and made brave how many women have inspired him before gloria looks up suddenly with a flash of jealous anger and amazement how many times he has laid the trap in which he has caught you how often he has baited it with the same speeches how much practice it has taken to make him perfect in his chosen part in life as the duellist of sex  valentine  this isnt fair  youre abusing my confidence mrs clandon  mrs clandon  ask him gloria  gloria in a flush of rage going over to him with her fists clenched  is that true  valentine  dont be angry  gloria interrupting him implacably  is it true  did you ever say that before  did you ever feel that beforefor another woman  valentine bluntly  yes  gloria raises her clenched hands  mrs clandon horrified springing to her side and catching her uplifted arm  gloria  my dear  youre forgetting yourself gloria with a deep expiration slowly relaxes her threatening attitude  valentine  remember a mans power of love and admiration is like any other of his powers he has to throw it away many times before he learns what is really worthy of it  mrs clandon  another of the old speeches gloria  take care  valentine remonstrating  oh  gloria to mrs clandon with contemptuous selfpossession  do you think i need to be warned now  to valentine  you have tried to make me love you  valentine  i have  gloria  well you have succeeded in making me hate you passionately  valentine philosophically  its surprising how little difference there is between the two  gloria turns indignantly away from him  he continues to mrs clandon  i know men whose wives love them and they go on exactly like that  mrs clandon  excuse me mr valentine but had you not better go  gloria  you need not send him away on my account mother  he is nothing to me now and he will amuse dolly and phil  she sits down with slighting indifference at the end of the table nearest the window  valentine gaily  of course thats the sensible way of looking at it  come mrs clandon you cant quarrel with a mere butterfly like me  mrs clandon  i very greatly mistrust you mr valentine  but i do not like to think that your unfortunate levity of disposition is mere shamelessness and worthlessness  gloria to herself but aloud  it is shameless and it is worthless  mrs clandon  so perhaps we had better send for phil and dolly and allow you to end your visit in the ordinary way  valentine as if she had paid him the highest compliment  you overwhelm me mrs clandon  thank you  the waiter enters  waiter  mr mccomas maam  mrs clandon  oh certainly  bring him in  waiter  he wishes to see you in the receptionroom maam  mrs clandon  why not here  waiter  well if you will excuse my mentioning it maam i think mr mccomas feels that he would get fairer play if he could speak to you away from the younger members of your family maam  mrs clandon  tell him they are not here  waiter  they are within sight of the door maam and very watchful for some reason or other  mrs clandon going  oh very well ill go to him  waiter holding the door open for her  thank you maam  she goes out  he comes back into the room and meets the eye of valentine who wants him to go  all right sir  only the teathings sir  taking the tray  excuse me sir  thank you sir  he goes out  valentine to gloria  look here  you will forgive me sooner or later  forgive me now  gloria rising to level the declaration more intensely at him never  while grass grows or water runs never never never  valentine unabashed  well i dont care  i cant be unhappy about anything  i shall never be unhappy again never never never while grass grows or water runs  the thought of you will always make me wild with joy  some quick taunt is on her lips he interposes swiftly no i never said that before thats new  gloria  it will not be new when you say it to the next woman  valentine  oh dont gloria dont  he kneels at her feet  gloria  get up  get up  how dare you  phil and dolly racing as usual for first place burst into the room  they check themselves on seeing what is passing  valentine springs up  philip discreetly  i beg your pardon  come dolly  he turns to go  gloria annoyed  mother will be back in a moment phil severely  please wait here for her  she turns away to the window where she stands looking out with her back to them  philip significantly  oh indeed  hmhm  dolly  ahah  philip  you seem in excellent spirits valentine  valentine  i am  comes between them  now look here  you both know whats going on dont you  gloria turns quickly as if anticipating some fresh outrage  dolly  perfectly  valentine  well its all over  ive been refusedscorned  im only here on sufferance  you understand its all over  your sister is in no sense entertaining my addresses or condescending to interest herself in me in any way  gloria satisfied turns back contemptuously to the window  is that clear  dolly  serve you right  you were in too great a hurry  philip patting him on the shoulder  never mind youd never have been able to call your soul your own if shed married you  you can now begin a new chapter in your life  dolly  chapter seventeen or thereabouts i should imagine  valentine much put out by this pleasantry  no dont say things like that  thats just the sort of thoughtless remark that makes a lot of mischief  dolly  oh indeed  hmhm  philip  ahah  he goes to the hearth and plants himself there in his best headofthefamily attitude  mccomas looking very serious comes in quickly with mrs clandon whose first anxiety is about gloria  she looks round to see where she is and is going to join her at the window when gloria comes down to meet her with a marked air of trust and affection  finally mrs clandon takes her former seat and gloria posts herself behind it mccomas on his way to the ottoman is hailed by dolly  dolly  what cheer finch  mccomas sternly  very serious news from your father miss clandon very serious news indeed  he crosses to the ottoman and sits down dolly looking deeply impressed follows him and sits beside him on his right  valentine  perhaps i had better go  mccomas  by no means mr valentine  you are deeply concerned in this  valentine takes a chair from the table and sits astride of it leaning over the back near the ottoman  mrs clandon your husband demands the custody of his two younger children who are not of age mrs clandon in quick alarm looks instinctively to see if dolly is safe  dolly touched  oh how nice of him  he likes us mamma  mccomas  i am sorry to have to disabuse you of any such idea miss dorothea  dolly cooing ecstatically  dorotheeeeeea  nestling against his shoulder quite overcome  oh finch  mccomas nervously moving away  no no no no  mrs clandon remonstrating  d e a r e s t  dolly  to mccomas the deed of separation gives me the custody of the children  mccomas  it also contains a covenant that you are not to approach or molest him in any way  mrs clandon  well have i done so  mccomas  whether the behavior of your younger children amounts to legal molestation is a question on which it may be necessary to take counsels opinion  at all events mr crampton not only claims to have been molested but he believes that he was brought here by a plot in which mr valentine acted as your agent  valentine  whats that  eh  mccomas  he alleges that you drugged him mr valentine  valentine  so i did  they are astonished  mccomas  but what did you do that for  dolly  five shillings extra  mccomas to dolly shorttemperedly  i must really ask you miss clandon not to interrupt this very serious conversation with irrelevant interjections  vehemently  i insist on having earnest matters earnestly and reverently discussed  this outburst produces an apologetic silence and puts mccomas himself out of countenance  he coughs and starts afresh addressing himself to gloria  miss clandon it is my duty to tell you that your father has also persuaded himself that mr valentine wishes to marry you  valentine interposing adroitly  i do  mccomas offended  in that case sir you must not be surprised to find yourself regarded by the young ladys father as a fortune hunter  valentine  so i am  do you expect my wife to live on what i earn tenpence a week  mccomas revolted  i have nothing more to say sir  i shall return and tell mr crampton that this family is no place for a father  he makes for the door  mrs clandon with quiet authority  finch  he halts  if mr valentine cannot be serious you can  sit down  mccomas after a brief struggle between his dignity and his friendship succumbs seating himself this time midway between dolly and mrs clandon  you know that all this is a made up casethat fergus does not believe in it any more than you do  now give me your real adviceyour sincere friendly advice you know i have always trusted your judgment  i promise you the children will be quiet  mccomas resigning himself  well well  what i want to say is this  in the old arrangement with your husband mrs clandon you had him at a terrible disadvantage  mrs clandon  how so pray  mccomas  well you were an advanced woman accustomed to defy public opinion and with no regard for what the world might say of you  mrs clandon proud of it  yes that is true  gloria behind the chair stoops and kisses her mothers hair a demonstration which disconcerts her extremely  mccomas  on the other hand mrs clandon your husband had a great horror of anything getting into the papers  there was his business to be considered as well as the prejudices of an oldfashioned family  mrs clandon  not to mention his own prejudices  mccomas  now no doubt he behaved badly mrs clandon  mrs clandon scornfully  no doubt  mccomas  but was it altogether his fault  mrs clandon  was it mine  mccomas hastily  no  of course not  gloria observing him attentively  you do not mean that mr mccomas  mccomas  my dear young lady you pick me up very sharply  but let me just put this to you  when a man makes an unsuitable marriage nobodys fault you know but purely accidental incompatibility of tastes when he is deprived by that misfortune of the domestic sympathy which i take it is what a man marries for when in short his wife is rather worse than no wife at all through no fault of his own of course is it to be wondered at if he makes matters worse at first by blaming her and even in his desperation by occasionally drinking himself into a violent condition or seeking sympathy elsewhere  mrs clandon  i did not blame him i simply rescued myself and the children from him  mccomas  yes but you made hard terms mrs clandon  you had him at your mercy you brought him to his knees when you threatened to make the matter public by applying to the courts for a judicial separation suppose he had had that power over you and used it to take your children away from you and bring them up in ignorance of your very name how would you feel what would you do  well wont you make some allowance for his feelingsin common humanity  mrs clandon  i never discovered his feelings  i discovered his temper and his she shivers the rest of his common humanity  mccomas wistfully  women can be very hard mrs clandon  valentine  thats true  gloria angrily  be silent  he subsides  mccomas rallying all his forces  let me make one last appeal mrs clandon believe me there are men who have a good deal of feeling and kind feeling too which they are not able to express  what you miss in crampton is that mere veneer of civilization the art of shewing worthless attentions and paying insincere compliments in a kindly charming way  if you lived in london where the whole system is one of false goodfellowship and you may know a man for twenty years without finding out that he hates you like poison you would soon have your eyes opened  there we do unkind things in a kind way we say bitter things in a sweet voice we always give our friends chloroform when we tear them to pieces  but think of the other side of it  think of the people who do kind things in an unkind waypeople whose touch hurts whose voices jar whose tempers play them false who wound and worry the people they love in the very act of trying to conciliate them and yet who need affection as much as the rest of us  crampton has an abominable temper i admit  he has no manners no tact no grace hell never be able to gain anyones affection unless they will take his desire for it on trust  is he to have nonenot even pityfrom his own flesh and blood  dolly quite melted  oh how beautiful finch  how nice of you  philip with conviction  finch this is eloquencepositive eloquence  dolly  oh mamma let us give him another chance  let us have him to dinner  mrs clandon unmoved  no dolly i hardly got any lunch  my dear finch there is not the least use in talking to me about fergus  you have never been married to him i have  mccomas to gloria   miss clandon i have hitherto refrained from appealing to you because if what mr crampton told me to be true you have been more merciless even than your mother  gloria defiantly  you appeal from her strength to my weakness  mccomas  not your weakness miss clandon  i appeal from her intellect to your heart  gloria  i have learnt to mistrust my heart  with an angry glance at valentine  i would tear my heart and throw it away if i could  my answer to you is my mothers answer  she goes to mrs clandon and stands with her arm about her but mrs clandon unable to endure this sort of demonstrativeness disengages herself as soon as she can without hurting glorias feelings  mccomas defeated  well i am very sorryvery sorry  i have done my best  he rises and prepares to go deeply dissatisfied  mrs clandon  but what did you expect finch  what do you want us to do  mccomas  the first step for both you and crampton is to obtain counsels opinion as to whether he is bound by the deed of separation or not  now why not obtain this opinion at once and have a friendly meeting her face hardensor shall we say a neutral meeting to settle the difficultyherein this hoteltonight  what do you say  mrs clandon  but where is the counsels opinion to come from  mccomas  it has dropped down on us out of the clouds  on my way back here from cramptons i met a most eminent qc a man whom i briefed in the case that made his name for him  he has come down here from saturday to monday for the sea air and to visit a relative of his who lives here  he has been good enough to say that if i can arrange a meeting of the parties he will come and help us with his opinion  now do let us seize this chance of a quiet friendly family adjustment  let me bring my friend here and try to persuade crampton to come too come consent  mrs clandon rather ominously after a moments consideration finch i dont want counsels opinion because i intend to be guided by my own opinion  i dont want to meet fergus again because i dont like him and dont believe the meeting will do any good  however rising you have persuaded the children that he is not quite hopeless  do as you please  mccomas taking her hand and shaking it  thank you mrs clandon will nine oclock suit you  mrs clandon  perfectly  phil will you ring please  phil rings the bell  but if i am to be accused of conspiring with mr valentine i think he had better be present  valentine rising  i quite agree with you  i think its most important  mccomas  there can be no objection to that i think  i have the greatest hopes of a happy settlement  goodbye for the present  he goes out meeting the waiter who holds the door for him to pass through  mrs clandon  we expect some visitors at nine william  can we have dinner at seven instead of halfpast  waiter at the door  seven maam  certainly maam  it will be a convenience to us this busy evening maam  there will be the band and the arranging of the fairy lights and one thing or another maam  dolly  the fairy lights  philip  the band  william what mean you  waiter  the fancy ball miss  dolly and philip simultaneously rushing to him  fancy ball  waiter  oh yes sir  given by the regatta committee for the benefit of the lifeboat sir  to mrs clandon  we often have them maam chinese lanterns in the garden maam very bright and pleasant very gay and innocent indeed  to phil  tickets downstairs at the office sir five shillings ladies half price if accompanied by a gentleman  philip seizing his arm to drag him off  to the office william  dolly breathlessly seizing his other arm  quick before theyre all sold  they rush him out of the room between them  mrs clandon  what on earth are they going to do  going out  i really must go and stop this  she follows them speaking as she disappears  gloria stares coolly at valentine and then deliberately looks at her watch  valentine  i understand  ive stayed too long  im going  gloria with disdainful punctiliousness  i owe you some apology mr valentine  i am conscious of having spoken somewhat sharply perhaps rudelyto you  valentine  not at all  gloria  my only excuse is that it is very difficult to give consideration and respect when there is no dignity of character on the other side to command it  valentine prosaically  how is a man to look dignified when hes infatuated  gloria effectually unstilted  dont say those things to me  i forbid you  they are insults  valentine  no theyre only follies  i cant help them  gloria  if you were really in love it would not make you foolish it would give you dignityearnestnesseven beauty  valentine  do you really think it would make me beautiful  she turns her back on him with the coldest contempt  ah you see youre not in earnest  love cant give any man new gifts  it can only heighten the gifts he was born with  gloria sweeping round at him again  what gifts were you born with pray  valentine  lightness of heart  gloria  and lightness of head and lightness of faith and lightness of everything that makes a man  valentine  yes the whole world is like a feather dancing in the light now and gloria is the sun  she rears her head angrily  i beg your pardon im off  back at nine  goodbye  he runs off gaily leaving her standing in the middle of the room staring after him  end of act iii   act iv   the same room  nine oclock  nobody present  the lamps are lighted but the curtains are not drawn  the window stands wide open and strings of chinese lanterns are glowing among the trees outside with the starry sky beyond  the band is playing dancemusic in the garden drowning the sound of the sea  the waiter enters shewing in crampton and mccomas  crampton looks cowed and anxious  he sits down wearily and timidly on the ottoman  waiter  the ladies have gone for a turn through the grounds to see the fancy dresses sir  if you will be so good as to take seats gentlemen i shall tell them  he is about to go into the garden through the window when mccomas stops him  mccomas  one moment  if another gentleman comes shew him in without any delay we are expecting him  waiter  right sir  what name sir  mccomas  boon  mr boon  he is a stranger to mrs clandon so he may give you a card  if so the name is spelt bohun  you will not forget  waiter smiling  you may depend on me for that sir  my own name is boon sir though i am best known down here as balmy walters sir by rights i should spell it with the aitch you sir but i think it best not to take that liberty sir  there is norman blood in it sir and norman blood is not a recommendation to a waiter  mccomas  well well true hearts are more than coronets and simple faith than norman blood  waiter  that depends a good deal on ones station in life sir  if you were a waiter sir youd find that simple faith would leave you just as short as norman blood  i find it best to spell myself b doubleon and to keep my wits pretty sharp about me  but im taking up your time sir  youll excuse me sir your own fault for being so affable sir  ill tell the ladies youre here sir  he goes out into the garden through the window  mccomas  crampton i can depend on you cant i  crampton  yes yes  ill be quiet  ill be patient  ill do my best  mccomas  remember ive not given you away  ive told them it was all their fault  crampton  you told me that it was all my fault  mccomas  i told you the truth  crampton plaintively  if they will only be fair to me  mccomas  my dear crampton they wont be fair to you its not to be expected from them at their age  if youre going to make impossible conditions of this kind we may as well go back home at once  crampton  but surely i have a right  mccomas intolerantly  you wont get your rights  now once for all crampton did your promises of good behavior only mean that you wont complain if theres nothing to complain of  because if so he moves as if to go  crampton miserably  no no let me alone cant you  ive been bullied enough ive been tormented enough  i tell you ill do my best  but if that girl begins to talk to me like that and to look at me like  he breaks off and buries his head in his hands  mccomas relenting  there there itll be all right if you will only bear and forbear  come pull yourself together theres someone coming  crampton too dejected to care much hardly changes his attitude  gloria enters from the garden mccomas goes to meet her at the window so that he can speak to her without being heard by crampton  there he is miss clandon  be kind to him  ill leave you with him for a moment  he goes into the garden  gloria comes in and strolls coolly down the middle of the room  crampton looking round in alarm  wheres mccomas  gloria listlessly but not unsympathetically  gone outto leave us together  delicacy on his part i suppose  she stops beside him and looks quaintly down at him  well father  crampton a quaint jocosity breaking through his forlornness  well daughter  they look at one another for a moment with a melancholy sense of humor  gloria  shake hands  they shake hands  crampton holding her hand  my dear im afraid i spoke very improperly of your mother this afternoon  gloria  oh dont apologize  i was very high and mighty myself but ive come down since oh yes ive been brought down  she sits on the floor beside his chair  crampton  what has happened to you my child  gloria  oh never mind  i was playing the part of my mothers daughter then but im not im my fathers daughter  looking at him funnily  thats a come down isnt it  crampton angry  what  her odd expression does not alter  he surrenders  well yes my dear i suppose it is i suppose it is she nods sympathetically  im afraid im sometimes a little irritable but i know whats right and reasonable all the time even when i dont act on it  can you believe that  gloria  believe it  why thats myselfmyself all over  i know whats right and dignified and strong and noble just as well as she does but oh the things i do the things i do the things i let other people do  crampton a little grudgingly in spite of himself  as well as she does  you mean your mother  gloria quickly  yes mother  she turns to him on her knees and seizes his hands  now listen  no treason to her no word no thought against her  she is our superioryours and minehigh heavens above us  is that agreed  crampton  yes yes  just as you please my dear  gloria not satisfied letting go his hands and drawing back from him  you dont like her  crampton  my child you havent been married to her  i have  she raises herself slowly to her feet looking at him with growing coldness  she did me a great wrong in marrying me without really caring for me  but after that the wrong was all on my side i dare say  he offers her his hand again  gloria taking it firmly and warningly  take care  thats a dangerous subject  my feelingsmy miserable cowardly womanly feelingsmay be on your side but my conscience is on hers  crampton  im very well content with that division my dear  thank you  valentine arrives  gloria immediately becomes deliberately haughty  valentine  excuse me but its impossible to find a servant to announce one even the never failing william seems to be at the ball  i should have gone myself only i havent five shillings to buy a ticket how are you getting on crampton  better eh  crampton  i am myself again mr valentine no thanks to you  valentine  look at this ungrateful parent of yours miss clandon  i saved him from an excruciating pang and he reviles me  gloria coldly  i am sorry my mother is not here to receive you mr valentine  it is not quite nine oclock and the gentleman of whom mr mccomas spoke the lawyer is not yet come  valentine  oh yes he is  ive met him and talked to him  with gay malice  youll like him miss clandon hes the very incarnation of intellect  you can hear his mind working  gloria ignoring the jibe  where is he  valentine  bought a false nose and gone into the fancy ball  crampton crustily looking at his watch  it seems that everybody has gone to this fancy ball instead of keeping to our appointment here  valentine  oh hell come all right enough that was half an hour ago  i didnt like to borrow five shillings from him and go in with him so i joined the mob and looked through the railings until miss clandon disappeared into the hotel through the window  gloria  so it has come to this that you follow me about in public to stare at me  valentine  yes somebody ought to chain me up  gloria turns her back on him and goes to the fireplace  he takes the snub very philosophically and goes to the opposite side of the room the waiter appears at the window ushering in mrs clandon and mccomas  mrs clandon hurrying in  i am so sorry to have kept you waiting  a grotesquely majestic stranger in a domino and false nose with goggles appears at the window  waiter to the stranger  beg pardon sir but this is a private apartment sir  if you will allow me sir i will shew you to the american bar and supper rooms sir  this way sir  he goes into the gardens leading the way under the impression that the stranger is following him  the majestic one however comes straight into the room to the end of the table where with impressive deliberation he takes off the false nose and then the domino rolling up the nose into the domino  and throwing the bundle on the table like a champion throwing down his glove  he is now seen to be a stout tall man between forty and fifty clean shaven with a midnight oil pallor emphasized by stiff black hair cropped short and oiled and eyebrows like early victorian horsehair upholstery  physically and spiritually a coarsened man in cunning and logic a ruthlessly sharpened one  his bearing as he enters is sufficiently imposing and disquieting but when he speaks his powerful menacing voice impressively articulated speech strong inexorable manner and a terrifying power of intensely critical listening raise the impression produced by him to absolute tremendousness  the stranger  my name is bohun  general awe  have i the honor of addressing mrs clandon  mrs clandon bows  bohun bows  miss clandon  gloria bows  bohun bows  mr clandon  crampton insisting on his rightful name as angrily as he dares  my name is crampton sir  bohun  oh indeed  passing him over without further notice and turning to valentine  are you mr clandon  valentine making it a point of honor not to be impressed by him do i look like it  my name is valentine  i did the drugging  bohun  ah quite so  then mr clandon has not yet arrived  waiter entering anxiously through the window  beg pardon maam but can you tell me what became of that he recognizes bohun and loses all his selfpossession  bohun waits rigidly for him to pull himself together  after a pathetic exhibition of confusion he recovers himself sufficiently to address bohun weakly but coherently  beg pardon sir im sure sir  waswas it you sir  bohun ruthlessly  it was i  waiter brokenly  yes sir  unable to restrain his tears  you in a false nose walter  he sinks faintly into a chair at the table i beg pardon maam im sure  a little giddiness  bohun commandingly  you will excuse him mrs clandon when i inform you that he is my father  waiter heartbroken  oh no no walter  a waiter for your father on the top of a false nose  what will they think of you  mrs clandon going to the waiters chair in her kindest manner  i am delighted to hear it mr bohun  your father has been an excellent friend to us since we came here  bohun bows gravely  waiter shaking his head  oh no maam  its very kind of you very ladylike and affable indeed maam but i should feel at a great disadvantage off my own proper footing  never mind my being the gentlemans father maam it is only the accident of birth after all maam  he gets up feebly  youll all excuse me im sure having interrupted your business  he begins to make his way along the table supporting himself from chair to chair with his eye on the door  bohun  one moment  the waiter stops with a sinking heart  my father was a witness of what passed today was he not mrs clandon  mrs clandon  yes most of it i think  bohun  in that case we shall want him  waiter pleading  i hope it may not be necessary sir  busy evening for me sir with that ball very busy evening indeed sir  bohun inexorably  we shall want you  mrs clandon politely  sit down wont you  waiter earnestly  oh if you please maam i really must draw the line at sitting down  i couldnt let myself be seen doing such a thing maam thank you i am sure all the same  he looks round from face to face wretchedly with an expression that would melt a heart of stone  gloria  dont let us waste time  william only wants to go on taking care of us  i should like a cup of coffee  waiter brightening perceptibly  coffee miss  he gives a little gasp of hope  certainly miss  thank you miss very timely miss very thoughtful and considerate indeed  to mrs clandon timidly but expectantly  anything for you maam  mrs clandon  eroh yes its so hot i think we might have a jug of claret cup  waiter beaming  claret cup maam  certainly maam  gloria  oh well ill have a claret cup instead of coffee  put some cucumber in it  waiter delighted  cucumber miss  yes miss  to bohun anything special for you sir  you dont like cucumber sir  bohun  if mrs clandon will allow mesyphonscotch  waiter  right sir  to crampton  irish for you sir i think sir  crampton assents with a grunt  the waiter looks enquiringly at valentine  valentine  i like the cucumber  waiter  right sir  summing up  claret cup syphon one scotch and one irish  mrs clandon  i think thats right  waiter perfectly happy  right maam  directly maam  thank you  he ambles off through the window having sounded the whole gamut of human happiness from the bottom to the top in a little over two minutes  mccomas  we can begin now i suppose  bohun  we had better wait until mrs clandons husband arrives  crampton  what dy mean  im her husband  bohun instantly pouncing on the inconsistency between this and his previous statement  you said just now your name was crampton  crampton  so it is  mrs clandon  all four     i  gloria         speaking     my  mccomas        simul       mrs  valentine      taneously  you  bohun drowning them in two thunderous words  one moment  dead silence  pray allow me  sit down everybody  they obey humbly gloria takes the saddlebag chair on the hearth  valentine slips around to her side of the room and sits on the ottoman facing the window so that he can look at her  crampton sits on the ottoman with his back to valentines  mrs clandon who has all along kept at the opposite side of the room in order to avoid crampton as much as possible sits near the door with mccomas beside her on her left  bohun places himself magisterially in the centre of the group near the corner of the table on mrs clandons side  when they are settled he fixes crampton with his eye and begins  in this family it appears the husbands name is crampton the wifes clandon  thus we have on the very threshold of the case an element of confusion  valentine getting up and speaking across to him with one knee on the ottoman  but its perfectly simple  bohun annihilating him with a vocal thunderbolt  it is  mrs clandon has adopted another name  that is the obvious explanation which you feared i could not find out for myself  you mistrust my intelligence mr valentine stopping him as he is about to protest no i dont want you to answer that i want you to think over it when you feel your next impulse to interrupt me  valentine dazed  this is simply breaking a butterfly on a wheel what does it matter  he sits down again  bohun  i will tell you what it matters sir  it matters that if this family difference is to be smoothed over as we all hope it may be mrs clandon as a matter of social convenience and decency will have to resume her husbands name  mrs clandon assumes an expression of the most determined obstinacy  or else mr crampton will have to call himself mr clandon  crampton looks indomitably resolved to do nothing of the sort  no doubt you think that an easy matter mr valentine he looks pointedly at mrs clandon then at crampton  i differ from you  he throws himself back in his chair frowning heavily  mccomas timidly  i think bohun we had perhaps better dispose of the important questions first  bohun  mccomas there will be no difficulty about the important questions  there never is  it is the trifles that will wreck you at the harbor mouth  mccomas looks as if he considered this a paradox you dont agree with me eh  mccomas flatteringly  if i did  bohun interrupting him  if you did you would be me instead of being what you are  mccomas fawning on him  of course bohun your specialty  bohun again interrupting him  my specialty is being right when other people are wrong  if you agreed with me i should be of no use here  he nods at him to drive the point home then turns suddenly and forcibly on crampton  now you mr crampton what point in this business have you most at heart  crampton beginning slowly  i wish to put all considerations of self aside in this matter  bohun interrupting him  so do we all mr crampton  to mrs clandon  y o u  wish to put self aside mrs clandon  mrs clandon  yes i am not consulting my own feelings in being here  bohun  so do you miss clandon  gloria  yes  bohun  i thought so  we all do  valentine  except me  my aims are selfish  bohun  thats because you think an impression of sincerity will produce a better effect on miss clandon than an impression of disinterestedness  valentine utterly dismantled and destroyed by this just remark takes refuge in a feeble speechless smile  bohun satisfied at having now effectually crushed all rebellion throws himself back in his chair with an air of being prepared to listen tolerantly to their grievances  now mr crampton go on  its understood that self is put aside  human nature always begins by saying that  crampton  but i mean it sir  bohun  quite so  now for your point  crampton  every reasonable person will admit that its an unselfish onethe children  bohun   well  what about the children  crampton with emotion  they have  bohun pouncing forward again  stop  youre going to tell me about your feelings mr crampton  dont i sympathize with them but theyre not my business  tell us exactly what you want thats what we have to get at  crampton uneasily  its a very difficult question to answer mr bohun  bohun  come ill help you out  what do you object to in the present circumstances of the children  crampton  i object to the way they have been brought up  bohun  how do you propose to alter that now  crampton  i think they ought to dress more quietly  valentine  nonsense  bohun instantly flinging himself back in his chair outraged by the interruption  when you are done mr valentinewhen you are quite done  valentine  whats wrong with miss clandons dress  crampton hotly to valentine  my opinion is as good as yours  gloria warningly  father  crampton subsiding piteously  i didnt mean you my dear pleading earnestly to bohun  but the two younger ones you have not seen them mr bohun and indeed i think you would agree with me that there is something very noticeable something almost gay and frivolous in their style of dressing  mrs clandon impatiently  do you suppose i choose their clothes for them  really this is childish  crampton furious rising  childish  mrs clandon rises indignantly  mccomas    all ris    crampton you promised  valentine   ing and     ridiculous  they dress              speaking      charmingly  gloria      together  pray let us behave reasonably  tumult  suddenly they hear a chime of glasses in the room behind them  they turn in silent surprise and find that the waiter has just come back from the bar in the garden and is jingling his tray warningly as he comes softly to the table with it  waiter to crampton setting a tumbler apart on the table  irish for you sir  crampton sits down a little shamefacedly  the waiter sets another tumbler and a syphon apart saying to bohun scotch and syphon for you sir  bohun waves his hand impatiently  the waiter places a large glass jug in the middle  and claret cup  all subside into their seats  peace reigns  mrs clandon humbly to bohun  i am afraid we interrupted you mr bohun  bohun calmly  you did  to the waiter who is going out  just wait a bit  waiter  yes sir  certainly sir  he takes his stand behind bohuns chair  mrs clandon to the waiter  you dont mind our detaining you i hope  mr bohun wishes it  waiter now quite at his ease  oh no maam not at all maam it is a pleasure to me to watch the working of his trained and powerful mindvery stimulating very entertaining and instructive indeed maam  bohun resuming command of the proceedings  now mr crampton we are waiting for you  do you give up your objection to the dressing or do you stick to it  crampton pleading  mr bohun consider my position for a moment i havent got myself alone to consider theres my sister sophronia and my brotherinlaw and all their circle  they have a great horror of anything that is at allat allwell  bohun  out with it  fast  loud  gay  crampton  not in any unprincipled sense of course butbut blurting it out desperately those two children would shock them theyre not fit to mix with their own people  thats what i complain of  mrs clandon with suppressed impatience  mr valentine do you think there is anything fast or loud about phil and dolly  valentine  certainly not  its utter bosh  nothing can be in better taste  crampton  oh yes of course you say so  mrs clandon  william you see a great deal of good english society are my children overdressed  waiter reassuringly  oh dear no maam  persuasively  oh no sir not at all  a little pretty and tasty no doubt but very choice and classyvery genteel and high toned indeed  might be the son and daughter of a dean sir i assure you sir  you have only to look at them sir to at this moment a harlequin and columbine dancing to the music of the band in the garden which has just reached the coda of a waltz whirl one another into the room  the harlequins dress is made of lozenges an inch square of turquoise blue silk and gold alternately  his hat is gilt and his mask turned up  the columbines petticoats are the epitome of a harvest field golden orange and poppy crimson with a tiny velvet jacket for the poppy stamens they pass an exquisite and dazzling apparition between mccomas and bohun and then back in a circle to the end of the table where as the final chord of the waltz is struck they make a tableau in the middle of the company the harlequin down on his left knee and the columbine standing on his right knee with her arms curved over her head  unlike their dancing which is charmingly graceful their attitudinizing is hardly a success and threatens to end in a catastrophe  the columbine screaming  lift me down somebody im going to fall  papa lift me down  crampton anxiously running to her and taking her hands  my child  dolly jumping down with his help  thanks so nice of you  phil putting his hat into his belt sits on the side of the table and pours out some claret cup  crampton returns to his place on the ottoman in great perplexity  oh what fun  oh dear  she seats herself with a vault on the front edge of the table panting  oh claret cup  she drinks  bohun in powerful tones  this is the younger lady is it  dolly slipping down off the table in alarm at his formidable voice and manner  yes sir  please who are you  mrs clandon  this is mr bohun dolly who has very kindly come to help us this evening  dolly  oh then he comes as a boon and a blessing  philip  sh  crampton  mr bohunmccomas i appeal to you  is this right would you blame my sisters family for objecting to this  dolly flushing ominously  have you begun again  crampton propitiating her  no no  its perhaps natural at your age  dolly obstinately  never mind my age  is it pretty  crampton  yes dear yes  he sits down in token of submission  dolly following him insistently  do you like it  crampton  my child how can you expect me to like it or to approve of it  dolly determined not to let him off  how can you think it pretty and not like it  mccomas rising angry and scandalized  really i must say bohun who has listened to dolly with the highest approval is down on him instantly  bohun  no dont interrupt mccomas  the young ladys method is right  to dolly with tremendous emphasis  press your questions miss clandon press your questions  dolly rising  oh dear you are a regular overwhelmer  do you always go on like this  bohun rising  yes  dont you try to put me out of countenance young lady  youre too young to do it  he takes mccomass chair from beside mrs clandons and sets it beside his own  sit down  dolly fascinated obeys and bohun sits down again  mccomas robbed of his seat takes a chair on the other side between the table and the ottoman  now mr crampton the facts are before youboth of them you think youd like to have your two youngest children to live with you  well you wouldnt crampton tries to protest but bohun will not have it on any terms  no you wouldnt you think you would but i know better than you  youd want this young lady here to give up dressing like a stage columbine in the evening and like a fashionable columbine in the morning  well she wontnever  she thinks she will but  dolly interrupting him  no i dont  resolutely  ill n e v e r  give up dressing prettily  never  as gloria said to that man in madeira never never never while grass grows or water runs  valentine rising in the wildest agitation  what  what beginning to speak very fast  when did she say that  who did she say that to  bohun throwing himself back with massive pitying remonstrance mr valentine  valentine pepperily  dont you interrupt me sir this is something really serious  i  i n s i s t  on knowing who miss clandon said that to  dolly  perhaps phil remembers  which was it phil number three or number five  valentine  number five  philip  courage valentine  it wasnt number five it was only a tame naval lieutenant that was always on handthe most patient and harmless of mortals  gloria coldly  what are we discussing now pray  valentine very red  excuse me i am sorry i interrupted  i shall intrude no further mrs clandon  he bows to mrs clandon and marches away into the garden boiling with suppressed rage  dolly  hmhm  philip  ahah  gloria please go on mr bohun  dolly striking in as bohun frowning formidably collects himself for a fresh grapple with the case  youre going to bully us mr bohun  bohun  i  dolly interrupting him  oh yes you are you think youre not but you are  i know by your eyebrows  bohun capitulating  mrs clandon these are clever children clear headed well brought up children  i make that admission deliberately  can you in return point out to me any way of inducting them to hold their tongues  mrs clandon  dolly dearest  philip  our old failing dolly  silence  dolly holds her mouth  mrs clandon  now mr bohun before they begin again  waiter softer  be quick sir be quick  dolly beaming at him  dear william  philip  sh  bohun unexpectedly beginning by hurling a question straight at dolly  have you any intention of getting married  dolly  i  well finch calls me by my christian name  mccomas  i will not have this  mr bohun i use the young ladys christian name naturally as an old friend of her mothers  dolly  yes you call me dolly as an old friend of my mothers  but what about dorotheeeea  mccomas rises indignantly  crampton anxiously rising to restrain him  keep your temper mccomas  dont let us quarrel  be patient  mccomas  i will not be patient  you are shewing the most wretched weakness of character crampton  i say this is monstrous  dolly  mr bohun please bully finch for us  bohun  i will  mccomas youre making yourself ridiculous  sit down  mccomas  i  bohun waving him down imperiously  no sit down sit down mccomas sits down sulkily and crampton much relieved follows his example  dolly to bohun meekly  thank you  bohun  now listen to me all of you  i give no opinion mccomas as to how far you may or may not have committed yourself in the direction indicated by this young lady  mccomas is about to protest no dont interrupt me if she doesnt marry you she will marry somebody else  that is the solution of the difficulty as to her not bearing her fathers name  the other lady intends to get married  gloria flushing  mr bohun  bohun  oh yes you do you dont know it but you do  gloria rising  stop  i warn you mr bohun not to answer for my intentions  bohun rising  its no  use miss clandon you cant put me down i tell you your name will soon be neither clandon nor crampton and i could tell you what it will be if i chose  he goes to the other end of the table where he unrolls his domino and puts the false nose on the table  when he moves they all rise and phil goes to the window bohun with a gesture summons the waiter to help him in robing  mr crampton your notion of going to law is all nonsense your children will be of age before you could get the point decided  allowing the waiter to put the domino on his shoulders  you can do nothing but make a friendly arrangement  if you want your family more than they want you youll get the worse of the arrangement if they want you more than you want them youll get the better of it  he shakes the domino into becoming folds and takes up the false nose  dolly gazes admiringly at him  the strength of their position lies in their being very agreeable people personally  the strength of your position lies in your income he claps on the false nose and is again grotesquely transfigured  dolly running to him  oh now you look quite like a human being maynt i have just one dance with you  c a n  you dance  phil resuming his part of harlequin waves his hat as if casting a spell on them  bohun thunderously  yes you think i cant but i can  come along  he seizes her and dances off with her through the window in a most powerful manner but with studied propriety and grace  the waiter is meanwhile busy putting the chairs back in their customary places  philip  on with the dance let joy be unconfined  william  waiter  yes sir  philip  can you procure a couple of dominos and false noses for my father and mr mccomas  mccomas  most certainly not  i protest  crampton  no no  what harm will it do just for once mccomas dont let us be spoilsports  mccomas  crampton you are not the man i took you for  pointedly bullies are always cowards  he goes disgustedly towards the window  crampton following him  well never mind  we must indulge them a little  can you get us something to wear waiter  waiter  certainly sir  he precedes them to the window and stands aside there to let them pass out before him  this way sir  dominos and noses sir  mccomas angrily on his way out  i shall wear my own nose  waiter suavely  oh dear yes sir the false one will fit over it quite easily sir plenty of room sir plenty of room  he goes out after mccomas  crampton turning at the window to phil with an attempt at genial fatherliness  come along my boy come along  he goes  philip cheerily following him  coming dad coming  on the window threshold he stops looking after crampton then turns fantastically with his bat bent into a halo round his head and says with a lowered voice to mrs clandon and gloria  did you feel the pathos of that  he vanishes  mrs clandon left alone with gloria  why did mr valentine go away so suddenly i wonder  gloria petulantly  i dont know  yes i   d o   know  let us go and see the dancing  they go towards the window and are met by valentine who comes in from the garden walking quickly with his face set and sulky  valentine stiffly  excuse me  i thought the party had quite broken up  gloria nagging  then why did you come back  valentine  i came back because i am penniless  i cant get out that way without a five shilling ticket  mrs clandon  has anything annoyed you mr valentine  gloria  never mind him mother  this is a fresh insult to me that is all  mrs clandon hardly able to realize that gloria is deliberately provoking an altercation  gloria  valentine  mrs clandon have i said anything insulting  have i done anything insulting  gloria  you have implied that my past has been like yours  that is the worst of insults  valentine  i imply nothing of the sort  i declare that my past has been blameless in comparison with yours  mrs clandon most indignantly  mr valentine  valentine  well what am i to think when i learn that miss clandon has made exactly the same speeches to other men that she has made to mewhen i hear of at least five former lovers with a tame naval lieutenant thrown in  oh its too bad  mrs clandon  but you surely do not believe that these affairs mere jokes of the childrenswere serious mr valentine  valentine  not to younot to her perhaps  but i know what the men felt  with ludicrously genuine earnestness  have you ever thought of the wrecked lives the marriages contracted in the recklessness of despair the suicides thethethe  gloria interrupting him contemptuously  mother this man is a sentimental idiot  she sweeps away to the fireplace  mrs clandon shocked  oh my  d e a r e s t  gloria mr valentine will think that rude  valentine  i am not a sentimental idiot  i am cured of sentiment for ever  he sits down in dudgeon  mrs clandon  mr valentine you must excuse us all  women have to unlearn the false good manners of their slavery before they acquire the genuine good manners of their freedom  dont think gloria vulgar gloria turns astonished she is not really so  gloria  mother  you apologize for me to  h i m  mrs clandon  my dear you have some of the faults of youth as well as its qualities and mr valentine seems rather too old fashioned in his ideas about his own sex to like being called an idiot  and now had we not better go and see what dolly is doing  she goes towards the window  valentine rises  gloria  do you go mother  i wish to speak to mr valentine alone  mrs clandon startled into a remonstrance  my dear  recollecting herself  i beg your pardon gloria  certainly if you wish  she bows to valentine and goes out  valentine  oh if your mother were only a widow  shes worth six of you  gloria  that is the first thing i have heard you say that does you honor  valentine  stuff  come say what you want to say and let me go  gloria  i have only this to say  you dragged me down to your level for a moment this afternoon  do you think if that had ever happened before that i should not have been on my guardthat i should not have known what was coming and known my own miserable weakness  valentine scolding at her passionately  dont talk of it in that way  what do i care for anything in you but your weakness as you call it  you thought yourself very safe didnt you behind your advanced ideas  i amused myself by upsetting  t h e m  pretty easily  gloria insolently feeling that now she can do as she likes with him  indeed  valentine  but why did i do it  because i was being tempted to awaken your heartto stir the depths in you  why was i tempted because nature was in deadly earnest with me when i was in jest with her  when the great moment came who was awakened who was stirred in whom did the depths break up  in myself m y s e l f i was transported you were only offendedshocked  you were only an ordinary young lady too ordinary to allow tame lieutenants to go as far as i went  thats all  i shall not trouble you with conventional apologies  goodbye  he makes resolutely for the door  gloria  stop  he hesitates  oh will you understand if i tell you the truth that i am not making an advance to you  valentine  pooh  i know what youre going to say  you think youre not ordinarythat i was rightthat you really have those depths in your nature  it flatters you to believe it  she recoils  well i grant that you are not ordinary in some ways you are a clever girl gloria stifles an exclamation of rage and takes a threatening step towards him but youve not been awakened yet  you didnt care you dont care  it was my tragedy not yours  goodbye  he turns to the door  she watches him appalled to see him slipping from her grasp  as he turns the handle he pauses then turns again to her offering his hand  let us part kindly  gloria enormously relieved and immediately turning her back on him deliberately  goodbye  i trust you will soon recover from the wound  valentine brightening up as it flashes on him that he is master of the situation after all  i shall recover such wounds heal more than they harm  after all i still have my own gloria  gloria facing him quickly  what do you mean  valentine  the gloria of my imagination  gloria proudly  keep your own gloriathe gloria of your imagination  her emotion begins to break through her pride  the real gloriathe gloria who was shocked offended horrifiedoh yes quite trulywho was driven almost mad with shame by the feeling that all her power over herself had been broken down at her first real encounter withwith the color rushes over her face again  she covers it with her left hand and puts her right on his left arm to support herself  valentine  take care  im losing my senses again  summoning all her courage she takes away her hand from her face and puts it on his right shoulder turning him towards her and looking him straight in the eyes  he begins to protest agitatedly  gloria be sensible its no use i havent a penny in the world  gloria  cant you earn one  other people do  valentine half delighted half frightened  i never couldyoud be unhappy  my dearest love i should be the merest fortunehunting adventurer if her grip on his arms tightens and she kisses him oh lord  breathless  oh i  he gasps  i dont know anything about women twelve years experience is not enough  in a gust of jealousy she throws him away from her and he reels her back into the chair like a leaf before the wind as dolly dances in waltzing with the waiter followed by mrs clandon and finch also waltzing and phil pirouetting by himself  dolly sinking on the chair at the writingtable  oh im out of breath  how beautifully you waltz william  mrs clandon sinking on the saddlebag seat on the hearth  oh how could you make me do such a silly thing finch  i havent danced since the soiree at south place twenty years ago  gloria peremptorily at valentine  get up  valentine gets up abjectly  now let us have no false delicacy  tell my mother that we have agreed to marry one another  a silence of stupefaction ensues valentine dumb with panic looks at them with an obvious impulse to run away  dolly breaking the silence  number six  philip  sh  dolly tumultuously  oh my feelings  i want to kiss somebody and we bar it in the family  wheres finch  mccomas starting violently  no positively crampton appears in the window  dolly running to crampton  oh youre just in time  she kisses him  now leading him forward bless them  gloria  no  i will have no such thing even in jest  when i need a blessing i shall ask my mothers  crampton to gloria with deep disappointment  am i to understand that you have engaged yourself to this young gentleman  gloria resolutely  yes  do you intend to be our friend or  dolly interposing  or our father  crampton  i should like to be both my child  but surely  mr valentine i appeal to your sense of honor  valentine  youre quite right  its perfect madness  if we go out to dance together i shall have to borrow five shillings from her for a ticket  gloria dont be rash youre throwing yourself away  id much better clear straight out of this and never see any of you again  i shant commit suicide i shant even be unhappy  itll be a relief to me iim frightened im positively frightened and thats the plain truth  gloria determinedly  you shall not go  valentine quailing  no dearest of course not  butoh will somebody only talk sense for a moment and bring us all to reason  i cant  wheres bohun  bohuns the man  phil go and summon bohun  philip  from the vastly deep  i go  he makes his bat quiver in the air and darts away through the window  waiter harmoniously to valentine  if you will excuse my putting in a word sir do not let a matter of five shillings stand between you and your happiness sir  we shall be only too pleased to put the ticket down to you and you can settle at your convenience  very glad to meet you in any way very happy and pleased indeed sir  philip reappearing  he comes  he waves his bat over the window bohun comes in taking off his false nose and throwing it on the table in passing as he comes between gloria and valentine  valentine  the point is mr bohun  mccomas interrupting from the hearthrug  excuse me sir the point must be put to him by a solicitor  the question is one of an engagement between these two young people  the lady has some property and looking at crampton will probably have a good deal more  crampton  possibly  i hope so  valentine  and the gentleman hasnt a rap  bohun nailing valentine to the point instantly  then insist on a settlement  that shocks your delicacy most sensible precautions do but you ask my advice and i give it to you  have a settlement  gloria proudly  he shall have a settlement  valentine  my good sir i dont want advice for myself  give  h e r some advice  bohun  she wont take it  when youre married she wont take yours either turning suddenly on gloria oh no you wont you think you will but you wont  hell set to work and earn his living turning suddenly to valentine oh yes you will you think you wont but you will  shell make you  crampton only half persuaded  then mr bohun you dont think this match an unwise one  bohun  yes i do all matches are unwise  its unwise to be born its unwise to be married its unwise to live and its unwise to die  waiter insinuating himself between crampton and valentine  then if i may respectfully put in a word in sir so much the worse for wisdom  to valentine benignly  cheer up sir cheer up every man is frightened of marriage when it comes to the point but it often turns out very comfortable very enjoyable and happy indeed sirfrom time to time  i never was master in my own house sir my wife was like your young lady she was of a commanding and masterful disposition which my son has inherited  but if i had my life to live twice over id do it again id do it again i assure you  you never can tell sir you never can tell  philip  allow me to remark that if gloria has made up her mind  dolly  the matters settled and valentines done for  and were missing all the dances  valentine to gloria gallantly making the best of it  may i have a dance  bohun interposing in his grandest diapason  excuse me i claim that privilege as counsels fee  may i have the honorthank you he dances away with gloria and disappears among the lanterns leaving valentine gasping  valentine recovering his breath  dolly may i offering himself as her partner  dolly  nonsense  eluding him and running round the table to the fireplace  finchmy finch  she pounces on mccomas and makes him dance  mccomas protesting  pray restrain  really  he is borne off dancing through the window  valentine making a last effort  mrs clandon may i  philip forestalling him  come mother  he seizes his mother and whirls her away  mrs clandon remonstrating  phil phil she shares mccomass fate  crampton following them with senile glee  ho ho  he he he he goes into the garden chuckling at the fun  valentine collapsing on the ottoman and staring at the waiter  i might as well be a married man already  the waiter contemplates the captured duellist of sex with affectionate commiseration shaking his head slowly  curtain
