440886	odd craft  by ww jacobs    a spirit of avarice   mr john blows stood listening to the foreman with an air of lofty disdain  he was a freeborn englishman and yet he had been summarily paid off at eleven oclock in the morning and told that his valuable services would no longer be required  more than that the foreman had passed certain strictures upon his features which however true they might be were quite irrelevant to the fact that mr blows had been discovered slumbering in a shed when he should have been laying bricks  illustration mr john blows stood listening to the foreman with an air of lofty disdain  take your ugly face off these ere works said the foreman take it ome and bury it in the backyard  anybodyll be glad to lend you a spade  mr blows in a somewhat fluent reply reflected severely on the foremans immediate ancestors and the strange lack of goodfeeling and public spirit they had exhibited by allowing him to grow up  take it ome and bury it said the foreman again  not under any plants youve got a liking for  i suppose said mr blows still referring to his foes parents and now endeavouring to make excuses for themi spose they was so pleased and so surprised when they found that you was a uman being that they didnt mind anything else  he walked off with his head in the air and the other men who had partially suspended work to listen resumed their labours  a modest pint at the rising sun revived his drooping spirits and he walked home thinking of several things which he might have said to the foreman if he had only thought of them in time  he paused at the open door of his house and looking in sniffed at the smell of mottled soap and dirty water which pervaded it  the stairs were wet and a pail stood in the narrow passage  from the kitchen came the sounds of crying children and a scolding mother  master joseph henry blows aged three was holding his breath and the family were all aghast at the length of his performance  he recovered it as his father entered the room and drowned without distressing himself the impotent efforts of the others  mrs blows turned upon her husband a look of hot inquiry  ive got the chuck he said surlily  what again said the unfortunate woman  yes again repeated her husband  mrs blows turned away and dropping into a chair threw her apron over her head and burst into discordant weeping  two little blows who had ceased their outcries resumed them again from sheer sympathy  stop it yelled the indignant mr blows stop it at once dye hear  i wish id never seen you sobbed his wife from behind her apron  of all the lazy idle drunken goodfornothing  go on said mr blows grimly  youre more trouble than youre worth declared mrs blows  look at your father my dears she continued taking the apron away from her face take a good look at him and mind you dont grow up like it  mr blows met the combined gaze of his innocent offspring with a dark scowl and then fell to moodily walking up and down the passage until he fell over the pail  at that his mood changed and turning fiercely he kicked that useful article up and down the passage until he was tired  ive ad enough of it he muttered  he stopped at the kitchendoor and putting his hand in his pocket threw a handful of change on to the floor and swung out of the house  another pint of beer confirmed him in his resolution  he would go far away and make a fresh start in the world  the morning was bright and the air fresh and a pleasant sense of freedom and adventure possessed his soul as he walked  at a swinging pace he soon left gravelton behind him and coming to the river sat down to smoke a final pipe before turning his back forever on a town which had treated him so badly  the river murmured agreeably and the rushes stirred softly in the breeze mr blows who could fall asleep on an upturned pail succumbed to the influence at once the pipe dropped from his mouth and he snored peacefully  he was awakened by a choking scream and starting up hastily looked about for the cause  then in the water he saw the little white face of billy clements and wading in up to his middle he reached out and catching the child by the hair drew him to the bank and set him on his feet  still screaming with terror billy threw up some of the water he had swallowed and without turning his head made off in the direction of home calling piteously upon his mother  mr blows shivering on the bank watched him out of sight and missing his cap was just in time to see that friend of several seasons slowly sinking in the middle of the river  he squeezed the water from his trousers and crossing the bridge set off across the meadows   his selfimposed term of bachelorhood lasted just three months at the end of which time he made up his mind to enact the part of the generous husband and forgive his wife everything  he would not go into details but issue one big magnanimous pardon  full of these lofty ideas he set off in the direction of home again  it was a threedays tramp and the evening of the third day saw him but a bare two miles from home  he clambered up the bank at the side of the road and sprawling at his ease smoked quietly in the moonlight  a waggon piled up with straw came jolting and creaking toward him  the driver sat dozing on the shafts and mr blows smiled pleasantly as he recognised the first face of a friend he had seen for three months  he thrust his pipe in his pocket and rising to his feet clambered on to the back of the waggon and lying face downward on the straw peered down at the unconscious driver below  ill give old joe a surprise he said to himself  hell be the first to welcome me back  joe he said softly  ow goes it old pal  mr joe carter still dozing opened his eyes at the sound of his name and looked round then coming to the conclusion that he had been dreaming closed them again  im alooking at you joe said mr blows waggishly  i can see you  mr carter looked up sharply and catching sight of the grinning features of mr blows protruding over the edge of the straw threw up his arms with a piercing shriek and fell off the shafts on to the road  the astounded mr blows raising himself on his hands saw him pick himself up and giving vent to a series of fearsome yelps run clumsily back along the road  joe shouted mr blows  joooe  illustration joe shouted mr blows  joooe  mr carter put his hands to his ears and ran on blindly while his friend sitting on the top of the straw regarded his proceedings with mixed feelings of surprise and indignation  it cant be that tanner e owes me he mused and yet i dont know what else it can be  i never see a man so jumpy  he continued to speculate while the old horse undisturbed by the drivers absence placidly continued its journey  a mile farther however he got down to take the short cut by the fields  if joe cant look after his orse and cart he said primly as he watched it along the road its not my business  the footpath was not much used at that time of night and he only met one man  they were in the shadow of the trees which fringed the new cemetery as they passed and both peered  the stranger was satisfied first and to mr blowss growing indignation first gave a leap backward which would not have disgraced an acrobat and then made off across the field with hideous outcries  if i get old of some of you said the offended mr blows ill give you something to holler for  he pursued his way grumbling and insensibly slackened his pace as he drew near home  a remnant of conscience which had stuck to him without encouragement for thirtyfive years persisted in suggesting that he had behaved badly  it also made a few illbred inquiries as to how his wife and children had subsisted for the last three months  he stood outside the house for a short space and then opening the door softly walked in  the kitchendoor stood open and his wife in a black dress sat sewing by the light of a smoky lamp  she looked up as she heard his footsteps and then without a word slid from the chair full length to the floor  go on said mr blows bitterly keep it up  dont mind me  mrs blows paid no heed her face was white and her eyes were closed her husband with a dawning perception of the state of affairs drew a mug of water from the tap and flung it over her  she opened her eyes and gave a faint scream and then scrambling to her feet tottered toward him and sobbed on his breast  there there said mr blows  dont take on i forgive you  oh john said his wife sobbing convulsively i thought you was dead i thought you was dead  its only a fortnight ago since we buried you  buried me  said the startled mr blows  buried me  i shall wake up and find im dreaming wailed mrs blows i know i shall  im always dreaming that youre not dead  night before last i dreamt that you was alive and i woke up sobbing as if my art would break  sobbing said mr blows with a scowl  for joy john explained his wife  mr blows was about to ask for a further explanation of the mystery when he stopped and regarded with much interest a fairsized cask which stood in one corner  a cask o beer he said staring as he took a glass from the dresser and crossed over to it  you dont seem to ave taken much arm during mymy going after work  we ad it for the funeral john said his wife leastways we ad two this is the second  mr blows who had filled the glass set it down on the table untasted things seemed a trifle uncanny  go on said mrs blows youve got more right to it than anybody else fancy aving you here drinking up the beer for your own funeral  i dont understand what youre adriving at retorted mr blows drinking somewhat gingerly from the glass  ow could there be a funeral without me  its all a mistake said the overjoyed mrs blows we must have buried somebody else  but such a funeral john you would ha been proud if you could ha seen it  all gravelton followed nearly  there was the boys drum and fife band and the ancient order of camels what you used to belong to turned out with their brass band and bannersall the people marching four abreast and sometimes five  mr blowss face softened he had no idea that he had established himself so firmly in the affections of his fellowtownsmen  four mourning carriages continued his wife and thethe hearse all covered in flowers so that you couldnt see it ardly  one wreath cost two pounds  mr blows endeavoured to conceal his gratification beneath a mask of surliness  waste o money he growled and stooping to the cask drew himself another glass of beer  some o the gentry sent their carriages to follow said mrs blows sitting down and clasping her hands in her lap  i know one or two that ad a liking for me said mr blows almost blushing  and to think that its all a mistake continued his wife  but i thought it was you it was dressed like you and your cap was found near it  hm said mr blows a pretty mess youve been and made of it  heres people been giving two pounds for wreaths and turning up with brass bands and banners because they thought it was me and its all been wasted  it wasnt my fault said his wife  little billy clements came running ome the day you went away and said ed fallen in the water and youd gone in and pulled im out  he said e thought you was drownded and when you didnt come ome i naturally thought so too  what else could i think  mr blows coughed and holding his glass up to the light regarded it with a preoccupied air  they dragged the river resumed his wife and found the cap but they didnt find the body till nine weeks afterward  there was a inquest at the peal o bells and i identified you and all that grand funeral was because they thought youd lost your life saving little billy  they said you was a hero  illustration they dragged the river resumed his wife and found the cap  youve made a nice mess of it repeated mr blows  the rector preached the sermon continued his wife a beautiful sermon it was too  i wish youd been there to hear it i should ave enjoyed it ever so much better  he said that nobody was more surprised than what e was at your doing such a thing and that it only showed ow little we knowed our fellowcreatures  he said that it proved there was good in all of us if we only gave it a chance to come out  mr blows eyed her suspiciously but she sat thinking and staring at the floor  i spose we shall have to give the money back now she said at last  money said the other what money  money that was collected for us replied his wife  one undered and eightythree pounds seven shillings and fourpence  mr blows took a long breath  ow much  he said faintly say it agin  his wife obeyed  show it to me said the other in trembling tones lets ave a look at it  lets old some of it  i cant was the reply theres a committee of the camels took charge of it and they pay my rent and allow me ten shillings a week  now i spose itll have to be given back  dont you talk nonsense said mr blows violently  you go to them interfering camels and say you want your moneyall of it  say youre going to australia  say it was my last dying wish  mrs blows puckered her brow  ill keep quiet upstairs till youve got it continued her husband rapidly  there was only two men saw me and i can see now that they thought i was my own ghost  send the kids off to your mother for a few days  his wife sent them off next morning and a little later was able to tell him that his surmise as to his friends mistake was correct  all gravelton was thrilled by the news that the spiritual part of mr john blows was walking the earth and much exercised as to his reasons for so doing  seemed such a monkey trick for im to do complained mr carter to the listening circle at the peal o bells  im alooking at you joe he ses and he waggled his ead as if it was made of indiarubber  hed got something on is mind what he wanted to tell you said a listener severely you ought to ave stopped joe and asked im what it was  i think i see myself said the shivering mr carter  i think i see myself  then he wouldnt ave troubled you any more said the other  mr carter turned pale and eyed him fixedly  praps it was only a deathwarning said another man  what dye mean only a deathwarning  demanded the unfortunate mr carter you dont know what youre talking about  i ad an uncle o mine see a ghost once said a third man anxious to relieve the tension  and what appened  inquired the first speaker  ill tell you after joes gone said the other with rare consideration  mr carter called for some more beer and told the barmaid to put a little gin in it  in a pitiable state of nerves he sat at the extreme end of a bench and felt that he was an object of unwholesome interest to his acquaintances  the finishing touch was put to his discomfiture when a wellmeaning friend in a vague and disjointed way advised him to give up drink swearing and any other bad habits which he might have contracted  illustration in a pitiable state of nerves he sat at the extreme end of a bench  the committee of the ancient order of camels took the news calmly and classed it with pink rats and other abnormalities  in reply to mrs blowss request for the capital sum they expressed astonishment that she could be willing to tear herself away from the heros grave and spoke of the pain which such an act on her part would cause him in the event of his being conscious of it  in order to show that they were reasonable men they allowed her an extra shilling that week  the hero threw the dole on the bedroom floor and in a speech bristling with personalities consigned the committee to perdition  the confinement was beginning to tell upon him and two nights afterward just before midnight he slipped out for a breath of fresh air  it was a clear night and all gravelton with one exception appeared to have gone to bed  the exception was policeconstable collins and he after tracking the skulking figure of mr blows and finally bringing it to bay in a doorway kept his for a fortnight  as a sensible man mr blows took no credit to himself for the circumstance but a natural feeling of satisfaction at the discomfiture of a member of a force for which he had long entertained a strong objection could not be denied  gravelton debated this new appearance with bated breath and even the purblind committee of the camels had to alter their views  they no longer denied the supernatural nature of the manifestations but with a strange misunderstanding of mr blowss desires attributed his restlessness to dissatisfaction with the projected tombstone and having plenty of funds amended their order for a plain stone at ten guineas to one in pink marble at twentyfive  that there committee said mr blows to his wife in a trembling voice as he heard of the alterationthat there committee seem to think that they can play about with my money as they like  you go and tell em you wont ave it  and say youve given up the idea of going to australia and you want the money to open a shop with  well take a little pub somewhere  mrs blows went and returned in tears and for two entire days her husband a prey to gloom sat trying to evolve fresh and original ideas for the possession of the money  on the evening of the second day he became lowspirited and going down to the kitchen took a glass from the dresser and sat down by the beercask  almost insensibly he began to take a brighter view of things  it was saturday night and his wife was out  he shook his head indulgently as he thought of her and began to realise how foolish he had been to entrust such a delicate mission to a woman  the ancient order of camels wanted a man to talk to thema man who knew the world and could assail them with unanswerable arguments  having applied every known test to make sure that the cask was empty he took his cap from a nail and sallied out into the street  old mrs martin a neighbour saw him first and announced the fact with a scream that brought a dozen people round her  bereft of speech she mouthed dumbly at mr blows  i aint touchtouched her said that gentleman earnestly  i aint been near er  the crowd regarded him wildeyed  fresh members came running up and pushing for a front place fell back hastily on the main body and watched breathlessly  mr blows disquieted by their silence renewed his protestations  i was coming long  he broke off suddenly and turning round gazed with some heat at a gentleman who was endeavouring to ascertain whether an umbrella would pass through him  the investigator backed hastily into the crowd again and a faint murmur of surprise arose as the indignant mr blows rubbed the place  hes alive i tell you said a voice  what cheer jack  ullo bill said mr blows genially  bill came forward cautiously and first shaking hands satisfied himself by various little taps and prods that his friend was really alive  its all right he shouted come and feel  at least fifty hands accepted the invitation and ignoring the threats and entreaties of mr blows who was a highly ticklish subject wandered briskly over his anatomy  he broke free at last and supported by bill and a friend set off for the peal o bells  by the time he arrived there his following had swollen to immense proportions  windows were thrown up and people standing on their doorsteps shouted inquiries  congratulations met him on all sides and the joy of mr joseph carter was so great that mr blows was quite affected  in high feather at the attention he was receiving mr blows pushed his way through the idlers at the door and ascended the short flight of stairs which led to the room where the members of the ancient order of camels were holding their lodge  the crowd swarmed up after him  the door was locked but in response to his knocking it opened a couple of inches and a gruff voice demanded his business  then before he could give it the doorkeeper reeled back into the room and mr blows with a large following pushed his way in  the president and his officers who were sitting in state behind a long table at the end of the room started to their feet with mingled cries of indignation and dismay at the intrusion  mr blows conscious of the strength of his position walked up to them  illustration mr blows conscious of the strength of his position walked up to them  mr blows  gasped the president  ah you didnt expec see me said mr blows with a scornful laugh theyre trying do me do me out o my lill bit o money bill  but you aint got no money said his bewildered friend  mr blows turned and eyed him haughtily then he confronted the staring president again  ive come formy money he said impressively one undereighty pounds  but look ere said the scandalised bill tugging at his sleeve you aint dead jack  you dont understan said mr blows impatiently  they know wharri mean one undereighty pounds  they want to buy me a tombstone an i dont want it  i want the money  here stop it dye hear  the words were wrung from him by the action of the president who after eyeing him doubtfully during his remarks suddenly prodded him with the buttend of one of the property spears which leaned against his chair  the solidity of mr blows was unmistakable and with a sudden resumption of dignity the official seated himself and called for silence  im sorry to say theres been a bit of a mistake made he said slowly but im glad to say that mr blows has come back to support his wife and family with the sweat of his own brow  only a pound or two of the money so kindly subscribed has been spent and the remainder will be handed back to the subscribers  here said the incensed mr blows listen me  take him away said the president with great dignity  clear the room  strangers outside  two of the members approached mr blows and placing their hands on his shoulders requested him to withdraw  he went at last the centre of a dozen panting men and becoming wedged on the narrow staircase spoke fluently on such widely differing subjects as the rights of man and the shape of the presidents nose  he finished his remarks in the street but becoming aware at last of a strange lack of sympathy on the part of his audience he shook off the arm of the faithful mr carter and stalked moodily home
