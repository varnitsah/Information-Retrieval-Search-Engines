long or distant expeditions from their new home their summer excursions to vallombrosa lucca or siena had been of the nature of short holidays and had not taken them beyond the limits of tuscany now they had planned a far wider series of travels which beginning with rome naples venice and milan should then be extended across the alps and comprehend brussels paris and ultimately london this ambitious programme had to be curtailed by the omission of the southern tour to rome and naples as well as the digression to brussels but the rest of the scheme was carried out and about the beginning of june they left casa guidi for an absence which extended over seventeen months  the holiday had been well earned especially by mrs browning who since the preparation of the new edition of her poems in the previous year had been writing the second part of casa guidi windows it is probably to this poem that she refers in the letter to miss browning printed at the end of the last chapter miss browning having on more than one occasion helped both her brother and her sisterinlaw in the task of passing their poems through the press the book appeared in june just as they were starting on their travels and probably for this reason we hear less in the letters of its reception it was hardly to be expected that the english public would take a very keen interest in a poem dealing almost entirely with italian politics and half of it with the politics of three years ago either in 1849 or in 1859 the interest would have been livelier but italy was passing now through the valley of the shadow and save for the horrors of the neapolitan prisons was not much before the public for the moment the intrigues of louis napoleon and the ostentatious aggression of the pope in england were the matters of most interest in foreign politics and both were overshadowed by the absorbing topic of the great exhibition  another reason why casa guidi windows has received less appreciation than it deserves both at the time of its publication and since is that it stands rather apart from all the recognised species of poetry and is hard to classify and criticise its political and contemporary character cut it off from the imaginative and historical subjects which form in general the matter of poetry while its genuinely poetic emotion and language separate it from the political pamphlet or the occasional verse it is a poetic treatment of a political subject raised to a high level by the genuine enthusiasm and fire with which it is inspired and these give it a value which lasts far beyond the moment of the events which gave it birth the execution too shows an advance on most of mrs brownings previous work the dangerous experiments in rhyming which characterised many of the poems in the volumes of 1844 are abandoned the licences of language are less frequent the verse runs smoothly and is more uniformly under command it would appear as if the heat of inspiration which produced the sonnets from the portuguese had left a permanent and purifying effect upon her style the poem has been neglected by those who take little interest in italy and its history and adversely criticised by those who do not sympathise with its political and religious opinions but with those who look only to its poetry and to its warmhearted championship of a great cause it will always hold a high place of its own among mrs brownings writings                                        to miss i blagden  florence may 1 1851  i am writing to you dearest miss blagden at last you see though you must have excommunicated me before now as the most ungrateful of correspondents and friends do forgive what you canand your kindness is so great that i believe you can and shall go on to write as if you did we have been in the extremity of confusion and indecision remember how the fairy princes used to do when they arrived at the meeting of three roads and had to consider what choice to make how they used to shake their heads and ponder and end sometimes by drawing lots much in the like perplexity have we been everything was ready for romethe day fixed the packing begun the vettura bargained for suddenly visions of obstacles rose up we were late in the season we should be late for the festas may would be hot in rome for wiedeman then two journeys north and south to rome and naples besides paris and england pulled fearfully at the pursestrings plainly we couldnt afford it so everything was stopped and changed we gave up rome and you and are now actually on the point of setting out for venice venice is to console us for rome we go tomorrow indeed the plan is to stay a fortnight at venice or more or less as the charm works and then to strike across to milan across the splügen into switzerland and to linger there among the hills and lakes for a part of the summer so working out an intention of economy then down the rhine then by railroad to brussels so to paris settling there after which we pay our visit to england for a few weeks early next spring we mean to go to rome and return here either for good which is very possible or for the purpose of arranging our house affairs and packing up books and furniture as it is we have our apartment for another year and shall let it if we can it has been painted cleaned and improved in all ways till my head and roberts ring again with the confusion of it all oh that we were gone since we are to go when out of sight of florence we shall begin to enjoy i hope the sight of other things but as it is the impression is only painful and dizzying our friends mr and mrs ogilvy go with us as far as venice and then leave us on a direct course for england having committed their children and nurses to the care of her sister at the baths of lucca meantime we take with us only wilson  do write to me at venice poste restante that i may know you are thinking of me and excusing me kindly if you knew how uncertain and tormented we have been i wont even ask robert to add a line to this he is so overwhelmed with a flood of businesses but he bids me speak to you of him as affectionately and faithfully because affectionately as i have reason to do so kind it was in you to think of taking the trouble of finding us an apartment so really sensible we are to all your warmhearted goodness with fullness of heart on our side too and after all we are not parting either we shall find you in italy again or you will find us in paris i have a presentimental assurance of finding one another again before long remember us and love us meantime  as to your spiritual visitorwhy it would be hard to make out a system of romish doctrine from the most romish version of the ss1 the differences between the protestant version and the papistical are not certainly justifiable by the greek original on the side of the latter in fact the papistical version does not pretend to follow the greek text but a latin translation of the sameits a translation from a translation granting it however to be faithful i must repeat that to make out the romish system from even such a romish version could not be achieved so little does scripture however represented seem to me to justify that system of ecclesiastical doctrine and discipline i answer your question because you bid me but i am not a bit frightened at the idea of your becoming a rc however you may try to frighten me you have too much intelligence and uprightness of intellect we do hope you have enjoyed rome and that dearest miss agassiz give our kind love to her is better and looks better than we all thought her a little while ago i have a book coming out in england called casa guidi windows which will prevent everybody else except you from speaking to me again do love me always as i shall you forgive me and dont forget me i shall try after a space of calm to behave better to you and more after my heartfor i am ever as robert is  your faithfully affectionate friend elizabeth b browning                                        to miss mitford  venice june 4 1851  my ever dearest miss mitfordi must write to you from venice though it can only be a few lines so much i have to say and feel in writing to you and thinking that you were not well when you wrote last to me i long to hear from youand yet i cant tell you today where a letter will find me we are wanderers on the face of the world just now and with every desire of going straight from venice to milan tomorrow friday week we shall more probably at the baths of recoaro be lingering and lingering therefore will you write to the care of miss browning new cross hatcham near london for so i shall not lose your letter i have been between heaven and earth since our arrival at venice the heaven of it is ineffable never had i touched the skirts of so celestial a place the beauty of the architecture the silver trails of water up between all that gorgeous colour and carving the enchanting silence the moonlight the music the gondolasi mix it all up together and maintain that nothing is like it nothing equal to it not a second venice in the world do you know when i came first i felt as if i never could go away but now comes the earth side robert after sharing the ecstasy grows uncomfortable and nervous and unable to eat or sleep and poor wilson still worse in a miserable condition of continual sickness and headache alas for these mortal venicesso exquisite and so bilious therefore i am constrained away from my joys by sympathy and am forced to be glad that we are going off on friday for myself it does not affect me at all i like these moist soft relaxing climates even the scirocco doesnt touch me much and the baby grows gloriously fatter in spite of everything  no indeed and indeed we are not going to england for the sake of the exposition how could you fancy such a thing even once in any case we shall not reach london till late and if by any arrangement i could see my sister arabel in france or on the coast of england we would persuade roberts family to meet us there and not see london at all ah if you knew how abhorrent the thought of england is to me well we must not talk of it my eyes shut suddenly when my thoughts go that way  tell me exactly how you are i heartily rejoice that you have decided at last about the other house so as to avoid the danger of another autumn and winter in the damp do you write still for mr chorleys periodical and how does it go on here in italy the fame of it does not penetrate as for venice you cant get even a times much less an athenæum we comfort ourselves by taking a box at the opera the whole box on the ground tier mind for two shillings and eightpence english also every evening at halfpast eight robert and i are sitting under the moon in the great piazza of st mark taking excellent coffee and reading the french papers can you fancy me so  you will receive a copy of my new poem casa guidi windows soon after this note i have asked sarianna browning to see that you receive it safely i dont give away copies having none to give away according to booksellers terms but i cant let you receive my little book from another hand than the writers tell me how you like the poemhonestly trulywhich numbers of people will be sure to dislike profoundly and angrily perhaps we think of going to recoaro because mr chorley praised it to us years ago tell him so if you write  here are a heap of words tossed down upon paper i cant put the stops even do write about yourself not waiting for the book  your ever attached ebb  at paris how near we shall be how sure to meet have you been to the exposition yourself tell me and what is the general feeling now                                        to john kenyon  paris july 7 1851  my dearest mr kenyoni have waited day after day during this week that we have been here to be able to tell you that we have decided this or thatbut the indecision lasts and i cant let you hear from others of our being in paris when you have a right more than anybody almost to hear all about us i wanted to write to you indeed from venice where we stayed a month and much the same reason made me leave it undone as we were making and unmaking plans the whole time and we didnt know till the last few hours for instance whether or not we should go to milan venice is quite exquisite it wrapt me round with a spell at first sight and i longed to live and die therenever to go away the gondolas and the glory they swim through and the silence of the population drifted over ones head across the bridges and the fantastic architecture and the coffeedrinking and music in the piazza san marco everything fitted into my lazy idle nature and weakness of body as if i had been born to the manner of it and to no other do you know i expected in venice a dreary sort of desolation whereas there was nothing melancholy at all only a soothing lulling rocking atmosphere which if armida had lived in a city rather than in a garden would have suited her purpose indeed taglioni seems to be resting her feet from dancing there with a peculiar zest inasmuch as she has bought three or four of the most beautiful palaces how could she do better and one or two exkings and queens of the more vulgar royalties have wrapt themselves round with those shining waters to forget the purpleor dream of it as the case may be robert and i led a true venetian life i assure you we swam in gondolas to the lido and everywhere else we went to a festa at chioggia in the steamer frightening wilson by being kept out by the wind till two oclock in the morning we went to the opera and the play at a shilling each or not as much and we took coffee every evening on st marks piazza to music and the stars altogether it would have been perfect only whats perfect in the world while i grew fat wilson grew thin and robert could not sleep at nights the air was too relaxing or soft or something for them both and poor wilson declares that another month of venice would have killed her outright certainly she looked dreadfully ill and could eat nothing so i was forced to be glad to go away out of pure humanity and sympathy though i keep saying softly to myself ever since what is there on earth like venice  then we slept at padua on st anthonys night mores the pity for us they made us pay sixteen zwanzigers for it and robert and i leaving wiedeman at the inn took a calèche and drove over to arqua which i had set my heart on seeing for petrarchs sake did you ever see it you and didnt it move you the sight of that little room where the great soul exhaled itself even roberts mans eyes had tears in them as we stood there and looked through the window at the greenpeaked hills and do you know i believe in the cat  through brescia we passed by moonlight such a flood of white moonlight and got into milan in the morning there we stayed two days and i climbed to the topmost pinnacle of the cathedral wonder at me indeed i was rather overtired it must be confessedthree hundred and fifty stepsbut the sight was worth everything enough to light up ones memory for ever how glorious that cathedral is worthy almost of standing face to face with the snow alps and itself a sort of snow dream by an artist architect taken asleep in a glacier then the da vinci christ did not disappoint us which is saying much it is divine and the lombard school generally was delightful after bologna and those soulless caracci i have even given up guido and guercino too since knowing more of them correggio on the other hand is sublime at parma he is wonderful besides having the sense to make his little christs and angels after the very likeness of my baby  from milan we moved to como steamed down to menaggio opposite to bellaggio took a calèche to porlezza and a boat to lugano another calèche to bellinzona left wiedeman there and returning on our steps steamed down and up again the lago maggiore went from bellinzona to faido and slept and crossed the mount st gothard the next day catching the lucerne steamer at fluellen the scenery everywhere was most exquisite but of the great pass i shall say nothingit was like standing in the presence of god when he is terrible the tears overflowed my eyes i think i never saw the sublime before do you know i sate out in the coupé a part of the way with robert so as to apprehend the whole sight better with a thick shawl over my head only letting out the eyes to see they told us there was more snow than is customary at this time of year and it well might be so for the passage through it cut for the carriage left the snowwalls nodding over us at a great height on each side and the cold was intense  do you know we might yield the palm and that lucerne is far finer than any of our italian lakes even robert had to confess it at once i wanted to stay in switzerland but we found it wiser to hasten our steps and come to paris so we came yes and we travelled from strasburg to paris in fourandtwenty hours night and day never stopping except for a quarter of an hours breakfast and half an hours dinner so afraid i was of the fatigue for wiedeman but between the unfinished railroad and the diligence theres a complication of risks of losing places just now and we were forced to go the whole way in a breath or to hazard being three or four days on the road so we took the coupé and resigned ourselves and poor little babe slept at night and laughed in the day and came into paris as fresh in spirit as if just alighted from the morning star screaming out with delight at the shops think of that child upon the whole he has enjoyed our journey as much as any one of us observing and admiring though robert and wilson will have it that some of his admiration of the scenery we passed through was pure affectation and acted out to copy ours he cried out clasping his hands that the mountains were duemeaning a great number his love of beautiful buildings of churches especially no one can doubt about when first he saw st marks he threw up his arms in wonder and then clasping them round wilsons neck she was carrying him he kissed her in an ecstasy of joy and that was after a long days journey when most other children would have been tired and fretful but the sense of the beautiful is certainly very strong in him little darling he cant say the word church yet but when he sees one he begins to chant oh hes a true florentine in some things  well now we are in paris and have to forget the belle chiese we have beautiful shops instead false teeth grinning at the corners of the streets and disreputable prints and fascinating hats and caps and brilliant restaurants and m le président in a cocked hat and with a train of cavalry passing like a rocket along the boulevards to an occasional yell from the red oh yes and dont mistake me for i like it all extremely its a splendid citya city in the country as venice is a city in the sea and im as much amused as wiedeman who stands in the street before the printshops to wilsons great discomfort and roars at the lions and i admire the bright green trees and gardens everywhere in the heart of the town surely it is a most beautiful city and i like the restaurants more than is reasonable dining à la carte and mixing up ones dinner with heaps of newspapers and the solution by emile de girardin who suggests that the next president should be a tailor moreover we find apartments very cheap in comparison to what we feared and we are in a comfortable quiet hotel where it is possible and not ruinous to wait and look about one  as to englandoh englandhow i dread to think of it we talk of going over for a short time but have not decided when yet it will be soon perhapsit may if it were not for my precious arabel i would not go because roberts family would come to him here they say but to give up arabel is impossible henrietta is in somersetshire it is uncertain whether i shall see her even in going and she too might come to paris this winter and you will comeyou promised i think  i feel here near enough to england thats the truth i recoil from the bitterness of being nearer still it must be thought of  dearest cousin dearest friend in all this pleasant journey we have borne you in mind and gratefully you must feel that without being told i wont quite do like my wiedeman who every time he fires his gun if its twenty times in five minutes says papa papa because robert gave him the gun and the gratitude is as reiterantly and loudly explosive but ones thoughts may say what they please and as often as they please  arabel tells me that you are kind to the manner of my poem though to the matter obdurate miss mitford too says that it wont receive the sympathy proper to a home subject because the english people dont care anything for the italians now despising them for their want of originality in art thats very good of the english people really i fear much that dear miss mitford has suffered seriously from the effects of the damp house last winter what she says of herself makes me anxious about her  give my true love to dear miss bayley and say how i repent in ashes for not having written to her but she is largehearted and will forgive me and i shall make amends and send her sheet upon sheet barry cornwalls letter to robert of course delighted as well as honoured me does it appear in the new edition of his songs c  mind if ever i go to england i shall have no heart to go out of a very dark corner i shall just see you and thats all its only robert who is a patriot now of us two england what with the past and the present is a place of bitterness to me bitter enough to turn all her seas round to wormwood airs and hearts all are against me in england yet dont let me be ungrateful no love is forgotten or less prized certainly not yours only im a citizeness of the world now you see and float loose  god bless you dearest mr kenyon prays  your ever affectionate ba  roberts best love as always he writes by this post to mr procter how beautifully sarianna has corrected for the press my new poem wonderfully well really there is only one error of consequence which i will ask you to correct in any copy you canof rail in the last line to vail the allusion being of course to the jewish templebut as it is printed nobody can catch any meaning i fear they tell me that the puseyite organ the guardian has been strong in attack so best                                        after a few weeks in paris the travellers crossed over to england which they had not seen for nearly five years their visit to london lasted about two months from the end of july to the end of september during which time they stayed in lodgings at 26 devonshire street                                        to mrs martin  26 devonshire street wednesday about august 1851  my ever dearest mrs martini am not ungrateful after all but i wanted to write a long letter to you having much to say and even now it is hard in this confusion to write a short one we have been overwhelmed with kindnesses crushed with gifts like the roman lady and literally to drink through a cup of tea from beginning to end without an interruption from the doorbell we have scarcely attained to since we came for my part i refuse all dinner invitations except when our dear friend mr kenyon imposes himself as an exception in his own words but even in keeping the resolution there are necessary fatigues and do you know i have not been well since our arrival in england my first step ashore was into a puddle and a fog and i began to cough before we reached london the quality of the air does not agree with me thats evident for nearly five years i have had no such cough nor difficulty of breathing and my friends who at first sight thought me looking well must forbear all compliments for the future i think i get so much paler every day next week we send wilson to see her mother near sheffield and the baby with her which is a great stroke of fortitude in me only what i cant bear is to see him crying because she is gone away so we resolve on letting them both go together when she returns ten days or a fortnight after we shall have to think of going to paris again indeed robert begins to be nervous about mewhich is nonsense but natural enough perhaps  in regard to colwall you are both my very dear friends the kindest that you can be ah but dearest dearest mrs martin you can understand with the same kindness that you use to me in other things there is only one event in my life which never loses its bitterness which comes back on me like a retreating wave going and coming again which was and is my griefi never had but one brother who loved and comprehended me and so there is just one thought which would be unbearable if i went into your neighbourhood and you wont set it down i am sure as unpardonable weakness much less as affectation if i confess to you that i never could bear it the past would be too strong for me as to hope end it is nothing i have been happier in my own home since than i was there and then but torquay has made the neighbourhood of hope end impossible to me i could not eat or sleep in that air you will forgive me for the weakness i am certain you know a little if not entirely how we loved one another how i was first with him and he with me while god knows that death and separation have no power over such love  after all we shall see you in paris if not in england we pass this winter in paris in the hope of my being able to bear the climate for indeed italy is too far and if the winter does not disagree with me too much we mean to take a house and settle in paris so as to be close to you all and that will be a great joy to me you will pass through paris this autumn wont you on your way to pau and i shall see you i do long to see you and make you know my husband  so far from regretting my marriage it has made the happiness and honour of my life and every unkindness received from my own house makes me press nearer to the tenderest and noblest of human hearts proved by the uninterrupted devotion of nearly five years husband lover nursenot one of these has robert been to me but all three together i neither regret my marriage therefore nor the manner of it because the manner of it was a necessity of the act i thought so at the time i think so now and i believe that the world in general will decide if the world is to be really appealed to that my opinion upon this subject after five years is worth more  dearest mrs martin do write to me i keep my thoughts as far as i can from bitter things and the affectionateness of my dearest sisters is indeed much on the other side also we are both giddy with the kind attentions pressed on us from every side from some of the best in england its hard to think at all in such a confusion we met tennyson the laureate by a chance in paris who insisted that we should take possession of his house and servants at twickenham and use them as long as we liked to stay in england nothing could be more warmly kind and we accepted the note in which he gave us the right of possession for the sake of the generous autograph though we never intended in our own minds to act out the proposition since then mr arnould the chancery barrister has begged us to go and live in his town house we dont want houses you see mrs fanny kemble called on and left us tickets for her shakespeare reading by the way i was charmed with her hamlet mr forster of the examiner gave us a magnificent dinner at thames ditton in sight of the swans and we breakfast on saturday with mr rogers then we have seen the literary guild actors at the hanover square rooms and we have passed an evening with carlyle one of the great sights in england to my mind he is a very warm friend of roberts so that on every account i was delighted to see him face to face i cant tell you what else we have done or not done its a great dazzling heap of things new and strange barry cornwall mr procter came to see us every day till business swept him out of town and dear mrs jameson left her madonna for us in despite of the printers such kindness on all sides ah theres kindness in england after all yet i grew cold to the heart as i set foot on the ground of it and wished myself away also the sort of life is not perhaps the best for me and the sort of climate is really the worst  you heard of mr kenyons goodness to us i told arabel to tell you  but i must end here another time i will talk of paris which i do hope will suit us as a residence i was quite well there the three weeks we stayed and am far from well just now you see the weight of the atmosphere which seems to me like lead combined with the excitement is too much at once oh it wont be very bad i dare say i mean to try to be quiet and abjure for the future the night air  i should not omit to tell you in this quantity of egotism that my husbands father and sister have received me most affectionately she is highly accomplished with a heart to suit the head  now do write let me hear all about you and how dear mr martin and yourself are roberts cordial regards with those of  your ever affectionate and ever grateful ba                                        to mrs martin  26 devonshire street saturday about august 1851  my dearest mrs martinday by day and hour by hour almost i have wanted to thank you again and again for your remedy which i did not use by the bye being much better and to answer your inquiry about me which really i could not deliver over to arabel to answer but the baby did not go to the country with wilson and i have been devoted since she went away une âme perdue with not an instant out of the fourandtwenty hours to call my own it appeared at the last that wilson would have a drawback to her enjoyments in having the child and i did not choose that she had only a fortnight you see after five years to be with her family so i took her place with him it was necessary for he was in a state of deplorable grief when he missed her and has refused ever since to allow any human being except me to do a single thing for him i hold him in my arms at night dress and wash him in the morning walk out with him and am not allowed either to read or write above three minutes at a time he has learnt to say in english no more and i am bound to be obedient perhaps i may make out five minutes just to write this for he is playing in the passage with a child of the house but even so much is doubtful he has made very good friends with a girl here and arabel has sent her maid ever so often to tempt him away for half an hour so as to give me breathing time but he wont be tempted he has it in his head that the world is in a conspiracy against him to take mama away after having taken lily and he is bound to resist it  after all the place of nursery maid is more suitable to me than that of poetess or even poets wife in this obstreperous london i was nearly killed the first weeks what with the climate and what with the kindness and what with the want of kindness and looked wretchedly whether reynolds peyton saw it or not and coughed day and night till robert took fright and actually fixed a day for taking me forthwith back to paris i had to give up a breakfast at rogers and shut myself up in two rooms for a week and refuse like wiedeman to be tempted out anywhere but after that i grew better and the wind changed and now the cough though not gone is quieted and i look a different person and have ceased to grow thin but a racketing life will never do for me nor an english atmosphere i am much afraid the lungs seem to labour in this heavy air oh it is so unlike the air of the continent i say nothing of florence but even of paris where i do wish to be able to live on account of the nearness to this dear detestable england  now let me tell you of wimpole street henry has been very kind in coming not infrequently he has a kind good heart occy too i have seen three or four times alfred and sette once my dearest arabel is of course here once if not twice a day and for hours at a time bringing me great joy always and henriettas dear kindness in coming to london on purpose to see me for a week has left a perfume in my life both those beloved sisters have been as ever perfect to me arabel is vexed just now and so am i my brothers having fixed with papa to go out of town directly and she caring more to stay where i am  i have not written to papa since our arrival through my fear of involving arabel but as soon as they go to the country i shall hopelessly write he is very well and in good spirits thank god  we have spent two days at new cross with my husbands father and sister and she has been here constantly most affectionate they are to me and the babe is taken into adoration by mr browning  but here he is upon me again indeed i have had wonderful luck in having been able to write all this and now god bless both of you my dearest friends oh i do feel to my heart all your kindness in wishing to have us with you and indeed robert would like to see herefordshire but  the remainder of this letter is wanting                                        to mrs martin  26 devonshire street wednesday september 1851  my dearest mrs martini write in haste to you to tell you some things which you should hear without delay  after roberts letter to george had been sent three times to wales and been returned twice it reached him and immediately upon its reaching him to do george justice he wrote a kind reply to apprise us that he would be at our door the same evening so the night before last he came and we are all good friends thank god i tenderly love him and the rest and must for ever deplore that such poor barriers as a pedantic pride can set up should have interposed between long and strong and holy affections for years but it is past and i have been very happy in being held in his arms again and seen in his eyes that i was still something more to him than a stone thrown away so if you have thought severely of him you and dear mr martin do not any longer preserve your friendship for him my dearest friends and let all this foolish mistaken past be well past and forgotten i think him looking thin though it does not strike them so in wimpole street certainly  for the rest the pleasantness is not on every side it seemed to me right notwithstanding that dear mr kenyon advised against it to apprise my father of my being in england i could not leave england without trying the possibility of his seeing me once of his consenting to kiss my child once so i wrote and robert wrote a manly true straightforward letter his was yet in some parts so touching to me and so generous and conciliating everywhere that i could scarcely believe in the probability of its being read in vain in reply he had a very violent and unsparing letter with all the letters i had written to papa through these five years sent back unopened the seals unbroken what went most to my heart was that some of the seals were black with blackedged envelopes so that he might have thought my child or husband dead yet never cared to solve the doubt by breaking the seal he said he regretted to have been forced to keep them by him until now through his ignorance of where he should send them so theres the end i cannot of course write again god takes it all into his own hands and i wait  we go on tuesday if i do not see you as i scarcely hope to do now it will be only a gladness delayed for a few months we shall meet in paris if we live may god bless you both dearest friends i think of you and love you dear mr martin dont stay too late in england this year for the climate seems to me worse than ever not that i have much cough nowi am much betterbut the quality of the atmosphere is unmistakable to my lungs and air passages and i believe it will be wise on this account to go away quickly  your ever affectionate and grateful ba                                        to miss ef haworth2  london september 24 1851  my dear miss haworthi do hope you have not set us quite on the outside of your heart with the unfeeling and ungrateful i say us when i ought to have said me for you have known robert and you have not known me and i am naturally less safe with you than he isless safe in your esteem we should both have gone to inquire after your health if he had not been attacked with influenza and unfit for anything until the days you mentioned as the probable term of your remaining in town had passed i waited till he should be better and the malady lingered now he is well and i do hope you may be so too may it be bear us in mind and love for we go away tomorrow to pariswhere however we shall expect you before long thank you thank you for the books i have been struck and charmed with some things in the companionespecially may i say with the modern pygmalion which catches me on my weak side of the love of wonder by the way what am i to say of swedenborg and mesmerism so much i couldthe books have so drawn and held me as far as i was capable of being drawn or held in this chaos of londonthat i will not speak at all the notepage is too smallthe haste i write in too great  god bless you and good bye robert bids me give you his love of the earnestest and i have leave from you have i not to be always affectionately yours  elizabeth barrett browning                                        the journey to paris was effected at the end of september and for about nine months they pitched their tent at no 138 avenue des champselysées it was a fortunate time to be in paris for those who had no personal nervousness and liked to be near the scene of great eventsa most anxious time for any who were alarmed at disturbances or took keenly to heart the horrors of street fighting fortunately for the brownings they whether by temperament or through their italian experiences were not unduly disturbed at revolutions while the horrors of louis napoleons coup détat were no doubt only partly known to mrs browning at the time and were palliated to her by the view she took of napoleons character she had not it is true raised him as yet to the pinnacle on which his intervention on behalf of italy subsequently caused her to place him but perhaps owing to what mr kenyon called her immoral sympathy with power she was always disposed to put a favourable construction on his actions and the coup détat was finally whitewashed for her by the approbation which the plébiscite of december 20 gave to his assumption of supreme power her views are however so fully set forth in her own letters that they need not be detailed here for her husbands opinion of the character of louis napoleon at least as it appeared to him when looking back after the lapse of years it is only necessary to refer to prince hohenstielschwangau                                        to mrs jameson  paris 138 avenue des champselysées october 21 1851  but didnt you dearest friend get casa guidi and the portrait of madme de goethe left for you in the london house i felt a want of leaving a word of adieu with these and then the chaotic confusion in which we left england stifled the better purpose out of me  with such mixed feelings i went away leaving love behind is always terrible but it was not all love that i left and there was relief in the state of mind with which i threw myself on the sofa at dieppeyes indeed robert felt differently from me for once as was natural for it had been pure joy to him with his family and his friends and i do believe he would have been capable of never leaving england again had such an arrangement been practicable for us on some accounts oh england i love and hate it at once or rather where love of country ought to be in the heart there is the mark of the burning iron in mine and the depth of the scar shows the depth of the root of it well i am writing you an amusing letter today i think after all i wasnt made to live in england or i should not cough there perpetually while no sooner do i get to paris than the cough vanishesit is all but gone now the lightness of the air here makes the place tenableso far at least we made many an effort to get an apartment near the madeleine but we had to sacrifice sun or money or breath in going up to the top of a house and the sacrifice seemed too great upon consideration and we came off to the avenue des champselysées on the sunshiny side of the way to a southern aspect and pretty cheerful carpeted roomsa drawing room a dressing and writing room for robert a small dining room two comfortable bedrooms and a third bedroom upstairs for the femme de service kitchen c for two hundred francs a month not too dear we think about the same that we paid out of the season in london for the miserable accommodation we had there but perhaps you wont come near us now we may be too much out of the way for you is it so indeed understand that close by us is a stand of coupés and fiacres not to profane your ears with the mention of the continual stream of omnibuses by means of which you may reach the other end of paris for six sous and there might be a possibility of taking a small apartment for you in this very house see how i castlebuild  but if the crystal palace vanishes from the face of the earth who shall trust any more in castles will they really pull it down do you think if its a bubble its a glass bubble and not meant therefore for bursting in the air it seems to me and you do want a place in england for sculpture and also to show people how olives grow what a beautiful winter garden it would be but they will pull it down perhaps and then the last we shall have seen of it will be in this description of your letter and thats seeing it worthily too  we were from home last night we went to lady elgins reception and met a madame mohl who was entertaining and is to come to us this morning  she came as i wrote those words she knows you among her other advantages and we have been talking of you dear friend and we are going to her on friday evening to see some of the french i shall have to go to prison very soon i suppose as usual for the winter months for here is the twentyfirst of october though this is the first fire we have had occasion for it was colder this morning but we have had exquisite weather really ever since we left england  the elf is flourishing in all good fairyhood with a scarlet rose leaf on each cheek wilson says she never knew him to have such an irreproachable appetite he is charmed with paris and its magnificent punches and roundabouts and balloonswhich last he says looking up after them gravely go to god the child has curious ideas about theology already he is of opinion that god lives among the birds he has taken to calling himself peninni3 which sounds something like a fairys name though he means it for wiedeman  robert is in good spirits and inclined to like paris increasingly do you know i think you have an idea in england that you monopolise comforts and i for one cant admit it these snug apartments exclude the draughty passages and staircases which threaten your life every time that you run to your bedroom for a pockethandkerchief in england i much prefer the continental houses to the english ones both for winter and summer on this account  so glad i am that you are nearly at the end of your work to rest after work what more than rest that always is  write to us oftendo we are not in italy and you have no excuse for even seeming to forget us we are full in sight still remember  are you aware that carlyle travelled with us to paris he left a deep impression with me it is difficult to conceive of a more interesting human soul i think all the bitterness is love with the point reversed he seems to me to have a profound sensibilityso profound and turbulent that it unsettles his general sympathies do you guess what i mean the least in the world or is it as dark as my writings are of course  i hope on every account you will have no increase of domestic care how is miss procter how kind everybody was to us in england and how affectionately we remember it god bless you yourself we love you for the past and the present besides the future in december  your attached ebb                                        to miss mitford  paris 138 avenue des champselysées october 22 1851  the pause in writing has come from the confusion in living my ever dearest miss mitford and no worse cause it was a long while before we could settle ourselves in a private apartment and we had to stay at the hotel and wander about like doves turned out of the dovecote and seeking where to inhabit we have seen nothing in paris except the shell of it yet no theatresnothing but business yet two evenings ago we hazarded going to a reception at lady elgins in the faubourg st germain and saw some french but nobody of distinction it is a good house i believe and she has an earnest face which must mean something we were invited and are invited to go every monday and that monday in particular between eight and twelve you go in a morning dress and there is tea nothing can be more sans façon and my tremors for do you know i was quite nervous on the occasion and charged robert to keep close to me were perfectly unjustified by the event you see it was an untried form of societylike trying a turkish bath i expected to see balzacs duchesses and hommes de lettres on all sides of me but there was nothing very noticeable i think though we found it agreeable enough we go on friday evening to a madame mohls where we are to have some of the celebrities i believe for she seems to know everybody of all colours from white to red then mazzini is to give us a letter to george sandcome what will we must have a letter to george sandand robert has one to emile lorquet of the national and gavarni of the charivari so that we shall manage to thrust our heads into this atmosphere of parisian journalism and learn by experience how it smells i hear that george sand is seldom at paris now she has devoted herself to playwriting and employs a houseful of men her sons friends and her own in acting privately with her what she writestrying it on a home stage before she tries it at paris her son is a very ordinary young man of threeandtwenty but she is fond of him  never expect me to agree with you in that cause célèbre of ladies and gentlemen against people of letters i dont like the sort of veneer which passes in societyyes i like it but i dont love it i know what the thing is worth as a matter of furnitureaccomplishment and there an end i should rather look at the scratched silent violin in the corner with the sense that music has come out of it or will come i am grateful to the man who has written a good book and i recognise reverently that the roots of it are in him and do you know i was not disappointed at all in what i saw of writers of books in london no not at all carlyle for instance i liked infinitely more in his personality than i expected to like him and i saw a great deal of him for he travelled with us to paris and spent several evenings with us we three together he is one of the most interesting men i could imagine even deeply interesting to me and you come to understand perfectly when you know him that his bitterness is only melancholy and his scorn sensibility highly picturesque too he is in conversation the talk of writing men is very seldom as good  and do you know i was much taken in london with a young authoress geraldine jewsbury you have read her books theres a french sort of daring halfaudacious power in them but she herself is quiet and simple and drew my heart out of me a good deal i felt inclined to love her in our halfhours intercourse and i liked lady eastlake too in another way the lady of the letters from the baltic nay i liked her better than the lady  do write to me and tell me of your house whether you are settling down in it comfortably4 in every new house theres a good deal of birds work in treading and shuffling down the loose sticks and straws before one can feel it is to be a nest robert laughs at me sometimes for pushing about the chairs and tables in a sort of distracted way but its the very instinct of making a sympathetical home that works in me we were miserably off in london i couldnt tuck myself in anyhow and we enjoy in proportion these luxurious armchairs so good for the lollards  people say that the troops which pass before our windows every few days through the arc de lÉtoile to be reviewed will bring the president back with them as emperor some sunny morning not far off as to waiting till may nobody expects it there is a great inward agitation but the surface of things is smooth enough be constant be constant constancy is a rare virtue even where it is not an undeniable piece of wisdom vive napoleon ii  as to the book ah you are always and have always been too good to me thats quite certain and if you are not too good to my husband it is only because i am persuaded in my secret soul nobody can be too good to him  he sends you his warm regards and i send you a kiss of babys who is finishing his babylonish education unfortunate child by learning a complement of french i assure you he understands everything you can say to him in english as well as italian so that he wont be utterly denationalised  god bless you say how you are and write soon  your ever affectionate ebb                                        to miss mitford  paris 138 avenue des champselysées november 12 1851  i see your house my beloved friend and clap my hands for pleasure it will suit you admirably i see plainly from paris and how right you are about the pretty garden not to make it fine and modern you have the right instincts about such things and are too strong for mrs loudon and the landscape gardeners the only defect apparent to me at this distance is the size of the sitting room if you were to see what we call an apartment in paris we have just a slip of a kitchen and no passage no staircase to take up the space which is altogether spent upon sitting and sleeping rooms talk of english comforts its a national delusion the comfort of the continental way of life has only to be tested to be recognised with the exception of the locks of doors and windows which are barbaric here theres no other word for it the economy of a habitation is understood in paris you have the advantages of a large house without the disadvantages without the coldness without the dearness and the beds chairs and sofas are perfect things  but the climate is not perfect it seems for we have had very cold weather the last ten days and i am a prisoner as usual our friends swear to us that it is exceptional weather and that it will be warmer presently and i listen with a sort of doubtful doubt worthy of a metaphysician it is some comfort to hear that its below zero in london meanwhile and that scotland stands eight feet deep in snow  we have a letter for george sand directed à madame george sand from mazzini and we hear that she is to be in paris within twelve days then we must make a rush and present it for her stay here is not likely to be long and i would not miss seeing her for a great deal though i have not read one of her late dramas and only by faith understand that her wonderful genius has conquered new kingdoms her last romance le château des déserts is treated disdainfully in the athenæum i have not read that even but mr chorley is apt to be cold towards french writers and i dont expect his judgment as final therefore have you seen m de la mares correspondence with mirabeau and do you ever catch sight of the revue des deux mondes in the august number is an excellent and most pleasant article on my husband elaborately written and so highly appreciatory as well nigh to satisfy me5 set you down this that there has sprung up in france lately an ardent admiration of the present english schools of poetry or rather of the poetry produced by the present english schools which they consider an advance upon the poetry of the ages think of this you english readers who are still wearing broad hems and bombazeens for the byron and scott glorious days  let me think what i can tell you of the president i have never seen his face though he has driven past me in the boulevards and past these windows constantly but it is said that he is very like his portraitsand yes rumour and the gazettes speak of his riding well wilson and wiedeman had an excellent view of him the other day as he turned into a courtyard to pay some visit and she tells me that his carriage was half full of petitions and nosegays thrown through the windows what a fourth act of a play we are in just now it is difficult to guess at the catastrophe certainly he must be very sure of his hold on the people to propose repealing the may edict6 and yet there are persons who persist in declaring that nobody cares for him and that even a revision of the constitution will not bring about his reelection i am of an opposite mind though there is not much overt enthusiasm of the population in behalf of his person still this may arise from a quiet resolve to keep him where he is and an assurance that he cant be ousted in spite of the people and army it is significant i think that emile de girardin should stretch out a hand a little dirty be it observed in passing and that lamartine after fasting nineteen days and nights a miraculous fast without fear of the prefect should murmur a credo in favour of his honesty as to honesty i do believe hes honest that is to say he has acted out no dishonesty as yet and we have no right to interpret doubtful texts into dishonorable allegations but for ambitionfor ambition answer from the depth of your conscience de profundis is he or is he not an ambitious man does he or does he not mean in his soul to be napoleon the second yes yesi think you think we all think  roberts father and sister have been paying us a visit during the last three weeks they are very affectionate to me and i love them for his sake and their own and am very sorry at the thought of losing them which we are on the point of doing we hope however to establish them in paris if we can stay and if no other obstacle should arise before the spring when they must leave hatcham little wiedeman draws as you may suppose he is adored by his grandpapa and then robert they are an affectionate family and not easy when removed one from another sarianna is full of accomplishment and admirable sense eventempered and excellent in all waysdevoted to her father as she was to her mother indeed the relations of life seem reversed in their case and the father appears the child of the child  perhaps you have not seen eugène sues mystères de parisand i am not deep in the first volume yet fancy the wickedness and stupidity of trying to revive the distinctions and hatreds of race between the gauls and franks the gauls please to understand are the prolétaires and the capitalists are the frank invaders call them cosaques says sue out of the forests of germany  i saw no mr harness and no talfourd of any kind the latter was a kind of misadventure as lady talfourd was on the point of calling on me when robert would not let her we were going away just then mr horne i had the satisfaction of seeing several timesyou know how much regard i feel for him one evening he had the kindness to bring his wife miles upon miles just to drink tea with us and we were to have spent a day with them somehow half among the fields but engagements came betwixt us adversely she is less pretty and more interesting than i expectedlooking very young her black glossy hair hanging down her back in ringlets with deep earnest eyes and a silent listening manner he was full of the household words and seems to write articles together with dickenswhich must be highly unsatisfactory as dickenss name and fame swallow up every sort of minor reputation in the shadow of his path i shouldnt like for my part and if i were a fish to herd with crocodiles but i suppose the household words payand thats a consideration claudie i have not read we have only just subscribed to a library and we have been absorbed a good deal by our visitors  write and dont leave off loving me i will tell you of everybody noticeable whom i happen to see and of george sand among the first  love your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs jameson  paris 138 avenue des champselysées december 10 1851  i receive your letter dearest friend and hasten to write a few brief words to save the post  we have suffered neither fear nor dangerand i would not have missed the grand spectacle of the second of december7 for anything in the worldscarcely i say for the sight of the alps  on the only day in which there was much fighting thursday wiedeman was taken out to walk as usual under the precaution of keeping in the immediate neighbourhood of this house this will prove to you how little we have feared for ourselves  but the natural emotion of the situation one could not escape from and on thursday night i sate up in my dressing gown till nearly one listening to the distant firing from the boulevards thursday was the only day in which there was fighting of any serious kind there has been no resistance on the part of the real peoplenothing but sympathy for the president i believe if you except the natural mortification and disappointment of baffled parties to judge from our own tradespeople il a bien fait cest le vrai neveu de son oncle such phrases rung on every tone expressed the prevailing sentiment  for my own part i have not only more hope in the situation but more faith in the french people than is ordinary among the english who really try to exceed one another in discoloration and distortion of the circumstances the government was in a deadlockwhat was to be done yes all parties cried out what was to be done and felt that we were waist deep a fortnight ago in a state of crisis in throwing back the sovereignty from a representative assembly which had virtually ceased to represent into the hands of the people i think that louis napoleon did well the talk about military despotism is absolute nonsense the french army is eminently civic and nations who take their ideas from the very opposite fact of a standing army are far from understanding how absolutely a french soldier and french citizen are the same thing the independence of the elections seems to be put out of reach of injury and intelligent men of adverse opinions to the government think that the majority will be large in its favour such a majority would certainly justify louis napoleon or shouldeven with you in england  i think you quite understate the amount of public virtue in france the difficulties of statesmanship here are enormous i do not accuse even m thiers of want of public virtue what he has wanted has been length and breadth of viewpurely an intellectual defectand his petty puny tracasseries destroyed the republican assembly just as it destroyed the throne of louis philippe in spite of his own intentions  there is a conflict of ideas in france which we have no notion of in england but we ought to understand that it does not involve the failing of principle in the elemental moral sense be just to france dear friend you who are more than an englishwomana mrs jameson  everything is perfectly tranquil in paris i assure youtheatres full and galleries open as usual at the same time timid and discouraged persons say wait till after the elections and of course the public emotion will be a good deal excited at that time therefore judge for yourself for my own part i have not had the slightest cause for alarm of any kindand there is my child judge  the weather is exquisite and i am going out to walk directly it is scarcely possible to bear a fire and some of our friends sit with the window open we are all well  this should have gone to you yesterday but we had visitors who talked past post time the delay however has allowed of my writing more than i meant to have done in beginning this letter roberts best love  your ever affectionate ba  robert says that according to the impression of the wisest there can be no danger dont wait till after the elections the time is most interesting and it is well worth your while to come and see for yourself                                        to mrs martin  paris 138 avenue des champselysées december 11 1851  to show how alive i am dearest mrs martin i will tell you that i have just come home from a long walk to the tuileries we took a carriage to return thats true then yesterday i was out besides and last saturday the 6th we drove down the boulevards to see the field of action on the terrible thursday the only day on which there was any fighting of consequence counting the holes in the walls bored by the cannon and looking at the windows smashed in even then though the asphalte was black with crowds the quiet was absolute and most of the shops reopened on sunday the theatres were as full as usual and our champselysées had quite its complement of promenaders wiedemans prophecy had not been carried out any more than the prophecies of the wiser maythe soldiers had not shot punch  and now i do beg you not to be downhearted see if french blood runs in your veins that you dont take a pedantic view of this question like an englishwoman constitutional forms and essential principles of liberty are so associated in england that they are apt to be confounded and are in fact constantly confounded for my part i am too good a democrat to be afraid of being thrown back upon the primitive popular element from impossible paper constitutions and unrepresenting representative assemblies the situation was in a deadlock and all the conflicting parties were full of dangerous hope of taking advantage of it and i dont see for my part what better could be done for the french nation than to sweep the board clear and bid them begin again with no sort of prejudice in favour of louis napoleon except i confess to you some artistical admiration for the consummate ability and courage shown in his coup détat with no particular faith in the purity of his patriotism i yet hold him justified so far that is i hold that a pure patriot would be perfectly justifiable in taking the same steps which up to this moment he has taken he has broken certainly the husk of an oath but fidelity to the intention of it seems to me reconcilable with the breach and if he had not felt that he had the great mass of the people to back him he is at least too able a man be certain if not too honest a man to have dared what he has dared you will see the result of the elections as to paris dont believe that paris suffers violence from louis napoleon the result of my own impressions is a conviction that from the beginning he had the sympathy of the whole population here with him to speak generally and exclusively of particular parties all our tradespeople for instance milkman breadman wine merchant and the rest yes even the shrewd old washerwoman and the concierge and our little lively servant were in a glow of sympathy and admiration mais cest le vrai neveu de son oncle il est admirable enfin la patrie sera sauvée the bourgeoisie has now accepted the situation it is admitted on all hands scandalous adhesion say some dreadful apathy say others dont you say either one or the other or i think you will be unjust to paris and france  the french people are very democratical in their tendencies but they must have a visible type of heroworship and they find it in the bearer of that name napoleon that name is the only tradition dear to them and it is deeply dear that a man bearing it and appealing at the same time to the whole people upon democratical principles should be answered from the heart of the people should neither astonish nor shame nor enrage anybody  an editor of the national a friend of ours feels this so much that he gnashes his teeth over the imprudence of the extreme reds who did not set themselves to trample out the fires of buonapartism while they had some possibility of doing it ce peuple a la tête dure said he vehemently  as to military despotism would france bear that do you think is the french army besides made after the fashion of standing armies such as we see in other countries are they not eminently civic flesh of the peoples flesh i fear no military despotism for france oh none every soldier is a citizen and every citizen is or has been a soldier  altogether instead of despairing i am full of hope it seems to me probable that the door is open to a wider and calmer political liberty than france has yet enjoyed let us wait  the american forms of republicanism are most uncongenial to this artistic people but democratical institutions will deepen and broaden i think even if we should soon all be talking of the empire  as to the repressive measures why grant the righteousness of the movement and you must accept its conditions dont believe the tremendous exaggerations you are likely to hear on all sidesdont i beseech you  the president rode under our windows on december 2 through a shout extending from the carrousel to the arc de letoile the troups poured in as we stood and looked no sight could be grander and i would not have missed it not for the alps i say  you say nothing specific how i should like to know why exactly you are out of spirits and whether dear mr martin is sad too robert and i have had some domestic émeutes because he hates some imperial names yet he confessed to me last night that the excessive and contradictory nonsense he had heard among legitimists orleanists and english against the movement inclined him almost to a revulsion of feeling  i would have written to you today even if i had not received your letter you will forgive that what i have written should have been scratched in the utmost haste to save the post i cant even read it over theres the effect of going out to walk the first thing in the morning  your ever affectionate bato both of you                                        to miss mitford  paris 138 avenue des champselysées christmas eve 1851  what can you have thought of me that i was shot or deserved to be forgive in the first instance dearest friend and believe that i wont behave so any more if in any way i can help it  tell me your thought now about l napoleon he rode under our windows on december 2 through an immense shout from the carrousel to the arc de letoile there was the army and the sun of austerlitz and even i thought it one of the grandest of sights for he rode there in the name of the people after all  but we know men most opposed to him writers of the old presse and national and orleanists and legitimists and the fury of all such i can scarcely express to you after the life emile de girardin and his friends had a sublime scheme of going over in a body to england and establishing a socialist periodical inscribing on their new habitation ici cest la france he actually advertised for sale his beautiful house close by in the champselysées asked ten thousand pounds english for it and would have been rather disappointed as one of his sympathising friends confessed to us if the offer had been accepted i heard a good story the other day a lady visitor was groaning politically to madame de girardin over the desperateness of the situation il ny a que celui qui est en haut qui peut nous en tirer said she casting up her eyes oui cest vrai replied madame il le pourrait lui glancing towards the second floor where emile was at work upon feuilletons not that she mistakes him habitually for her deity by any manner of means if scandal is to be listened to  i hear that lamennais is profoundly disgusted he said to a friend of ours that the french people were putrefied to the heart which means that they have one tradition still dear to them the name of napoleon and that they put no faith in the socialistic prophets wise or unwise they may be accordingly but an affection and an apprehension cant reasonably be said to amount to a putrefaction i think no indeed  louis napoleon is said to say a bitter foe of his told me this that there will be four phases of his life the first was all rashness and imprudence but it was necessary to make him known the second the struggle with and triumph over anarchy the third the settlement of france and the pacification of europe the fourth a coup de pistolet se non è vero è ben trovato nothing is more likely than the catastrophe in any case and the violence of the passions excited in the minority makes me wonder at his surviving a day even do you know i heard your idol of a napoleon the antique hero called the other evening through a black beard and gnashing teeth le plus grand scélérat du monde and his empire le règne du satan and his marshals les coquins after that i wont tell you that le neveu is reproached with every iniquity possible to anybodys public and private life perhaps he is not sans reproche in respect to the latter not altogether but one cant believe and oughtnt even infinitesimally the things which are talked on the subject  ah i am so vexed about george sand she came she has gone and we havent met there was a m françois who pretended to be her very very particular friend and who managed the business so particularly ill from some motive or some incapacity that he did not give us an opportunity of presenting our letter he did not dare to present it for us he said she is shyshe distrusts bookmaking strangers and she intended to be incognita while in paris he proposed that we should leave it at the theatre and robert refused robert said he wouldnt have our letter mixed up with the love letters of the actresses or perhaps given to the premier comique to read aloud in the green room as a relief to the chère adorable which had produced so much laughter robert was a little proud and m françois very stupid and i between the two in a furious state of dissent from either robert tries to smooth down my ruffled plumage now by promising to look out for some other opportunity but the late one has gone she is said to have appeared in paris in a bloom of recovered beauty and brilliancy of eyes and the success of her play le mariage de victorine was complete a strange wild wonderful woman certainly while she was here she used a bedroom which belongs to her sona mere chambre de garçonand for the rest saw whatever friends she chose to see only at the café where she breakfasted and dined she has just finished a romance we hear and took fiftytwo nights to write it she writes only at night people call her madame sand there seems to be no other name for her in society or letters  now listen alexandre dumas does write his own books thats a fact you know i always maintained it through the odour of dumas in the books but people swore the contrary with great foolish oaths worth nothing maquet prepares historical materials gathers together notes and so on but dumas writes every word of his books with his own hand and with a facility amounting to inspiration said my informant he called him a great savage negro child if he has twenty sous and wants bread he buys a pretty cane instead for the rest bon enfant kind and amiable an inspired negro child in debt at this moment after all the sums he has made said my informanthimself a most credible witness and highly cultivated man  i heard of eugène sue too yesterday our child is invited to a christmas tree and party and robert says he is too young to go but i persist in sending him for half an hour with wilsonoh really i mustthough he will be by far the youngest of the thirty children invited the lady of the house miss fitton an english resident in paris an elderly woman shrewd and kind said to robert that she had a great mind to have eugène sue only he was so scampish i think that was the word or something alarmingly equivalent now i should like to see eugène sue with my little innocent child in his arms the idea of the combination pleases me somewhat but i shant see it in any case we had three cold days last week which brought back my cough and took away my voice i am dumb for the present and cant go out any more  at last i have caught sight of an advertisement of your book a very catching title and if i maynt compliment you upon it i certainly do your publisher i dare say the book is charming and the more of yourself in it the more charming  write and say how you are always when you write say too how you continue to like your new house we heard a good deal of you from mr fields though he came to us only once with him came mr longfellow the poets brother who is at present in parisi mean the brother not the poet roberts love may i say  wiedeman has struck up two friendships one with the small daughter of our concierge and one with a little russian princess a month younger than himself he calls them both boys having no idea yet of the less sublime sex but he likes the plebeian best may god make you happy on this and other seasons  love your affectionate and grateful ba                                        to mrs martin  paris 138 avenue des champselysées january 17 1852  my dearest mrs martinif you think i have not written to you you must be as you are the most lenient of friends not to give me up for ever i answered your first letter by return of post and at great length about a fortnight ago robert heard from madame mohl who heard from somebody at pau that you were waiting anxiously to hear from me upon which i wrote a second letter and that too did not reach you is it possible but i am innocent innocent innocent see how innocent now if m le président has stopped my letters or if he ponders in his imperial mind how to send me out of paris he is as ungrateful as a king because i have been taking his part all this time at a great cost of domestic émeutes so you would have known if you had received my letters the coup détat was a grand thing dramatically and poetically speaking and the appeal to the people justified it in my eyes considering the immense difficulty of the circumstances the impossibility of the old constitution and the impracticability of the house of assembly now thats all over for the restthe new constitutioni cant say as much for it it disappoints me immensely absolute government no while the taxes and acceptance of law lies as he leaves it with the people but there are stupidities undeniable i am afraid and how such a constitution is to work and how marshals and cardinals are to help to work it remains to be seen i fear we have not made a good change even from the constitution marrast8 after all the english newspapers have made me so angry that i scarcely know whether i am as much ashamed yet the shame is very great as if the people of france had not a right to vote as they pleased9 we understand nothing in england as cousin said long ago we are insular of understanding france may be mistaken in her speculations as she often is and if any mistake has been lately committed it will be corrected by herself in a short time ignoble in her speculations she never is  i must tell you my dearest friend that for some days past i have been very much upset and am scarcely now fairly on my feet again in consequence of becoming suddenly aware of a painful indiscretion committed by an affectionate and generous woman i refer to miss mitfords account of me in her new book10 we heard of it in a strange way through m philaret chasles of the collège de france beginning a course of lectures on english literature and announcing an extended notice of ebb the veil from whose private life had lately been raised by miss mitford somebody who happened to be present told us of it and while we were wondering and uncomfortable up came a writer in the revue des deux mondes to consult robert upon a difficulty he was in he was engaged he said upon an article relating to me and the proprietors of the review had sent him a number of the athenæum which contained an extract from miss ms book desiring him to make use of the biographical details now it struck him immediately he said on reading the passage that it was likely to give me great pain and he was so unwilling to be the means of giving me more pain that he came to robert to ask him how he should act do observe the delicacy and sensibility of this mana man a foreigner a frenchman i shall be grateful to him as long as i live11  robert has seen the extract in the athenæum it refers to the great affliction of my life with the most affectionate intentions and the obtusest understanding i know i am morbid but this thing should not have been done indeed now i shall be liable to see recollections dreadful to me thrust into every vulgar notice of my books i shall be afraid to see my books reviewed anywhere oh i have been so deeply shaken by all this you will understand i am certain and i could not help speaking of it to you because i was certain  i am answering your note observe by return of post do let me know if you receive what i write this time robert will direct for me having faith in his superior legibleness and i accept the insult implied in the opinion  god bless you do write and never doubt my grateful affection for you whether posts go ill or well  robert is going out to inquire about my novel his warm regards with mine to dear mr martin and yourself this is a scratch rather than a letter but i would rather send it to you in haste than wait for another post  your ever affectionate ba                                        the following letter marks the beginning of a new friendship with miss mulock afterwards mrs craik the authoress of john halifax gentleman the subsequent letters are in very affectionate tones but it does not appear that the correspondence ever reached any very extended dimensions                                        to miss mulock  paris 138 avenue des champselysées january 21 1852  i hear from england that you have dedicated a book to me with too kind and most touching words to thank you for such a proof of sympathy to thank you from my heart cannot surely be a wrong thing to do it seems so natural and comes from so irresistible an impulse  i read a book of yours once at florence which first made me know you pleasantly and afterwards that was at florence too there came a piercing touch from a hand in the airwhether yours also i cannot dare to guesswhich has preoccupied me a good deal since if i speak to you in mysteries forgive me let it be clear at least that i am very happy to be grateful to you for the honor you have done me in your dedication and that my husband moved more as he always is by honor paid to me than to himself thanks you beside i will not keep back his thanks which are worth more than mine can be  for the rest we have neither of us seen the book yet nor even read an exact copy of the words in question only the rumour of them appears to run that i am not likely ever to see you and why am i never to see you pray unlikelier pleasures have been granted to me and i will not indeed lose hold of the hope of this pleasure  allow it to  your always obliged elizabeth barrett browning                                        to miss mitford  paris 138 avenue des champselysées januaryfebruary 1852  my very dear friend let me begin what i have to say by recognising you as the most generous and affectionate of friends i never could mistake the least of your intentions you were always from first to last kind and tenderly indulgent to mealways exaggerating what was good in me always forgetting what was faulty and weakkeeping me by force of affection in a higher place than i could aspire to by force of vanity loving me always in fact now let me tell you the truth it will prove how hard it is for the tenderest friends to help paining one another since you have pained me see what a deep wound i must have in me to be pained by the touch of such a hand oh i am morbid i very well know but the truth is that i have been miserably upset by your book and that if i had had the least imagination of your intending to touch upon certain biographical details in relation to me i would have conjured you by your love to me and by my love to you to forbear it altogether you cannot understand no you cannot understand with all your wide sympathy perhaps because you are not morbid and i am the sort of susceptibility i have upon one subject i have lived heart to heart for instance with my husband these five years i have never yet spoken out in a whisper even what is in me never yet could find heart or breath never yet could bear to hear a word of reference from his lips and now those dreadful words are going the round of the newspapers to be verified here commented on there gossiped about everywhere and i for my part am frightened to look at a paper as a child in the darkas unreasonably you will saybut what then what drives us mad is our unreason i will tell you how it was first of all an english acquaintance here told us that she had been hearing a lecture at the collège de france and that the professor m philaret chasles in the introduction to a series of lectures on english poetry had expressed his intention of noticing tennyson browning c and ebbfrom whose private life the veil had been raised in so interesting a manner lately by miss mitford in the midst of my anxiety about this up comes a writer of the revue des deux mondes to my husband to say that he was preparing a review upon me and had been directed by the editor to make use of some biographical details extracted from your book into the athenæum but that it had occurred to him doubtfully whether certain things might not be painful to me and whether i might not prefer their being omitted in his paper all this time we had seen neither book nor athenæum robert answered for me that the omission of such and such things would be much preferred by me and accordingly the article appears in the revue with the passage from your book garbled and curtailed as seemed best to the quoter then robert set about procuring the athenæum in question he tells me and that i perfectly believe that for the facts to be given at all they could not possibly be given with greater delicacy oh and i will add for myself that for them to be related by anyone during my life i would rather have you to relate them than another but why should they be related during my life there was no need no need to show my nervous susceptibility in the length and breadth of it to you i could not when it came to the point bear to read the passage extracted in the athenæum notwithstanding my natural anxiety to see exactly what was done i could not bear to do it i made robert read it aloudwith omissionsso that i know all your kindness i feel it deeply through tears of pain i feel it and if as i dare say you will you think me very very foolish do not on that account think me ungrateful ungrateful i never can be to you my much loved and kindest friend  i hear your book is considered one of your best productions and i do not doubt that the opinion is just thank you for giving it to us thank you  i dont like to send you a letter from paris without a word about your herohandsome i fancy not nor the imperial type i have not seen his face distinctly what do you think about the constitution will it work do you fancy nowadays in france the initiative of the laws put out of the power of the legislative assembly seems to me a stupidity and the senators in their fine dresses make me wink a little also i hear that the senatorial cardinals dont please the peasants who hate the priesthood as much as they hate the cossacks on the other hand montalembert was certainly in bed the other day with vexation because nobody could do anything with louis napoleonhe was obstinate nous nous en lavons les mains and that fact gives me hope that not too much indulgence is intended to the church theres to be a ball at the tuileries with court dresses which is un peu fort for a republic by the way rumour with apparent authority justifying it says that a black woman opened her mouth and prophesied to him at ham he should be the head of the french nation and be assassinated in a ballroom i was assured that he believes the prophecy firmly being in all things too superstitious and fatalistical  i was interrupted in this letter yesterday meantime comes out the decree against the orleans property which i disapprove of altogether its the worst thing yet done to my mind yet the bourse stands fast and the decree is likely enough to be popular with the ouvrier class there are rumours of tremendously wild financial measures only i believe in no rumours just now and apparently the bourse is as incredulous on this particular point if i thought as people say that we are on the verge of a law declaring the roman catholic religion the state religion i should give him up at once but this would be contrary to the traditions of the empire and i cant suppose it to be probable on any account  observe i am no napoleonist i am simply a democrat and hold that the majority of a nation has the right of choice upon the question of its own government even where it makes a mistake therefore the outcry of the english newspapers is most disgusting to me for the rest one can hardly do strict justice at this time of transition to the ultimate situation of the country we must really wait a little till the wind and rain shall have ceased to dash so in ones eyes the wits go on talking though all the same and i heard a suggestion yesterday that for the effaced liberté égalité fraternité should be written up infanterie cavallerie artillerie thats the last mot i believe the salons are very noisy a lady was ordered to her country seat the other day for exclaiming et il ny a pas de charlotte corday  forgive with this dull letter my other defects always i am frank to you saying what is in my heart and there is always there dearest miss mitford a fruitful and grateful affection to you from your  ebb                                        to miss mitford  paris 138 avenue des chelysées february 15 1852  thank you thank you my beloved friend yes i do understand in my heart all your kindness yes i do believe that on some points i am full of disease and this has exposed me several times to shocks of pain in the ordinary intercourse of the world which for bystanders were hard i dare say to make out once at the baths of lucca i was literally nearly struck down to the ground by a single word said in all kindness by a friend whom i had not seen for ten years the blue sky reeled over me and i caught at something not to fall well there is no use dwelling on this subject i understand your affectionateness and tender consideration i repeat and thank you and love you which is better now let us talk of reasonable things  béranger lives close to us and robert has seen him in his white hat wandering along the asphalte i had a notion somehow that he was very old but he is only elderly not much indeed above sixty which is the prime of life nowadays and he lives quietly and keeps out of scrapes poetical and political and if robert and i had but a little less modesty we are assured that we should find access to him easy but we cant make up our minds to go to his door and introduce ourselves as vagrant minstrels when he may probably not know our names we never could follow the fashion of certain authors who send their books about without intimations of their being likely to be acceptable or not of which practice poor tennyson knows too much for his peace if indeed a letter of introduction to béranger were vouchsafed to us from any benign quarter we should both be delighted but we must wait patiently for the influence of the stars meanwhile we have at last sent our letter mazzinis to george sand accompanied with a little note signed by both of us though written by me as seemed right being the woman we half despaired in doing this for it is most difficult it appears to get at her she having taken vows against seeing strangers in consequence of various annoyances and persecutions in and out of print which its the mere instinct of a woman to avoid i can understand it perfectly also she is in paris for only a few days and under a new name to escape from the plague of her notoriety people said to us she will never see you you have no chance i am afraid but we determined to try at last i pricked robert up to the leap for he was really inclined to sit in his chair and be proud a little no said i you shant be proud and i wont be proud and we will see her i wont die if i can help it without seeing george sand so we gave our letter to a friend who was to give it to a friend who was to place it in her hands her abode being a mystery and the name she used unknown the next day came by the post this answer       madamejaurai lhonneur de vous recevoir dimanche prochain      rue racine 3 cest le seul jour que je puisse passer chez      moi et encore je nen suis pas absolument certaine mais jy      ferai tellement mon possible que ma bonne étoile my aidera      peutêtre un peu       agréez mille remercîments de coeur ainsi que monsieur      browning que jespère voir avec vous pour la sympathie que      vous maccordez       george sand      paris 12 février 52   this is graceful and kind is it not and we are going tomorrow i rather at the risk of my life but i shall roll myself up head and all in a thick shawl and we shall go in a close carriage and i hope i shall be able to tell you about the result before shutting up this letter  one of her objects in coming to paris this time was to get a commutation of the sentence upon her friend dufraisse who was ordered to cayenne she had an interview accordingly with the president he shook hands with her and granted her request and in the course of conversation pointed to a great heap of decrees on the table being hatched for the good of france i have heard scarcely anything of him except from his professed enemies and it is really a good deal the simple recoil from manifest falsehoods and gross exaggerations which has thrown me on the ground of his defenders for the rest it remains to be proved i think whether he is a mere ambitious man or betterwhether his personality or his country stands highest with him as an object i thought and still think that a washington might have dissolved the assembly as he did and appealed to the people which is not saying however that he is a washington we must wait i think to judge the man only it is right to bear in mind one fact that admitting the lawfulness of the coup détat you must not object to the dictatorship and admitting the temporary necessity of the dictatorship it is absolute folly to expect under it the liberty and ease of a regular government  what has saved him with me from the beginning was his appeal to the people and what makes his government respectable in my eyes is the answer of the people to that appeal being a democrat i dare to be so consequently there never was a more legitimate chief of a state than louis napoleon is nowelected by seven millions and a half and i do maintain that ape or demigod to insult him where he is is to insult the people who placed him there as to the stupid outcry in england about forced votes voters pricked forward by bayonetswhy nothing can be more stupid nobody not blinded by passion could maintain such a thing for a moment no frenchman however blinded by passion has maintained it in my presence  a very philosophically minded man french was talking of these things the other dayone of the most thoughtful liberal men i ever knew of any country and high and pure in his moral viewsalso let me add more anglomane in general than i am he was talking of the english press he said he did it justice for good and noble intentions more than i do but marvelled at its extraordinary ignorance those writers did not know the a b c of france then as to louis napoleon whether he was right or wrong they erred in supposing him not to be in earnest with his constitution and other remedies for france the fact was he not only was in earnesthe was even fanatical  there is of course much to deplore in the present state of affairsmuch that is very melancholy the constitution is not a model one and no prospect of even comparative liberty of the press has been offered at the same time i hope still as tranquillity is established there will be certain modifications this indeed has been intimated and i think the press will by degrees attain to its emancipation meanwhile the athenæum and other english papers say wrongly that there is a censure established on books there is a censure on pamphlets and newspaperson books no cormenin is said to have been the adviser of the orleans confiscation                                        to john kenyon  paris 138 avenue des chelysées february 15 1852  my dearest mr kenyonrobert sends you his shelley12 having a very few copies allowed to him to dispose of i think you have shelleys other letters of which this volume is the supplement and you will not be sorry to have roberts preface thrown in though he makes very light of it himself  you never write a word to us and so i dont mean to send you a letter todayonly as few lines as i can drop in a sulky fit repenting as i go on as to politics you know you have all put me in the corner because i stand up for universal suffrage and am weak enough to fancy that seven millions and a half of frenchmen have some right to an opinion on their own affairs its really fatal in this world to be consequentit leads one into damnable errors so i shall not say much more at present you must bear with medear miss bayley and all of youand believe of me if i am ever so wrong that i do at least pray from my soul may the right prevailloving right truth justice and the people through whatever mistakes as it was in the beginning from casa guidi windows so it is now from the avenue des champselysées i am most humanly liable of course to make mistakes and am by temperament perhaps over hopeful and sanguine but i do see with my own eyes and feel with my own spirit and not with other peoples eyes and spirits though they should happen to be the dearestand thats the very best of me be certain so dont quarrel with it too much  as to the worst of the president let him have vultures beak hyenas teeth and the rattle of the great serpent its nothing to the question let him be caligulas horse raised to the consulshipwhat then i am not a buonapartist i am simply a democrat as you say i simply hold to the fact that such as he is the people chose him and to the opinion that they have a right to choose whom they please when your english press denies the fact of the choice a fact which the most passionate of partymen does not think of denying here i seem to have a right to another opinion which might strike you as unpatriotic if i uttered it in this place hic tacet then rather jacet  for the rest for heavens sake and the truths do let us try to take breath a little and be patient let us wait till the dust of the struggle clears away before we take measures of the circus we cant have the liberty of a regular government under a dictatorship and if the constitution which is coming is not model it may wear itself into shape by being worked calmly these new boots will be easier to the feet after half an hours walking not that i like the pinching meanwhile not that stringencies upon the press please meno nor arrests and imprisonments i like these things god knows as little as the loudest curser of you all but i dont think it necessary and lawful to exaggerate and overcolour nor to paint the cheeks of sorrows into horrors nor to talk like the quarterly review betwixt excuses for the king of naples of two thousand four hundred persons being cut to mincemeat in the streets of paris nor to call boldness hypocrisy because hypocrisy is the worse word and the appeal to the sovereignty of the people usurpation and universal suffrage the pricking of bayonets above all i would avoid insulting the whole french nation who have judged their own position and acted accordingly if louis napoleon disappoints their expectation he wont sit long where he is of that i feel satisfactory assurance and considering the national habits of insurrection i really think that others may  meanwhile it is just to tell you that the two deepestminded persons whom we have known in parisone an ultrarepublican of european reputation i dont like mentioning names and the other a constitutionalist of the purest and noblest moral natureare both inclined to take favorable views of the presidents personal character and intentions for my part i dont pretend to an opinion he may be as they say bon enfant homme de conscience and so much in earnest as to be fanatical or he may be a wretch and a reptile as you say in england thats nothing to the question as i see it i dont take it up by that handle at all caligulas horse or the peoples messiah as i heard him called the other daywhat then you are wonderfully intolerant you in england of equine consulships you who bear with quite sufficient equanimity a great rampancy of beasts all over the worldmr forster not blowing the trumpet of war and mrs alfred tennyson not loading the rifles  there nowive done with politics today only just let me tell you that cormenin is said to be the adviser in the matter of the orleans decrees so much the worse for him  whom do you think i saw yesterday george sand oh i have been in such fear about it its the most difficult thing to get access to her and notwithstanding our letter from mazzini we were assured on all sides that she would not see us she has been persecuted by bookmakersrun to ground by the race and after having quite lost her on her former visit to paris it was in half despair that we seized on an opportunity of committing our letter of introduction to a friend of a friend of hers who promised to put it into her own hands with the letter i wrote a little notei writing as i was the woman and both of us signing it to my delight we had an answer by the next days post gracious and graceful desiring us to call on her last sunday  so we went robert let me at last though i had a struggle for even that the air being rather oversharp for me but i represented to him that one might as well lose ones life as ones peace of mind for ever and if i lost seeing her i should with difficulty get over it so i put on my respirator smothered myself with furs and in a close carriage did not run much risk after all  she received us very kindly with hand stretched out which i with a natural emotion i assure you my heart beat stooped and kissed when she said quickly mais non je ne veux pas and kissed my lips she is somewhat large for her heightnot talland was dressed with great nicety in a sort of grey serge gown and jacket made after the ruling fashion just now and fastened up to the throat plain linen collarette and sleeves her hair was uncovered divided on the forehead in black glossy bandeaux and twisted up behind the eyes and brow are noble and the nose is of a somewhat jewish character the chin a little recedes and the mouth is not good though mobile flashing out a sudden smile with its white projecting teeth there is no sweetness in the face but great moral as well as intellectual capacitiesonly it never could have been a beautiful face which a good deal surprised me the chief difference in it since it was younger is probably that the cheeks are considerably fuller than they used to be but this of course does not alter the type her complexion is of a deep olive i observed that her hands were small and wellshaped we sate with her perhaps threequarters of an hour or morein which time she gave advice and various directions to two or three young men who were there showing her confidence in us by the freest use of names and allusion to facts she seemed to be in fact the man in that company and the profound respect with which she was listened to a good deal impressed me you are aware from the newspapers that she came to paris for the purpose of seeing the president in behalf of certain of her friends and that it was a successful mediation what is peculiar in her manners and conversation is the absolute simplicity of both her voice is low and rapid without emphasis or variety of modulation except one brilliant smile she was graveindeed she was speaking of grave matters and many of her friends are in adversity but you could not help seeing both robert and i saw it that in all she said even in her kindness and pity there was an undercurrent of scorn a scorn of pleasing she evidently had there never could have been a colour of coquetry in that woman her very freedom from affectation and consciousness had a touch of disdain but i liked her i did not love her but i felt the burning soul through all that quietness and was not disappointed in george sand when we rose to go i could not help saying cest pour la dernière fois and then she asked us to repeat our visit next sunday and excused herself from coming to see us on the ground of a great press of engagements she kissed me again when we went away and robert kissed her hand  lady elgin has offered to take him one day this week to visit lamartine who we hear will be glad to see us having a cordial feeling towards england and english poets but i shall wait for some very warm day for that visit not meaning to run mortal risks except for george sand nota bene we didnt see her smoke  robert has ventured to send to your house my dearest friend two copies of shelley besides yoursone for mr procter and one for mrs jameson with kindest love both there is no hurry about either you know we wanted another for dear miss bayley but we have only six copies and dont keep one for ourselves and she wont care i dare say  your ever most affectionate and grateful ba  will you let your servant put this letter into the post for miss mitford she upset me by her book but had the most affectionate intentions and i am obliged to her for what she meant then i am morbid i know  tell dearest miss bayley with my love i shall write to her soon                                        to mrs jameson  paris 138 avenue des champselysées february 26 1852  never believe of me so bad a thing as that i could have received from you my ever dear and very dear friend such a letter as you describe and rung hollow in return i did not get your letter so how could i send an answer your letters lost like some other happy things but i thank you for it fervently guessing from what you say the sympathy and affection of it i thank you for it most gratefully  as for poor dear miss mitfords book i was entirely upset by the biography she thought it necessary or expedient to give of me oh if our friends would but put off anatomising one till after one was safely dead and call to mind that previously we have nerves to be agonised and morbid brains to be driven mad i am morbid i know i cant bear some words even from robert like the lady who lay in the grave and was ever after of the colour of a shroud so i am whitesouled the past has left its mark with me for ever and now this is the worst every newspaper critic who talks of my poems may refer to other things i shall not feel myself safe a moment from references which stab like a knife  but poor dear miss mitford if we dont forgive whats meant as kindness how are we to forgive whats meant as injury in my first agitation i felt it as a real vexation that i couldnt be angry with her how could i poor thing she has always loved me and been so anxious to please me and this time she seriously thought that robert and i would be delighted extraordinary defect of comprehension  still i did not i could not conceal from her that she had given me great pain and she replied in a tone which really made me almost feel ungrateful for being pained she said rather that her whole book had perished than have given me a moments pain how are you to feel after that  for the rest it appears that she had merely come forward to the rescue of my reputation no more than so sundry romantic tales had been in circulation about me i was in widows weeds in my habitual costumeand in fact before i was married i had grievously scandalised the english public the imaginative part of the public and it was expedient to tirer de lautre coté  well i might have laughed at thatbut i didnt i wrote a very affectionate letter for i really love miss mitford though she understands me no more under certain respects than you in england understand louis napoleon and the french nation loves love she meant the best to meand so do you who have a much more penetrating sense of delicacy forgive her for my sake dear friend  of the memoirs of madame ossoli i know only the extracts in the athenæum she was a most interesting woman to me though i did not sympathise with a large portion of her opinions her written works are just naught she said herself they were sketches thrown out in haste and for the means of subsistence and that the sole production of hers which was likely to represent her at all would be the history of the italian revolution in fact her reputation such as it was in america seemed to stand mainly on her conversation and oral lectures if i wished anyone to do her justice i should say as i have indeed said never read what she has written the letters however are individual and full i should fancy of that magnetic personal influence which was so strong in her i felt drawn in towards her during our short intercourse i loved her and the circumstances of her death shook me to the very roots of my heart the comfort is that she lost little in this worldthe change could not be loss to her she had suffered and was likely to suffer still more  and now am i to tell you that i have seen george sand twice and am to see her again ah there is no time to tell you for i must shut up this letter she sate like a priestess the other morning in a circle of eight or nine men giving no oracles except with her splendid eyes sitting at the corner of the fire and warming her feet quietly in a general silence of the most profound deference there was something in the calm disdain of it which pleased me and struck me as characteristic she was george sand that was enough you wanted no proof of it robert observed that if any other mistress of a house had behaved so he would have walked out of the roombut as it was no sort of incivility was meant in fact we hear that she likes us very much and as we went away she called me chère madame and kissed me and desired to see us both again  i did not read myself the passage in question from miss ms book i couldnt make up my mind my courage to look at it but i understood from robert                                        to mrs martin  paris 138 avenue des chelysées february 27 1852  i get your second letter my dearest mrs martin before i answer your first which makes me rather ashamed    dearest friend it is true that i have seldom been so upset as by this act of poor dear miss mitfords and the very impossibility of being vindictive on this occasion increased my agitation at the moment  there are defects in delicacy and apprehensiveness one cannot deny it and yet i assure you that a more generous and fervent woman never lived than dear miss mitford is and if you knew her you would do her this justice she is better in herself than in her booksmore large more energetic more human altogether i think i understand her better on the whole than she understands me which is not saying much and i admire her on various accounts she talks better for instance than most writers male or female whom i have had any intercourse with and affectionate in the extreme she has always been to me  so i have mystified you and disgusted you with my politics and my friends in england have put me in the corner just so  the french nation is very peculiar we choose to boast ourselves of being different in england but we have simply les qualités de nos défauts after all the clash of speculative opinions is dreadful here practical men catch at the ideal as if it were a loaf of bread and they literally set about cutting out their romeos into little stars as if that were the most natural thing in the world as for the socialists i quite agree with you that various of them yes and some of their chief men are full of pure and noble aspiration the most virtuous of men and the most benevolent still they hold in their hands in their clean hands ideas that kill ideas which defile ideas which if carried out would be the worst and most crushing kind of despotism i would rather live under the feet of the czar than in those states of perfectibility imagined by fourier and cabet if i might choose my pis aller all these speculators even louis blanc who is one of the most rational would revolutionalise not merely countries but the elemental conditions of humanity it seems to me none of them seeing that antagonism is necessary to all progress a man in walking must set one foot before another and in climbing as dante observed long ago the foot behind è sempre il più basso only the gods plato tells us keep both feet joined together in moving onward it is not so and cannot be so with men  but i think that not only in relation to the socialists but to the monarchies is ln the choice of the french people i think that they will not bear the monarchies they will not have either of them they put them away it seems to me that the french people is essentially democratical and that by the vote in question they never meant to give away either rights or liberties the extraordinary part of the actual position is that the government with these ugly signs of despotism in its face stands upon the democracy is no military despotism therefore in any sense as the english choose to say and may be thrown and will be thrown on that day when it disappoints the popular expectation for my part i am hopeful both for this reason and for others i hope we shall do better when there is greater calm that presently there will be relaxation where there is stringency and room to breathe and speak at present it is a dictatorship and we cant expect at such a time the ease and liberty of a regular government the constitution itself may be modified as the very terms of it imply and the laws of the press not carried out even as it is all the english papers infamous in their abuse of the government because of their falsifications and exaggerations properly called infamous and highly immoral in their tone towards france generally come in as usual without an official finger being lifted up to hinder them louis philippe would not admit punch you remember on account of a few personal sarcasms  so much there is to say and the post going can you read as i write on at a full gallop dont be out of heart do let us trust francenot l napoleon but france  dearest friends think of me as your  ever affectionate ba                                        to miss mitford  paris 138 avenue des chelysées april 7 1852  what a time seems to have passed since i wrote to you my ever loved friend again and again i have been on the point of writing and something has stopped me always i have wished to wait till i had more about this and that to gossip of and so the time went on now i am getting impatient to have news of you and to learn whether the lovely spring has brought you any good yet as to health and strength dont take vengeance on my silence but write write  yes i want to see béranger and so does robert george sand we came to know a great deal more of i think robert saw her six times once he met her near the tuileries offered her his arm and walked with her the whole length of the gardens she was not on that occasion looking as well as usual being a little too much endimanchée in terrestrial lavenders and supercelestial bluesnot in fact dressed with the remarkable taste which he has seen in her at other times her usual costume is both pretty and quiet and the fashionable waistcoat and jacket which are a spectacle in all the ladies companions of the day make the only approach to masculine wearings to be observed in her she has great nicety and refinement in her personal ways i think and the cigarette is really a feminine weapon if properly understood ah but i didnt see her smoke i was unfortunate i could only go with robert three times to her house and once she was out he was really very good and kind to let me go at all after he found the sort of society rampant around her he didnt like it extremely but being the prince of husbands he was lenient to my desires and yielded the point she seems to live in the abomination of desolation as far as regards societycrowds of illbred men who adore her à genoux bas betwixt a puff of smoke and an ejection of saliva society of the ragged red diluted with the lower theatrical she herself so different so apart as alone in her melancholy disdain i was deeply interested in that poor woman i felt a profound compassion for her i did not mind much the greek in greek costume who tutoyéd her and kissed her i believe so robert said or the other vulgar man of the theatre who went down on his knees and called her sublime caprice damitié said she with her quiet gentle scorn a noble woman under the mud be certain i would kneel down to her too if she would leave it all throw it off and be herself as god made her but she would not care for my kneeling she does not care for me perhaps she doesnt care for anybody by this timewho knows she wrote one or two or three kind notes to me and promised to venir membrasser before she left paris but she did not come we both tried hard to please her and she told a friend of ours that she liked us only we always felt that we couldnt penetratecouldnt really touch herit was all vain her play failed though full of talent it didnt draw and was withdrawn accordingly i wish she would keep to her romances in which her real power lies  we have found out jadin alexandre dumas friend and companion in the speronare he showed robert at his house poor louis philippes famous umbrella and the duke of orleans uniform and the cup from which napoleon took his coffee which stood beside him as he signed the abdication then there was a picture of milord hanging up i must go to see too said robert then alexandre dumas doesnt write romances always you know it was like a sudden spectacle of one of ledas eggs indeed replied jadin he wrote the true history of his own travels only of course seeing everything like a poet from his own point of view alfred de musset was to have been at m bulozs where robert was a week ago on purpose to meet him but he was prevented in some way his brother paul de musset a very different person was there insteadbut we hope to have alfred on another occasion do you know his poems he is not capable of large grasps but he has poets life and blood in him i assure you he is said to be at the feet of rachel just now and a man may nearly as well be with a tigress in a cage he began with the princess belgiojosofollowed george sandrachel finishes is likely to finish in every sense in the intervals he plays at chess theres the anatomy of a man  we are expecting a visit from lamartine who does a great deal of honour to both of us it appears in the way of appreciation and is kind enough to propose to come i will tell you all about it  but now tell me oh i want so to hear how you are better stronger i hope and trust how does the new house and garden look in the spring prettier and prettier i dare say  the dotation of the president is enormous certainly and i wish for his own sake it had been rather more moderate now i must end here post hour strikes god bless you  do love me as much as you can always and think how i am your ever affectionate  ba  our darling is well thank god                                        to mrs jameson  paris 138 avenue des chelysées april 12 monday 1852  your letter was pleasant and not so pleasant dearest monna nina for it was not so pleasant indeed to hear how ill you had beenand yet to be lifted into the hope or rather certainty of seeing you next week pleased us extremely of course and the more that your note through lady lyell had thrown us backward into a slough of despond and made me sceptical as to your coming here at all  what a beautiful paris it is i walked out a little yesterday with robert and we both felt penetrated with the sentiment of southern life as we watched men women and children sitting out in the sun taking wine and coffee and enjoying their fête day with good happy faces the mixture of classes is to me one of the most delicious features of the south and you have it here exactly as in italy the colouring too the brightness even the sunoh come and enjoy it all with us we have had a most splendid spring beginning with february still i have been out very seldom being afraid of treacherous winds combined with burning sunshine but i have enjoyed the weather in the house and by opening the windows and have been revived and strengthened much by it and shall soon recover my summer power of walking i dare say what do you think i did the other night went to the vaudeville to see the dame aux camélias on above the fiftieth night of the representation i disagree with the common outcry about its immorality according to my view it is moral and human but i never will go to see it again for it almost broke my heart and split my head i had a headache afterwards for twentyfour hours even robert who gives himself out for blasé on dramatic matters couldnt keep the tears from rolling down his cheeks the exquisite acting the too literal truth to nature everywhere was exasperatingthere was something profane in such familiar handling of life and death art has no business with real graveclothes when she wants tragic draperyhas she it was too much altogether like a bull fight theres a caricature at the shop windows of the effect produced the pit protecting itself with multitudinous umbrellas from the tears of the boxes this play is by alexandre dumas filsand is worthy by its talent of alexandre dumas père  only that once have i been in a parisian theatre i couldnt go even to see les vacances de pandolphe when george sand had the goodness to send us tickets for the first night she failed in it i am sorry to sayit did not draw as the phrase is now she has left paris but is likely to return  i am sure it will do you great good to have change and liberty and distraction in various ways the anxiety you speak ofoh i do hope it does not relate to gerardine i always think of her when you seem anxious  i shall be very glad if when you come you should be inclined to give your attention you with your honest and vigorous mind to the facts of the political situation not the facts as you hear them from the english or from our friend madme mohl who confessed to me one day that she liked exaggerations because she hated the president she is a clever shrewd woman but most eminently and on all subjects a woman her passions having her thoughts inside them instead of her thoughts her passions thats the common distinction between women and men is it not  robert too will tell you that he hates all buonapartes past present or to come but then he says that in his selfwilled pettish way as a manner of dismissing a subject he wont think aboutand knowing very well that he doesnt think about it not mistaking a feeling for a reason not for a moment theres the difference between women and men  well but you wont come here to knit your brows about politics but rather to forget all sorts of anxieties and distresses and be well and happy i do hope you deserve a holiday after all that work god bless you dear friend  our united love goes to you and stays with you  your ever affectionate ba                                        to miss mulock  paris 138 avenue des champselysées april 27 1852  i am afraid you must think mewhat can you have thought of me for not immediately answering a letter which brought the tears both to my eyes and my husbands i was going to write just so but he said no do not write yet wait till we get the book and then you can speak of it with knowledge and i waited  but the misfortune is that messrs chapman  hall waited too and that up to the present time the head of the family has not arrived mr chapman is slow in finding what he calls his opportunities  therefore i cant wait any more no indeed the voice which called dinah in the gardenwhich was true because certainly i did call from florence with my whole heart to the writer of these verses13 how deeply they moved mewill have seemed to you by this time as fabulous as the garden itself and we had no garden at florence i must confess to you only a terrace facing the grey wall of san felice church where we used to walk up and down on the moonlight nights but san felice was always a good saint to me and when i had read and cried over those verses from the athenæum my husband wrote them out for me at the reading room and when i had vainly written to england to find out the poet and when i had all as vainly on our visit to england last summer inquired of this person and that person it turns out after all that dinah answers me do you not think i am glad  the beautiful verses touched me to the quick so does your letter we shall be in london again perhaps in two months for a few weeks and then you will let us see you i hope will you not and in the meanwhile you will believe that we do not indeed think of you as a stranger ah your dream flattered me in certain respects yet there was some truth in it as i have told you even though you saw in the dreamlight more roses than were growing  certainly mr chapman will at last send me the head of the family and then i will write again of course  dear miss mulock may i write myself down now because i must  affectionately yours and gratefully elizabeth barrett browning                                         to miss mitford  paris138 avenue des chelysées may 9 1852  i began a long letter to you in the impulse left by yours upon me and then destroyed it by accident that hindered me from writing as soon as i should have done for indeed i am anxious to have other news of you my dearest dear miss mitford and to know if possible that you are a little better tell me everything why you looked really well last summer and i want to see you looking well this summer for we shall probably be in london in junemores the pity perhaps the gladness i have in england is so leavened through and through with sadness that i incline to do with it as one does with the black bread of the monks of vallombrosa only pretend to eat it and drop it slyly under the table if it were not for some ties i would say farewell england and never set foot on it again theres always an east wind for me in england whether the sun shines or notthe moral east wind which is colder than any other but how dull to go on talking of the weather sia come vuole as we say in italy  tomorrow is the great fête of your louis napoleon the distribution of the eagles we have done our possible and impossible to get tickets because i had taken strongly into my head to want to go and because robert who didnt care for it himself cared for it for me but heres the eleventh hour and our prospects remain gloomy we did not apply sufficiently soon i am afraid and the name of the applicants has been legion it will be a grand sight and full of significances nevertheless the empire wont come so you will have to wait a little for the empire who were your financial authorities who praised louis napoleon and do the same approve of the late measure about the three per cents i am so absolutely bête upon such subjects that i dont even pretend to be intelligent but i heard yesterday from a direct source that rothschild expressed a high admiration of the presidents financial ability a friend of that master in israel said it to our friend lady elgin commerce is reviving money is pouring in confidence is being restored on all sides even the press palpitates againah but i wish it were a little freer of the corset this government is not after my heart after all i only tolerate what appear to me the necessities of an exceptional situation the masses are satisfied and hopeful and the president stronger and strongernot by the sword may it please the english press but by the democracy  i am delighted to see that the french government has protested against the reactionary iniquities of the tuscan grand duke and every day i expect eagerly some helping hand to be stretched out to rome i have looked for this from the very first and certainly it is significant that the prince of canino the late president of the roman republic should be in favour at the elysée pio nonos time is but short i fancythat is reforms will be forced upon him  when george sand had audience with the president he was very kind did i tell you that at the last he said vous verrez vous serez contente de moi to which she answered et vous vous serez content de moi it was repeated to me as to the great dishonour of madame sand and as a proof that she could not resist the influence of power and was a bad republican i on the contrary thought the story quite honourable to both parties it was for the sake of her rouge friends that she approached the president at all and she has used the hand he stretched out to her only on behalf of persons in prison and distress the same being delivered call her gratefully a recreant  victor cousin and villemain refuse to take the oath and lose their situations in the academy accordingly but they retire on pensions and its their own fault of course michelet and quinet should have an equivalent i think for what they have lost they are worthy as poets orators dreamers speculative thinkersas anything in fact but instructors of youth  no there is a brochure or a little book somewhere pretending to be a memoir of balzac but i have not seen it some time before his death he had bought a country place and there was a fruit tree in the gardeni think a walnut treeabout which he delighted himself in making various financial calculations after the manner of césar birotteau he built the house himself and when it was finished there was just one defectit wanted a staircase they had to put in the staircase afterwards the picture gallery however had been seen to from the first and the great writer had chalked on the walls mon raffaelle mon corrège mon titien mon léonard de vinci the pictures being yet unattained he is said to have been a little loth to spend money and to have liked to dine magnificently at the restaurant at the expense of his friends forgetting to pay for his own share of the entertainment for the rest the idée fixe of the man was to be rich one day and he threw his subtle imagination and vital poetry into pounds shillings and pence with such force that he worked the base element into spiritual splendours oh to think of our having missed seeing that man it is painful a little book is published of his thoughts and maxims the sweepings of his desk i suppose broken notes probably which would have been wrought up into some noble works if he had lived some of these are very striking  lamartine has not yet paid us the promised visit just as we were beginning to feel vexed we heard that the intermediate friend who was to have brought him had been caught up by the government and sent off to saintgermain to faire le mort on pain of being sent farther i mean eugène belleton if he talked in many places as he talked in this room i cant be very much surprised but i am really very sorry he is one of those amiable domestic men who delight in talking battle murder and sudden death  the end of this letter is wanting                                        to miss mulock  paris 138 avenue des champselysées june 2 1852  my husband went directly to rue vivienne and came back without the book we waited and waited but at last it reached us and we have read it and since then i have let some days go by through having been unwell you seemed to let me sit still in my chair and do nothing you did not call too loud so was it with most other things in the universe now having awakened from my somnolency recovered from la grippe or what mortal londoners call the influenza the first person and first book i think of must naturally be you and yours  so i thank you much much for the book it has interested me dear miss mulock as a book should and i am delighted to recognise everywhere undeniable talent and faculty combined with high and pure aspiration a clever book a graceful book and with the moral grace besidesthank you many must have thanked you as well as myself  at the same time precisely because i feel particularly obliged to you i mean to tell you the truth your hero is heroic from his own point of viewaccepting his own view of the situation which i for one cannot accept do you know for i am of opinion that both you and he are rather conventional on the subject of his marriage i dont in the least understand at this moment why he should not have married in the first volume no not in the least it was a matter of income he would tell me and of keeping two establishments and i would answer that it ought rather to have been a matter of faith in god and in the value of gods gifts the greatest of which is love i am romantic about loveoh much more than you are though older than you a mans life does not develop rightly without it and what is called an improvident marriage often appears to me a noble righteous and prudent act your ninian was a man before he was a brother i hold that he had no right to sacrifice a great spiritual good of his own to the worldly good of his family however he made it out he should have said god gives me this gift he will find me energy to work for it and suffer for it we will all live together struggle together if it is necessary a little more poorly a little more laboriously but keeping true to the best aims of life all of us  thats what my ninian would have said i dont like to see noble ninians crushed flat under family juggernauts from whatever heroic motivesnot i do you forgive me for being so candid  i must tell you that mrs jameson who is staying in this house read your book in england and mentioned it to me as a good book very gracefully written before i read it quite irrespectively too of my dedication which was absent from the copy she saw at brighton it was mentioned as one of the novels which had pleased her most lately  i shall like to show you my child as you like children and as i am vainoh past endurance vain about him you wont understand a word he says though for he speaks three languages at once and most of the syllables of each wrong side foremost  no dont call me a bonapartist i am not a bonapartist indeed but i am a democrat and singularly in these days consequent about universal suffrage also facts in england have been much misstated but theres no room for politics today  when i thank you remember that my husband thanks you we both hope to see you before this month shall be quite at an end and then you will know me better i hope and though i shall lose a great deal by your knowing me of course yet you wont after that make such mistakes as you confess in this note which i have just read over again did i think you sentimental wont you rather think me sentimental today through it all  your affectionate elizabeth barrett browning                                        to mrs martin  paris 138 avenue des champselysées june 16 1852  my first word must be to thank you my dearest kind friend for your affectionate words to me and mine which always from you sink deeply it was on my part great gratification to see you and talk to you and hear you talk and above all perhaps to feel that you loved me still a little may god bless you both and may we meet again and again in paris and elsewhere in london this summer to begin with as the italians would say in relation to any like pleasure sarebbe una benedizione  we are waiting for the english weather to be reported endurable in order to set out mrs streatfield who has been in england these twelve days writes to certify that it is past the force of a parisian imagination to imagine the state of the skies and the atmosphere yet even in paris we have been moaning the last four days because really since then we have gone back to april and a rather cool april with alternate showers and sunshinea crisis however which does not call for fires nor inflict much harm on me it was the thunder we think that upset the summer  you seem to have had a sort of inkling about my brittleness when you were here it was the beginning of a bad attack of cough and pain in the side the consequence of which was that i turned suddenly into the likeness of a ghost and frightened robert from his design of going to england about that i am by no means regretful he was not wanted as the event proved abundantly the worst was that he was annoyed by the number of judicious observers and miserable comforters who told him i was horribly changed and ought to be taken back to italy forthwith i knew it was nothing but an accidental attack and that the results would pass away as they did i kept quiet applied mustard poultices and am now looking again tell dear mr martin as if i had shammed so all these misfortunes are strictly historical you are to understand tonight we are going to ary scheffers to hear music and to see ever so many celebrities oh and let me remember to tell you that m thierry the blind historian has sent us a message by his physician to ask us to go to see him and as a matter of course we go madame viardot the prima donna and leonard the first violin player at the conservatoire are to be at m scheffers  after all you are too right the less amused i am clearly the better for me i should live ever so many years more by being shut up in a hermitage if it were warm and dry mores the pity when one wants to see and hear as i do the only sort of excitement and fatigue which does me no harm but good is travelling the effect of the continual change of air is to pour in oil as the lamp burns so i explain the extraordinary manner in which i bear the fatigue of being fourandtwenty hours together in a diligence for instance which many strong women would feel too much for them  all this talking of myself when i want to talk of you and to tell you how touched i was by the praises of your winning little letitia enclosed is a note to chapman  hall which will put her bearer if she can find one in london in possession of the two volumes in question i shall like her to have them and she must try to find my love as the king of france did the poison a most unsavoury simile certainly between the leaves i send with them in any case my best love ah so sorry i am that she has suffered from the weather you have had she is a most interesting child and of a nature which is rare  roberts warm regards with those of your  ever affectionate and grateful ba  madame viardot is george sands heroine consuelo you know that beautiful book                                        with the last days of june the long stay in paris came to an end and the brownings paid their second visit to london their residence on this occasion was at 58 welbeck street very respectable rooms this time and at a moderate price and here they stayed until the beginning of november neither husband nor wife seems to have written much poetry during this year either in paris or in london                                        to miss mitford  london 58 welbeck street saturday junejuly 1852    we saw your book in paris the galignani edition and i read it all except the one thing i had not courage to read thank you thank you we are both of us grateful to you for your most generous and heartwarm intentions to us as to the book its a book made to go east and west its a popular book with flowers from the village laid freshly and brightly between the critical leaves i dont always agree with you i think for instance that mary anne browne should never be compared to george sand in passion and i cant grant to you that your extracts from her poems bear you out to even one fiftieth degree in such an opinion i agree with you just as little with regard to dr holmes and certain others but to have your opinion is always a delightful thing and it is characteristic of your generosity to say the least we say to ourselves when we are dissidents most  i am writing in the extremest haste just a word to announce our arrival in england we are in very comfortable rooms in 58 welbeck street and my sister henrietta is some twenty doors away tomorrow robert and i are going to wimbledon for a day to dear mr kenyon who looks radiantly well and has mr landor for a companion just now imagine the uproar and turmoil of our first days in london and believe that i think of you faithfully and tenderly through all i am overjoyed to see my sisters who look well on the whole  and they and everybody assure me that i show a very satisfactory face to my country as far as improved looks go  what nonsense one writes when one has but a moment to write in i find people talking about the facts in the times touching louis napoleon facts in the times  the heat is stifling do send one word to say how you are and love me always as i love you  your most affectionate ba                                        to miss mitford  58 welbeck street friday july 31 1852 postmark  i want to hear about you again dear dearest miss mitford and i cant hear will you send me a line or a word i mean to go down to see you one day but certainly we must account it right not to tire you while you are weak and not to spoil our enjoyment by forestalling it two months are full of days we can afford to wait meantime let us have a little gossip such as the gods allow of  dear mr kenyon has not yet gone to scotland though his intentions still stand north he passed an evening with us some evenings ago and was brilliant and charming the two things together and good and affectionate at the same time mr landor was staying with him perhaps i told you that and went away into worcestershire assuring me when he took leave of me that he would never enter london again a week passes and lo mr kenyon expects him again resolutions are not always irrevocable you observe  i must tell you what landor said about louis napoleon you are aware that he loathed the first napoleon and that he hates the french nation also he detests the present state of french affairs and has foamed over in the examiner in prose and rhyme on the subject of them nevertheless he who calls the emperor an infernal fool expresses himself to this effect about the president i always knew him to be a man of wonderful genius i knew him intimately and i was persuaded of what was in him when people have said to me how can you like to waste your time with so trifling a man i have answered if all your houses of parliament putting their heads together could make a head equal to this trifling mans head it would be well for england  it was quite unexpected to me to hear mr landor talk so  he mr landor is looking as young as ever as full of life and passionate energy  did mr horne write to you before he went to australia did i speak to you about his going did you see the letter which he put into the papers as a farewell to england i think of it all sadly  mazzini came to see us the other day with that pale spiritual face of his and those intense eyes full of melancholy illusions i was thinking while he sate there on what italian turf he would lie at last with a bullet in his heart or perhaps with a knife in his back for to one of those ends it will surely come mrs carlyle came with him she is a great favorite of mine full of thought and feeling and character it seems to me  london is emptying itself and the relief will be great in a certain way for one gets exhausted sometimes let me remember whom i have seen mrs newton crosland who spoke of you very warmly miss mulock who wrote the ogilvies that series of novels and is interesting gentle and young and seems to have worked half her life in spite of youth mr field we have not seen only heard of miss  nobut i am to see her i understand and that she is an american corinna in yellow silk but pretty we drove out to kensington with monckton milnes and his wife and i like her she is quiet and kind and seems to have accomplishments and we are to meet fanny kemble at the procters some day next week many good faces but the best wanting ah i wish lord stanhope who shows the spirits of the sun in a crystal ball could show us that have you heard of the crystal ball14 we went to meet it and the seer the other morning with sundry of the believers and unbelieversamong the latter chief among the latter mr chorley who was highly indignant and greatly scandalised particularly on account of the combination sought to be established by the lady of the house between lobster salad and oremus spirit of the sun for my part i endured both luncheon and spiritual phenomena with great equanimity it was very curious altogether to my mind as a sign of the times if in no other respect of philosophy but i love the marvellous write a word to me i beseech you and love me and think of me as i love and think of you god bless you roberts love  your ever affectionate ba                                         to mrs jameson  58 welbeck street tuesday julyoctober 1852  dearest monna ninahere are the verses i did them all because that was easiest to me but of course you will extract the two you want  it has struck me besides that you might care to see this old ballad which i find among my papers from one of the percy or other antiquarian society books and which i transcribed years ago modernising slightly in order to make out some sort of rhythm as i went on i did this because the original poem impressed me deeply with its pathos i wish i could send you the antique literal poem but i havent it nor know where to find it still i dont think i quite spoilt it with the very slight changes ventured by me in the transcription  god bless you let us meet on wednesday roberts best love with that of your ever affectionate  ba       stabat mater      mother full of lamentation     near that cross she wept her passion       whereon hung her child and lord     through her spirit worn and wailing     tortured

this time the pleasure was tempered by an undeniable pain in the conscience oh i ought to have written long and long ago i have another letter of yours unanswered also there was a proposition in it to robert of a tempting character and he put off the nothe ungracioussounding noas long as he could he would have liked to have seen mrs flood as well as you she is a favorite with us both but he finds it impossible to leave london we have had no less than eight invitations into the country and we are forced to keep to london in spite of all babbling about and from green fields once we went to farnham and spent two days with mr and mrs paine there in that lovely heathy country and met mr kingsley the christian socialist author of alton locke yeast c it is only two hours from town or less by railroad and we took our child with us and flush and had a breath of fresh air which ought to have done us good but didnt few men have impressed me more agreeably than mr kingsley he is original and earnest and full of a genial and almost tender kindliness which is delightful to me wild and theoretical in many ways he is of course but i believe he could not be otherwise than good and noble let him say or dream what he will you are not to confound this visit of ours to farnham with the sanitary reform picnic  to the same place at which the newspapers say we were present we were invitedthat is truebut did not go nor thought of it i am not up to picnicsnor down to some of the company perhaps who knows dont think me grown too suddenly scornful without being sure of the particulars  mr tennyson has a little son and wrote me such three happy notes on the occasion that i really never liked him so well before i do like men who are not ashamed to be happy beside a cradle monckton milnes had a brilliant christening luncheon and his baby was made to sweep in india muslin and brussels lace among a very large circle of admiring guests think of my vanity turning my head completely and admitting of my taking wiedeman there because of an express invitation he behaved like an angel everybody said and looked very pretty i said myself only he disgraced us all at last by refusing to kiss the baby on the ground of his being troppo grande he has learnt quantities of english words and is in consequence more unintelligible than ever poor darling i am in pain about him today wilson goes to spend a fortnight with her mother and i dont know how i shall be comforter enough there will be great wailing and gnashing of teeth certainly and i shall be in prison for the next two weeks and have to do all the washing and dressing myself  your ever affectionate ba                                        to miss mitford  58 welbeck street saturday september 14 1852 postmark  my dearest miss mitfordi am tied and bound beyond redemption for the next fortnight at least therefore the hope of seeing you must be for afterwards i dare say you think that a child can be stowed away like other goods but i do assure you that my child though quite capable of being amused by his aunts for a certain number of halfhours would break his little heart if i left him for a whole day while he had not wilson when she is here he is contented in her absence he is sceptical about happiness and suspicious of complete desolation every now and then he says to me will mama saying it in his pretty broken unquotable language go away and leave peninni all alone he wont let a human being touch him i wash and dress him and have him to sleep with me and robert is the only other helper he will allow of theres spoiling of a child say you but he is so good and tender and sensitive that we cant go beyond a certain line for instance i was quite frightened about the effect of wilsons leaving him we managed to prepare him as well as we could and when he found she was actually gone the passion of grief i had feared was just escaped he struggled with himself the eyes full of tears and the lips quivering but there was not any screaming and crying such as made me cry last year on a like occasion he had made up his mind  you see i cant go to you just now whatever temptations you hold out waitoh we must wait and whenever i do go to you you will see robert at the same time he will like to see you and besides he would as soon trust me to travel to reading alone as i trust peninni to be alone here i believe he thinks i should drop off my head and leave it under the seat of the railcarriage if he didnt take care of it  i ought to have told you that mr kingsley one of the reasons why i liked him spoke warmly and admiringly of you yes i ought to have told you thathis praise is worth having of course i have heard much of mr harness from mr kenyon and you as well as from my own husband but there is no use in measuring temptations i am a female st anthony and wont be overcome the talfourds wanted me to dine with them on monday robert goes alone you dont mention mr chorley didnt he find his way to you  mr patmore told us that tennyson was writing a poem on arthurnot an epic a collection of poems ballad and otherwise united by the subject after the manner of in memoriam but in different measures the work will be full of beauty whatever it is i dont doubt  i am reading more dumas he never flags i must see dumas when i go again to paris and it will be easy as we know his friend jadin  did you read mrs nortons last bookthe novel which seems to be so much praised tell me what it is in your mind  i will write no more that you may have the answer to my kind proposition as soon as possible after the fortnight  god bless you  your ever affectionate ebb                                        to miss mitford  58 welbeck street tuesday september 1852  alas no i cannot go to you before the saturday you name nor for some days after dearest friend it is simply impossible wilson has not come back nor will till the end of next week and though i can get away from my child for two or three hours at once during the daytime for the whole day i could not go what would become of him poor darling  and i cant go to you this week nor next week probably how vexatious my comfort is that you seem to be bettermuch much betterand that you have courage to think of the pony carriages and the kingsleys of the earth that man impressed me much interested me much the more you see of him the more you will like him is my prophecy he has a volume of poems i hear close upon publication and robert and i are looking forward to it eagerly  mr ruskin has been to see us did i tell you that we went to denmark hill yesterday by agreement to see the turnerswhich by the way are divine i like mr ruskin much and so does robert very gentle yet earnestrefined and truthful i like him very much we count him among the valuable acquaintances made this year in england  mr kenyon has come back and most other people are gone away but he is worth more than most other people so the advantage remains to the scale i am delighted that you should have your dear friend mr harness with you and for my own part i do feel grateful to him for the good he has evidently done you oh continue to be better dont overtire yourselfdont use improvidently the new strength remember the winter and be wise and let me see you before it comes looking as bright and well as i thought you last year god bless you always  love your ever affectionate ba  roberts love                                        to miss mitford  london friday october 6 1852  my dearest miss mitfordi am quite in pain to have to write a farewell to you after all as soon as wilson had returnedand she stayed away much longer than last yearwe found ourselves pushed to the edge of our time for remaining in england and the accumulation of business to be done before we could go pressed on us i am almost mad with the amount of things to be done as it is but i should have put the visit to you at the head of them and swept all the rest on one side for a day if it hadnt been for the detestable weather and my horrible cough which combines with it when wilson came back she found me coughing in my old way and it has been without intermission up to now or rather waxing worse and worse to have gone down to you and inflicted the noise of it on you would have simply made you nervous while the risk to myself would have been very great indeed still i have waited and waited feeling it scarcely possible to write to you to say i am not coming this year ah i am so very sorry and disappointed i hoped against hope for a break in the weather and an improvement in myself now we must go and there is no hope for about a fortnight i have been a prisoner in the house this climate wont let me live theres the truth so we are going on monday we go to paris for a week or two and then to florence and then to rome and then to naples but we shall be back next year if god pleases and then i shall seize an early summer day to run down straight to you and find you stronger if god blesses me so far think of me and love me a little meanwhile i shall do it by you and do dosince there is no time to hear from you in londonsend a fragment of a note to arabel for me that i may have it in paris before we set out on our long italian journey let me have the comfort of knowing exactly how you are before we set out as for me i expect to be better on crossing the channel how people manage to live and enjoy life in this fog and cold is inexplicable to me i understand the system of the american rapping spirits considerably better  the tennysons in their kindest words pressed us to be present at their childs christening which took place last tuesday but i could not go it was not possible robert went alone therefore and nursed the baby for ten or twelve minutes to its obvious contentment he flatters himself it was christened hallam tennyson mr hallam was the godfather and present in his vocation that was touching wasnt it i hear that the laureate talks vehemently against the french president and the french but for the rest he is genial and good and has been quite affectionate to us  so i go without seeing you grieved i am love me to make amends  roberts love goes with me  your ever affectionate ba                                        to john kenyon  paris hôtel de la villelÉvêque rue villelÉvêque thursday november 1852  my dearest mr kenyoni cannot do better today than keep my promise to you about writing we have done our business in paris but we linger from the inglorious reason that we experienced travellers as we are actually left a desk behind us in bentinck street and must get it before we go farther meanwhile its rather dangerous to let the charm of paris workthe honey will be clogging our feet very soon and make it difficult to go away what an attractive place this is to be sure how the sun shines how the blue sky spreads how the life lives and how kind the people are on all sides if we were going anywhere but to italy and if i were a little less plainly mortal with this disagreeable cough of mine i would gladly stay and see in the empire with m proudhon in the tail of it and sit as a watcher over whatever things shall be this year and next spring at paris as it is we have been very fortunate as usual in being present in a balcony on the boulevard the best place possible for seeing the grandest spectacle in the world the reception of louis napoleon last saturday the day was brilliant and the sweep of sunshine over the streaming multitude and all the military and civil pomp made it difficult to distinguish between the light and life the sunshine seemed literally to push back the houses to make room for the crowd and the wide boulevards looked wider than ever if you had cursed the sentiment of the day ever so you would have had eyes for its picturesqueness i think so i wish you had been there to see louis napoleon showed his usual tact and courage by riding on horseback quite alone at least ten paces between himself and his nearest escort which of course had a striking effect taking the french on their weak side and startling even miss cushman who had been murmuring displeasure into my ear for an hour into an exclamation of thats fine i must say little wiedeman was in a state of ecstasy and has been recounting ever since how he called vive napoléon molto molto duro meaning very loud his italian is not very much more correct you know than his other languages and how napoleon took off his hat to him directly i dont see the english papers but i conclude you are all furious you must make up your minds to it neverthelessthe empire is certain and the feeling of all but unanimity whatever the motive throughout france obvious enough smooth down the lions mane of the examiner and hint that roaring over a desert is a vain thing as to victor hugos book the very enemies of the present state of affairs object to it that he lies simply there is not enough truth in it for an invective to rest on still less for an argument its an inarticulate cry of a bird of prey wild and strong irrational and not a book at all for my part i did wave my handkerchief for the new emperor but i bore the show very well and said to myself god bless the people as the man who to my apprehension represents the democracy went past a very intelligent frenchman caught in the crowd and forced to grope his way slowly along told me that the expression of opinion everywhere was curiously the same not a dissenting mutter did he hear strange strange all this for the drama of history we must look to france for startling situations for the points which thrill you to the bone  may god bless you meantime take care of yourself for the sake of us all who love you none indeed more affectionately and gratefully than  rb and ebb   footnotes  1 the holy scriptures  2 miss haworth was a friend of mr browning from very early days and was commemorated by him in sordello under the name of eyebright see mrs orrs life p 86 her acquaintance with mrs browning began with this visit to london and ripened into a warm friendship one subject of interest which they had in common was mesmerism with the attendant mysteries of spiritualism and swedenborgianism and references to these are frequent in mrs brownings letters to her  3 so spelt in the earlier letters but subsequently modified to penini  4 miss mitford had lately moved into her new home at swallowfield about three miles from the old cottage at three mile cross commemorated in our village  5 the article was by m joseph milsand and led to the formation of the warm friendship between him and mr browning which lasted until the death of the former in 1886  6 the may edict restricted the franchise to electors who had resided three years in the same district in october louis napoleon proposed to repeal it and the refusal of the assembly no doubt strengthened his hold on the democracy  7 the coup détat took place in the early morning of december 2  8 the constitution of 1848  9 the point was rather whether they had the power  10 miss mitfords recollections of a literary life contained a chapter relating to robert and elizabeth browning in which with the best intentions in the world she told the story of the drowning of edward barrett and of the gloom cast by it on his sisters life it was this revival of the greatest sorrow of her life that so upset mrs browning  11 no doubt m milsand was the writer in question  12 the forged letters of shelley to which mr browning wrote an introduction dealing rather with shelley in general than with the letters  13 lines to elizabeth barrett browning on her later sonnets printed in the athenæum for february 15 1851 the allusion to the voice which called dinah must refer to something in miss mulocks letter dinah was miss mulocks christian name  14 in another letter written about the same date to mrs martin mrs browning says perhaps you never heard of the crystal ball the original ball was bought by lady blessington from an egyptian magician and resold at her sale she never could understand the use of it but others have looked deeper or with purer eyes it is said and now there is an optician in london who makes and sells these balls and speaks of a great demand though they are expensive many persons said lord stanhope use the balls without the moral courage to confess it no doubt they did     chapter viii  185255   the middle of november found the travellers back again in florence and it was nearly three years before they again quitted italy no doubt after the excitement of the coup détat in paris and the subsequent manoeuvres of louis napoleon which culminated in this very month in his exchanging the title of president for that of emperor florence must have seemed very quiet if not dull the political movement there was dead the grand duke restored by austrian bayonets had abandoned all pretence at reform and constitutional progress in piedmont cavour had just been summoned to the head of the administration but there were no signs as yet of the use he was destined to make of his power of politics therefore we hear little for the present  nor is there much to note at this time in respect of literature a new edition of mrs brownings poems was called for in 1853 but beyond some minor revisions of detail it did not differ from the edition of 1850 her husbands play colombes birthday was produced at the haymarket theatre during april with miss faucit lady martin in the principal part but the poet had no share in the production and his literary activity must have been devoted to the composition of some of the fine poems which subsequently formed the two volumes of men and women which appeared in 1855 mrs browning had also embarked on her longest poem aurora leigh and speaks of being happily and busily engaged in work but we hear little of it as yet in her correspondence her little son and her florentine friends and visitors form her principal subjects and we also see the beginning of a topic which for the next few years occupied a good deal of her attentionnamely spiritualism  the temperament of mrs browning had in it a decidedly mystical vein which predisposed her to believe in any communication between our world and that of the spirits hence when a number of people professed to have such communication she was not merely ready to listen to their claims but was by temperament inclined to accept them the immense vogue which spiritualism had during the fifties tended to confirm her belief it was easy to say that where there was so much smoke there must be fire and what she believed she believed strongly and with a perfect conviction that no other view could be right just as her faith in louis napoleon survived the coup détat and even villafranca so her belief in communications with the spirit world was proof against any exposure of fraud on the part of the mediums not that she was guilty of the absurdities which marked many of the devotees of spiritualism she had a great horror of submitting herself to mesmeric influences she recognised that very many of the supposed revelations of the spirits were trivial perhaps false but to the fact that communications did exist she adhered constantly  it is not of much interest now to discuss the ethics or the metaphysics of the rapping spirits but the subject deserves more than a passing mention in the life of mrs browning because it has been said and apparently with authority that the only serious difference which ever arose between mr browning and his wife referred to the subject of spiritualism15 it is quite certain that mr browning did not share his wifes belief in spiritualism a reference to sludge the medium is sufficient to establish his position in the matter but it is easy to make too much of the supposed difference certainly it has left no trace in mrs brownings letters which are now extant there is no sign in them that the divergence of opinion produced the slightest discord in the harmony of their life no doubt mr browning felt strongly as to the character of some of the persons whether mediums or their devotees with whom his wife was brought into contact and he may have relieved his feelings by strong expressions of his opinion concerning them but there is no reason to lay stress on this as indicating any serious difference between himself and his wife  it has seemed necessary to say so much lest it should be supposed that any of the omissions which have been made in order to reduce the bulk of the letters within reasonable limits cover passages in which such a difference is spoken of in no single instance is this the case the omissions have been made in the interests of the reader not in order to affect in any way the representation which the letters give of their writers feelings and character with this preface they may be left to tell their own tale                                        to miss browning  florence november 14 1852 postmark  my dearest sariannayou cant think how pleased i am to find myself in florence again in our own house everything looking exactly as if we had left it yesterday scarcely i can believe that we have gone away at all but robert has been perfectly demoralised by paris and thinks it all as dull as possible after the boulevards no life no variety oh of course it is very dead in comparison but its a beautiful death and what with the lovely climate and the lovely associations and the sense of repose i could turn myself on my pillow and sleep on here to the end of my life only be sure that i shall do no such thing we are going back to paris you will have us safe peninni had worked himself up to a state of complete agitation on entering florence through hearing so much about it first he kissed me and then robert again and again as if his little heart were full poor florence said he while we passed the bridge certainly there never was such a darling since the world began i suffered extremely through our unfortunate election of the mont cenis route much more my own fault than roberts and was extremely unwell at genoa to the extent of almost losing heart and hope which is a most unusual case with me but the change from lyons had been too sudden and severe at genoa the weather was so exquisite so absolutely june weather that at the end of a weeks lying on the sofa i had rallied again quite only poor darling robert was horribly vexed and out of spirits all that time as was natural i feel myself every now and then and did then like a weight round his neck poor darling though he does not account it so for his part well but it passed and we were able to walk about beautiful genoa the last two days and visit andrea dorias palace and enjoy everything together then we came on by a night and days diligence through a warm air which made me better and better by the way turin is nearly as cold as chambéry you cant believe yourself to be in italy susa at the foot of the alps is warmer we were all delighted to hear the sound of our dear italian and inclined to be charmed with everything and peninni fairly expressed the kind of generalisations we were given to when he observed philosophically in italy pussytats dont never scwatch mama this was in reply to an objection i had made to a project of his about kissing the head of an enchanting pussycat who presented herself in vision to him as we were dining at turin god bless and preserve you we love you dearly and talk of you continuallyof both of you your most affectionate sister  ba  best love to your fatherpeninni                                        to john kenyon  casa guidi november 23 1852  we flatter ourselves dearest mr kenyon that as we think so much of you you may be thinking a little of us and will not be sorrywho knowsto have a few words from us  november 24  just as i was writing had written that sentence yesterday came the letter which contained your notelet thank you thank you dearest friend it is very pleasant to have such a sign from your hand across the alps of kindness and remembrance as to my sins in the choice of the mont cenis route bradshaw was full of temptation and the results to me have so entirely passed away now that even the wholesome state of repentance is very faded in the colours what chiefly remains is the sense of wonderful contrast between climate and climate when we found ourselves at genoa and in june i cant get rid of the astonishment of it even now at turin i had to keep up a fire most of the night in my bedroom and at genoa with all the windows and doors open we were gasping for breath languid with the heat blue burning skies overhead and not enough stirring air for refreshment nothing less perhaps would have restored me so soon and it was delightful to be able during our last two days of our ten days there to stand on andrea dorias terrace and look out on that beautiful bay with its sweep of marble palaces my unconquerable mind even carried me halfway up the lighthouse for the sake of the view only there i had to stop ingloriously and let robert finish the course alone while i rested on a bench aspiration is not everything either in literature or lighthouses you know let us be ever so insolvent  well and since we left turin everywhere in italy we have found summer summernot a fire have we needed even in florence such mornings such evenings such walkings out in the dusk such sunsets over the arno ah mr kenyon you in england forget what life is in this outofdoor fresh world with your cloistral habits and necessities i assure you i cant help fancying that the winter is over and gone the past looks so cold and black in the warm light of the present we have had some rain but at night and only thundery frank rains which made the next day warmer and i have all but lost my cough and am feeling very well and very happy  oh yes it made me glad to see our poor darling florence again i do love florence when alls said against it and when robert demoralised by paris has said most strongly that the place is dead and dull and flat which it is i must confess particularly to our eyes fresh from the palpitating life of the parisian boulevards where we could scarcely find our way to prichards for the crowd during our last fortnight there poor florence so dead as robert says and as we both feel so trodden flat in the dust of the vineyards by these mules of austria and these asses of the papacy good heavens how long are these things to endure i do love florence when alls said the very calm the very dying stillness is expressive and touching and then our house our tables our chairs our carpets everything looking rather better for our having been away overjoyed i was to feel myself at home again our italians so pleased to see us wiedemans nurse rushing in kissing my lips away almost and seizing on the child dio mio come è bellino the tears pouring down her cheeks not able to look for emotion at the shawl we had brought her from england poor italians who can help caring for them and feeling for them in their utter prostration just now the unanimity of despair on all sides is an affecting thing i can assure you there is no mistake here no possibility of mistake or doubt as to the sentiment of the people towards the actual régime and if your english newspapers earnestly want to sympathise with an oppressed people let them speak a little for tuscany the most hopeful word we have heard uttered by the italians is surely it cannot last it is the hope of the agonising  but our carta di soggiorno was sent to us duly the government is not over learned in literature oh no  and only robert has seen mr powers yet for he is in the crisis of removal to a new house and studio a great improvement on the last and an excellent sign of prosperity of course he is to come to us some evening as soon as he can take breath we have had visits from the attachés at the english embassy here mr wolf and mr lytton16 sir e bulwer lyttons son and i think we shall like the latter who a reason for my particular sympathy is inclined to various sorts of spiritualism and given to the magic arts he told me yesterday that several of the american rapping spirits are imported to knebworth to his fathers great satisfaction a very young man as you may suppose the son is refined and gentle in manners sir henry bulwer is absent from florence just now  as to our house it really looks better to my eyes than it used to look mr lytton wondered yesterday how we could think of leaving it and so do i almost the letting has answered well enough that is it has paid all expenses leaving an advantage to us of a house during six months at our choice to occupy ourselves or let again also it might have been let for a year besides other offers only our agent expecting us in september and mistaking our intentions generally refused to do so now i will tell you what our plans are we shall stay here till we can let our house if we dont let it we shall continue to occupy it and put off rome till the spring but the probability is that we shall have an offer before the end of december which will be quite time enough for a roman winter in fact i hear of a fever at rome and another at naples and would rather on every account as far as i am concerned stay a little longer in florence i can be cautious you see upon some points and roman fevers frighten me for our little wiedeman  as to your science of turning the necessity of travelling into a luxury my dearest cousin do let me say that like some of the occult sciences it requires a good deal of gold to work out your too generous kindness enabled us to do what we couldnt certainly have done without it but nothing would justify us you know in not considering the cheapest way of doing things notwithstanding so bradshaw as i say tempted us and the sight of the short cut in the map pure delusion those maps are beguiled us and we crossed the cold valley and the cold mountain when we shouldnt have done either and we have bought experience and paid for it never mind experience is nearly always worth its price and i have nearly lost my cough and robert is dosing me indefatigably with cods liver oil to do away with my thinness  roberts best love with that of your most  gratefully affectionate ba                                        to miss i blagden  florence winter 18523  the beginning of the letter is lost  the state of things here in tuscany is infamous and cruel the old serpent the pope is wriggling his venom into the heart of all possibilities of free thought and action it is a dreadful state of things austria the hand the papal power the brain and no energy in the victim for resistanceonly for hatred they do hate here i am glad to say  but we linger at florence in spite of all it was delightful to find ourselves in the old nest still warm of casa guidi to sit in our own chairs and sleep in our own beds and here we shall stay as late perhaps as march if we dont relet our house before then we go to rome and naples you cant think how we have caught up our ancient traditions just where we left them and relapsed into our former soundless stirless hermit life robert has not passed an evening from home since we camejust as if we had never known paris people come sometimes to have tea and talk with us but thats all a few intelligent and interesting persons sometimes such as mr tennyson the poets brother and mr lytton the novelists son and mr stuart the lecturer on shakespeare whom once i named to you i fancy mr tennyson married an italian and has four children he has much of the atmosphere poetic about him a dreamy speculative shy man reminding us of his brother in certain respects good and pureminded i like him young mr lytton is very young as you may suppose with all sorts of high aspirationsand visionary enough to suit me which is saying muchand affectionate with an apparent liking to us both which is engaging to us of course we have seen the trollopes once the younger ones but the elder mrs trollope was visible neither at that time nor since  i sit here reading dumas last notwithstanding dumas is astonishing he never will write himself out theres no dust on his shoes after all this running his last books are better than his first  do your american friends write ever to you about the rapping spirits i hear and would hear much of them it is said that at least fifteen thousand persons in america of all classes and society are mediums as the term is most curious these phenomena  the end of the letter is lost                                        to miss mitford  casa guidi florence february 1853  i had just heard of your accident from arabel my much loved friend and was on the point of writing to you when your letter came to say that i was shocked and grieved to hear such news of you is useless indeed you will feel how i have felt about it may god bless and restore you and make me very thankful as certainly i must be in such a case  the comfort to me in your letter is the apparent good spirits you write in and the cheerful active intentions you have of work for the delight of us all i clap my hands and welcome the new volumes dearest friend i do wish i had heard about the french poetry in paris for there i could have got at books and answered some of your questions the truth is i dont know as much about french modern poetry as i ought to do in the way of métier the french essential poetry seems to me to flow out into prose works into their school of romances and to be least poetical when dyked up into rhythm mdme valmore i never read but she is esteemed highly i think for a certain naïveté and happy surprises in the thought and feeling des mots charmants i wanted to get her books in paris and missed them somehow there was so much to think of in paris alfred de mussets poems i read collected in a single volume it is the only edition i ever met with the french value him extremely for his music and there is much in him otherwise to appreciate i think very beautiful things indeed he is best to my mind when he is most lyrical and when he says things in a breath his elaborate poems are defective one or two spanish ballads of his seem to me perfect really he has great power in the introduction of familiar and conventional images without disturbing the ideala good power for these days the worst is that the moral atmosphere is bad and that though i am not as you know the very least bit of a prude not enough perhaps some of his poems must be admitted to be most offensive get st beuves poems they have much beauty in them you will grant at once then there is a breton17 poet whose name robert and i have both of us been ungrateful enough to forgetwe have turned our brains over and over and cant find the name anyhowand who indeed deserves to be remembered who writes some fresh and charmingly simple idyllic poems one called i think primel et nola by that clue you may hunt him out perhaps in the revue des deux mondes theres no strong imagination understandnothing of that sort but you have a sweet fresh cool sylvan feeling with him rare among frenchmen of his class edgar quinet has more positive genius he is a man of grand extravagant conceptions do you know the ahasuerus  i wonder if the empress pleases you as well as the emperor for my part i approve altogether and none the less that he has offended austria by the mode of announcement every cut of the whip in the face of austria is an especial compliment to meor so i feel it let him head the democracy and do his duty to the world and use to the utmost his great opportunities mr cobden and the peace society are pleasing me infinitely just now in making head against the immorality thats the word of the english press the tone taken up towards france is immoral in the highest degree and the invasion cry would be idiotic if it were not something worse the empress i heard the other day from good authority is charming and good at heart she was educated at a respectable school at bristol miss rogerss royal crescent clifton and is very english which doesnt prevent her from shooting with pistols leaping gates driving fourinhand and upsetting the carriage when the frolic requires it as brave as a lion and as true as a dog her complexion is like marble white pale and pure her hair light rather sandy they say and she powders it with gold dust for effect but there is less physical and more intellectual beauty than is generally attributed to her she is a woman of very decided opinions i like all that dont you and i liked her letter to the préfet as everybody must ah if the english press were in earnest in the cause of liberty there would be something to say for our poor trampleddown italymuch to say i mean under my eyes is a people really oppressed really groaning its heart out but these things are spoken of with measure  we are reading lamartine and proudhon on 48 we have plenty of french books here only the poets are to seekthe moderns do you catch sight of moore in diary and letters robert who has had glimpses of him says the flunkeyism is quite humiliating it is strange that you have not heard more of the rapping spirits they are worth hearing of were it only in the point of view of the physiognomy of the times as a sign of hallucination and credulity if not more fifteen thousand persons in all ranks of society and all degrees of education are said to be mediums that is seers or rather hearers and recipients perhaps oh i cant tell you all about it but the details are most curious i understand that dickens has caught a wandering spirit in london and showed him up victoriously in household words as neither more nor less than the cracking of toe joints but it is absurd to try to adapt such an explanation to cases in general you know i am rather a visionary and inclined to knock round at all the doors of the present world to try to get out so that i listen with interest to every goblin story of the kind and indeed i hear enough of them just now  we heard nothing however from the american minister mr marsh and his wife who have just come from constantinople in consequence of the change of presidency and who passed an evening with us a few days ago she is pretty and interesting a great invalid and almost blind yet she has lately been to jerusalem and insisted on being carried to the top of mount horeb after which i certainly should have the courage to attempt the journey myself if we had money enough going to the holy land has been a favorite dream of roberts and mine ever since we were married and some day you will wonder why i dont write and hear suddenly that i am lost in the desert you will wonder too at our wandering madness by the way more than at any rapping spirit extant we have a spirit in our feet as shelley says in his lovely eastern songand our child is as bad as either of us he says i tuite tired of flolence i want to go to brome which is worse than either of us i never am tired of florence robert has had an application from miss faucit now mrs martin to bring out his colombes birthday at the haymarket  the remainder of this letter is missing                                        to miss i blagden  florence march 3 1853  my dearest isa  you have seen in the papers that sir edward lytton bulwer has had an accident in the arm which keeps him away from the house of commons and even from the haymarket where they are acting his play not so bad as we seem with some success well here is a curious thing about it mr lytton told us some time ago that by several clairvoyantes without knowledge or connection with one another an impending accident had been announced to him not fatal but serious mr lytton said i have been very uneasy about it and nervous as every letter arrived but nearly three months having passed i began to think they must have made a mistakeonly it is curious that they all should all make a mistake of the same kind precisely when after this we saw the accident in the paper it was effective as you may suppose  profane or not i am resolved on getting as near to a solution of the spirit question as i can and i dont believe in the least risk of profanity seeing that whatever is must be permitted and that the contemplation of whatever is must be permitted also where the intentions are pure and reverent i can discern no more danger in psychology than in mineralogy only intensely a greater interest as to the spirits i care less about what they are capable of communicating than of the fact of there being communications i certainly wouldnt set about building a system of theology out of their oracles god forbid they seem abundantly foolish one must admit there is probably however a mixture of good spirits and bad foolish and wise of the lower orders perhaps in both kinds  isa you and i must try to make head against the strongminded women though really you half frighten me prospectively    one of the strongminded we just escaped with life from in london and again in paris in rome she has us what makes me talk so illnaturedly is the information i have since received that she has put everybody unfortunate enough to be caught into a book and published them at full length in american fashion now i do confess to the greatest horror of being caught stuck through with a pin and beautifully preserved with other butterflies and beetles even in the album of a corinna in yellow silk i detest that particular sort of victimisation  we are invited to go to constantinople this summer to visit the american minister there theres a temptation for you  god bless you dearest isa i shall be delighted to see you again and so will robert i always feel i say to him sometimes that you love me a little and that i may rest on you your ever affectionate friend  elizabeth b browning                                        to miss mitford  florence march 15 1853    the spring has surprised us here just as we were beginning to murmur at the cold think of somebody advising me the other day not to send out my child without a doublelined parasol theres a precaution for march the sun is powerfulwe are rejoicing in our italian climate oh that i could cut out just a mantle of it to wrap myself in and so go and see you your house is dry you say is the room you occupy airy as well as warm because being confined to a small room with you who are so used to liberty and out of door life must be depressing to the vital energies do you read much no no you ought not to think of the press of course till you are strong ahif you should get to london to see our play how glad i should be we too talk of london but somewhat mistily and not so early in the summer mr and mrs marshhe is the american minister at constantinoplehave been staying in florence and passing some evenings with us they tempt us with an invitation to constantinople this summer which would be irresistible if we had the money for the voyage perhaps so perhaps it is as well that we have not enough for us that we are going to rome and to naples then northward i am busy in the meanwhile with various things a new poem and revising for a third edition which is called for by the gracious public robert too is busy with another book then i am helping to make frocks for my child reading proudhon and swedenborg and in deep meditation on the nature of the rapping spirits upon whom i understand a fellow dramatist of yours henry spicer i think you once mentioned him to me as such has just written a book entitled the mystery of the age a happy winter it has been to me altogether we have had so much repose and at the same time so much interest in life also i have been so well that i shall be sorry when we go out of harbour again with the spring breezes we like mr tennyson extremely and he is a constant visitor of ours the poets elder brother by the way the new edition of the ode on the duke of wellington seems to contain wonderful strokes of improvement have you seen it as to alexandre dumas fils i hope it is not true that he is in any scrape from the cause you mention he is very clever and i have a feeling for him for his fathers sake as well as because he presents a rare instance of intellectual heirship didnt i tell you of the prodigious success of his drama of the dame aux camélias which ran about a hundred nights last year and is running again how there were caricatures on the boulevards showing the public of the pit holding up umbrellas to protect themselves from the tears rained down by the public of the boxes how the president of the republic went to see and sent a bracelet to the first actress and how the english newspapers called him immoral for it how i went to see myself and cried so that i was ill for two days and how my aunt called me immoral for it i was properly lectured i assure you she quite wondered how mr browning could allow such a thing not comprehending that mr browning never or scarcely ever does think of restraining his wife from anything she much pleases to do the play was too painful that was the worst of it but i maintain it is a highly moral play rightly considered and the acting was most certainly most exquisite on the part of all the performers not that alexandre dumas fils excels generally in morals in his books i mean but he is really a promising writer as to cleverness and when he has learnt a little more art he will take no low rank as a novelist robert has just been reading a tale of his called diane de lys and throws it down withyou must read that bait is cleveronly outrageous as to the morals just what i should expect from alexandre dumas fils i have a tenderness for the whole family you see  you dont say a word to me of mrs beecher stowe how did her book18 impress you no woman ever had such a success such a fame no man ever had in a single book for my part i rejoice greatly in it it is an individual glory full of healthy influence and benediction to the world  the remainder of this letter is missing                                        to mrs jameson  casa guidi florence march 17 1853  thank youhow to thank you enoughfor the too kind present of the madonna19 dearest mona nina i will not wait to read it throughwe have only looked through it which is different but there is enough seen so beautiful as to deserve the worlds thanks to say nothing of ours and there are personal reasons besides why we should thank you have you not quoted us have you not sent us the book surely good reasons  but now be still better to me and write and say how you are i want to know that you are quite well if you can tell me so do you have told me of a new book which is excellent news and i hear from another quarter that it will consist of your readings and remarks a sort of book most likely to penetrate widely and be popular in a good sense would it not be well to bring out such a work volume by volume at intervals is it this you are contemplating  robert and i have had a very happy winter in florence let me any way answer for myself i have been well and we have been quiet and occupied reading books doing work playing with wiedeman and with nothing from without to vex us much at the end of it all we go to rome certainly but we have taken on this apartment for another year which robert decided on to please me and because it was reasonable on the whole we have been meditating socialism and mysticism of very various kinds deep in louis blanc and proudhon deeper in the german spiritualists added to which i have by no means given up my french novels and my rapping spirits of whom our american guests bring us relays of witnesses so we dont absolutely moulder here in the intellect only robert and indeed i have too has tender recollections of that blaze of life in paris and we both mean to go back to it presently no place like paris for living in here one sleeps perchance to dream and praises the pillow  we had a letter from our friend m milsand yesterday you see he does not forget usno indeed in speaking of the state of things in france which i had asked him to do he says he is not sanguine he never is sanguine i must tell you about anything though entirely dissentient from la presse anglaise he considers on the whole that the status is as good as can be desired as a stable foundation for the development of future institutions it is in that point of view that he regards the situation so do i as to the english press i who am not anglomane like our friend i call it plainly either maniacal or immoral let it choose the epithet the invasion cry for instance i really cant qualify it i cant comprehend it with motives all good and fair i throw it over to you to analyse  with regard to the sudden death of french literature you all exaggerate that like the rest if you look into even the revue des deux mondes for the year 1852 you will see that a few books are still published pazienza things will turn up better than you suppose newspapers breathe heavily just now thats undeniable but for book literature the government never has touched it with a finger i ascertained that as a fact when i was in paris  none of you in england understand what the crisis has been in france and how critical measures have been necessary lamartines work on the revolution of 48 is one of the best apologies for louis napoleon and if you want another take louis blancs work on the same  isnt it a shame that nobody comes from the north to the south after a hundred oaths i hear nothing of dear mr kenyon i hear nothing from you of your coming you wont come any of you  i am much relieved by hearing that mazzini is gone from italy whatever lord malmesbury may say of it every day i expected to be told that he was taken at milan and shot a noble man though incompetent i think to his own aspiration but a man who personally has my sympathies always the state of things here is cruel the people are one groan god deliver us all i must pray and by almost any means  as to your ministry i dont expect very much from it lord aberdeen put on to lord john is using the drag uphill they will do just as little as they can be certain  think of my submitting at last to the conjugal will and cods liver oilyes and think of its doing me good the cough was nearly if not quite gone because of the climate before i took the oil but it does me good by making me gain in flesh i am much less thin and very well and dearest robert triumphant                                        to mrs jameson  florence april 12 1853  the comfort is my ever loved friend that here is springsummer as translated into italyif fine weather is to set you up again i shall be very thankful to have better news of you to hear of your being out of that room and loosened into some happy condition of liberty it seems unnatural to think of you in one room that seems fitter for me doesnt it and the rooms in england are so low and small that they put double bars on ones captivity may god bring you out with the chestnut trees and elms its very sad meanwhile  comfort yourself dear friend admire louis napoleon hes an extraordinary man beyond all doubt and that he has achieved great good for france i do not in the least doubt i was only telling you that i had not finished my pedestal for himwait a little because you see for my part i dont go over to the system of mild despotisms no indeed i am a democrat to the bone of me it is simply as a democratical ruler and by grace of the people that i accept him and he must justify himself by more deeds to his position before he glorifies himself before me thats what i mean to say a mild despot in france let him be the archangel gabriel unless he hold the kingdom in perpetuity what is the consequence a successor like the archangel lucifer perhaps then for the press where there is thought there must be discussion or conspiracy are you aware of the amount of readers in france take away the times newspaper and the blow falls on a handful of readers on a section of what may be called the aristocracy but everybody reads in france every fiacre driver who waits for you at a shop door beguiles the time with a newspaper it is on that account that the influence of the press is dangerous you will say precisely so but also on that account too it is necessary no i hold myself that he will give more breathing room to france as circumstances admit of it else there will be convulsion you will see we shall see and louis napoleon who is wise foresees i cannot doubt  not read mrs stowes book but you must her book is quite a sign of the times and has otherwise and intrinsically considerable power for myself i rejoice in the success both as a woman and a human being oh and is it possible that you think a woman has no business with questions like the question of slavery then she had better use a pen no more she had better subside into slavery and concubinage herself i think as in the times of old shut herself up with the penelopes in the womens apartment and take no rank among thinkers and speakers certainly you are not in earnest in these things a difficult questionyes all virtue is difficult england found it difficult france found it difficult but we did not make ourselves an armchair of our sins as for america i honor america in much but i would not be an american for the world while she wears that shameful scar upon her brow the address of the new president20 exasperates me observe i am an abolitionist not to the fanatical degree because i hold that compensation should be given by the north to the south as in england the states should unite in buying off this national disgrace  the americans are very kind and earnest and i like them all the better for their warm feeling towards you is longfellow agreeable in his personal relations we knew his brother i think i told you in paris i suppose mr field has been liberal to thackeray and yet thackeray does not except him in certain observations on american publishers we shall have an arrangement made of some sort it appears mr forster wants me to add some new poems to my new edition in order to secure the copyright under the new law but as the law does not act backwards i dont see how new poems would save me they would just sweep out the new poemsthats all one or two lyrics could not be made an object and in those two thick volumes nearly bursting with their present contents there would not be room for many additions no i shall add nothing i have revised the edition very carefully and made everything better it vexed me to see how much there was to do positively even rhymes left unrhymed in lady geraldines courtship you dont write so carelessly not you and the reward is that you havent so much trouble in your new editions i see your book advertised in a stray number of the athenæum lent to me by mr tennysonfrederick he lent it to me because i wanted to see the article on the new poet alexander smith who appears so applauded everywhere he has the poets stuff in him one may see from the extracts do you know him and coventry patmorehave you heard anything of his book21 of which appears an advertisement  ah yes how unfortunate that you should have parted with your copyrights its a bad plan always except in the case of novels which have their day and no day after  the poem i am about will fill a volume when done it is the novel or romance i have been hankering after so long written in blank verse in the autobiographical form the heroine an artist womannot a painter mind it is intensely modern crammed from the times not the times newspaper as far as my strength will allow perhaps you wont like it perhaps you will who knows who dares hope  i am beginning to be anxious about colombes birthday i care much more about it than robert does he says that nobody will mistake it for his speculation its mr buckstones affair altogether true but i should like it to succeed being roberts play notwithstanding but the play is subtle and refined for pits and galleries i am nervous about it on the other hand those theatrical people ought to know and what in the world made them select it if it is not likely to answer their purpose by the way a dreadful rumour reaches us of its having been prepared for the stage by the author dont believe a word of it robert just said yes when they wrote to ask him and not a line of communication has passed since he has prepared nothing at all suggested nothing modified nothing he referred them to his new edition and that was the whole  we see a great deal of mr tennyson robert is very fond of him and so am i he too writes poems and prints them though not for the public they are better and stronger than charles tennysons and he has the poetical temperament in everything did i tell you that he had married an italian and had children from twelve years old downwards he is intensely english nevertheless as expatriated englishmen generally are i always tell robert that his patriotism grows and deepens in exact proportion as he goes away from england as for me it is not so with me i am very cosmopolitan and am considerably tired of the selfdeification of the english nation at the expense of all others we have some noble advantages over the rest of the world but it is not all advantage the shameful details of bribery for instance prove what i have continually maintained the nonrepresentativeness of our representative system and socially speaking we are much behindhand with most foreign peoples let us be proud in the right place i say and not in the wrong we see too a good deal of young lytton sir edwards only son an interesting young man with various sorts of good and aspiration to good in him you see we are not at rome yet do write to me speak of yourself particularly god bless you dearest friend believe that i think of you and love you most faithfully  ba                                        to mrs martin  florence april 21 1853  my dearest mrs martini am in consternation and vexation on receiving your letter what you must have thought of me all this time of course i never saw the letters which went to rome letters sent to poste restante rome are generally lost even if you are a roman and we are no romans alas nor likely to become such it seems to me theres a fatality about rome to us i waited for you to write and then waited on foolishly for the settlement of our own plans after i had ascertained that you were not in devonshire but in france as usual now i cant help writing though i have written a letter already which must have crossed yoursa long letterso that you will have more than enough of me this time  its comfort and pleasure after all to have a good account of you both my very dear friends even though one knows by it that you have been sending one al diavolo for weeks or months forgive me do i feel guilty somehow to the extreme degree that four letters should have been written to me even though i received none of them because i ought to have written at least one letter in that time  your politics would be my politics on most points we should run together more than halfway if we could stand side by side in spite of all your vindictiveness to n iii my herosay you well i have more belief in him than you have and what is curious and would be unaccountable i suppose to english politicians in general the italian democrats of the lower classes the popular clubs in florence are clinging to him as their one hope ah heres oppression heres a people trodden down you should come here and see it is enough to turn the depths of the heart bitter the will of the people forced their instinctive affections despised their liberty of thought spied into their national life ignored altogether robert keeps saying how long o lord how long such things cannot last surely oh this brutal austria  i myself expect help from louis napoleon though scarcely in the way that the clubs are said to do when i talk of a club of course i mean a secret combination of menyoung men who meet to read forbidden newspapers and talk forbidden subjects he wont help the mazzinians but he will do something for italy you will see the cardinals feel it and thats why they wont let the pope go to paris we shall see i seem to catch sight of the grey of dawn even in the french government papers and am full of hope  as to mazzini he is a noble man and an unwise man unfortunately the epithets are compatible kossuth is neither very noble nor very wise i have heard and felt a great deal of harm of him the truth is not in him and when a patriot lies like a jesuit what are we to say  for englanddo you approve of the fleet staying on at malta we are prepared to do nothing which costs us a halfpenny for a less gain than three farthingsalways excepting the glorious national defences which have their end too though not the one generally attributed  god bless you my dear dear friends care in your thoughts for us all  your ever affectionate ba                                        to john kenyon  casa guidi may 16 1853  my dearest mr kenyonyou are to be thanked and loved as ever and what can we say more this do be good to us by a supererogatory virtue and write to us you cant know how pleasant it is to be en rapport with you though by holding such a fringe of a garment as a scrap of letter is we dont see you we dont hear you rap to us with the end of your pen like the benign spirit you are and let me who am credulous believe that you care for us and think kindly of us in the midst of your brilliant london gossipry and that you dont disdain the talk of us dark ultramontanists as we are you are good to us in so many ways that its a reason for being good in another way besides at least to reason so is one of the foolishnesses of my gratitude  on the whole i am satisfied with regard to colombe i never expected a theatrical success properly and vulgarly so called and the play has taken rank to judge by the various criticisms in the right way as a true poets work the defects of the acting drama seemed recognised as the qualities of the poem it was impossible all that subtle tracery of thought and feeling should be painted out clear red and ochre with a housepainters brush and lose nothing of its effect22 a play that runs nowadays has generally four legs to run withsomething of the beast to keep it going the human biped with the os divinior is slower than a racehorse even what i hope is that the poetical appreciation of colombe will give an impulse to the sale of the poems which will be more acceptable to us than the other kind of success  yes dearest mr kenyon we mean if we can to go to rome in the autumn it is very wrong of you not to come too and the reasons you give against it are by no means conclusive my opinion is that whatever the term of your natural life may be you would probably have an additional ten years fastened on to it by coming to the continent and so i tease you and tease you as is natural to such an opinion people twirl now in their armchairs and the vitality in them kindles as they rush along remember how pleased you were when you were at como dont draw a chalk circle round you and fancy you cant move even tables and chairs have taken to move lately and hats spin round without a giddy head in them is this a time to stand still even in the garden at wimbledon i speak to a wise man judge what i say  we tried the table experiment in this room a few days since bythebye and failed but we were impatient and robert was playing mephistopheles as mr lytton said and there was little chance of success under the circumstances it has been done several times in florence and the fact of the possibility seems to have passed among attested facts there was a placard on the wall yesterday about a pamphlet purporting to be an account of these and similar phenomena scoperte a livorno referring to oggetti semoventi and other wonders you cant even look at a wall without a touch of the subject the circoli at florence are as revolutionary as ever only tilting over tables instead of states alas from the legation to the english chemists people are serving tables in spite of the apostle everywhere when people gather round a table it isnt to play whist so good you say you can believe in tablemoving because that may be electricity but you cant believe in the rapping spirits with the history of whom these movements are undeniably connected because its a jump well but you will jump when the time comes for jumping and when the evidence is strong enough i know you you are strong enough and true enough to jump at anything without being afraid the tables jump observeand you may jump meanwhile if you were to hear what we heard only the evening before last from a cultivated woman with truthful tearful eyes whose sister is a medium and whose mother believes herself to be in daily communion with her eldest daughter dead years agoif you were to hear what we hear from nearly all the americans who come to us their personal experiences irrespectively of paid mediums i wonder if you would admit the possibility of your even jumping robert who wont believe he says till he sees and hears with his own sensesrobert who is a scepticobserved of himself the other day that we had received as much evidence of these spirits as of the existence of the town of washington but then of course he would addand you would reasonably enoughthat in a matter of this kind where you have to jump you require more evidence double the evidence to what you require for the existence of washington thats true  incomplete                                        to miss ef haworth  florence june 1853  my dearest fannyi hope you will write to me as if i deserved it you see my first word is to avert the consequences of my sin instead of repenting of it in the proper and effectual way the truth is that ever since i received your letter we have been looking out for messengers from the legation so as to save you postage while the embassy people have been regularly forgetting us whenever there has been an opportunity by the way i catch up that word of postage to beg you never to think of it when inclined in charity to write to us if you knew what a sublunary thingoh far below any visible moonpostage is to us exiles too glad we are to get a letter and pay for it so write to me directly dear fanny when you think enough of us for that and write at length and tell us of yourself first swirling off into popes circlesyour country first and then the human raceand indeed we get little news from home on the subjects which especially interest us my sister sends me heaps of near things but she is not in the magnetic circles nor in the literary nor even in the gossiping be good to us you who stand near the fountains of life every cup of cold water is worth a ducat here  to wait to a second page without thanking you for your kindness and sympathy about colombe does not do justice to the grateful sense i had of both at the time and have now we were very glad to have your opinion and impressions most of our friends took for granted that we had supernatural communications on the subject and did not send us a word mrs duncan stewart was one of the kind exceptions with yourself and one or two more and i write to thank her it was very pleasant to hear what you said dear fanny certainly says the author you are right and helen faucit wrong in the particular reading you refer to but she seems to have been right in so much that we should only remember our grateful thoughts of her in general  now what am i to say about my illustrationsthat is your illustrations of my poems to thank you again and again first to be eager next to see what is done to be sure it is good and surer still that you are good for spending your strength on me see how it is when you wrote to me a new edition was in the press yes and i was expecting every day to hear it was out again but it would not have done i suppose to have used illustrations for that sort of edition it would have raised the price already too high beyond the public but there will be time always for such arrangementswhen it so pleases mr chapman i suppose do tell me more of what you have done  we did not go to rome last winter in spite of the spirits of the sun who declared from lord stanhopes crystal ball you remember that we should and we dont go to england till next summer because we must see rome next winter and must lie perdus in italy meantime i have had a happy winter in florence recovered my lost advantages in point of health been busy and tranquil had plenty of books and talk and seen my child grow rosier and prettier said aside every day robert and i are talking of going up to the monasteries beyond vallombrosa for a day or two on muleback through forests and mountains we have had an excursion to prato less difficult already and we keep various dreams in our heads to be acted out on occasion our favorite friend here is a brother of alfred tennysons himself a poet but most admirable to me for his simplicity and truth robert is very fond of him then we like powersof the greek slaveswedenborgian and spiritualist and mr lytton sir edwards son who is with us often and always a welcome visitor all these confederate friends are ranged with me on the believing side with regard to the phenomena and robert has to keep us at bay as he best can oh do tell me what you can your account deeply interested me we have heard many more intimate personal relations from americans who brush us with their garments as they pass through florence and i should like to talk these things over with you paid mediums as paid clairvoyants in general excite a prejudice yet perhaps not reasonably the curious fact in this movement is however the degree in which it works within private families in america has anything of the kind appeared in england and has the motion of the tables ever taken the form of alphabetical expression which has been the case in america i had a letter from athens the other day mentioning that nothing was talked of there except moving tables and spiritual manifestations the writer was not a believer even here from the priest to the mazzinian they are making circles an engraving of a spinning table at a shop window bears this motto e pur si muove thats adroit for galileos land isnt it now mind you tell me whatever you hear and see how does mrs crowe decide by the way i was glad to observe by the papers that she has had a dramatic success  your alexander smith has noble stuff in him its undeniable indeed it strikes us however that he has more imagery than verity more colour than form he will learn to be less arbitrary in the use of his figuresof which the opulence is so strikingand attain as he ripens more clearness of outline and depth of intention meanwhile none but a poet could write this and this and this  your faithfully affectionate ebb properly speaking ba  july 3  this was written ever so long since here we are in july but i wont write it over again the tables are speaking alphabetically and intelligently in paris they knock with their legs on the floor establishing what was clear enough before to me the connection between the tablemoving and rapping spirits sariannawho is of the unbelieving of temperaments as you knowwrote a most curious account to me the other day of a séance at which she had been present composed simply of one or two of our own honest friends and of a young friend of theirs a young lady23 she says that she was not as much impressed as she would have been but i am bound to tell the truth that i do not think it possible that any tricks could have been played  this from sarianna is equal to the same testimonyfrom mr chorley say  we are planning a retreat into the mountainsinto giottos country the casentinowhere we are to find a villa for almost nothing and shall have our letters sent daily from florence together with books and newspapers i look forward to it with joy we promise one another to be industrious à faire frémir so as to make the pleasure lawful little penini walks about talking of mine villa anxiously hoping that some boys may not have pulled all the flowers before he gets there he boasts with considerable complacency that a table in pallis says i am four years though the fact doesnt strike him as extraordinary  do you ever see mr kenyon i congratulate you on your friends coeur de lion that has given you pleasure                                        the summer retreat from florence this year was not to the casentino after all but to the baths of lucca which they had already visited in 1849 during their stay there which lasted from july to october mr browning is said to have composed in a balcony                                        to miss mitford  florence july 15 1853    we have taken a villa at the baths of lucca after a little holy fear of the company there but the scenery the coolness and the convenience altogether prevail and we have taken our villa for three months or rather more and go to it next week with a stiff resolve of not calling nor being called upon you remember perhaps that we were there four years ago just after the birth of our child the mountains are wonderful in beauty and we mean to buy our holiday by doing some work  yesterday evening we had the american minister at the court of turin here and it was delightful to hear him talk about piedmont its progress in civilisation and the comprehension of liberty and the honesty and resolution of the king it is the only hope of italy that piedmont god prosper the hope besides this diplomatical dignitary and his wife we had two american gentlemen of more than average intelligence who related wonderful things of the spiritual manifestations so called incontestable things inexplicable things you will have seen faradays letter24 i wish to reverence men of science but they often will not let me if i know certain facts on this subject faraday ought to have known them before he expressed an opinion on it his statement does not meet the facts of the caseit is a statement which applies simply to various amateur operations without touching on the essential phenomena such as the moving of tables untouched by a finger  our visitor last night to say nothing of other witnesses has repeatedly seen this done with his eyesin private houses for instance where there could be no machineryand he himself and his brother have held by the legs of a table to prevent the motionthe medium sitting some yards awayand that table has been wrenched from their grasp and lifted into the air my husbands sister who has admirable sense and excessive scepticism on all matters of the kind was present the other day at the house of a friend of ours in paris where an english young lady was medium and where the table expressed itself intelligently by knocking with its leg responses according to the alphabet for instance the age of my child was asked and the leg knocked four times sarianna was not impressed she says but being bound to speak the truth she does not think it possible that any trick could have been used to hear her say so was like hearing mr chorley say so all her prejudices were against it strongly mr spicers book on the subject is flippant and a little vulgar but the honesty and accuracy of it have been attested to me by americans oftener than once by the way he speaks in it of your interesting recollections and quotes you upon the possibility of making a ghost story better by the tellingin reference to washington  mr tennyson is going to england for a few months so that our florence party is breaking up you see he has printed a few copies of his poems and is likely to publish them if he meets with encouragement in england i suppose they are full of imagery encompassed with poetical atmosphere and very melodious on the other hand there is vagueness and too much personification its the smell of a rose rather than a rosevery sweet notwithstanding his poems are far superior to charles tennysons bear in mind as for the poet we quite love him robert and i do what swedenborg calls selfhood the proprium is not in him  oh yes i confess to loving florence and to having associated with it the idea of home my child was born here and here i have been very happy and well yet we shall not live in florencewe are steady to our paris plan we must visit rome next winter and in the spring we shall go to paris viâ london you may rely on us for next summer i think it too probable that i may not be able to bear two successive winters in the north but in that case it will be easy to take a flight for a few winter months into italy and we shall regard paris where roberts father and sister are waiting for us as our fixed place of residence as to the distance between paris and london its a mere step now we are to have war i suppose i would not believe it for a long while but the czar seems to be struck with madnessmad in good earnest under these circumstances i hope our ministry will act with decision and honestybut i distrust lord aberdeen there is evidently or has been a division in the cabinet and perhaps lord palmerston is not the strongest louis napoleon has acted excellently in this conjuncturewith integrity and boldnessdont you think so dear mr kenyon has his brother and sister with him to his great joy robert pretended he would not give me your last letter little wiedeman threw his arms round my neck taking the playcruelty for earnest and exclaimed never mind mine darling ba youll have it he always calls me ba at coaxing times such a darling that child is indeed  god bless you do write soon and tell me in detail of yourself  our united love but mine the closest  your ever most affectionate ebb                                        to miss i blagden  casa tolomei alia villa bagni di lucca july 26 1853  i deserve another scold for this other silence dearest isa scold as softly as you can we have been in uncertainty about leaving florencewhere to go for the summerand i did not like to write till i could tell you where to write to me now we are fixed as our american friends would say we have taken this house for three monthsa larger house than we need we have a row of plane trees before the door in which the cicale sing all day and the beautiful mountains stand close around keeping us fresh with shadows penini thinks he is in edenat least he doesnt think otherwise we have a garden and an arbour and the fireflies light us up at nights with all this i am sorry for florence florence was horribly hot and pleasant notwithstanding we hated cutting the knot of friends we had therebachelor friends isa who came to us for coffee and smoking i was gracious and permitted the cigar as you were not present and there were quantities of talk controversy and confidences evening after evening one of our very favourite friends frederick tennyson is gone to england or was to have gone for three months mr lytton had a reception on the terrace of his villa at bellosguardo the evening before our last in florence and we were all bachelors together there and i made tea and we ate strawberries and cream and talked spiritualism through one of the pleasantest two hours that i remember such a view florence dissolving in the purple of the hills and the stars looking on mr tennyson was there mr powers and m villari25 an accomplished sicilian besides our young host and ourselves how we set down faraday for his arrogant and insolent letter and what stories we told and what miracles we swore to oh we are believers here isa except robert who persists in wearing a coat of respectable scepticismso consideredthough it is much out of elbows and ragged about the skirts if i am right you will none of you be able to disbelieve much longera new law or a new development of law is making way everywhere we have heard muchmore than i can tell you in a letter imposture is absolutely out of the question to speak generally and unless you explain the phenomena by a personality unconsciously projected which requires explanation of itself you must admit the spirit theory as to the simpler forms of the manifestation it is all one manifestation the turningtables i was convinced long before faradays letter that many of the amateur performances were from involuntary muscular actionbut what then these are only imitations of actual phenomena faradays letter does not meet the common fact of tables being moved and lifted without the touch of a finger it is a most arrogant letter and singularly inconclusive tell me any facts you may hear mr kinney the american minister at the court of turin had arrived at florence a few days before we quitted it and he and his wife helped us to spend our last evening at casa guidi he is cultivated and highminded i like him much and none the less that he brings hopeful accounts of the state of piedmont of the progress of the people and good persistency of the king it makes ones heart beat with the sense that all is not over with our poor italy  i am glad you like frederick tennysons poems they are full of atmospherical poetry and very melodious the poet is still better than the poemsso truthful so direct such a reliable christian man robert and i quite love him we very much appreciate too young lytton your old friend he is noble in many ways i think and affectionate moreover he has an incontestable faculty in poetry and i expect great things from him as he ripens into life and experience meanwhile he has just privately printed a drama called clytemnestra too ambitious because after Æschylus but full of promise indeed we are hoping that he will come down and see us in the course of our rustication at the baths and occupy our spare bedroom  as to mr  his hebrew was chinese to you do you say but dear he is strong in veritable chinese besides and one evening he nearly assassinated me with the analysis chapter by chapter of a japanese novel mr lytton who happened to be a witness swore that i grew paler and paler and not with sympathy for the heroine he is a miraculously vain manwhich rather amused meand for the rest is full of informationyes and of kindness i think he gave me a little black profile of you which gives the air of your head and is so far valuable to me as to myself indeed he has rather flattered me than otherwisei dont complain i assure you how could i complain of a man who compares me to isaiah under any circumstances  god bless you roberts love with that of  your ever affectionate and faithful ba                                        to mr chorley  casa tolomei alia villa bagni di lucca august 10 1853  my dear mr chorleyi cant bear that you should intimate by half a word that you are a creature to be eatenviz not to have your share in friendship and confidence now if you fancy that we for instance dont affectionately regard you you are very wrong and i am very right for feeling inclined to upbraid you i take the pen from roberthe would take it if i did not we scramble a little for the pen which is to tell you thiswhich is to say it again and again and be dull in the reiteration rather than not instruct you properly as we teach our child to dod o g dog d o g dog d o g dog says robert what a slow business yet hes a quick child and you too must be quick and comprehending or we shall take it to heart sadly often i think and we say to one another that we belied ourselves to you in england if you knew how at that time robert was vexed and wornwhy he was not the same even to me he seemed to himself to be slipping out of waistcoats and friends at onceso worn and teased he was but then and now believe that he loved and loves you set him down as a friendas somebody to rest on after all and dont fancy that because we are away here in the wilderness which blossoms as a rose to one of us at least we may not be full of affectionate thoughts and feelings towards you in your different sort of life in london so sorry we arei especially for i think i understand the grief especiallyabout the household troubles which you hint at and mr kenyon gave us a key to i quite understand how a whole life may seem rumpled up and creasedtorn for the moment only you will live it smooth again dear mr chorleytake courage you have time and strength and good aims and human beings have been happy with much less i understate your advantages on purpose you see i heard you talked of in florence when miss cushman in the quarter of an hour she gave us at casa guidi told us of the oath she had in heaven to bring out your play and make it a triumph how she praised the play and you twice i have spoken with heronce on a balcony on the boulevard when together we saw louis napoleon enter paris in immediate face of the empire and that once in florence i like the manly soul in her face and manners manly not masculinean excellent distinction of mrs jamesons by the way we hear wonderful things of the portrait painted of miss cushman at rome by mr page the artist called the american titian by the americans  there i stop not to fret you beyond measure besides now that you czars of the athenæum have set your faradays on us ukase and knout what pole in the deepest of the brain would dare to have a thought on the subject now that professor faraday has condescended as the literary gazette affectingly puts it and the condescension is sufficiently obvious in the letterhow we stoopnow that professor faraday has condescended to explain the whole questionwhich had offered some difficulty it is admitted to hundreds of intelligent men including five or six eminent men of science in paris and we may add to thousands of unintelligent men elsewhere including the eminent correspondent of the literary gazettelet us all be silent for evermore for my part i wont say that lord bacon would have explained any question to a child even without feeling it to be an act of condescension i wont hint under my breath that lord bacon reverenced every fact as a footstep of deity and stooped to pick up every rough ungainly stone of a fact though it were likely to tear and deform the smooth wallet of a theory i for my part belong you know not to the eminent men of science nor even to the intelligent men but simply to the women children and poets and if we happen to see with our eyes a table lifted from the floor without the touch of a finger or foot let no dog of us barkmuch less a puppydog the famous letter holds us gagged what it does not hold is the facts but en revanche the writer and his abettors know the secret of being invinciblewhich is not to fight my child proposed a donkeyrace yesterday the condition being that he should ride first somebody told me once that when miss martineau has spoken eloquently on one side of a question she drops her eartrumpet to give the opportunity to her adversary most controversies to do justice to the world are conducted on the same plan and terms  what i do venture however to say is that its not all over in paris because of faradays letter ask lamartine what i hear and what the literary gazette hears from paris is by no means the same thing i hear hebrew while the gazette hears dutcha miracle befitting the subject or what was once considered to be the subject i beg professor faradays pardon before it was annihilated  how pert women can be cant they mr chorley particularly when they are safe among the mountains shut in with a row of seven planetrees joined at top i wont go on to offer myself as spiritual correspondent to the athenæum though i have a modest conviction that it might increase your sale considerably ah tread us down put us out you will have some trouble with us yet the opposition czar of st petersburg supports us be it known and louis napoleon comes to us for oracles the king of holland is going mad gently in our favourquite absorbed says an informant but i wont quote kings it is giving oneself too great a disadvantage  we stayed in florence till it was ovenheat and then we came here where it was fireheat for a short time though with cool nights comparatively by means of which we lived comparatively too now it is cool by day and night you know these beautiful hills the green rushing river which keeps them apart the chestnut woods the sheepwalks and goatwalks the villages on the peaks of the mountains like wild eagles the fresh unworn uncivilised worldbeforetheflood look of everything if you dont know it you ought to know it come and know itdo we have a spare bedroom which opens its door of itself at the thought of you and if you can trust yourself so far from home try for our sakes come and look in our faces and learn us more by heart and see whether we are not two friends i am so very sorry for your increased anxiety about your sister i scarcely know how to cheer you or rather to attempt such a thing but it did strike me that she was full of life when i saw her it may be better with her than your fears after all if you would come to us you would be here in two hours from leghorn and theres a telegraph at leghornat florence think of it do the storys are at the top of the hill you know mr and mrs story she and i go backward and forward on donkeyback to teadrinking and gossiping at one anothers houses and our husbands hold the reins also robert and i make excursions he walking as slowly as he can to keep up with my donkey when the donkey trots we are more equal the other day we were walking and i attracted by a picturesque sort of ladderbridge of loose planks thrown across the river ventured on it without thinking of venturing robert held my hand when we were in the middle the bridge swayed rocked backwards and forwards and it was difficult for either of us to keep footing a gallant colonel who was following us went down upon his hands and knees and crept in the meantime a peasant was assuring our admiring friends that the river was deep at that spot and that four persons had been lost from the bridge i was so sick with fright that i could scarcely stand when all was over never having contemplated an heroic act why what a courageous creature you are said our friends so reputations are made mr chorley  yes we are doing a little work both of us robert is working at a volume of lyrics of which i have seen but a few and those seemed to me as fine as anything he has done we neither of us show our work to one another till it is finished an artist must i fancy either find or make a solitude to work in if it is to be good work at all this for the consolation of bachelors  i am glad you like mr powerss paper you would have fretted me terribly if you had not for i liked it myself knowing it to be an earnest opinion and expressive of the man i had a very interesting letter from him the other day he is devout in his art and the simplest of men otherwise  now i will ask you to write to us it is you who give us up indeed will your sister accept our true regards and sympathies i shall persist in hoping to see her a little stronger next springor summer rather may god bless you i will set myself down and robert with me as  faithfully and affectionately yours elizabeth barrett browning                                        to miss mitford  casa tolomei alia villa bagni di lucca august 20 and 21 1853    we are enjoying the mountains here riding the donkeys in the footsteps of the sheep and eating strawberries and milk by basins full the strawberries succeed one another generation after generation throughout the summer through growing on different aspects of the hills if a tree is felled in the forests strawberries spring up just as mushrooms might and the peasants sell them for just nothing our little penini is wild with happiness he asks in his prayers that god would mate him dood and tate him on a dontey make him good and take him on a donkey so resuming all aspiration for spiritual and worldly prosperity then our friends mr and mrs story help the mountains to please us a good deal he is the son of judge story the biographer of his father and for himself sculptor and poet and she a sympathetic graceful woman fresh and innocent in face and thought we go backwards and forwards to tea and talk at one anothers houses last night they were our visitors and your name came in among the household gods to make us as agreeable as might be we were considering your expectations about mr hawthorne all right says mr story except the rare half hours of eloquence he represents mr hawthorne as not silent only by shyness but by nature and inaptitude he is a man it seems who talks wholly and exclusively with the pen and who does not open out socially with his most intimate friends any more than with strangers it isnt his way to converse that has been a characteristic of some men of genius before him you know but you will be nevertheless disappointed very surely also mr story does not imagine that you will get anything from him on the subject of the manifestations you have read the blithedale romance and are aware of his opinion expressed there he evidently recognised them as a sort of scurvy spirits good to be slighted because of their disreputableness by the way i heard read the other day a very interesting letter from paris from mr appleton longfellows brotherinlaw who is said to be a man of considerable ability and who is giving himself wholly just now to the investigation of this spiritsubject termed by him the sublimest conundrum ever given to the world for guessing he appears still in doubt whether the intelligence is external or whether the phenomena are not produced by an unconscious projection in the medium of a second personality accompanied with clairvoyance and attended by physical manifestations this seems to me to double the difficulty yet the idea is entertained as a doubtful sort of hypothesis by such men as sir edward lytton and others imposture is absolutely out of the question be certain as an ultimate solution and a greater proof of credulity can scarcely be given than a belief in imposture as things are at present but i was going to tell you mr appleton has a young american friend in paris who besides being a very sweet girl says he is a strong medium by lamartines desire he took her to the poets house all the phenomena were reproduced and everybody present convinced lamartine himself in ecstasies among other spirits came henry clay who said jaime lamartine we shall have it in the next volume of biography louis napoleon gets oracles from the raps and it is said that the czar does the sameyour emperor certainlyand the king of holland is allowing the subject to absorb him dying out dying out our accounts from new york are very different but unbelieving persons are apt to stop their ears and exclaim we hear nothing now on one occasion the hebrew professor at new york was addressed in hebrew to his astonishment  well i dont believe with all my credulity in poets being perfected at universities what can be more absurd than this proposition of finishing alexander smith at oxford or cambridge we dont know how to deal with literary genius in england certainly we are apt to treat poets when we condescend to treat them at all as overmasculine papas do babies and monckton milnes was accused of only touching his in order to poke out its eyes for instance why not put this new poet in a public library there are such situations even among us and something of the kind was done for patmore the very judgment tennyson gave of him in the very words we had given herefancy not imagination also imagery in excess thought in deficiency still the new poet is a true poet and the defects obvious in him may be summed up in youth simply let us wait and see i have read him only in extracts such as the reviews give and such as a friend helped me to by goodnatured ms it is extraordinary to me that with his amount of development as far as i understand it he has met with so much rapid recognition tell me if you have read queechy the american booknovelby elizabeth wetherell i think it very clever and characteristic mrs beecher stowe scarcely exceeds it after all the trumpets we are about to have a visit from mr lytton sir edwards only sononly child now did i tell you that he was a poetyes and of an unquestionable faculty i expect much from him one day when he shakes himself clear of the poetical influences of the age which he will have strength to do presently he thinks as well as sees and that is good  oh yes i like mr kingsley i am glad he spoke kindly of us because really i like him and admire him few people have struck me as much as he did last year in england manly do you say but i am not very fond of praising men by calling them manly i hate and detest a masculine man humanly bold brave true direct mr kingsley isa moral cordiality and an original intellect uniting in him i did not see her and the children but i hope we shall be in better fortune next time  since i began this letter the storys and ourselves have had a grand donkeyexcursion to a village called benabbia and the cross above it on the mountainpeak we returned in the dark and were in some danger of tumbling down various precipices but the scenery was exquisitepast speaking of for beauty oh those jagged mountains rolled together like preadamite beasts and setting their teeth against the sky it was wonderful you may as well guess at a lion by a ladys lapdog as at nature by what you see in england all honour to england lanes and meadowland notwithstanding to the great trees above all will you write to me sooner will you give me the details of yourself will you love me  your most affectionate ba                                        to miss ef haworth  casa tolomei alia villa bagni di lucca august 30 1853  dearest fannyon your principle that theres too much to say i ought not to think of writing to you these three months you have pleased me and made me grateful to such an extremity by your most pretty and graceful illustrative outlines the deathbed i admire particularly the attitudes are very expressive and the open window helps the sentiment what am i to say for your kindness in holding a torch of this kind perfumed for the nobilities between the wind and my poems thank you thank you and when thats said i ought to stop short and beg you dear fanny not to waste yourself in more labour of this kind seeing that i am accursed and that nothing is to be done with my books and me as far as my public is concerned why not get up a book of your own a collection of outlines illustrative of everybodys poems which would stand well on its own feet and make a circle for itself think of that rather for my part theres nothing to be done with me as i said that is theres nothing to be done with my publishers who just do as they like with my books and dont like to do much good for me with them whatever they may do for themselves i am misanthropical in respect to the booksellers they manage one as they please and not at all to please one i have no more to say to the fate of my books than you haveand not much more to pocket this third edition for instance which should have been out four or five months ago they are keeping i suppose for the millennium encouraged probably by the spiritual manifestations and my personal manifestations meanwhile have as much weight with them as facts have with faraday or the theory of fair play with the london athenæum i am sick of it all indeed i look down on it all as the epicurean gods do on the world without putting out a finger to save an empire perhaps because they cant long live the  who are kings of us its the best thing possible i conclude in this best of possible social economies though for ourselves individually it may not be a very good thing not precisely what we should choose think of the separate book of outlines seriously robert and i recommend you to consider it you might make a book for drawingroom tables which would be generally acceptable if not too expensive and mr spicer is bringing me more how kind of you and when is he coming scarcely could anyone come as a stranger whom i desire more to see and i do hope he will bring me facts and fantasies too on the great subject which is interesting me so deeply his book of sights and sounds we have read but the new book has not penetrated to us sights and sounds is very curious and the authenticity of its facts has been confirmed to me by various testimonies but the author is too clever for his position i mean too full of flash and wit theres an air of levity and of effective writing without which the book would have been more impressive and convincing dont you think so and here we get to the heart of most of the difficulties of the subject why do we make no quicker advances do you say why are our communications chiefly trivial why but because we ourselves are trivial and dont bring serious souls and concentrated attentions and holy aspirations to the spirits who are waiting for these things spirit comes to spirit by affinity says swedenborg but our cousinship is not with the high and noble we try experiments from curiosity just as children play with the loadstone our ducks swim but they dont get beyond that and wont unless we do better to prove what i say consider what you say yourself that you couldnt manage to draw the same persons together again these very persons being persuaded of the verity of the spiritual communications they were in reach of on account of the difficulties of the london season difficulties of the london season the inconsequence of human nature is more wonderful to me than the ingress of any spirits could be this instance is scarcely credible  i had a letter the other day from mr chorley and he was chivalrous enough i call it real chivalry in his state of opinion to deliver to me a message from mr westland marston whom he met at folkestone and who kindly proposes to write a full account to me of his own spiritual experiences having heard from you that they were likely to interest me i mean that i was interested in the whole subject will you tell him from me that i shall be most thankful for anything he will vouchsafe to write to me and will you give him my address i dont know where to find him and mr chorley is on the continent wandering i have seen nothing for myself but i am a believer upon testimony and a stream of americans running through florence and generally making way to us the testimony has been various and strong interested in the subject who can be uninterested in the subject even robert is interested who professes to be a sceptic an infidel indeed though i can swear to having seen him considerably shaken more than once and who promises never to believe till he has experience by his own senses isnt it hard on me that i cant draw a spirit into our circle and convince him he would give much he says to find it true  here an end write soon and write much  your ever affectionate ebb called ba  our child was gathering box leaves in a hedge the other day wherever we have a hedge its box i would have you to understand and pulled a yellow flower by mistake down he flung it as if it stung him ah brutto colore tedesco think of that baby                                        to mr westwood  casa tolomei alia villa bagni di lucca september 1853  as to patmores new volume of poems my husband and i had the pleasure of reading in ms the poem which gives its title to the book he has a great deal of thought and poetry in him alexander smith i know by copious extracts in reviews and by some mss once sent to us by friends and readers judging from those he must be set down as a true poet in opulence of imagery but defective so far he is said to be very young in the intellectual part of poetry his images are flowers thrown to him by the gods beautiful and fragrant but having no root either in enna or olympus theres no unity and holding together no reality properly so called no thinking of any kind i hear that alfred tennyson says of him he has fancy without imagination still it is difficult to say at the dawn what may be written at noon certainly he is very rich and full of colour nothing is more surprising to me than his favourable reception with the critics i should have thought that his very merits would be against him  if you can read novels and you have too much sense not to be fond of them read villette the scene of the greater part of it is in belgium and i think it a strong book ruth too by mrs gaskell the author of mary barton has pleased me very much do you know the french novels theres passion and power for you if you like such things balzac convinced me that the french language was malleable into poetry we are behindhand here in books and elderly ones seem young to us for instance we have not caught sight yet of moores life the extracts from which are unpropitious i think i had a fancy i cannot tell you how it grew that moore though an artificial therefore inferior poet was a most brilliant letterwriter his letters are disappointing and his mean clinging to the aristocracy still more so  i wish you could suddenly walk into this valley which seems to have been made by the flashing scimitar of the river that cuts through the mountain ah you in england and in belgium still less do not know what scenery is what nature is when she is natural you could as soon guess at a tiger from the cat on the hearthstone you do not know but being a poet you can dream you have divine insights as we all have of heaven all of us with whom the mortal mind does not cake and obstruct into cecity no no no i protest against anything i have not reprinted the prometheus poems bear the mark of their time which was one of greenness and immaturity indeed the responsibility for what i acknowledge in print is hard enough to bear dont put another stick on the overloadedass shall i say candidly                                        to mrs martin  bagni di lucca october 5 1853  my dearest mrs martin i am delighted to have your letter at last and should have come upon you like a storm in a day or two if you hadnt written for really i began to be low in patience also after having spent the summer here we were about to turn our faces to florence again and it was necessary to my own satisfaction to let you know of our plans for the winter to begin with those then we go to florence as i said from hence and after a week or two or three or four as it may be the briefer time if we let our house we proceed to rome for some months you see we must visit rome before we go northwards and northwards we must go in the spring so that the logic of events seems to secure rome to us this time otherwise i should still doubt of our going there so often have we been on the verge and caught back  so you think that he26 is looking less young than formerly and that we should all learn to hear and make such remarks with equanimity now once for all let me tell youconfess to youi never if i live to be a hundred should learn that learning death has the luminous side when we know how to look but the rust of time the touch of age is hideous and revolting to me and i never see it by even a lines breadth in the face of any i love without pain and recoil of nature i have a worse than womanly weakness about that class of subjects death is a facetoface intimacy age a thickening of the mortal mask between souls so i hate it put it far from me why talk of age when its just an appearance an accident when we are all young in soul and heart we dont say one to another you are freckled in the forehead today or theres a yellow shade in your complexion leave those disagreeable trifles i for my part never felt younger did you i wonder to be sure not also i have a gift in my eyes i think for scarcely ever does it strike me that anybody is altered except my child for instance who certainly is larger than when he was born when i went to england after five years absence everybody save one appeared to me younger than i was used to conceive of them and of course i took for granted that i appeared to them in the same light be sure that it is highly moral to be young as long as possible women who throw up the game early or even late and wear dresses suitable to their years that is as hideous as possible are a disgrace to their sex arent they now and women and men with statistical memories who are always quoting centuries and the years thereof do you remember in 20 as if anybody could are the pests of society and in short and for my part whatever honours of authorship may ever befall me i hope i may be safe from the epithet which distinguishes the venerable bede  now if i had written this from paris you would have cried out upon the frivolity i had picked up who would imagine that i had just finished a summer of mountain solitude succeeding a winters meditation on swedenborgs philosophy and that such fruit was of it all by the way tell me how it was that paris did harm to moore mentally was it and morally or in the matter of the body i have not seen the biography yet italy keeps us behind in new books but the extracts given in newspapers displease me through the ignoble tone of doing honour to the lord which is anything but religious also the letters seem somewhat less brilliant than i expected from moore but it must be after all a most entertaining book tell me if you have read mrs gaskells ruth thats a novel which i much admire it is strong and healthy at once teaching a moral frightfully wanted in english society such an interesting letter i had from mrs gaskell a few days ago simple worthy of ruth by the way ruth is a great advance on mary barton dont you think so villette too jane eyres is very powerful  since we have been here we have had for a visitor drawing the advantage from our spare room mr lytton sir edwards only son who is attaché at the florence legation at this time he lost nothing from the test of houseintimacy with either of usgained in fact much full of all sorts of good and nobleness he really is and gifted with high faculties and given to the highest aspirationsnot vulgar ambitions understandhe will never be a great diplomatist nor fancy himself an inch taller for being master of knebworth27 then he is somewhat dreamy and unpractical we must confess he wont do for drawing carts under any sort of discipline such a summer we have enjoyed here free from burning heats and mosquitosthe two drawbacks of italyand in the heart of the most enchanting scenery mountains not too grand for exquisite verdure and just kept from touching by the silver finger of a stream i have been donkeyriding and so has wiedeman i even went to prove to you how well i am the great excursion to prato fiorito six miles there and six miles back perpendicularly up and down oh it almost slew me of course i could not stir for days after but who wouldnt see heaven and die such a vision of divine scenery such as in england the best dreamers do not dream of as we came near home i said to mr lytton who was on horseback i am dying how are you to which he answered i thought a quarter of an hour ago i could not keep up to the end but now i feel better this from a young man just oneandtwenty he is delicate to be sure but still you may imagine that the days work was not commonly fatiguing the guides had to lead the horses and donkeys it was like going up and down a wall without the smoothness no road except in the beds of torrents robert pretended to be not tired but of course as sensible people say of the turning tables nobody believed a word of it it was altogether a supernatural pretension and very impertinent in these enlightened days  mr and mrs story were of our party he is the son of judge story and full of all sorts of various talent and she is one of those cultivated and graceful american women who take away the reproach of the national want of refinement we have seen much of them throughout the summer there has been a close communion of teadrinking between the houses and as we are all going to rome together this pleasure is not a past one  we still point to paris ah you disapprove of paris i see but we must try the experiment what i am afraid of is simply the climate i doubt whether i shall stand two winters running as far north as paris but if i cant we must come south again then i love italy oh if it were not for the distance between italy and england we should definitively settle here at once we shall be in england by the way next summer for pleasure and business having or about to have two books to see through the press not prose mr martin im lostdevoted to the infernal gods of rhyming its my fate as a popular poet said when going to be married  we go on monday write to florence for the next month                                        to miss browning  florence autumn 1853  my dearest sariannai shall not be able to write very much today for robert is in haste and we are both overwhelmed with different engagements the worst of which have been forced on me maritally rather than artistically by the portraitsittings he of course has told you of his own portrait by mr reade i must be glad about seeing that though it by no means gives his best expression the face is there and it will be the best work extant on the same subject i only wish that the artist had been satisfied with it or taken my penini in the second place instead of me who am not wanted in canvas for arts sake or for any other sake in the world when gone from hence may nobody think of me again except when one or two may think perhaps how i loved them  do you think much of the war i hope all will be done on the part of the two western powers honestly and directly and then may the best that can come out of the worst that must be the poor italians catch like men in an agony at all these floating straws we hear that the new austrian commandant has received instructions to hold no intercourse with members of the english and french legations till further orders are received  we have lived a disturbed life lately too much coming and going even with agreeable people there has been no time for work in rome it must be different or we shall get on poorly with our books i think robert seems however by his account to be in an advanced state already  incomplete                                        to miss i blagden  casa guidi saturday about october 1853  my dearest isa  i was very sorry on returning from lucca to find only mr thompsons note and yours but though we missed him at florence we shall see him at rome i hope there was also a card from miss lynch28 an american poetess one of the ninetyandnine muses with a note of introduction from england do you hear of her at rome the ninth street printed on her card leaves me in the infinite as far as conjectures of where she is go  so pleased i am to get back to florence and so little inclined to tumble out of my nest again yet we shall go to rome if some new obstacle does not arise we have had no glimpse of the tassinaris they seem to have vanished from the scene florence is full of great people so called from england and the real sommités are coming such as alfred tennyson and with an interval dickens and thackeray the two latter go to rome for the winter i understand  do you say edward lytton but he isnt edward lytton nowhe is robert the two edwards clashed inconveniently and now he doesnt sign an edward even by an initial he has renounced the name and is a robert for evermore i am glad to tell you that although he is delicate and excitable there seems to me no tendency to disease of any kind indeed he is looking particularly well just now he is full of sensibility both intellectually and morally which is scarcely favorable to health and long life but in the long run if people can run they get over such a disadvantage at this time he is about to publish a collection of poems i think highly of his capabilities and he is a great favorite with both of us for various excellent reasons did i tell you of his passing a fortnight with us at lucca and how sorry we were to lose him at last sir edward either has just brought out or is bringing out a volume of poems of his own called cornflowers referring to the harvest time of maturity in which he produces them and chiefly of a metaphysical character his son who has seen the manuscript thinks them the best of his poems my novel is certainly excellent did i tell you that i had seized and read it  i shall get at swedenborg in rome and get on with my readings there are deep truths in him i cannot doubt though i cant receive everything which may be my fault i would fain speak with a wise humility we will talk on these things and the spirits how that last subject attracts me it strikes me that we are on the verge of great developments of the spiritual nature and that in a philosophical point of view apart from ulterior ends the facts are worthy of all admiration and meditation if a spiritual influx it is mixedgood and evil together the fact of there being a mixture of evil justifies swedenborgs philosophy does it not without concluding against the movement generally we were at the pergola the other night and heard the trovatore verdis new work very passionate and dramatic surely the storys are here on their way back to rome oh i mean to convert you isa is it true that the fever at rome is still raging give my love to your dear invalid who must be comforting you so much with her improvement penini is in a chronic state of packing up his desk to go to bome roberts love with mine as ever i cant write either legibly or otherwise than stupidly on this detestable paper having never learnt to skate are we giving you too much trouble dearest kind isa  your affectionate friend ebb                                        after a few weeks only at florence the brownings moved on to rome and there at no 43 via bocca di leone they passed the winter both were now actively engaged on their new volumes of poetrymr browning on his men and women mrs browning on aurora leigh both of which were however still far from completion                                        to mrs jameson  via bocca di leone rome december 21 1853  my dearest mona ninai have been longer than i thought to be in rome without writing to you especially when i have a letter of yours for which to thank you my fancy was to wait till i had seen gerardine in her own home and then to write to you but i have called on her three times and the three fates have been at it each time to prevent my getting in still we have met here and i would rather not wait any longer for whatever might be added to what i have seen and know already  ah dearest friend you have heard how our first step into rome was a fall not into a catacomb but a fresh grave29 and how everything here has been slurred and blurred to us and distorted from the grand antique associations i protest to you i doubt whether i shall get over it and whether i ever shall feel that this is rome the first day at the beds head of that convulsed and dying child and the next two three four weeks in great anxiety about his little sister who was all but given up by the physicians the english nurse horribly ill of the same fever and another case in this house it was not only sympathy i was selfishly and intensely frightened for my own treasures i wished myself at the end of the world with robert and penini twenty times a day rome has been very peculiarly unhealthy and i heard a monsignore observe the other morning that there would not be much truce to the fever till march came still i begin to take breath again and be reasonable peninis cheeks are red as apples and if we avoid the sun and the wind and the damp and above all if god takes care of us we shall do excellently i of course am in a flourishing condition walk out nearly every day and scarcely cough at all which isnt enough for me you see dear friend we have not set foot in the vatican oh barbarians  but we have seen mrs kemble and i am as enchanted as i ought to be and even perhaps a little more she has been very kind and gracious to me she was to have spent an evening with us three days since but something intervened i am much impressed by her as well as attracted to her what a voice what eyes what eyelids full of utterance  then we have had various visits from mr thackeray and his daughters she writes to me of thackeray instead of raffael and she is at rome but she isnt at rome theres the sadness of it we got to gibsons studio which is close by and saw his coloured venus i dont like her she has come out of her cloud of the ideal and to my eyes is not too decent then in the long and slender throat in the turn of it and the setting on of the head you have rather a grisette than a goddess tis over pretty and petite the colour adding of course to this effect crawfords studio the american sculptor was far more interesting to me than gibsons by the way mr pages portrait of miss cushman is really something wonderfulsoul and body together you can show nothing like it in england take for granted indeed the american artists consider themselves a little aggrieved when you call it as good as a titian did titian ever produce anything like it said an admirer in my hearing critics wonder whether the colour will stand it is a theory of this artist that time does not tone and that titians pictures were painted as we see them the consequence of which is that his pages pictures are undertoned in the first instance and if they change at all will turn black30 may all boston rather turn black which it may do one of these days by an eruption from the south when uncle tomison gets strong enough  we have been to st peters we have stood in the forum and seen the coliseum penini says the sun has tome out i think god knows i want to go out to walk and so he has sent the sun out theres a child who has faith enough to put us all to shame a vision of angels wouldnt startle him in the least when his poor little friend died and we had to tell him he inquired fixing on me those earnest blue eyes did papa see the angels when they took away joe and when i answered no for i never try to deceive him by picturesque fictions i should not dare i tell him simply what i believe myself then did joe go up by himself in a moment there was a burst of cries and sobs the other day he asked me if i thought joe had seen the dute of wellyton he has a medal of the duke of wellington which put the name into his head bythebye robert yesterday in a burst of national vanity informed the child that this was the man who beat napoleon then i sint he a velly naughty man what he beat napoleon wiz a stit with a stick imagine how i laughed and how robert himself couldnt help laughing so the seraphs judge our glories  if you have seen sir david brewster lately i should like to know whether he has had more experience concerning the tables and has modified his conclusions in any respect i myself am convinced as i can be of any fact that there is an external intelligence the little i have seen is conclusive to me and this makes me more anxious that the subject should be examined with common fairness by learned persons only the learned wont learnthats the worst of them their hands are too full to gather simples it seems to me a new development of law in the human constitution which has worked before in exceptional cases but now works in general  dearest friend i do not speak of your own anxious watch and tender grief but think of them deeply believe that i love you always and in all truth  your ebb                                        to miss ef haworth  rome 43 bocca di leone december 27 1853  my dearest fannyi cant judge of your obstacles of course but as to your being snowed up on the road or otherwise impeded between rome and cività castellana or vecchia theres certainly not room for even a dream of it there has been beautiful weather here ever since we came except for exacting invalids i for instance have been kept in the house for a fortnight or more till christmas day when i was able to get to st peters by tramontana but there has been sun on most days of cold and nothing has been severe as cold the hard weather came in november before we arrived i was out yesterday and may be today perhaps judge ye  you bid me write but to what end if you are here on new years day theres not time for a letter  and at first i intended not to write till beginning to consider how as you are not actually of the race of medes and persians you might possibly so modify your plans as to be able to receive these lines oh a provoking person or persons you are since you and ellen heaton are plural henceforth no i wont include her you are singular by your own confession on this occasion and instead of christmas solemnisations i shall take to reading the commination service over you if you stay any longer at florence because of the impracticable snowedup roads around rome you really might as well object to coming on account of the heat  i thank you very much for meaning to bring my goods for me i wish i could have seen your pictures before they took to themselves golden wings and fled away is it true really that you think to exhibit in london peninis portrait at the piano as sophie eckley tells me i shall like to hear that you succeed in that  i see her every day almost if not quite nobody is like her and there are quantities of people here to choose from i have not taken heart and an evening for reception yet but we have had squeezes of more or less stringency miss ogle is hereand her family of course for she is youngthe author of a lost love that very pretty book and she is natural and pleasing do you know lady oswald and her daughter and son she is lady elgins sisterinlaw and brought a letter to me from lady augusta bruce then the marshalls found us out through mr de vere her cousin and in the name of alfred tennyson their intimate friend mrs marshall was a miss spring rice and is very refined in all senses refinement expresses the whole woman yes there are some nice people herenice people its the word nobody as near to me as mr page whom we often see i am happy to say and who has just presented the world only that is generally said of the lady with a son and is on the point of presenting said world with a venus will you come to see i wonder  i want you here to see a portrait taken of me in chalks by miss fox i said no to her in london which was my sole reason for saying yes to her in rome when she asked me for a patientor victim she draws well and has been very successful with the hair at least for the likeness you shall judge for yourself she comes here for an hour in the morning to execute me and im as well as can be expected under it  may god bless you dearest fanny what christmas wishes warm from the heart by heartfuls i throw at you and say to ellen heaton with cordial love that i thank her much for her kind letter and remember her in all affectionate wishes made for friends i shall write to mr ruskin dont get this letter i say  your ebb  roberts love and peninis if fanny strikes you madame bovary will thunderstrike you                                        to miss mitford  43 via di leone rome january 7 1854  it is long my ever dearest miss mitford since i wrote to you last but since we came to rome we have had troubles out of the deep pit of which i was unwilling to write to you lest the shadows of it should cleave as blots to my pen then one day followed another and one days work was laid on anothers shoulders well we are all well to begin with and have been well our troubles came to us through sympathy entirely a most exquisite journey of eight days we had from florence to rome seeing the great monastery and triple church of assisi and the wonderful terni by the waythat passion of the waters which makes the human heart seem so still in the highest spirits we entered rome robert and penini singing actually for the child was radiant and flushed with the continual change of air and scene and he had an excellent scheme about tissing the popes foot to prevent his taking away mine gun somebody having told him that such dangerous weapons were not allowed by the roman police you remember my telling you of our friends the storyshow they and their two children helped to make the summer go pleasantly at the baths of lucca they had taken an apartment for us in rome so that we arrived in comfort to lighted fires and lamps as if coming home and we had a glimpse of their smiling faces that evening in the morning before breakfast little edith was brought over to us by the manservant with a messagethe boy was in convulsions there was danger we hurried to the house of course leaving edith with wilson too true all that first day was spent beside a deathbed for the child never rallied never opened his eyes in consciousness and by eight in the evening he was gone in the meanwhile edith was taken ill at our housecould not be moved said the physicians we had no room for her but a friend of the storys on the floor immediately belowmr page the artisttook her in and put her to bed gastric fever with a tendency to the brain and within two days her life was almost despaired of exactly the same malady as her brothers also the english nurse was apparently dying at the storys house and emma page the artists youngest daughter sickened with the same symptoms now you will not wonder that after the first absorbing flow of sympathy i fell into a selfish human panic about my child oh i lost my head said robert and if i could have caught him up in my arms and run to the ends of the world the hooting after me of all rome could not have stopped me i wishedhow i wishedfor the wings of a dove or any unclean bird to fly away with him to be at peace but there was no possibility but to stay also the physicians assured me solemnly that there was no contagion possible otherwise i would have at least sent him from us to another house to pass over this dreary time i will tell you at once that the three patients recovered only in poor little ediths case roman fever followed the gastric and has persisted so ever since in periodical recurrence that she is very pale and thin roman fever is not dangerous to lifesimple fever and aguebut it is exhausting if not cut off and the quinine fails sometimes for three or four days now she has been free from the symptoms and we are beginning to hope now you will understand at once what ghastly flakes of death have changed the sense of rome to me the first day by a deathbed the first drive out to the cemetery where poor little joe is laid close to shelleys heart cor cordium says the epitaph and where the mother insisted on going when she and i went out in the carriage together i am horribly weak about such things i cant look on the earthside of death i flinch from corpses and graves and never meet a common funeral without a sort of horror when i look deathwards i look over death and upwards or i cant look that way at all so that it was a struggle with me to sit upright in that carriage in which the poor stricken mother sate so calmlynot to drop from the seat which would have been worse than absurd of me well all this has blackened rome to me i cant think about the cæsars in the old strain of thought the antique words get muddled and blurred with warm dashes of modern everyday tears and fresh graveclay rome is spoiled to metheres the truth still one lives through ones associations when not too strong and i have arrived at almost enjoying some thingsthe climate for instance which though perilous to the general health agrees particularly with me and the sight of the blue sky floating like a seatide through the great gaps and rifts of ruins we read in the papers of a tremendously cold winter in england and elsewhere while i am able on most days to walk out as in an english summer and while we are all forced to take precautions against the sun also robert is well and our child has not dropped a single roseleaf from his radiant cheeks we are very comfortably settled in rooms turned to the sun and do work and play by turnshaving almost too many visitorshear excellent music at mrs sartoriss adelaide kemble once or twice a week and have fanny kemble to come and talk to us with the doors shut we three together this is pleasant i like her decidedly if anybody wants smalltalk by handfuls of glittering dust swept out of salons heres mr thackeray besides and if anybody wants a snowman to match southeys snowwoman see thalaba heres mr lockhart who in complexion hair conversation and manners might have been made out of one of your english driftssixteen feet deep in some places says galignani also heres your friend vmrs archer clive31 we were at her house the other evening she seems goodnatured but what a very peculiar person as to looks and even voice and general bearing and what a peculiar unconsciousness of peculiarity i do not know her much i go out very little in the evening both from fear of the night air and from disinclination to stir mr page our neighbour downstairs pleases me much and you ought to know more of him in england for his portraits are like titiansflesh blood and soul i never saw such portraits from a living hand he professes to have discovered secrets and plainly knows them from his wonderful effects of colour on canvasnot merely in words his portrait of miss cushman is a miracle gibsons famous painted venus is very prettythats my criticism yes i will say besides that i have seldom if ever seen so indecent a statue the colouring with an approximation to flesh tints produces that effect to my apprehension i dont like this statue colouringno not at all dearest miss mitford will you write to me i dont ask for a long letter but a lettera letter and i entreat you not to prepay among other disadvantages that prepaying tendency of yours may lose me a letter one day i want much to hear how you are bearing the winterhow you are give me details about your dear self  the remainder of this letter is missing                                        to mr westwood  43 via bocca di leone rome february 2 1854  thank you my dear mr westwood for your kind defence of me against the stupid blind curdog backbiting of the american writer i will tell you three weeks ago i had a letter from my brother apprising me of what had been said and pressing on me the propriety of a contradiction in form said i in reply when you marry a wife george take her from the class of those who have never printed a book if this thing vexes you a woman in a crowd cant help the pushing up against her of dirty coats happy if somebody in boots does not tread upon her toes words to that effect i said i really could not do the american the honour of sitting down at the table with him to say sir you are considerably mistaken he was not only mistaken you see but so stupid and selfwilled in his mistake so determined to make a system of it but he was too disreputable to set right also of the tendency of ones writings ones readers are the best judges i dont profess to write a religious commentary on my writings i am content to stand by the obvious meaning of what i have written according to the common sense of the general reader  the tendency of my writings to swedenborgianism has been observed by others though i had read swedenborg when i wrote most of them as little as the american editor of robert hall can have done and less cant be certainly otherwise the said editor would have known that the central doctrine of swedenborgianism being the godhead of jesus christ no unitarian liberal or unliberal could have produced works swedenborgian in character and that william and mary howitt being unitarian which i believe they are couldnt have a tendency at the same time to swedenborgianism unless it should be possible for them to be bolt upright with a leaning to the floor i speak to a wise man judge what i say for my own part i have thought freely on most subjects and upon the state of the churches among others but never at any point of my life and now thank god least of all have i felt myself drawn towards unitarian opinions i should throw up revelation altogether if i ceased to recognise christ as divine sectarianism i do not like even in the form of a state church and the athanasian way of stating opinions between a scholastic paradox and a curse is particularly distasteful to me but i hold to christs invisible church as referred to in scripture and to the saviours humanity and divinity as they seem to me conspicuous in scripture and so you have done me justice and the american has done me injustice  well i have seen your mrs brotherton only once though because she cant come to see me at all and lives too far for me to go in the winter weather i shall see more of her presently i hope and in the meantime she is very generous to me and sends me violets and notes that are better and we have a great sympathy on the spiritual subjects which set you so in a passion what do i say she sends me greek of which she does not know a single character written by her or rather through her mystical greek from a spiritworld produced by her hands she herself not knowing what she writes the character is beautifully written and the separate words are generally correctsuch words as christ god tears blood tempest sea thunder calm morning sun joy no grammatical construction hitherto but a significant sort of grouping of the separate words as if the meaning were struggling out into coherence my idea is that she is being exercised in the language in the character in order to fuller expression hereafter well you would have us snowed upon with poppies till we sleep and forget these things i on the contrary would have our eyes wide open our senses all attentive our souls lifted in reverential expectation every fact is a word of god and i call it irreligious to say i will deny this because it displeases me i will look away from that because it will do me harm why be afraid of the truth god is in the truth and he is called also love the evil results of certain experiences of this class result mainly from the superstitions and distorted views held by most people concerning the spiritual world we have to learnwe in the bodythat death does not teach all things death is simply an accident foolish jack smith who died on monday is on tuesday still foolish jack smith if people who on monday scorned his opinions prudently will on tuesday receive his least words as oracles they very naturally may go mad or at least do something as foolish as their inspirer is also it is no argument against any subject that it drives people mad who suffer themselves to be absorbed in it that would be an argument against all religion and all love by your leave ask the commissioners of lunacy knock at the door of madhouses in general and inquire what two causes act almost universally in filling them answerlove and religion the common objection of the degradation of knocking with the leg of the table and the ridicule of the position for a spirit c c i dont enter into at all twice i have been present at tableexperiments and each time i was deeply impressedimpressed theres the word for it the panting and shivering of that dead dumb wood the human emotion conveyed through itby what had to me a greater significance than the st peters of this rome o poet do you not know that poetry is not confined to the clipped alleys no nor to the blue tops of parnassus hill poetry is where we live and have our beingwherever god works and man understands hein  if you are in a dungeon and a friend knocks through the outer wall spelling out by knocks the words you comprehend you dont think the worse of the friend standing in the sun who remembers you he is not degraded by it you rather think now apply this certainly there is a reaction from the materialism of the age and this is certainly well in my mind but then there is something more than this more than a mere human reaction i believe i have not the power of writing myself at all though i have felt the pencil turn in my handa peculiar spiral motion like the turning of the tables and independent of volition but the power is not with me strong enough to make words or letters even  we see a good deal of fanny kemble a noble creature and hear her sister singmrs sartoris do admit a little society it is good for soul and body and on the continent it is easy to get a handful of society without paying too dear for it that i think is an advantage of continental life                                        to miss mitford  43 via bocca di leone rome march 19 1854  my dearest miss mitfordyour letter made my heart ache it is sad sad indeed that you should have had this renewed cold just as you appeared to be rallying a little from previous shocks and i know how depressing and enfeebling a malady the influenza is its the vulture finishing the work of the wolf i pray god that having battled through this last attack you may be gradually strengthened and relieved by the incoming of the spring though an english spring makes one shiver to think of generally and with the summer come out into the garden to sit in a chair and be shone upon dear dear friend i shall be in england then and get down to see you this time and i tenderly hold to the dear hope of seeing you smile again and hearing you talk in the old way  we see a good deal of the kembles here and like them both especially the fanny who is looking magnificent still with her black hair and radiant smile a very noble creature indeed somewhat unelastic unpliant to the eye attached to the old modes of thought and convention but noble in quality and defects i like her much she thinks me credulous and full of dreams but does not despise me for that reason which is good and tolerant of her and pleasant too for i should not be quite easy under her contempt mrs sartoris is genial and generous her milk has had time to stand to cream in her happy family relations the sartoriss house has the best society at rome and exquisite music of course we met lockhart there and my husband sees a good deal of himmore than i do because of the access of cold weather lately which has kept me at home chiefly robert went down to the seaside in a days excursion with him and the sartoriss and i hear found favor in his sight said the critic i like browning he isnt at all like a damned literary man thats a compliment i believe according to your dictionary it made me laugh and think of you directly i am afraid lockharts health is in a bad state he looks very ill and every now and then his strength seems to fail robert has been sitting for his picture to fisher the english artist who painted mr kenyon and landor you remember those pictures in mr kenyons house landors was praised much by southey well he has painted robert and it is an admirable likeness32 the expression is an exceptional expression but highly characteristic it is one of fishers best works now he is about our wiedeman and if he succeeds as well in painting angels as men will do something beautiful with that seraphic face you are to understand that these works are done by the artist for the artist oh we couldnt afford to have such a luxury as a portrait done for us but i am pleased to have a good likeness of each of my treasures extant in the possession of somebody roberts will of course be eminently saleable and wiedemans too perhaps for the beautys sake with those blue farreaching eyes and that innocent angel face emplumed in the golden ringlets somebody told me yesterday that she never had known in a long experience of children so attractive a child he is so full of sweetness and vivacity together of imagination and grace a poetical child really and in the best sense such a piece of innocence and simplicity with it all too a child you couldnt lie to if you tried i had a fit of remorse for telling him the history of jack and the beanstalk when he turned his earnest eyes up to me at the end and said i think if jack went up so high he must have seen god  to see those two works through the press must be a fatigue to you in your present weak state dearest friend and i keep wishing vainly i could be of use to you in the matter of the proof sheets i might you know if i were in england i do some work myself but doubt much whether i shall be ready for the printers by july no indeed it is clear i shall not if robert is it will be well doesnt it surprise you that alexander smith should be already in a third edition i cant make it out for my part i give it up as is my way with riddles he is both too bad and too good to explain this phenomenon which is harder to me than any implied in the turning tables or involuntary writing by the way a lady whom i know here writes greek without knowing or having ever known a single letter of it the unbelievers writhe under it  oh i have been reading poor haydons biography there is tragedy the pain of it one can hardly shake off surely surely wrong was done somewhere when the worst is admitted of haydon for himself looking forward beyond the grave i seem to understand that all things when most bitter worked ultimate good to him for that sublime arrogance of his would have been fatal perhaps to the moral nature if developed further by success but for the nation we had our duties and we should not suffer our teachers and originators to sink thus it is a book written in blood of the heart poor haydon  may god bless you my dear friend i think of you and love you dearly roberts love put to mine and peninis love put to roberts i give away peninis love as i please just now  your ever affectionate ebb  send my bulletins only two lines if you will                                        to miss browning  rome about march 1854  my dearest sariannawe are all well and so is the weather which is diviner we sit with the windows wide open and find it almost too warm and today robert and i have been wandering under the trees of the pincio and looking to the monte marino pine let the best come i dont like rome i never shall and as they have put into the english newspapers that i dont i might as well acknowledge the barbarism very glad i shall be to see you and paris even though my beloved florence shall be left behind dearest sarianna after a short rest at paris we go on to london for the printing of roberts book mine wont be ready till later in the year and for the sight of some dear english faces while the weather shall admit of it before we settle for the winter in france well you will go with us to england wont you the dear nonno33 will spare you to go with us it will do you good and it will do us good certainly  i quite agree with you that theres no situation like the champs elyséesreally there is scarcely anything like it in europe if you put away venicefor a situation in a city  the worst of the champs elysées is that it is out of the way and expensive on the point of carriages when you cant walk far people tell you too that the air is sharper at the end of the avenue yet the sun is so brilliant as to make amends for the disadvantage if it exists then you pay more for houses on account of the concourse of english and what if i object a little to the english besides if i do the desirableness of the pure air and free walking for penini counterbalances them  the thackeray girls have had the scarlatina at naples and have been very desolate i fear without a female servant or friend near them they probably were indisposed towards naples by their own illness which was slight however the scarlet fever is always slight in italy they say and by their fathers more serious attack for i have heard very different accounts of the neapolitan weather still it has been an abnormal winter everywhere and there are cold winds on that coast on certain months of the year always lockhart has gone away with the duke of wellington who was in deep consideration how he should manage his funeral on the road robert was present when the question was mooted on the dukes last evening should he send the body to england or bury it would it be delicate to ask lockhart which he preferred somebody said suppose you were to ask what he would do with your body if you died yourself i am afraid poor lockhart is really in a dangerous state of health and that it would have been better if he had had something tenderer and more considerate than a dukedom travelling with him under his circumstances he called upon us and took a great fancy to robert i understand as being not at all like a damned literary man  penini is overwhelmed with attentions and gifts of all kinds and generally acknowledged as the king of the children here mrs page the wife of the distinguished american artist gave a party in honor of him the other day there was an immense cake inscribed penini in sugar and he sat at the head of the table and did the honors you never saw a child so changed in point of shyness he will go anywhere with anybody and talk and want none of us to back him wilson is only instructed not to come till it is velly late to fetch him away he talks to fanny kemble who dashes most people i not aflaid of nossing says he in his eloquent english mr fishers cartoon of him is very pretty but doesnt do him justice in the delicacy of the lower part of the face yet i cant complain of mr fisher after the admirable likeness he has painted of robert it is really satisfying to me you will see it in london oh how cruel it is that we cant buy it sarianna i have a sort of hope that mr kenyon maybut zitto zitto34 arabel will be very grateful to you for the drawings  endorsed by miss browning part of a letter                                        the plans thus confidently spoken of for a visit to paris and london in the summer of this year did not attain fulfilment the brownings left rome for florence about the end of may intending to stay there only a few weeks but their arrangements were altered by letters received from england and ultimately they remained in florence until the summer of the following year whether for this reason or because the poems were not after all ready for press the printing of mr brownings new volumes men and women was also postponed and they did not appear until 1855 while aurora leigh was still a long way from completion                                        to miss mitford  rome may 10 1854  my ever dearest miss mitfordyour letter pained me to a degree which i will not pain you by expressing farther now i do not write to press for another letter on the contrary i entreat you not to attempt to write a word to me with your own hand until you can do so without effort and suffering in the meanwhile would it be impossible for k to send me in one line some account of you i dont mean to tease but i should be very glad and thankful to have news of you though in the briefest manner and if a letter were addressed to me at poste restante florence it would reach me as we rest there on our road to paris and london in any case i shall see you this summer if it shall please god and stay with you the half hour you allow and kiss your dear hands and feel again i hope the brightness of your smile as the green summer comes on you must be the better surely if you can bear to lie out under the trees the general health will rally and the local injury correct itself you must have a strong energetic vitality and after all spinal disorders do not usually attack life though they disable and overthrow the pain you endure is the terrible thing has a local application of chloroform been ever tried i catch at straws perhaps with my unlearned hands but its the instinct of affection while you suffer my dear friend the world is applauding you i catch sight of stray advertisements and fragmentary notices of atherton which seems to have been received everywhere with deserved claps of hands this will not be comfort to you perhaps but you will feel the satisfaction which every workman feels in successful work i think the edition of plays and poems has not yet appeared and i suppose there will be nothing in that which can be new to us atherton i thirst for but the cup will be dry i dare say till i get to england for new books even at florence take waiting for far beyond all necessary bounds we shall not stay long in tuscany we want to be in england late in june or very early in july and some days belong to paris as we pass since roberts family are resident there to leave rome will fill me with barbarian complacency i dont pretend to have a rag of sentiment about rome its a palimpsest romea wateringplace written over the antiqueand i havent taken to it as a poet should i suppose only let us speak the truth above all things i am strongly a creature of association and the associations of the place have not been personally favorable to me among the rest my child the light of my eyes has been more unwell lately than i ever saw him in his life and we were forced three times to call in a physician the malady was not serious it was just the result of the climate relaxation of the stomach c but the end is that he is looking a delicate pale little creature he who was radiant with all the roses and stars of infancy but two months ago the pleasantest days in rome we have spent with the kemblesthe two sisterswho are charming and excellent both of them in different ways and certainly they have given us some exquisite hours on the campagna upon picnic excursions they and certain of their friendsfor instance m ampère the member of the french institute who is witty and agreeable m gorze the austrian minister also an agreeable man and mr lyons the son of sir edmund c the talk was almost too brilliant for the sentiment of the scenery but it harmonised entirely with the mayonnaise and champagne i should mention too miss hosmer but she is better than a talker the young american sculptress who is a great pet of mine and of roberts and who emancipates the eccentric life of a perfectly emancipated female from all shadow of blame by the purity of hers she lives here all alone at twentytwo dines and breakfasts at the cafés precisely as a young man would works from six oclock in the morning till night as a great artist must and this with an absence of pretension and simplicity of manners which accord rather with the childish dimples in her rosy cheeks than with her broad forehead and high aims the archer clives have been to naples but have returned for a time mr lockhart who went to england with the duke of wellington the same prepared to bury him on the road writes to mrs sartoris that he has grown much better under the influence of the native beef and beer to do him justice he looked when here innocent of the recollection even of either i wonder if you have seen mrs howes poems lately out called passion flowers they were sent to me by an american friend but were intercepted en route so that i have not set eyes on them yet but one or two persons not particularly reliable as critics have praised them to me she is the wife of dr howe the deaf and dumb philanthropist and herself neither deaf nor dumb very much the contrary i understanda handsome woman and brilliant in society i gossip on to you dearest dear miss mitford as if you were in gossiping humour believe that my tender thoughts deeper than any said are with you always  roberts love with that of your attached ba  we go on the 22nd of this month you have seen mr chorleys book i daresay which i should like much to see                                        to miss browning  casa guidi thursday end of may 1854  my dearest sariannai am delighted to say that we have arrived and see our dear florence the queen of italy after all on the road i said to penini make a poem about florence without a moments hesitation he began florence is more pretty of all florence is a beauty florence was born first and then rome was born and paris was born after penini is always en verve hes always ready to make a poem on any subject and doesnt ask you to wait while he clears his voice the darling will soon get over the effect of that poisonous roman air i do trust though it is humiliating to hear our florentines wailing over the loss of bloom and dimples it doesnt console me that his amount of growth is properly acknowledged well good milk and good air will do their work in a little time with gods blessing and a most voracious appetite is developed already i am glad to say even in the journey he revived the blue marks under the darling eyes fading gradually away and now he looks decidedly better though unlike himself of two months ago you are to understand that the child is perfectly well and that the delicate look is traceable distinctly and only to the attacks he had in rome during the last few weeks throughout the winter he was radiant as i used to tell you and the confessed king of the whole host of his contemporaries and countrybabies  the kembles were our gain in rome i appreciate and admire both of them they fail in nothing as you see them nearer noble and upright women whose social brilliancy is their least distinction mrs sartoris is the more tender and tolerant the more loveable and sympathetical perhaps to me i should like you to know them both then there is that dear mr page yes and harriet hosmer the young american sculptress who is an immense favorite with us both  a comfort is that robert is considered here to be looking better than he ever was known to look and this notwithstanding the greyness of his beard which indeed is in my own mind very becoming to him the argentine touch giving a character of elevation and thought to the whole physiognomy this greyness was suddenly developed let me tell you how he was in a state of bilious irritability on the morning of his arrival in rome from exposure to the sun or some such cause and in a fit of suicidal impatience shaved away his whole beard whiskers and all i cried when i saw him i was so horrorstruck i might have gone into hysterics and still been reasonable for no human being was ever so disfigured by so simple an act of course i said when i recovered breath and voice that everything was at an end between him and me if he didnt let it all grow again directly and upon the further advice of his lookingglass he yielded the point and the beard grew but it grew white which was the just punishment of the godsour sins leave their traces  well poor darling robert wont shock you after all you cant choose but be satisfied with his looks m de monclar swore to me that he was not changed for the intermediate years  robert talks of money of waiting for that among other hindrances to setting out directly not my fault be certain sarianna we seem to have a prospect of letting our house for a year which if the thing happens will give us a lift  we spent yesterday evening with lytton at his villa meeting there mr and mrs walpole frederick tennyson and young norton mrs nortons son who married the capri girl she was not present i am sorry to say we walked home to the song of nightingales by starlight and fireflylight florence looks to us more beautiful than ever after rome i love the very stones of it to say nothing of the cypresses and river  robert says are you nearly done i am done give peninis love and mine to the dear nonno and tell him and yourself dear how delighted we shall be to have you both you are prepared to go to england i hope by the way the weather there is said to be murderous through bitter winds but it must soften as the season advances may god bless you i am yours in truest love  ba  we had a very pleasant vettura journey robert will have told you                                        to miss mitford  florence june 6 1854  yes dearest friend i had your few lines which arabel sent to me i had them on the very day i had posted my letter to you and i need not say how deeply it moved me that you should have thought of giving me that pleasure of mr ruskins kind word at the expense of what i knew to be so much pain to yourself  we mean to stay at florence a week or two longer and then go northward i love florence the place looks exquisitely beautiful in its gardenground of vineyards and olive trees sung round by the nightingales day and night nay sung into by the nightingales for as you walk along the streets in the evening the song trickles down into them till you stop to listen such nights we have between starlight and fireflylight and the nightingales singing i would willingly stay here if it were not that we are constrained by duty and love to go and at some day not distant i daresay we shall come back for good and all as people say seeing that if you take one thing with another there is no place in the world like florence i am persuaded for a place to live in cheap tranquil cheerful beautiful within the limit of civilisation yet out of the crush of it i have not seen the trollopes yet but we have spent two delicious evenings at villas on the outside the gates one with young lytton sir edwards son of whom i have told you i think i like him we both do from the bottom of our hearts then our friend frederick tennyson the new poet we are delighted to see again have you caught sight of his poems if you have tell me your thought mrs howes i have read since i wrote last some of them are goodmany of the thoughts striking and all of a certain elevation of poetry however strictly speaking there is not much and theres a large proportion of conventional stuff in the volume she must be a clever woman of the ordinary impotencies and prettinesses of female poets she does not partake but she cant take rank with poets in the good meaning of the word i think so as to stand without leaning also there is some bad taste and affectation in the dressing of her personality i dare say mr fields will bring you her book talking of american literature with the publishers on the back of it we think of offering the proofs of our new works to any publisher over the water who will pay us properly for the advantage of bringing out a volume in america simultaneously with the publication in england we have heard that such a proposal will be acceptable and mean to try it the words you sent to me from mr ruskin gave me great pleasure indeed as how should they not from such a man i like him personally too besides my admiration for him as a writer and i was deeply gratified in every way to have his approbation his seven lamps i have not read yet books come out slowly to italy its our disadvantage as you know ruskin and art go together i must tell you how rome made me some amends after all page the american artist painted a picture of robert like an italian and then presented it to me like a prince it is a wonderful picture the colouring so absolutely venetian that artists cant for the most part keep their temper when they look at it and the breath of the likeness is literal35 mr page has secrets in the artcertainly nobody else paints like himand his nature i must say is equal to his genius and worthy of it dearest miss mitford the athenæum is always as frigid as mont blanc it cant be expected to grow warmer for looking over your green valleys and still waters it wouldnt be alpine if it did they think it a point of duty in that journal to shake hands with one finger i dare say when mr chorley sits down to write an article he puts his feet in cold water as a preliminary still i oughtnt to be impertinent he has been very goodnatured to me and it isnt his fault if im not poet laureate at this writing and engaged in cursing the czar in pindarics very prettily atherton meanwhile wants nobody to praise it i am sure how glad i shall be to seize and read it and how i thank you for the gift may god bless and keep you i may hear again if you write soon to florence but dont pain yourself for the world i entreat you i shall see you before long i think  your ever affectionate ebb  roberts love                                        to miss mitford  florence july 20 1854  my dearest miss mitfordi this moment receive your little note it makes me very sad and apprehensive about you and i would give all this bright sunshine for weeks for one explanatory word which might make me more easy arabel speaks of receiving your booksi suppose athertonand of having heard from yourself a very bad account of your state of health are you worse my beloved friend i have been waiting to hear the solution of our own plans dependent upon letters from england in order to write to you and when i found our journey to london was definitively rendered impossible till next spring i deferred writing yet again it was so painful to me to say to you that our meeting could not take place this year now i receive your little note and write at once to say how sad that makes me it is the first time that the expression of your love my beloved friend has made me sad and i start as from an omen on the other hand the character you write in is so firm and like yourself that i do hope and trust you are not sensibly worse let me hear by a word if possible that the change of weather has done you some little good i understand there has scarcely been any summer in england and this must necessarily have been adverse to you a gleam of fine weather would revive you by gods help oh that i could look in your face and say god bless you as i feel it may god bless you my dear dear friend  our reason for not going to england has not been from caprice but a cross in money matters a ship was to have brought us in something and brought us in nothing instead with a discount the consequence of which is that we are transfixed at florence and unable even to fly to the mountains as a refuge from the summer heat it has been a great disappointment to us all and to our respective families my poor darling arabel especially but we can only be patient and i take comfort in the obvious fact that my penini is quite well and almost as rosy as ever in spite of the excessive florence heat one of the worst thoughts i have is about you i had longed so to see you this summer and had calculated with such certainty upon doing so i would have gone to england for that single reason if i could but i cant we cant stir really that we should be able to sit quietly still at florence and eat our bread and maccaroni is the utmost of our possibilities this summer  mrs trollope has gone to the baths of lucca and thus i have not seen her she will be very interested about you of course how many hang their hearts upon your sickbed dearest miss mitford yes and their prayers too  the other day by an accident an old number of the athenæum fell into my hands and i read for the second time mr chorleys criticism upon atherton it is evidently written in a hurried manner and is quite inadequate as a notice of the book but do you know i am of opinion that if you considered it more closely you would lose your impression of its being depreciatory and cold he says that the only fault of the work is its shortness a rare piece of praise to be given to a work nowadays you see your reputation is at the height neither he nor another could help you such books as yours make their own way the athenæum doesnt give full critiques of dickens for instance and it is arctical in general temperature i thought i would say this to you certainly i do know that mr chorley highly regards you in every capacityas writer and as womanand in the manner in which he named you to me in his last letter there was no chill of sentiment nor recoil of opinion so do not admit a doubt of him he is a sure and affectionate friend and absolutely highminded and reliable of an intact and even chivalrous delicacy i say it lest you might have need of him and be scrupulous from your late feeling about making him useful it is horrible to doubt of ones friends oh i know that and would save you from it  we had a letter from paris two days ago from one of the noblest and most intellectual men in the country m milsand a writer in the deux mondes he complains of a stagnation in the imaginative literature but adds that he is consoled for everything by the state of politics your napoleon is doing you credit his very enemies must confess  as for me i cant write today your little precious melancholy note hangs round the neck of my heart like a stone arabel simply says she is afraid from what you have written to her that you must be very ill she does not tell me what you wrote to herperhaps for fear of paining meand now i am pained by the silence beyond measure  roberts love and warmest wishes for you he appreciates your kind word to him and i what am i to say i love you from a very sad and grateful heart looking backwards and forwardsand upwards to pray gods love down on you  your ever affectionate ebb rather ba  precious the books will be to me i hope not to wait to read them till they reach me as there is a bookseller here who will be sure to have them thank you thank you                                        to miss mitford  florence september 4 1854  five minutes do not pass my beloved friend since reading this dear letter which has wrung from me tender and sorrowful tears and answering it thus pray for you i do not wait that you should bid me may the divine love in the face of our lord jesus christ shine upon you day and night and make all our human loves strike you as cold and dull in comparison with that ineffable tenderness as to wandering prayers i cannot believe that it is of consequence whether this poor breath of ours wanders or does not wander if we have strength to throw ourselves upon him for everything for prayer as well as for the ends of prayer it is enough and he will prove it to be enough presently i have been when i could not pray at all and then gods face seemed so close upon me that there was no need of prayer any more than if i were near you as i yearn to be as i ought to be there would be need for this letter oh be sure that he means well by us by what we suffer and it is when we suffer that he often makes the meaning clearer you know how that brilliant witty true poet heine who was an atheist as much as a man can pretend to be has made a public profession of a change of opinion which was pathetic to my eyes and heart the other day as i read it he has joined no church but simply to use his own words has returned home to god like the prodigal son after a long tending of the swine it is delightful to go home to god even after a tending of the sheep poor heine has lived a sort of living death for years quite deprived of his limbs and suffering tortures to boot i understand it is not because we are brought low that we must die my dearest friend i hopei do not say hope for you so much as for me and for the many who hang their hearts on your lifei hope that you may survive all these terrible sufferings and weaknesses and i take my comfort from your letter from the firmness and beauty of the manuscript i who know how weak hands will shudder and reel along the paper surely there is strength for more life in that hand now i stoop to kiss it in my thought feel my kiss on the dear hand dear dear friend  a previous letter of yours pained me much because i seemed to have given you the painful trouble in it of describing your state your weakness ah i knew what that state was and it was therefore that the slip of paper which came with atherton seemed to me so ominous by the way i shall see atherton before long i dare say the german library in our street is to have a box of new books almost directly and in it surely must be atherton and you shall hear my thoughts of the book as soon as i catch sight of it then you have sent me the dramas thank you thank you they will be precious i saw the article in the athenæum with joy and triumph and knew mr chorley by the roman hand in the illustrated news also robert not i read an enthusiastic notice he fell upon it at the readingroom where i never go on account of my shedom women in florence being supposed not  part of this letter is missing  think of me who am far yet near in love and thought love me with that strong heart of yours may god bless it bless it  i am ever your attached ebb rather ba  i have had a sad letter from poor haydons daughter she has fiftysix pounds a year and can scarcely live on it in england and inquires if she could live in any family in florence i fear to recommend her to come so far on such means roberts love may god bless you and keep you love me                                        to miss mitford  florence october 19 1854  i will try not to be overjoyed my dear dearest miss mitford but indeed it is difficult to refrain from catching at hope with both hands if the general health will but rally there is nothing fatal about a spine disease may god bless you give you the best blessing in earth and heaven as the god of the living in both places we ought not to be selfish nor stupid so as to be afraid of leaving you in his hands what is beautiful and joyful to observe is the patience and selfpossession with which you endure even the most painful manifestation of his will and that while you lose none of that interest in the things of our mortal life which is characteristic of your sympathetic nature you are content just as if you felt none to let the world go according to the decision of god may you be more and more confirmed and elevated and at restbeing the lords whether absent from the body or present in it for my own part i have been long convinced that what we call death is a mere incident in lifeperhaps scarcely a greater one than the occurrence of puberty or the revolution which comes with any new emotion or influx of new knowledge i am heterodox about sepulchres and believe that no part of us will ever lie in a grave i dont think much of my nailparingsdo younot even of the nail of my thumb when i cut off what penini calls the giftmark on it i believe that the body of flesh is a mere husk which drops off at death while the spiritual body see st paul emerges in glorious resurrection at once swedenborg says some persons do not immediately realise that they have passed death and this seems to me highly probable it is curious that maurice mr kingsleys friend about whom so much lately has been written and quarrelled and who has made certain great mistakes i think takes this precise view of the resurrection with an apparent unconsciousness of what swedenborg has stated upon the subject and that i too long before i knew swedenborg or heard the name of maurice came to the same conclusions i wonder if mr kingsley agrees with us i dare say he does upon the wholefor the ordinary doctrine seems to me as little taught by scripture as it can be reconciled with philosophical probabilities i believe in an active human life beyond death as before it an uninterrupted human life i believe in no waiting in the grave and in no vague effluence of spirit in a formless vapour but youll be tired with what i believe  i have been to the other side of florence to call on mrs trollope on purpose that i might talk to her of you but she was not at home though she has returned from the baths of lucca from what i hear she appears to be well and has recommenced her public mornings which we shrink away from she receives every saturday morning in the most heterogeneous way possible it must be amusing to anybody not overwhelmed by it and people say that she snatches up characters for her so many volumes a year out of the diversities of masks presented to her on these occasions oh our florence in vain do i cry out for atherton the most active circulating library hasnt got it yet they say i must still wait meanwhile of course i am delighted with all your successes and your books wont spoil by keeping like certain other books so i may wait  how young children unfold like flowers and how pleasant it is to watch them i congratulate you upon yoursyour babygirl must be a dear forward little thing but i wish i could show you my penini with his drooping golden ringlets and seraphic smile and his talk about angelsyou would like him i know your girlbaby has avenged my name for me and now if you heard my penini say in the midst of a coaxing fito my sweetest little mama my darling dearlest little ba you would admit that ba must have a music in it to my ears at least the love of two generations is poured out to me in that nameand the stream seems to run in one instance when alas the fountain is dry i do not refer to the dead who live still  ah dearest friend you feel how i must have felt about the accident in wimpole street36 i can scarcely talk to you about it there will be permanent lameness arabel says according to the medical opinion though the general health was not for a moment affected but permanent lameness that is sad for a person of active habits i ventured to write a little notewhich was not returned i thank godor read i dare say but of course there was no result i never even expected it as matters have been i must tell you that our pecuniary affairs are promising better results for next year and that we shall not in all probability be tied up from going to england for the restif i understand youoh no my husband has a family likeness to lucifer in being proud besides its not necessary when literary people are treated in england as in some other countries in that case and that time we may come in for our share in the pensions given by the people without holding out our hands now think of carlyleunpensioned why if we sate here in rags we wouldnt press in for an obolus before belisarius mrs sartoris has been here on her way to rome spending most of her time with ussinging passionately and talking eloquently she is really charming may god bless and keep you and love you beloved friend love your own affectionate  ba  may it be roberts love                                        to miss browning  florence november 11 1854 postmark  my dearest sariannai shall be writing my good deeds in water today with this mere pretence at inks37 we are all well though it is much too cold for mea horrible tramontana which would create a cough under the ribs of death and sets me coughing a little in the morning i am afraid its to be a hard winter again this yearor harder than last years we began fires on the last day of october after the most splendid stretch of spring summer and autumn i ever remember we have translated our room into wintersent off the piano towards the windows and packed tables chairs and sofas as near to the hearth as possible  what a time of anxiety this war time is38 i do thank god that we have no reasons for its being a personal agony through having anyone very precious at the post of danger i have two first cousins there a hedley and paget butler sir thomass son i understand that the gloom in england from the actual bereavements is great that the frequency of deep mourning strikes the eye that even the shops are filled chiefly with black and that it has become a sort of mode to wear black or grey without family losses and from the mere force of sympathy  my poor father is still unable to stir from the house and he has been unwell through a bilious attack the consequence of want of exercise nothing can induce him to go out in a carriage because he never did in his life drive out for mere amusement he says theres what mr kenyon calls the barrett obstinacy and it makes me uneasy as to the effect of it in this instance upon the general health of the patient poor darling arabel seems to me much out of spiritsout of humour she calls it dear thingoppressed by the gloom of the house and looking back yearningly to the time when she had sisters to talk to oh sarianna i wish we were all together to have a good gossip or groaning with a laugh at the end  your ever affectionate sister ba                                        to mrs martin  florence november 1854  my dearest mrs martinyou make me wait and i make you wait for letters it is bad of us bothand remember worse of you seeing that you left two long letters of mine unanswered for months i felt as if i had fallen down an oubliette and i was about to utter the loud shrieks befitting the occasion when you wrote at last dont treat me so another time i want to know your plans for the winter since the winter is upon us next summer if it pleases god we shall certainly meet somewheresay paris say london we shall have money for it which we had not this year and now the disappointments over i dont care the heat at florence was very bearable and our child grew into his roses lost at rome and we have lived a very tranquil and happy six months on our own sofas and chairs among our own nightingales and fireflies theres an inclination in me to turn round with my penini and say im an italian certainly both light and love seem stronger with me at florence than elsewhere  the war the alliance is the consolation the necessity is the justification for the rest one shuts ones eyes and earsthe rest is too horrible what do you mean by fearing that the war itself may not be all the evil of the war i expect on the contrary a freer political atmosphere after this thunder louis napoleon is behaving very tolerably well wont you admit after all and i dont look to a treason at the end as certain of his enemies do who are reduced to a wait wait and youll see theres a friend of mine here a traditional antigallican and very lively in his politics until the last few months he cant speak now or lift up his eyelids and i am too magnanimous in opposition to talk of anything else in his presence except verdis last opera which magnanimity he appreciates though he has no ear about a month ago he came suddenly to life again have you heard the news napoleon is suspected of making a secret treaty with russia the next morning he was as dead as everpoor man its a desperate case for him  are you not happyyouin this fast union between england and france some of our english friends coming to italy through france say that the general feeling towards england and the affectionate greetings and sympathies lavished upon them as englishmen by the french everywhere are quite strange and touching in two or three years said a frenchman on a railroad french and english we shall make only one nation are you very curious about the subject of gossip just now between lord palmerston and louis napoleon we hear from somebody in paris whose métier it is to know everything that it refers to the readjustment of affairs in italy may god grant it the italians have been hanging their whole hopes weight upon louis napoleon ever since he came to power and if he does now what he can for them i shall be proud of my protégéoh and so glad robert and i clapped our hands yesterday when we heard this we couldnt refrain though our informant was reactionary and in a deep state of conservative melancholy awful things were to be expected about italy quotha  now do be good and write and tell me what your plans are for the winter we shall remain here till may and then if god pleases go northto paris and london robert and i are at work on our books i have taken to asss milk to counteract the tramontana and he is in the twentyfirst and i in the twentysecond volume of alexandre dumass memoirs the book is un peu hasardé occasionally as might be expected but extremely interesting and i really must recommend it to your attention for the winter if you dont know it already  we have seen a good deal of mrs sartoris lately on her way to rome adelaide kembleeloquent in talk and song a most brilliant woman and noble she must be saddened since then poor thing by her fathers death tell me if it is true that harriet martineau has seceded again from her atheism we heard so the other day dearest mrs martin do write to me and do both of you remember me and think of both of us kindly with roberts true regards  i am your as ever affectionate ba  tell me dear mr martins mind upon politicsin the austrian and prussian question for instance we have no fears in spite of dr cumming and the prophets generally of ultimate results                                        to miss mitford  florence december 11 1854  i should have written long ago my dearest miss mitford to try to say half the pleasure and gratitude your letter made for me but i have been worried and anxious about the illnesses not exactly in my family but nearly as touching to me and hanging upon posts from england in a painful way inevitable to these great distances  i understand that literature is going on flaggingly in england just now on account of nobody caring to read anything but telegraphic messages so thackeray told somebody only he might refer chiefly to the fortunes of the newcomes who are not strong enough to resist the czar the book is said to be defective in story certainly the subject of the war is very absorbing we are all here in a state of tremblement about it dr harding has a son at sebastopol who has had already three horses killed under him what hideous carnage the allies are plainly numerically too weak and the two governments are much blamed for not reinforcing long ago i am discontented about austria i dont like handshaking with austria i would rather be picking her pocket of her italian provinces and while upon such civil terms how can we yet somebody who professes to know everything told somebody at paris who professes to tell everything that louis napoleon and lord palmerston talked much the other day about what is to be done for italy and here in italy we have long been all opening our mouths like so many young thrushes in a nest expecting some worme small from your emperor now if theres an austrian alliance instead  do you hear from mr kingsley and if so how is his wife i am reading now mrs stowes sunny memories and like the naturalness and simplicity of the book much in spite of the provincialism of the tone of mind and education and the really wretched writing its quite wonderful that a woman who has written a book to make the world ring should write so abominably  do you hear often from mr chorley mr kenyon complains of never seeing him he seems to have withdrawn a good deal perhaps into closer occupations who knows aubrey de vere told a friend of ours in paris the other day that mr patmore was engaged on a poem which was to be the love poem of the age parts of which he aubrey de vere had seen last week i was vexed by the sight of mrs trollopes card brought in because we were at dinner i should have liked to have seen her for the sake of the opportunity of talking of you  do you know the engravings in the story without an end the picture of the child is just my penini some one was observing it the other day and i thought i would tell you that you might image him to yourself think of his sobbing and screaming lately because of the evangelist john being sent to patmos just like poor robinson crusoe said he i scarcely knew whether to laugh or cry i was so astonished at this crisis of emotion  roberts love will be put in may god bless you and keep you and love you better than we all  your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs martin  casa guidi february 13 1855  my dearest mrs martinhow am i to thank you for this most beautiful shawl looking fresh from galateas flocks and woven by something finer than her fingers you are too good and kind and i shall wrap myself in this piece of affectionateness on your part with very pleasant feelings thank you thank you i only wish i could have seen you though more or less dimly it would have been a satisfaction in the face of your friend who was so kind as to bring the parcel to me but i have been very unwell and was actually in bed when he called unwell with the worst attack on the chest i ever suffered from in italy oh i should have written to you long since if it had not been for this for a month past or more i have been ill now indeed i consider myself convalescent the exhausting cough and night fever are gone i may say the pulse quiet and though considerably weakened and pulled down that will be gradually remedied as long as this genial mildness of the weather lasts you were quite right in supposing us struck here by the cold of which you complained even at pau not only here but at pisa there has been snow and frost together with a bitter wind which my precaution of keeping steadily to two rooms opening one into another could not defend me from my poor robert has been horribly vexed about me of course and indeed suffered physically at one time through sleepless nights diversified by such pastimes as keeping fires alight and warming coffee c c except for loves sake it wouldnt be worth while to live on at the expense of doing so much harm but you neednt exhorti dont give it up i mean to live on and be well  in the meantime in generous exchange for your miraculous shawl i send you back sixpence worth of rhymes they were written for arabels ragged school bazaar last spring she wanted our names and would not be worth your accepting but for the fact of their not being purchaseable anywhere39 a few copies were sent out to us lately half i draw back my hand as i give you this little pamphlet because i seem to hear dear mr martins sardonic laughter at my phrase about the czar if she wink c well i dont generally sympathise with the boasting mania of my countrymen but its so much in the blood that even with me it exceeds now and then you observe ask him to be as gentle with me as possible  oh the east the east my husband has been almost frantic on the subject we may all cover our heads and be humble40 verily we have sinned deeply as to ministers that there is blame i do not doubt the aberdeen element has done its worst but our misfortune is that nobody is responsible and that if you tear up mr soandso and lord soandso limb from limb as a mild politician recommended the other day you probably would do a gross injustice against very wellmeaning persons its the system the system which is all one gangrene the most corrupt system in europe is it not here is my comfort apart from the dreadful amount of individual suffering which cries out against us to heaven and earth this adversity may teach us much this shock which has struck to the heart of england may awaken us much and this humiliation will altogether be good for us we have stood too long on a pedestal talking of our moral superiority our political superiority and all our other superiorities which i have long been sick of hearing recounted heres an inferiority proved let us understand it and remedy it and not talk talk any more  part of this letter has been cut out  we heard yesterday from the editor of the examiner mr forster who expects some terrible consequence of present circumstances in england as far as i can understand the alliance with france is full of consolation there seems to be a real heartunion between the peoples what a grand thing the napoleon loan is it has struck the english with admiration  i heard too among other english news that walter savage landor who has just kept his eightieth birthday and is as young and impetuous as ever has caught the whooping cough by way of an illustrative accident kinglake eothen came home from the crimea where he went out and fought as an amateur with fever which has left one lung diseased he is better however  dearest mrs martin dearest friends be both of you well and strong shall we not meet in paris this early summer  may god bless you your ever affectionate  ba                                        to mrs jameson  florence february 24 1855  the devil say charitable souls is not as bad as he is painted and even i dearest mona nina am better than i seem in the first place let me make haste to say that i never received the letter you sent me to rome with the information of your family affliction and that if i had it could never have remained an unnoticed letter i am not so untender so unsympathising not so brutallet us speak out i lost several letters in rome besides a good deal of illusion i did not like rome i think i confessed to you in the second place when your last letter reached mei mean the letter in which you told me to write to you directlyi would have written directly but was so very unwell that you would not have wished me even to try if absent in the flesh you had been present in spirit i have had a severe attack on the chestthe worst i ever had in italythe consequence of exceptionally severe weatherbitter wind and frost togetherwhich quite broke me up with cough and fever at night now i am well again only of course much weakened and grown thin i mean to get fat again upon cods liver oil in order to appear in england with some degree of decency you know im a lineal descendant of the white cat and have seven lives accordingly also i have a trick of falling from sixstorey windows upon my feet in the manner of the traditions of my race not only i die hard but i can hardly die half of it would kill me said an admiring friend the other day what strength you must have a questionable advantage except that i have alsoa robert and a penini  dearest friend i dont know how to tell you of our fullness of sympathy in your late trials41 from a word which reached us from england the other day there will be i do trust some effectual arrangement to relieve your friends from their anxieties about you then there should be an increase of the government pension by another hundred that is certain only the should be lies so far out of sight in the ideal that nobody in his senses should calculate on its occurrence as to law its different from rightparticularly in england perhapsand appeals to law are disastrous when they cannot be counted on as victorious always and certainly therefore you may be wise in abstaining you have considered sufficiently of course i only hope you are not trammelled in any degree by motives of delicacy which would be preposterous under the actual circumstances you meantime are as nobly laborious as ever we have caught hold of fragments in the newspapers from your commonplace book which made us wish for more and mr kenyon told me of a kind mention of robert which was very pleasant to me  how will it be shall you be likely to come to italy before we set out to the norththat is before the middle of mayor shall we cross on the road like our letters or shall we catch you in london or in paris at least oh you wont miss the exhibition in paris that seems certain  i know florence nightingale slightly she came to see me when we were in london last and i remember her face and her graceful manner and the flowers she sent me after afterwards i honor her from my heart she is an earnest noble woman and has fulfilled her womans duty where many men have failed  at the same time i confess myself to be at a loss to see any new position for the sex or the most imperfect solution of the womans question in this step of hers if a movement at all it is retrograde a revival of old virtues since the siege of troy and earlier we have had princesses binding wounds with their hands its strictly the womans part and men understand it so as you will perceive by the general adhesion and approbation on this late occasion of the masculine dignities every man is on his knees before ladies carrying lint calling them angelic shes whereas if they stir an inch as thinkers or artists from the beaten line involving more good to general humanity than is involved in lint the very same men would curse the impudence of the very same women and stop there i cant see on what ground you think you see here the least gain to the womans question so called its rather the contrary to my mind and any way the women of england must give the precedence to the soeurs de charité who have magnificently won it in all matters of this kind for my own part and apart from the exceptional miseries of the war i acknowledge to you that i do not consider the best use to which we can put a gifted and accomplished woman is to make her a hospital nurse if it is why then woe to us all who are artists the womans question is at an end the mens noes carry it for the future i hope you will know your place and keep clear of raffaelle and criticism and i shall expect to hear of you as an organiser of the gruel department in the hospital at greenwich that is if you have the luck to percer and distinguish yourself  oh the crimea how dismal how full of despair and horror the results will however be good if we are induced to come down from the english pedestal in europe of incessant selfglorification and learn that our close stifling corrupt system gives no air nor scope for healthy and effective organisation anywhere we are oligarchic in all things from our parliament to our army individual interests are admitted as obstacles to the general prosperity this plague runs through all things with us it accounts for the fact that according to the last marriage statistics thirty per cent of the male population signed with the mark only it accounts for the fact that london is at once the largest and ugliest city in europe for the rest if we cannot fight righteous and necessary battles we must leave our place as a nation and be satisfied with making pins write to me but dont pay your letters dear dear friend and i will tell you why through some slip somewhere we have had to pay your two last letters just the same so dont try it any more do you think we grudge postage from you tell me if it is true that harriet martineau is very ill what do you hear of her  may god bless you with roberts true love  your ever affectionate ba                                        the following letter is the first of a few addressed to mr ruskin which have been made available through the kindness of mrs arthur severn the acquaintanceship with mr ruskin dated from the visit of the brownings to england in 1852 see vol ii p 87 above but the occasion of the present correspondence was the recent death of miss mitford which took place on january 10 1855 mr ruskin had shown much kindness to her during her later years and after her death had written to mrs browning to tell her of the closing scenes of her friends life                                        to mr ruskin  florence march 17 1855  i have your letter dear mr ruskin the proof is the pleasure it has given meyes and given my husband which is better when has a letter given me so much pleasure he exclaimed after reading it will you write i thank you muchmuch for thinking of it and i shall be thankful of anything you can tell me of dearest miss mitford i had a letter from her just before she went written in so firm a hand and so vital a spirit that i could feel little apprehension of never seeing her in the body again gods will be done it is better so i am sure she seemed to me to see her way clearly and to have as few troubling doubts in respect to the future life as she had to the imminent end of the present  often we have talked and thought of you since the last time we saw you and before your letter came we had ventured to put on the list of expected pleasures connected with our visit to england fixed for next summer the pleasure of seeing more of mr ruskin for the rest there will be some bitter things too i do not miss them generally in england and among them this time will be an empty place where i used always to find a tender and too indulgent friend  you need not be afraid of my losing a letter of yours the peril would be mine in that case but among the advantages of our florencethe art the olives the sunshine the cypresses and dont let me forget the arno and mountains at sunset timeis that of an all but infallible post office one loses letters at rome here i think we have lost one in the course of eight years and for that loss i hold my correspondent to blame  how good you are to me how kind the soul of a cynic at its third stage of purification might feel the value of gold laid on the binding of a book by the hand of john ruskin much more i who am apt to get too near that ugly sty of epicurus sometimes indeed you have gratified me deeply there was once on a time as is said in the fairy tales a word dropped by you in one of your books which i picked up and wore for a crown your words of goodwill are of great price to me always and one of my dear friend miss mitfords latest kindnesses to me was copying out and sending to me a sentence from a letter of yours which expressed a favorable feeling towards my writings she knew wellshe who knew methe value it would have for me and the courage it would give me for any future work  with my husbands cordial regards  i remain most truly yours elizabeth barrett browning  our american friends who sent to dresden in vain for your letter are here now but will be in england soon on their way to america with the hope of trying fate again in another visit to you thank you also thank you for your inquiry about my health i have had a rather bad attack on my chest never very strong through the weather having been colder than usual here but now i am very well againfor me                                        to mrs martin  florence april 20 1855  my dearest mrs martinhaving nine lives as i say i am alive again and prosperousthanking you for wishing to know people look at me and laugh because its a clear case of bulbous root with melet me pass being humble for the onion i was looking miserable in february and really could scarcely tumble across the room and now i am up on my perch againnay even out of my cage door the weather is divine one feels in ones self why the trees are green i go out walk out have recovered flesh and firemy very hair curls differently is i i i say with the metaphysicians theres something vital about this florence air for though much given to resurrection i never made such a leap in my life before after illness robert and i need to run as well as leap we have quantities of work to do and small time to do it in he is four hours a day engaged in dictating to a friend of ours who transcribes for him and i am not even ready for transcriptionhave not transcribed a line of my six or seven thousand we go to england or at least to paris next month but it cant be early oh may we meet you our little penini is radiant and altogether we are all in good spirits which is a shame you will say considering the state of affairs at sebastopol forgive me i never at worst thought that the great tragedy of the world was going on there it was tragic but there are more chronic cruelties and deeper despairsay and more exasperating wrongs for the rest we have the most atrocious system in europe and we mean to work it out oh you will see your committees nibble on and this and that poisonous berry is pulled off leisurely while the bush to the root of it remains and the children eat on unhindered on the other side i had hoped that there was real feeling among politicians but no we are put off with a fast day there an end i begin to think that nothing will do for england but a good revolution and a besom of destruction used dauntlessly we are getting up our vainglories again smoothing our peacocks plumes we shall be as exemplary as ever by next winter you will see  meanwhile dearest mrs martin that you should ask me about armageddon is most assuredly a sign of the times you know i pass for being particularly mad myself and everybody almost universally is rather mad as may be testified by the various letters i have to read about visible spirithands pianos playing themselves and fleshandblood human beings floating about rooms in company with tables and lamps dante has pulled down his own picture from the wall of a friend of ours in florence five times signifying his pleasure that it should be destroyed at once as unauthentic our friend burnt it directly which will encourage me to pull down mine by word lost savonarola also has said one or two things and there are gossiping guardian angels of whom i need not speak let me say though that nothing has surprised me quite so much as your inquiring about armageddon because i am used to think of you as the least in the world of a theorist and am half afraid of you sometimes and range the chairs before my speculative dark corners that you may not think or see how very wild that ba is getting well now it shall be my turn to be sensible and unbelieving theres a forced similitude certainly in the etymology between the two words but if it were full and perfect i should be no nearer thinking that the battle of armageddon could ever signify anything but a great spiritual strife the terms taken from a symbolical book are plainly to my mind symbolical and dr cumming and a thousand mightier doctors could not talk it out of me i think i dont for the rest like dr cumming his books seem to me very narrow isnt the tendency with us all to magnify the great events of our own time just as we diminish the small events for me i am heretical in certain things i expect no renewal of the jewish kingdom for instance and i doubt much whether christs second coming will be personal the end of the world is probably the end of a dispensation what i expect is a great development of christianity in opposition to the churches and of humanity generally in opposition to the nations and i look out for this in much quiet hope also and in the meanwhile the war seems to be just and necessary there is nothing in it to regret except the way of conducting it  write to me soon again and tell me as much of both of you as you can put into a letter  may god bless you always  with roberts warm regards both of you think of me as  your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs braun  florence may 13 1855  my dearest madame braunyou have classed me and ticketed me before now i think as among the ungrateful of the world yet i am grateful grateful grateful when your book42 came how very kind you were to send it to me and when i had said so some five times running in came somebody who was fanatico per roma and reverential in proportion for dr braun who with some sudden appeal to my sensibilitythe softer just then that i was only just recovering strength after a sharp winter attackswept the volume off the table and carried it off out of the house to study the contents at leisure i expected it back the next week but it lingered and i really hadnt the audacity to write to you and say thank you but i have looked as yet simply at the titlepage well at last it comes home and i turn the leaves examine read approve like ludovisi and the belvedere with a double pleasure of association and become qualified properly to thank you and dr braun from robert and myself for this gift to us and valuable contribution to archæological literature i am only sorry i did not get to rome after the book it would have helped my pleasure so holding up the lanthorn in dark places so much suggestiveness in combination with so much specific information makes a book or a man worth knowing  of late other hindrances have come to writing this in the shape of various labours of hercules which fall sometimes to omphale as well we go to england in a week or two or three and we take between us some sixteen thousand lines eight on one side eight on the other which ought to be ready for publication i have not finished my seventh thousand yet robert is at his mark then i have to see that we have shoes and stockings to go in and that peninis little trousers are creditably frilled and tucked then about twenty letters lie by me waiting to be answered in time so as to save me from a mobbing in england then there are visits to be paid all round in florence to make amends for the sins of the winter visiting like almsgiving being put generally in the place of virtue when the latter is found too inconvenient altogether my head swims and my heart ticks before the days done with positive weariness for there are peninis lessons you are to understand besides the rest and between the intersections cod liver oil to be taken judiciously in order to appear before my english friends with due decency of corporeal coverture  well now do tell me shall you go to england you you will see my reasons for being very interested oh i hope you wont be snatched away to naples or nailed down at rome railroads open from marseilles the exhibition open at paris surely surely dr braun will go to paris to see the exhibition his conscience wont let him off tell him too from me that in london he may see a spirit if he will go for it i have a letter from a friend who swears to me he has shaken hands with three or foursofter more thrilling than any womans handtenderly touchingthink of that the american medium hume is turning the world upside down in london with this spiritual influx  let me remember to tell you your paper was in the athenæum therefore if you were not paid for it it was the more abominable robert saw it with his own eyes printed when i heard from you that you had heard nothing i mentioned the circumstance to mrs jameson in a letter i was writing to her and i do hope she has not neglected since to give you some information at least you are aware probably of the excellent effect with which that kind mrs procter has managed a private subscription in behalf of dear mrs jameson in consequence of which she will be placed in circumstances of ease for the rest of her life fanny kemble nobly gave a hundred pounds towards this good purpose mrs jameson spoke in her last letter of coming to italy this summer and i dare say we shall have the ill luck to lose her miss her cross her en route perhaps  we hear from dear mr kenyon and from miss bayley each very well and full of animation if it were not for them and my dear sisters and one or two other hands i shall care to clasp beside the spirits i would give much not to go north oh we italians grow out of the english bark it wont hold us after a time such a happy year i have had this last i do love florence so when penini says sono italiano voglio essere italiano i agree with him perfectly  so we shall come back of course if we live indeed we leave this house ready to come back to meaning if we can to let our rooms simply  little penini looks like a rose and has besides the understanding and sweetness of a creature a little lower than the angels i dont care any less for him than i did upon the whole  i hear the sartoriss think of paris for next winter and mean to give up rome she has been a good deal secluded until quite lately they say on account of her fathers death and brothers worse than death which may account in part for any backwardness you may have observed as to her not liking dr braun do you believe in anybodys not liking dr braun i dont quite its more difficult for me to receive than the notion of the spiritual handtenderly touching  do you know young leighton43 of rome if so you will be glad of this wonderful success of his picture44 bought by the queen and applauded by the academicians and he not twentyfive  the lady who brought your book did not leave her name here so of course she did not mean to be called on  our kindest regards for dear dr braun and repeated truest thanks to both of you among his discoveries and inventions he will invent some day an aladdins lamp and then you will be suddenly potentates and vanish in a clap of thunder  till then think of me sometimes dearest madame braun as i do of you and of all your great kindness to me at rome  ever your affectionate elizabeth barrett browning                                        to mr ruskin  florence june 2 1855  my dear mr ruskini believe i shall rather prove in this letter how my head turns round when i write it than explain why i didnt write it beforeand so you will go on to think me the most insusceptible and least grateful of human beingsno small distinction in our bad obtuse world yet the truth isoh the truth is that i am deeply grateful to you and have felt to the quick of my heart the meaning and kindness of your words the worth of your sympathy and praise one thing especially which you said made me thankful that i had been allowed to live to hear itsince even to fancy that anything i had written could be the means of the least good to you is worth all the trumpet blowing of a vulgar fame oh of course i do not exaggerate though your generosity does i understand the case as it is we burn straw and it warms us my verses catch fire from you as you read them and so you see them in that light of your own but it is something to be used to such an end by such a man and i thank you thank you and so does my husband for the deep pleasure you have given us in the words you have written  and why not say so sooner just because i wanted to say so fully and because i have been crushed into a corner past all elbowroom for doing anything largely and comfortably by work and fuss and uncertainty of various kinds now it isnt any better scarcely though it is quite fixed now that we are going from florence to englandno more of the shadow dancing which is so pretty at the opera and so fatiguing in real life we are coming and have finished most of our preparations conducted on a balance ofmust we go may we stay which is so very inconvenient if you knew what it is to give up this still dreamlife of our florence where if one is overbusy ever the old tapestries on the walls and the pregiotto pictures picked up by my husband for so many pauls surround us ready to quiet us againif you knew what it is to give it all up and be put into the mill of a dingy london lodging and ground very small indeed you wouldnt be angry with us for being sorry to go northyou wouldnt think it unnatural as for me i have all sorts of pain in englandeverything is against me except a few things and yet while my husband and i groan at one another strophe and antistrophe pardon that rag of greek we admit our compensationsthat it will be an excellent thing for instance to see mr ruskin are we likely to undervalue that  let me consider how to answer your questions my poetrywhich you are so good to and which you once thought sickly you say and why not i have often written sickly poetry i do not doubti have been sickly myselfhas been called by much harder names affected for instance a charge i have never deserved for i do think if i may say it of myself that the desire of speaking or spluttering the real truth out broadly may be a cause of a good deal of what is called in me careless and awkward expression my friends took some trouble with me at one time but though i am not selfwilled naturally as you will find when you know me i hope i never could adopt the counsel urged upon me to keep in sight always the stupidest person of my acquaintance in order to clear and judicious forms of composition will you set me down as arrogant if i say that the longer i live in this writing and reading world the more convinced i am that the mass of readers never receive a poet you who are a poet yourself must surely observe that without intermediation the few understand appreciate and distribute to the multitude below therefore to say a thing faintly because saying it strongly sounds odd or obscure or unattractive for some reason to careless readers does appear to me bad policy as well as bad art is not art like virtue to be practised for its own sake first if we sacrifice our ideal to notions of immediate utility would it not be better for us to write tracts at once  of course any remark of yours is to be received and considered with all reverence only be sure you please to say do it differently to satisfy me john ruskin and not to satisfy mr mrs and the miss and master smith of the great majority the great majority is the majority of the little you know who will come over to you if you dont think of themand if they dont you will bear it  am i pert do you think no dont think it and the truth is though you may not see that that your praise made me feel very humble nay i was quite abashed at the idea of the illumination of my poem and still i keep winking my eyes at the prospect of so much glory if you were a woman i might say when one feels ugly one pulls down the blinds but as a man you are superior to the understanding of such a figure and so i must simply tell you that you honor me over much indeed my husband is very much pleased and particularly pleased that you selected catarina which is his favourite among my poems for some personal fanciful reasons besides the rest  but to go back i said that any remark of yours was to be received by me in all reverence and truth is a part of reverence so i shall end by telling you the truth that i think you quite wrong in your objection to nympholept nympholepsy is no more a greek word than epilepsy and nobody would or could object to epilepsy or apoplexy as a greek word its a word for a specific disease or mania among the ancients that mystical passion for an invisible nymph common to a certain class of visionaries indeed i am not the first in referring to it in english literature de quincey has done so in prose for instance and lord byron talks of the nympholepsy of a fond despair though he never was accused of being overridden by his greek tell me now if i am not justified i also we are all nympholepts in running after our idealsand none more than yourself indeed  our american friend mr jarves wrote to us full of gratitude and gratification on account of your kindness to him for which we also should thank you whether he felt most overjoyed by the clasp of your hand or that of a disembodied spirit which he swears was as real under the mediumship of hume his compatriot it was somewhat difficult to distinguish but all else in england seemed dull and worthless in comparison with those two manifestations the spirits and yours  how very very kind of your mother to think of my child and how happy i am near the end of my paper not to be tempted on into descriptions that hold the place of sense he is six years old he reads english and italian and writes without lines and shall i send you a poem of his for illumination his poems are far before mine the very prattle of the angels when they stammer at first and are not sure of the pronunciation of es and is in the spiritual heavens see swedenborg really he is a sweet good child and i am not bearable in my conceit of him as you see my thankful regards to your mother whom i shall hope to meet with you and do yourself accept as much from us both  most truly yours elizabeth b browning  we leave florence next week and spend at least a week in paris 138 avenue des champselysées                                        to miss browning  florence june 12 1855 postmark  how kind and tender of you my dearest sarianna to care so much to hear that i am better i was afraid that robert had written in the crimean style about me for he was depressed and uneasy poor darling and looked at things from the blackest point of view nevertheless i have escaped some bad symptoms no spitting of blood for instance no loss of voice and scarcely a threatening of pain in the side also i have not grown thinner than is natural under the circumstances at genoa after our cold journey45 i wasted in a few days and thought much worse of myself than there was reason to do this time  i can assure you i am now much restored the cough is decidedly got under and teases me for the most part only in the early morning the fever is gone and the nights are quiet i am able to take animal food again and shall soon recover my ordinary strength certainly it has been a bad attack and i never suffered anything like it in italy before the illness at genoa was the mere tail of what began in england and was increased by the alpine exposure our weather has been very severewind and frost togethersomething peculiarly irritating in the air i am loth to blame my poor florence who never treated me so before and how many winters we have spent hereand our friends write from pisa that the weather was as trying there while from rome the account is simply detestable weather at naples it is sometimes furiously cold theres no perfect climate anywhere thats certain you have only to choose the least evil here for the last week it has been so mild that if i had been in my usual state of health i might have gone out they say and of course i have felt the influence beneficially one encourages oneself in italy when it is cold with the assurance that it cant last our misfortune this time has been that it has lasted unusually long how the italians manage without fires i cannot make out so chilly as they are too its a riddle  you would wonder almost how i could feel the cold in these two rooms opening into each other and from which i have not stirred since the cold weather began robert has kept up the fire in our bedroom throughout the night oh he has been spoiling me so if it had not been that i feared much to hurt him in having him so disturbed and worried it would have been a very subtle luxury to me this being ill and feeling myself dear do not set me down as too selfish may god bless him  robert has been frantic about the crimea and being disgraced in the face of europe c c when he is mild he wishes the ministry to be torn to pieces in the streets limb from limb i do not doubt that the aberdeen side of the cabinet has been greatly to blame but the system is the root of the whole evil if they dont tear up the system they may tear up the aberdeens world without end and not better the matter if they do tear up the system then shall we all have reason to rejoice at these disasters apart from our sympathy with individual sufferings more good will have been done by this one great shock to the heart of england than by fifty years more patching and pottering and knocking impotent heads together what makes me most angry is the ministerial apology its always so with us for three campaigns its our way its want of experience c c thats precisely the thing complained of as to want of experience if the french have had algerine experiences we have had our indian wars chinese wars caffre wars and military and naval expenses exceeding those of france from year to year if our people had never had to pay for an army they might sit down quietly under the taunt of wanting experience but we have soldiers and soldiers should have military education as well as red coats and be led by properly qualified officers instead of lord nincompoops youngest sons as it is in the army so it is in the state places given away here and there to incompetent heads nobody being responsible no unity of idea and purpose anywherethe individual interest always in the way of the general good there is a noble heart in our people strong enough if once roused to work out into light and progression and correct all these evils robert is a good deal struck by the generous tone of the observations of the french press as contradistinguished from the insolences of the americans who really are past enduring just now certain of our english friends here in florence have ceased to associate with them on that ground i think theres a good deal of jealousy about the french alliance that may account for something  dearest kindest sarianna remember not to think any more about me except that i love you that i am your attached  ba   footnotes  15 life and letters of robert browning by mrs sutherland orr p 216  16 the late earl lytton  17 auguste brizieux  18 uncle toms cabin published in 1852  19 mrs

poetical works iv 270 and her husbands the twins were printed together as a small pamphlet for sale at miss arabella barretts bazaar mrs brownings poem had been written before they left rome  40 the horrors of the crimean winter were now becoming known which fully accounts for this outburst  41 the death of mrs jamesons husband in 1854 had left her in very straitened circumstances which were ultimately relieved in part by a subscription among her friends and the admirers of her works  42 dr brauns ruins and museums of rome 1854  43 the late lord leighton pra  44 the picture of cimabues

after the date of the last letter mr and mrs browning left italy for the second time as on the previous occasion 18512 their absence extended over two summers and a winter the latter being spent in paris while portions of each summer were given up to visits to england each of them was bringing home an important work for publication mr brownings men and women containing much of his very greatest poetry being passed through the press in 1855 while mrs brownings aurora leigh although more than half of it had been written before she left florence was not ready for printing until the following year they travelled direct from florence to london arriving there apparently in the course of july and taking up their quarters at 13 dorset street their stay there was made memorable as mrs browning records below by a visit from tennyson who read to them on september 27 his new poem of maud and it was while he was thus employed that rossetti drew a wellknown portrait of the laureate in pen and ink but in spite of glimpses of tennyson ruskin carlyle kenyon and other friends the visit to england was on the whole a painful one to mrs browning intercourse with her own family did not run smooth one sister was living at too great a distance to see her the other was kept out of her reach for a considerable part of the time by her father in addition a third member of the barrett family her brother alfred earned excommunication from his fathers house by the unforgivable offence of matrimony altogether it was not without a certain feeling of relief that in the middle of october mrs browning with her husband and child left england for paris the whole visit had been so crowded with work and social engagements as to leave little time for correspondence and the letters for the period are consequently few and short                                        to mrs martin  13 dorset street baker street tuesday julyaugust 1855  my dearest mrs martini have waited days and days in the answering of your dear kind welcoming letter and yet i have been very very grateful for it thank you i need such things in england above other places  for the rest we could not go to herefordshire even if i were rational which i am not i could as soon open a coffin as do it theres the truth the place is nothing to me of course only the string round a faggot burnt or scattered but if i went there the thought of one face which never ceases to be present with me and which i parted from for ever in my poor blind unconsciousness with a pettish word would rise up put down all the rest and prevent my having one moment of ordinary calm intercourse with you so dont ask me set it down to mania or obstinacy but i never could go into that neighbourhood except to die which i think sometimes i should like so you may have me some day when the physicians give me up but then you wont you know and it wouldnt any way be merry visiting  foolish to write all this as if any human being could know thoroughly what he was to me it must seem so extravagant and perhaps affected even to you who are largehearted and make allowances after these years  and after all i might have just said the other truth that we are at the end of our purse and cant travel any more not even to taunton where poor henrietta who is hindered from coming to me by a like pecuniary straitness begs so hard that we should go also we are bound to london by business engagements a book in the press roberts two volumes and proofs coming in at all hours we have been asked to two or three places at an hours distance from london and cant stir to knebworth for instance where sir edward lytton wants us to go it would be amusing in some ways but we are tired also roberts sister is staying with us  also we shall see you in paris on the way to pau next november shall we not write and tell me that we shall and that you are not disgusted with me meanwhile  do you know our news alfred is just married at the paris embassy to lizzie barrett of course he makes the third exile from wimpole street the course of true love running remarkably rough in our house for the rest there have been no scenes i thank god for dearest arabels sake he had written to my father nine or ten days before the ceremony received no answer and followed up the silence rather briskly by another letter to announce his marriage i am going to write to him at marseilles  you cannot imagine to yourself the unsatisfactory and disheartening turmoil in which we are at present its the mad bull and the china shop and nota bene we are the china shop people want to see if italy has cut off our noses or what a very kind anxiety certainly but so horribly fatiguing that my heart sinks and my brain goes round under the process o my florence how much better you are  have you heard that wilson is married to a florentine who lived once with the peytons and is here now with us a good tenderhearted man46  i am tolerably well though to breathe this heavy air always strikes me as difficult and my little penini is very well thank god i want so much to show him to you we shall be here till the end of september if the weather admits of it then go to paris for the winter then return to london and thenwhy that then is too far off to see only we talk of italy in the distance  my book is not ready for the press yet and as to writing here who could produce an epic in the pauses of a summerset not that my poem is an epic i hurry on to say in consideration for dear mr martins feelings i flatter myself its a novel rather a sort of novel in verse arabel looks well  what pens what ink do write and tell me of you both i love you cordially indeed  your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs jameson  13 dorset street tuesday julyaugust 1855  my dearest mona ninai write to you in the midst of so much fatigue and unsatisfactory turmoil that i feel i shall scarcely be articulate in what i say still it must be tried for i cant have you think that i have come to london to forget you much less to be callous to the influence of this dear affectionate letter of yours may god bless you how sorry i am that you should have vexation on the top of more serious hurts to depress you indeed if it were not for the other side of the tapestry it would seem not at all worth while for us to stand putting in more weary gobelin stitches till we turn into goblins day after day year after year in this sad world for my part i am ready at melancholy with anybody the air mentally or physically considered is very heavy for me here and i long for the quiet of my florence where somehow it always has gone best with my life as to england it affects me so in body soul and circumstances that if i could not get away soon i should be provoked i think into turning monster and hating the whole island which shocks you so to hear that you will be provoked into not loving me perhaps and that would really be too hard after all  the best news i can give you is that robert has printed the first half volume of his poems and that the work looks better than ever in print as all true work does brought into the light he has read these proofs to mr fox of oldham who gives an opinion that the poems are at the top of art in their kind i dont know whether you care for mr foxs opinion but its worth more than mine of course on the ground of impartiality to say no otherwise and it will disappoint me much if you dont confirm both of us presently the poems for variety vitality and intensity are quite worthy of the writer it seems to me and a clear advance in certain respects on his previous productions  has maud penetrated to you the winding up is magnificent full of power and there are beautiful thrilling bits before you get so far still there is an appearance of labour in the early part the language is rather encrusted by skill than spontaneously blossoming and the rhythm is not always happy the poet seems to aim at more breadth and freedom which he attains but at the expense of his characteristic delicious music people in general appear very unfavourably impressed by this poem very unjustly robert and i think on some points it is even an advance the sale is great nearly five thousand copies already  let me see what london news i have to tell you we spent an evening with mr ruskin who was gracious and generous and strengthened all my good impressions robert took our friend young leighton to see him afterwards and was as kindly received we met carlyle at mr forsters and found him in great force particularly in the damnatory clauses mr kinglake we saw twice at the procters and once here the procters are very well how i like adelaides face thats a face worth a drove of beauties dear mrs sartoris has just left london i grieve to say and so has mrs kemble who let me say it quick in a parenthesis is looking quite magnificent just now with those gorgeous eyes of hers mr kenyon too has vanishedgone with his brother to the isle of wight the weather has been very uncertain cloudy misty and rainy with heavy air ever since we came ferdinando keeps saying povera gente che deve vivere in questo posto and penini catches it up and gives himself immense airs discoursing about florentine skies and the glories of the cascine to anyone who will listen the child is well thank god and in great spirits which is my comfort i found my dear sister arabel too well and it is deep yet sad joy to me to look in her precious loving eyes which never failed me nor could henrietta will be hindered perhaps from coming to see me by want of means poor darling and the same cause will keep me from going to taunton we have a quantity of invitations to go into the country to the custs to the martins c c and one which rather tempts me to knebworth sir edward lytton having written us the kindest of possible invitations but none of these things are for us i see  dearest friend i do hope you wont go to rome this winter when you have been to vienna come back and let us have you in paris i am glad lady elgin liked the book the history of it was that she asked robert to get it for her and he presented it instead  our m milsand likes you much he says and i like you to hear it  oh we read your graceful spirited letter in the athenæum by the way did you see the absurd exposition of maud as an allegory what pure madness instead of maudness                                        to mrs martin  13 dorset street monday augustseptember 1855  day after day my dearest mrs martin i have been meaning to write to you always in vain and now i hear from mrs ormus biddulph that you are not quite well how is this shall i hear soon that you are better i want something to cheer me up a little the bull is out of the china shop certainly but the broken pottery doesnt enjoy itself much the more for that i have lost my arabel my one light in london who has had to go away to eastbourne very vexed at it dear darling though she really required change of air we for our parts are under promise to follow her in a week as it will be on our way to paris and not cost us many shillings over the expenses of the direct route but the days drag themselves out and there remains so much work on proof sheets c to be done here that i despond of our being able to move as soon as i fain would i assure you i am stuffed as hard as a cricket ball with the work of every day and i have waited in vain for a clear hour to write quietly and comfortably to you in order to say how your letter touched me dear dear friend you always understand your sympathy stretches beyond points of agreement which is so rare and so precious and makes one feel so unspeakably grateful  london has emptied itself as you may suppose by this time mrs ormus biddulph was so kind as to wish us to dine with them on monday today but we found it absolutely impossible the few engagements we make we dont keep and i shall try for the future to avoid perjury as it is i have no doubt that various people have set me down as full of arrogance and assumption at which the gods must laugh for really if truths could be known i feel even morbidly humble just now and could show my sackcloth with anybodys sackcloth but it is difficult to keep to the conventions rigidly and return visits to the hour and hold engagements to the minute when one has neither carriage nor legs nor time at ones disposal which is my case if i dont at once answer for instance such a letter as you sent me i must be a beggar  may god bless you both my very dear friends my husband bids me remember him to you in cordial regard i long to see you and to hear first that you are well  dearest mrs martins ever attached ba                                        to mrs martin  13 dorset street tuesday october 1855  my dearest mrs martini cant go without writing to you but i am ground down with last things to do on last days and it must be a word only dearest friend i have waited morning after morning for a clear halfhour because i didnt like to do your bidding and write briefly though now after all i am reduced to it we leave england tomorrow and shall sleep dv at 102 rue de grenelle faubourg st germain parisi am afraid in a scarcely convenient apartment which a zealous friend in spite of our own expressed opinion secured for us for the term of six months because of certain yellow satin furniture which only she could consider worthy of us we shall probably have to dress on the staircase but what matter theres the yellow satin to fall back upon  if the rooms are not tenable we must underlet them or try  one of the pleasantest things which has happened to us here is the coming down on us of the laureate who being in london for three or four days from the isle of wight spent two of them with us dined with us smoked with us opened his heart to us and the second bottle of port and ended by reading maud through from end to end and going away at halfpast two in the morning if i had had a heart to spare certainly he would have won mine he is captivating with his frankness confidingness and unexampled naïveté think of his stopping in maud every now and thentheres a wonderful touch thats very tender how beautiful that is yes and it was wonderful tender beautiful and he read exquisitely in a voice like an organ rather music than speech  war war it is terrible certainly but there are worse plagues deeper griefs dreader wounds than the physical what of the forty thousand wretched women in this city the silent writhing of them is to me more appalling than the roar of the cannons then this war is necessary on our sides is that wrong necessary it is not so clear to me  can i write of such questions in the midst of packing  may god bless you both write to me in paris and do come soon and find us out  roberts love my love to you both dearest friends may god bless you your ever affectionate  ba                                        to mr ruskin  13 dorset street tuesday morning october 17 1855 postmark  my dear mr ruskini cant express our amount of mortification in being thwarted in the fulfilment of the promise you allowed us to make to ourselves that we would go down to you once more before leaving england what with the crush rather than press of circumstances i have scarcely needed the weather to pin me to the wall sometimes my husband could not go with me sometimes i couldnt go with him and always we waited for one another in hope till this last day overtook us tomorrow dv we shall be in paris now will you believe how we have wished and longed to see you beyond these strait tantalising limitshow you look to us at this moment like the phantasm of a thing dear and desired just seen and vanishing what are you to be ranked among my spiritualities after all forgive me that wrong  then you had things to say to me i know which in your consideration and through my cowardice you did not say but yet will  will you write to me dear mr ruskin sometimes or have i disgusted you so wholly that you wont or cant  once i know somewhat because of shyness and somewhat because of intense apprehensionsomewhat too through characteristic stupidity no contradiction thisi said i was grateful to you when you had just bade me not well i really couldnt help it thats all i can say now even if your appreciation were perfectly deserved at all points why appreciation means sympathy and sympathy being the best gift nearly which one human creature can give another i dont understand i never could why it does not deserve thanks i am stupid perhaps but for my life i never could help being grateful to the people who loved me even if they happened to say i cant help it not i  as for mr ruskin he sees often in his own light thats what i see and feel  will you write to me sometimes i come back to it will you though i am awkward and shy and obstinate now and then and a wicked spiritualist to wita realist in an outoftheworld senseaccepting matter as a means no matter for it otherwise  dont give me up dear mr ruskin my husbands truest regards and farewell from both of us i would fain be  your affectionate friend elizabeth barrett browning  our address in paris will be 102 rue de grenelle faubourg st germain                                        the house in the rue de grenelle however did not prove a success in spite of the consolations of the yellow satin and after six weeks of discomfort and househunting the brownings moved to 3 rue de colisée which became their home for the next eight months it was a period first of illness caused by the unsuitable rooms and then of hard work for mrs browning who was engaged in completing aurora leigh while her husband was less profitably employed in the attempt to recast sordello into a more intelligible form no such incident as the visits to george sand marked this stay in paris and politics were in a very much less exciting state the crimean war was just coming to a close and public opinion in england was far from satisfied with the conduct of its ally but on the whole the times were uneventful  the first letter from paris has however a special interest as containing a very full estimate of the character and genius of mrs brownings dear friend miss mitford it is addressed to mr ruskin who had been unceasingly attentive and helpful to miss mitford during her declining days                                        to mr ruskin  paris 102 rue de grenelle faubourg st germain november 5 1855  my dear mr ruskini thank you from my heart for your more than interesting letter you have helped me to see that dear friend of ours as without you i could not have seen her in those last affecting days of illness by the window not only of the house in berkshire but of the house of the body and of the material worldan open window through which the light shone thank god it would be a comfort to me now if i had had the privilege of giving her a very very little of the great pleasure you certainly gave her for i know how she enjoyed your visitshe wrote and told me but i must be satisfied with the thought left to me that now she regrets nothing not even great pleasures  i agree with you in much if not in everything you have written of her it was a great warm outflowing heart and the head was worthy of the heart people have observed that she resembled coleridge in her granite foreheadsomething too in the lower part of the facehowever unlike coleridge in mental characteristics in his tendency to abstract speculation or indeed his ideality there might have been as you suggest a somewhat different development elsewhere than in berkshirenot very different thoughsouls dont grow out of the ground  i agree quite with you that she was stronger and wider in her conversation and letters than in her books oh i have said so a hundred times the heat of human sympathy seemed to bring out her powerful vitality rustling all over with laces and flowers she seemed to think and speak stronger holding a handnot that she required help or borrowed a word but that the human magnetism acted on her nature as it does upon men born to speak perhaps if she had been a man with a mans opportunities she would have spoken rather than written a reputation who can say she hated the act of composition did you hear that from her ever  her letters were always admirable but i do most deeply regret that what made one of their greatest charms unfits them for the publici mean their personal details mr harness sends to me for letters and when i bring them up and with the greatest pain force myself to examine them all those letters she wrote to me in her warm goodness and affectionateness i find with wonder and sorrow how only a halfpage here and there could be submitted to general readerscould with any decency much less delicacy  but no her judgment was not unerring she was too intensely sympathetical not to err often and in fact it was singular or seemed so what faces struck her as most beautiful and what books as most excellent if she loved a person it was enough she made mistakes one couldnt help smiling at till one grew serious to adore her for it and yet when she read a book provided it wasnt written by a friend edited by a friend lent by a friend or associated with a friend her judgment could be fine and discriminating on most subjects especially upon subjects connected with life and society and manners shall i confess she never taught me anything but a very limited admiration of miss austen whose people struck me as wanting souls even more than is necessary for men and women of the world the novels are perfect as far as they gothats certain only they dont go far i think it may be my fault  you lay down your finger and stop me and exclaim that its my way perhaps to attribute a leaning of the judgment through personal sympathy to people in generalthat i do it perhaps to you no indeed i can quite easily believe that you dont either think or say the pleasantest things to your friends in fact i am sure you dont you would say them as soon to your enemiesperhaps sooner also when you began to say pleasant things to me you hadnt a bit of personal feeling to make a happy prejudice of and really i cant flatter myself that you have now what i meant was that you john ruskin not being a critic sal merum as the ancients had it but half critic and half poet may be rather encumbered sometimes by the burning imagination in you may be apt sometimes when you turn the light of your countenance on a thing to see the thing lighted up as a matter of course just as we when we carried torches into the vatican were not perfectly clear how much we brought to that wonderful demosthenes folding the marble round him in its thousand foldshow much we brought and how much we received was it the sculptor or was it the torchbearer who produced that effect and like doubts i have had of you i confess and not only when you have spoken kindly of me you dont mistake by your heart through loving but you exaggerate by your imagination through glorifying theres my thought at least  but what i meant by apprehending too intensely dear mr ruskin dont ask me really i have forgotten i suppose i did mean something though it was a day of chaos and packing boxestry to think i did therefore and let it pass  you please meoh so muchby the words about my husband when you wrote to praise my poems of course i had to bear iti couldnt turn round and say well and why dont you praise him who is worth twenty of me praise my second me as well as my me proper if you please ones forced to be rather decent and modest for ones husband as well as for ones self even if its harder i couldnt pull at your coat to read pippa passes for instance i cant now  but you have put him on the shelf so we have both taken courage to send you his new volumes men and women not that you may say pleasant things of them or think yourself bound to say anything indeed but that you may accept them as a sign of the esteem and admiration of both of us i consider them on the whole an advance upon his former poems and am ready to die at the stake for my faith in these last even though the discerning public should set it down afterwards as only a heretics tragedy  our friend mr jarves came to read a part of your letter to us confirmatory of doctrines he had heard from us on an earlier day the idea of your writing the art criticisms of the leader  was so stupendously ludicrous there was no need of faith in your loyalty to laugh the whole imputation at first hearing to uttermost scorn i must say in justice to mr jarves that he never did really believe one word of it though a good deal ruffled and pained that it should have been believed by anybody he is full of admiring and grateful feeling for you and has gone on to italy in that mind  as for me i almost yearn to go too we have fallen into a pit here in paris upon evil days and rooms an impulsive friend having taken an apartment for us facing the east insufficiently protected and with a bedroom wanting so that we are still waiting with trunks unpacked and our child sleeping on the floor till we can get emancipated anyhow then through the last weeks cold i have not been wellonly it will not i think be much as i am better already and there will be no practical end to the talk of nice and pau which my husband had begun a little all this has hindered me from following my first impulse of thanking you for your letter immediately  how beautiful paris is and how i agree with you as we both did with dear miss mitford on the subject of louis napoleon i approve of him exactly because i am a democrat and not at all for an exceptional reason i hold that the most democratical government in europe is out and out the french government which doesnt exclude the absolutist element far from it but who in england understands this and that the representative man of france the incarnate republic is the man louis napoleon an extraordinary man he is i never was a buonapartist though the legend of the first napoleon has wrung tears from me before now and i was very sorry when louis napoleon was elected instead of cavaignac at the coup détat i was not sorry and since then i have believed in him more and more  so far in sympathy in regard to the slaves no no no i belong to a family of west indian slaveholders and if i believed in curses i should be afraid i can at least thank god that i am not an american how you look serenely at slavery i cannot understand and i distrust your power to explain do you indeed  dear mr ruskin do let us hear from you sometimes it is such a great gift a letter of yours then remember that i am a spirit in prison all the winter not able to stir out up to this time we have lived perdus from all our acquaintances because of our misfortunes with my husbands cordial regards i remain most truly yours always  elizabeth barrett browning  the publishers are directed to send you the volumes on their publication                                        to mrs jameson  paris 3 rue du colisée avenue des champselysées saturday december 17 1855 postmark  how pleasant dearest mona nina to hear you though the voice sounds far try and come back to us soon and let us talk or listen rather to your talking why shouldnt i too have a sister of charity like others i appeal to you  still i have only good to tell you of myself i am better through the better weather and through our arrival in this apartment where as robert says we are as pleased as if we had never lived in a house before well i assure you the rooms are perfect in comfort and convenience not large but warm and of a number and arrangement which exclude all faultfinding clean carpeted no glitter nothing very prettynot even the clocksbut with sofas and chairs suited to lollers such as one of us and altogether what i mean whenever i say that an apartment on the continent is twenty times more really comfortable than any of your small houses in england robert has a room to himself too its perfect i hop about from one side to the other like a bird in a new cage the feathers are draggled and rough though i am not strong though the cough is quieter without the least doubt  and this time also i shall not die perhaps indeed i do think not  that darling robert carried me into the carriage swathed past possible breathing over face and respirator in woollen shawls no he wouldnt set me down even to walk up the fiacre steps but shoved me in upside down in a struggling bundlei struggling for breathhe accounting to the concierge for his murdered man rather woman in a way which threw me into fits of laughter afterwards to remember elle se porte très bien elle se porte extrêmement bien ce nest rien que les poumons nothing but lungs no air in them which was the worst think how the concierge must have wondered ever since about cet original danglais and the peculiar way of treating wives when they are in excellent health sacre  kind madame mohl was here today asking about you and the aides male and female whom we did not see being at dinner and dear lady elgin came to the door in her wheelchair  we keep penini in a bed this time in our bedroom he was so pathetic about it we would not lose him  write to us keep writing to us till you come i think much of you wish much for you and feel much with you may god bless you my dear dear friend the frost broke up on thursday and it is raining warmly today but i cant believe in the possibility of the cold penetrating much into this house under worse circumstances and i shall be bold and try hard to begin writing next week  oh george sand how magnificent that eighteenth volume is i mean the volume which concludes with the views upon the sexes after all and through all if her hands are ever so defiled that woman has a clean soul  on the magnetic subjects too her je ne sais is worthy of her and yet more is to be known i am sure than she knows  i read this book so eagerly and earnestly that i seem to burn it up before me really there are great things in it  and to hear people talking it over coldly pulling it leaf from leaf  robert quite joins with me at last he is intensely interested and full of admiration  now do write with our united love we are ever yours be certain  rb and ebb  remember not to agree to do the etching pray be careful not to involve the precious eyes too much how easy it would be to etch them out frightfully easy                                         to miss ef haworth  paris 3 rue du colisée monday january 29 1856 postmark  dearest fannyi cant get over it that you should fancy i meant to banter you47 if i wrote lightly it was partly that you wrote lightly and partly perhaps because at bottom i wasnt light at all when one feels out of spirits its the most natural thing possible to be extravagantly gay now isnt it  and now believe me with what truth and earnestness of heart i am interested in all that concerns you and this is every womans chief concern of course this great fact of love and marriage my advice is be sure of him first and of yourself chiefly for the rest i would marry if i were a woman i was going to say though the whole world spouted fire in my face marriage is a personal matter be sure and the nearest and wisest cant judge for you if you can make up two hundred a year between you or less even there is no pecuniary obstacle in my eyes people may live very cheaply and very happily if they are happy otherwise  as for me my only way was to cut the knotbecause it was an untieable knotand because my fingers generally are not strong at untieing what do you mean by mr kenyons backing me nobody backed me except the north wind which blew us vehemently out of england mr kenyon knew no more of the affair than you did though he was very kind afterwards and took my part and as to money there was and is little enough it was a case of pure madness for people of the world just like tablemoving and spiritrapping and the hands  but you my dear friend i do earnestly entreat you to consider if you are sure of principles sentimentand of yourself because whether you know it or not you are happily situated now as far as exterior circumstances are concerned they are not worth much but they have their worth they give you liberty to follow your own devices to think the beautiful and feel the noble to live out in short your individual life which it is so hard to do in marriage even where you marry worthily  i say this probably as one who beateth the air yet you must consider that i who say it and who say it emphatically consider a happy marriage as the happiest state and that all pecuniary reasons against love are both ineffectual and stupid  flippancy flippancy of course london would be better for your friends as a residence for you than wittemberg can be and for that and no other account i could be sorry that you did not settle so  well never mind the description sounds excellently almost overromantic though is there steadiness do you think and depth and reliableness altogether what impression does he make among those who have known him longest dearest fanny do nothing in haste  now i am going to tell you something which has vexed me and continues to vex me the clock if you knew robert you never would have asked him he has a sort of mania about shops and wont buy his own gloves he bought a pair of boots the other day because i went down on my knees to ask him and the water was running in through his soles and he will not soon get over it without exaggeration he would rather leap down among the lions after your glove as the knight of old than walk into a shop for you if i could but go out there would be no difficulties but i am shut up in my winter prison in spite of the extraordinarily mild weather through having suffered so much in the beginning of the winter i asked sarianna she also shrinks from the responsibility is afraid of not pleasing you c the end of it all is that mrs haworth will think us all very disobliging barbarians and that really i am vexed why not ask mrs cochrane to get the thing for you you can but ask at any rate  i am very anxious just now about dear mr kenyon who has been alarmingly ill and is only better i fear miss bayley wrote to tell me and added that he was going to cowes when he could move which pleases me for only change of air and liberation from london air can complete his convalescence  for the rest i am busy beyond description but never too much so mind dear fanny to be glad to get your letters write soon your ever affectionate  ebb                                        to mrs martin  paris 3 rue du colisée february 21 1856  my dearest mrs martini should have answered your note days ago if you saw how i am in a plague of industry just now and not a moment unspottedhow for instance i kept an examiner newspaper sent to us from london three days on the table before i could read ityou would make an allowance for me its a sort of furia i must get over so much writing or i shall be too late for the summers printing if it isnt done by june what will become of me i shall go back to italy in disgrace and considerably poorer than i need be which is of more practical consequence so i fag then theres an hour and a half in the morning for peninis lessons we breakfast at nine and receive nobody till past four this will all prove to you two things dearest friendfirst i hope that im pardonable for making you wait a few days longer than should have been and secondly that im tolerably well yes indeed since our arrival in this house after just the first when there was some frost we have had such a miraculous mildness under the name of winter that i rallied as a matter of course and for the last month there has been no return of the spitting of blood and no extravagance of cough i have persisted with cods liver oil and i look by no means ill people assure me and so i may assure you but i am not very strong and was a good deal tired after a two hours drive which i ventured on a week ago in the bois de boulogne the small rooms and deficiency of air resulting from them make a long shutting up a more serious thing than i find it in florence in our acres of apartment but it is easy to mend strength when only strength is to be mended and i for one get strong again easily i only hope that the cold is not returning the air was sharp yesterday and is today but its february and the spring is at the doors and we may hope with reason  what do you say of the peace as a final peace you are not at least vexed as so many english are that we cant fight a little for glory to reinstate our reputation youll excuse that still i cant help feeling disappointed in the peacechiefly perhaps because i hoped too much from the war will nothing be done after all for italy nothing for poland  you want books read abouts tolla he is a new writer and his book is exquisite as a transcript of italian manners then read octave feuillet there is much in him  will there be war with america dear mr martin never will i believe it till i hear the cannons  talking of what we should believe it appears that mrs trollope has thrown over hume48 from some failure in his moral character in florence i have had many letters on the subject i have no doubt that the young man who is weak and vain and was exposed to gross flatteries from the various unwise coteries at florence who took him up deserves to be thrown over but his mediumship is undisproved as far as i can understand it is simply a physical facultyhe is quite an electric wire at florence everybody is quarrelling with everybody on the subject i thought i would tell you  penini the pet is radiant and learning french triumphantly may god bless you write to me dearest mrs martin and tell me of both of you roberts love  your ever ever affectionate ba                                         to mrs jameson  paris 3 rue du colisée february 28 1856 postmark  my dearest mona ninathree letters one on the top of another and i dont answer shame on me how i have thought of you to make up and you write to apologise to us from a dreamy mystical apprehension that we may peradventure have lost eightpence on your account well it would have been awful if we had and so providence interposed with a special miracle and obliged the officials to accept the actual penny stamp for the fourpenny stamp you meant to put and we paid just nothing for the terrible letter take heart therefore in future before all hypothetical misfortunes thats the moral of the tale  my dear friend how shall i pull you and make you come to paris madame de triqueti was here the other day and spoke of you and swore she wouldnt help to take rooms for you unless you came near her as to the two rooms you speak of i am sure you might have what rooms you pleased now in this neighbourhood what would you give our present apartment is comfort itself and except some cold days a short time after you went away we have really had no winter the miraculous warmth has saved me for i was so felled in that rue de grenelle i should scarcely have had force against an ordinary cold season little penini has been blossoming like a rose all the time such a darling idle distracted child he is not keeping his attention for three minutes together for the hour and a half i teach him and when i upbraid him for it throwing himself upon me like a dog kissing my cheeks and head and hands o you little pet dive me one chance more i will really be dood and learning everything by magnetism getting on in seven weeks for instance to read french quite surprisingly he has written a poem on the war and the peace called soldiers going and coming which robert and i thought so remarkable that i sent it to mr forster oh such a darling that child is i expect the wings to grow presently  as for my poem far below peninis i work on steadily and have put in order and transcribed five books containing in all above six thousand lines ready for the press i have another book to put together and transcribe and then must begin the composition part of one or two more books i suppose i must be ready for printing by the time we go to england in june robert too is much occupied with sordello49 and we neither of us receive anybody till past four oclock i mean that when you have read my new book you put away all my other poems or most of them and know me only by the new oh i am so anxious to make it good i have put much of myself in iti mean to say of my soul my thoughts emotions opinions in other respects there is not a personal line of course its a sort of poetic artnovel if its a failure there will be the comfort of having made a worthy effort of having done it as well as i could write soon to me and love us both constantly as we do you  your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs jameson  paris may 2 1856 postmark  my dearest mona ninaits very pleasant always to get letters from you and such kind dear letters showing that you havent broken the tetherstrings in search of pastures new weary of our cropped grass  as for news you have most of the persons upon whom you care for gossip in your hand nowmrs sartoris madame viardot lady monson and the ristori herself robert went to see her twice because lady monson led him by the hand kindly and was charmed thought the médée very fine but wont join in the cry about miraculous genius and rachel outracheled he thinks that as far as the highest and largest development of sensibility can go she is very great but that for those grand and sudden aperçus which have distinguished actorssuch as kean for instancehe does not acknowledge them in her you have heard perhaps how dickens and others macready among the rest depreciated her dickens went so far as to say i understand that no english audience would tolerate her defects which will be put to the proof presently by the way you had better not quote macready on this subject as he expressed himself unwilling to be quoted on it  so now we are well again50 thank god and if robert will but take regular exercise he will keep so i hope as to penini he is radiant and even i have been out walking twice though a good deal weaker for the winter more open air and much more is necessary to set me growing again but i shall grow and meantime i have been working and am working at so close a rate that if i lose a day i am lost which is too close a rate and makes one feel rather nervous we see nobody till after four meantime i have finished not transcribed the last book but one and am now in the very last book which must be finished with the last days of may then the first fortnight of june will be occupied with the transcription of these two last books and i shall carry the completed work with me to england on the 16th if it please god oh i do hope you wont be disappointed with itmuch some things you will like certainly because of the boldness and veracity of them and others you may i cant be so sure robert speaks well of the poetryencourages me much but then he has seen only six of the eight books yet  he just now has taken to drawing and after thirteen days application has produced some quite startling copies of heads i am very glad he cant rest from serious work in light literature as i can it wearies him and there are hours which are on his hands which is bad both for them and for him the secret of life is in full occupation isnt it this world is not tenable on other terms so while i lie on the sofa and rest in a novel robert has a resource in his drawing and really with all his feeling and knowledge of art some of the mechanical trick of it cant be out of place  tonight he is going to madame mohl who is well and as vivacious as ever when monckton milnes was in paris he dined with him in company with mignet cavour george sand and an empty chair in which lamartine was expected to sit george sand had an ivy wreath round her head and looked like herself but lady monson will talk to you of her better than i can now mind you ask lady monson  as to this government i only entreat you not to believe any of the mendacious reports set afloat here by a most unworthy opposition and carried out by the english athenæum and other prints surely a cause must be bad which is supported by such bad means in the first place béranger did not write the verses attributed to him the internal evidence was sufficientfor victor hugo is his personal enemyto say nothing of the poetry then it would be wise i think in considering this question and in taking for granted that the literature and talent of the country are against the government to analyse the antecedents and character of the persons who do stand out persons implicated in former governments or favored by former governments and whose vanity and prejudices are necessarily contrary to a new order these persons either in themselves or their friends have all been tried in action and found wanting they have all lost the confidence of the french people either by their misconduct or their illfortune they are all cast aside as broken instruments under these circumstances they think it desirable to break themselves into the lock to prevent the turning of another key they consider it noble and patriotic to stand aside and revile and throw mud in order to hinder the action of those who are acting for the country in my mind it is quite otherwise in my mind and in many other mindsroberts for instance and he began with a most intense hatred of this government as you well know but he does not shut his eyes to all that is noble and admirable going on on all sides at last he is sick of the opposition he admits in respect to literature nothing can be more mendacious than to say there are restraints upon literature books of freer opinion are printed now than would ever have been permitted under louis philippe as was reproached against napoleon by an enemy the other daybooks of free opinion even licentious opinion on religion and philosophy there is restraint in the newspapers only that the athenæum should venture to say that in consequence of the suppression of books compositors are thrown out of work and forced to become transcribers of verses like bérangers which are not bérangers is so stupendous a falsehood in the face of statistics which prove a yearly increase in the amount of books printed that i quite lose my breath you see in speaking of it  the government is steadily solving or attempting to solve that difficult modern problem of possible socialism which has been knocking at all our heads and hearts so long that is its vexation it is a government for the bus people the first settled and serious government that ever attempted their case its action is worth all the pedantry of the doctrinaires and the middling morals of the juste milieu and i who am a democrat will stand by it as long as i can stand which isnt very long just now as i told you  dearest mona nina i am so uneasy about dear mr kenyon who has been ill againis ill i fear he is in londonmores the pity and miss bayley is with him he gives me sad thoughts  do write of yourself dont you be sad dearest friend oh i do wish you could have come and let us love you and talk to youbut on the 16th of june at any rate  your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs jameson  paris monday may 6 1856 postmark  my dearest mona ninayour letter makes me feel very uncomfortable we are in real difficulty about our dear friend mr kenyon the impulse being of course that robert should go at once and then the fear coming that it might be an annoyance an intrusion something the farthest from what it should be at all if you had been more explicityouand we could know what was in your mind when you ask robert to come my dear friend then it would be all easier if we could but know whether anything passed between you and miss bayley on this subject or whether it is entirely out of your own head that you wish robert to come i thought about it yesterday till i went to bed at eight oclock with headache shall i tell you something in your ear it is easier for a rich man to enter after all into the kingdom of heaven than into the full advantages of real human tenderness robert would give much at this moment to be allowed to go to dearest mr kenyon sit up with him hold his hand speak a good loving word to him this would be privilege to him and to me and love and gratitude on our parts justified us in asking to be allowed to do it twice we have asked the first time a very kind but decided negative was returned to us on the part of our friend yesterday we again asked yesterday i wrote to say that it would be consolation to us if robert might goif we might say so without teasing tomorrow in the case of miss bayley sending a consent even on her own part robert will set off instantly but without an encouraging word from hermy dear friend do you not see that it might really vex dearest mr kenyon observe we have no more right of intruding than you would have if you forced your way upstairs its a wretched world where we cant express an honest affection honestly without half appearing indelicate to ourselves nothing proves more how the dirt of the world is up to our chins and i think i had my headache yesterday really and absolutely from simple disgust  you see robert might go to stay till mr edward kenyon arrivesif it were only till then i still hope and pray that our dearest friend may rally to recover at least a tolerable degree of health he has certain good symptoms and some of the bad ones such as the wandering c are constitutional with him under the least fever you may suppose what painful anxiety we are in about him oh he has been always so good to meso true sympathising and generous a friend  i shall always have a peculiar feeling to that dear kind miss bayley for what she has been to him these latter months  now i cant write any more just now leighton has been cut up unmercifully by the critics but bears on robert says not without courage that you should say his picture looked well was comfort in the general gloom though even you dont give anything yet that can be called an opinion mrs sartoris will be much vexed by it all i am sure  may god bless you write to me roberts love with that of  your ever affectionate ba  did you observe a portrait of robert by page where have they hung it and how does it strike you                                        to miss ef haworth  paris 3 rue du colisée saturday june 17 1856 postmark  my dearest fannyi was just going to write to you to beg you to apply to chapman for roberts book when he came to stop me with the newspaper thank you my dearest fanny for having thought of me when you had so much weary thought it was very touching to me that you should and i am vexed to have missed two days before i told you thisthe first by an accident and the second today by its being a blank postday but you will know by your heart how deeply i have felt and feel for you may god bless you and love you if i were as he to comfort you should be strong and calm at this moment but what are we to one another in this world how weak how far we all feel in moments like these  still i should like to know that you had some friend near you to hold your hand and look in your face and be silent as those are silent who know and feel when you can write again tell me how it is with you in this respect and in others  so sudden so sudden yet bereavements like these are always sudden to the soul more or less all blows must needs be sudden may your health not suffer dear fanny we shall be in london in about a week after the 16th for we are delayed through my not having finished my poem which nobody will finish reading perhaps we go to mr kenyons house in devonshire place kindly offered to us for the summer shall we find you i wonder in london  yes there are terrible costs in this world we get knowledge by losing what we hoped for and liberty by losing what we loved but this world is a fragmentor rather a segmentand it will be rounded presently to the completer satisfaction not to doubt that is the greatest blessing it gives now death is as vain as life the common impression of it as false and as absurd a mere change of circumstances what more and how near these spirits are how conscious how full of active energy and tender reminiscence and interest who shall dare to doubt for myself i do not doubt at all if i did i should be sitting here inexpressibly sadfor myself not you  robert unites with me in affectionate sympathy and sarianna was here last night talking feelingly about you you shall have roberts book when we get to england think how much i think of you  your ever affectionate ba  mr kenyon has been very ill and is still in a state occasioning anxiety he is at the isle of wight                                        at the end of june the brownings came back to london for what was as it proved mrs brownings last visit to england mr kenyon had lent them his house in london at 39 devonshire place he himself being in the isle of wight but a shadow was thrown over the whole of this visit by the serious and ultimately fatal illness of this dear friend it was partly in order to see him and partly because miss arabel barrett had been sent out of town by her father almost as soon as her sister reached devonshire place that about the beginning of september they made an expedition to the isle of wight staying first at ventnor with miss barrett and subsequently at west cowes with mr kenyon all the while mrs browning was actively engaged in seeing aurora leigh through the press and the poem was published just about the time they left england the letters during this visit are few and mostly unimportant but the following are of interest                                        to mrs jameson  39 devonshire place friday morning julyaugust 1856  my dearest mona nina my dear friendi am so grieved so humiliated if it is possible to forgive me do  i received your note delayed answering it because i fancied robert might learn to accept your kindness about the box after a days consideration and so forgot everything bodily taking one day for another as is my way lately in this great crush of too much to do and think of when i was persuaded to go yesterday morning for the first and last time to the royal academy on the point of closing i went in like an idiotthat is an innocentnever once thinking of what i was running the risk of losing and when i returned and found you gone you were lost and i in despair so much in despair that i did not hope once you might come again and out i went after dinner to see the edward kenyons in beaumont street like an innocentthat is an idiotand so lost you again you may forgive meit is possiblebut to forgive myself it is more difficult try not quite to give me up for it your note gave me so much pleasure i wished so to see you for the future i mean to write down engagements in a texthand and set them up somewhere in sight but if i broke through twenty others as shamefully it would not be with as much real grief to myself as in this fault to my dearest mona nina do come soon out of mercyand magnanimity  your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs martin  3 parade west cowes september 9 1856 postmark  my dearest mrs martinyour letter has followed us we have been in the south of the island at ventnor with arabel and are now in the north with mr kenyon we came off from london at a days notice the wimpole street people being sent away abruptly in consequence plainly of our arrival becoming known and arabel bringing her praying eyes to bear on robert who agreed to go with her and stay for a fortnight so we have had a happy sorrowful two weeks together between meeting and parting and then came here where our invalid friend called us poor arabel is in low spiritsveryand aggrieved with being sent away from town but the fresh air and repose will do her good in spite of herself though she swears they wont in the tone of saying they shant she is not by any means strong and overworks herself in london with schools and refuges and societiesdoes the work of a horse and isnt a horse last winter she was quite unwell as you heard in spite of which i did not think her looking ill when i saw her first and now she looks well i thinkquite as well as she ever does but she wants a new moral atmospherea little society she is thrown too entirely on her own resources and her own resources are of somewhat a gloomy character this is all wrong it has been partly necessary and a little her fault at one time i would give my right hand to take her to italy but if i gave right and left it would not be found possible my father has remained in london and may not go to ventnor for the next week or two says a letter from arabel this morning the very day he heard of our being in devonshire place he gave orders that his family should go away i wrote afterwards but my letter as usual remained unnoticed  it has naturally begun to dawn upon my child that i have done something very wicked to make my father what he is once he came up to me earnestly and said mama if youve been very very naughtyif youve broken china his idea of the heinous in crimei advise you to go into the room and say papa ill be dood almost i obeyed the inspirationalmost i felt inclined to go but there were considerationsyes good reasonswhich kept me back and must continue to do so in fact the position is perfectly hopelessperfectly  we find our dear friend mr kenyon better in some respects than we expected but i fear in a very precarious state our stay is uncertain we may go at a moments notice or remain if he wishes it and my proofs being sent post by post we are able to see to them together without too much delay still only onehalf of the book is done and the days come when i shall find no pleasure in themnothing but coughing  george and my brothers were very kind to robert at ventnor and he is quite touched by it also little pen made his way into the heart of mine untles and was carried on their backs up and down hills and taught the ways of english boys with so much success that he makes pretensions to pluck and has left a good reputation behind him on one occasion he went up to a boy of twelve who took liberties and exclaimed dont be impertinent sir doubling his small fist or i will show you that im a boy of course mine untles are charmed with this proper spirit and applaud highly robert and i begged to suggest to the hero that the boy of twelve might have killed him if he had pleased never mind cried little pen there would have been somebody to think of me who would have him hanged great applause from the uncles but you would still be dead said robert remorselessly well i dont tare for that it was a beautiful place to die inclose to the sea  so you will please to observe that in spite of being italians and wearing curls we can fight to the death on occasion  write to me and say how you both are roberts love we both love you  very lovingly yours ba                                        to miss browning  west cowes september 13 1856 postmark  my dearest sariannarobert comes suddenly down on me with news that he is going to write to you so though i have been writing letters all the morning i must throw in a few words as to keeping penini at the sea longer he will have been three weeks at the sea tomorrow and you must remember how late into the year it is gettingand we with so much work before us and if peni recovered his roses at ventnor i recovered my cough from the piercing east winds but i am better since and last night slept well its far too early for cough however in any shape we have heaps of business to do in londonheapsand the book is only halfdone still we are asked to stay here till three days after madame brauns arrival and it isnt fixed yet when she will arrive so that i daresay peni will have a full month of the sea after all then i have a design upon roberts goodnature of persuading him to go round by taunton to london something like going round the earth to paris that i may see my poor forsaken sister henrietta who wants us to give her a week in her cottage pathetically bewailing herself that she has no means for the expense of going to london this timethat she has done it twice for me and cant this time the purse being low and unless we go to her she must do without seeing me in spite of a separation of four years so i am anxious to go of course  robert will have told you of our dear friend here we began by finding him much better than we expected but gradually the sad truth deepens that he is very illoh it deepens and saddens at once the face lights up with the warm generous heart then the fire drops and you see the embers the breath is very difficultit is hard to live he leans on the table saying softly and pathetically my god my god now and then he desires aloud to pass away and be at rest i cannot tell you what his kindness ishis consideration is too affecting kinder he is than ever miss bayley is an excellent nurseat once gentle and decidedand if she did but look further than this life and this death she would be a perfect companion for him peni creeps about like a mouse but he goes out and he isnt overtired as he was at ventnor we think he is altogether better in looks and ways  your affectionate ba                                        a short visit to taunton seems to have been made about the end of september as anticipated in the last letter and then at some time in the course of october they set out for florence but mrs browning in thus quitting england for the last time left behind her as a legacy the completed volume of aurora leigh this poem was the realisation of her early scheme which goes back at least to the year 1844 of writing a novel in versea novel modern in setting and ideas and embodying her own ideals of social and moral progress and to a large extent she succeeded as a vehicle of her opinions the scheme and style of the poem proved completely adequate she moves easily through the story she handles her metre with freedom and command she can say her say without exaggeration or unnatural strain further the opinions themselves as those who have learnt to know her through her letters will feel sure are lofty and honourable and full of a genuine enthusiasm for humanity as a novel aurora leigh may be open to the criticism that most of the characters fail to impress us with a sense of reality and vitality and that the hero hardly wins the sympathy from the reader which he is meant to win but as a poem it is unquestionably a very remarkable worknot so full of permanent poetic spirit as the sonnets from the portuguese not so readily popular as the cry of the children or cowpers gravebut a highly characteristic work of one whose character was made up of pure thoughts and noble ideals which in spite of the inevitable change of manners and social interests with the lapse of years will retain into an indefinite future a very considerable intrinsic value as poetry and a very high rank among the works of its author  at the time of its publication its success was immediate the subjects touched on were largely such as always attract interest because they are open to much controversy and the freshness of style and originality of conception for almost the only other novelpoem in the language is don juan which can hardly be regarded as of the same type as aurora leigh attracted a multitude of readers a second edition was required in a fortnight a third in a few monthsa success which must have greatly pleased the authoress who had put her inmost self into her work and had laboured hard to leave behind her an adequate representation of her poetic art  this natural satisfaction was darkened however by the death on december 3 of mr kenyon in whose house the poem had been completed and to whom it had been dedicated readers of these letters do not require to be told how near and dear a friend he had been to both mrs browning and her husband during his life his friendship had taken the practical form of allowing them 100l a year in order that they might be more free to follow their art for its own sake only and in his will he left 6500l to robert browning and 4500l to mrs browning these were the largest legacies in a very generous willthe fitting end to a life passed in acts of generosity and kindness to those in need                                        to miss browning  florence november 1856  robert says he will wait for me till tomorrow but i leave my other letters rather and write to you so sure i am that we oughtnt to put that off any longer dearest sarianna i am very much pleased that you like the poem having feared a little that you might not m milsand will not i prophesy seeing as from a tower the end of all the athenæum is right in supposing that it will be much liked and much disliked by people in general although the press is so far astonishing in its goodwill and although the extravagance of private letters might well surprise the warmest of my friends but patience in a little while we shall have the other side of the question and the whips will fall fast after the nosegays still i am surprised i own at the amount of success and that goldenhearted robert is in ecstasies about itfar more than if it all related to a book of his own the form of the story and also something in the philosophy seem to have caught the crowd as to the poetry by itself anything good in that repels rather i am not as blind as romney not to perceive this he had to be blinded observe to be made to see just as marian had to be dragged through the uttermost debasement of circumstances to arrive at the sentiment of personal dignity i am sorry but indeed it seemed necessary  you tantalise me with your account of warm days it is warmer with us today but we have had snow on all the mountains and poor isa has been halffrozen at her villa as for me i have suffered wonderfully littleno more than discomfort and languor we have piled up the wood in this room and the next and had a perpetual blaze not for ten years has there been in florence such a november is this italy says poor fanny haworths wondering face still she likes florence better than she did  is it not strange that dear mr kenyon should have lost his brother by this sudden stroke strange and sad he was suffering too under a relapse when the news camewhich miss bayley says did not dangerously affect him after all oh sad and strange i pity the unfortunate wife more than anyone she said to me this summer i could not live without him let us hope in god that he and i may die at the same moment  theres much good in dear m milsands idea for us about paris and the south of france still im rather glad to be quite outside the world for a little during these first steps of aurora best love to the dear nonno may god bless you both  your ever affectionate ba  oh the spirits hate of hume and belief in the facts are universal here                                        to miss i blagden  about december 1856  my dearest isajust before your note came i had the pleasure of burning my own to you yesterday which was not called for as i expected you would have seen from that that robert was going to you of his own accord and mine  i am rather glad you have not seen the athenæum the analysis it gives of my poem is so very unfair and partial you would say the conception was really null it does not console me at all that i should be praised and overpraised the idea given of the poem remaining so absolutely futile even the outside shell of the plan is but half given and the double action of the metaphysical intention entirely ignored i protest against it still robert thinks the article not likely to do harm perhaps not only one hates to be misrepresented  so glad i am that robert was good last night he told me he had been defending swedenborg and the spirits which suggested to me some notion of superhuman virtue on his part yes love him he is my right glory and the lute and harp would go for nothing beside him even if athenæums spelled one out properly  dearest isa may god bless you let me hear by a word when ansuno passes how you are your loving  ebb                                        the following letter was written almost immediately after the receipt of the news of mr kenyons death mrs kinney to whom it is addressed was the wife of the hon william burnett kinney who was united states minister at the court of sardinia in 1851 after his term of office he removed to florence for the purpose of producing an historical work but he did not live to accomplish it mrs kinney who was herself a poet was also the mother of the wellknown american poet and critic mr ec stedman51                                        to mrs wb kinney  casa guidi friday evening december 1856  your generous sympathy my dear mrs kinney would have made me glad yesterday if i had not been so very very sad with some news of the day before telling me of the loss of the loved friend to whom that book is dedicated so sad i was that i could not lift up my head to write and express to you how gratefully i felt the recognition of your letter you are most generousoverflowingly generous if i said i wished to deserve it better it would be like wishing you less generous so i wont i will only thank you from my heart that shall be all i shall say  affectionately yours always elizabeth barrett browning                                        to mrs jameson  florence december 26 1856 postmark  my ever dear friendto have three letters from you all unanswered seems really to discredit me to myself while it gives such proof of your kindness and affection no other excuse is to be offered but the sort of interruption which sadness gives i really had not the heart to sit down and talk of my aurora even in reference to the pleasure and honour brought to me by the expression of your opinion when the beloved friend associated with the poor book was lost to me in this world gone where perhaps he no longer sympathises with pleasure or honour of mine nowfor nearly the first time perhaps after such separations the sense of distance is the thing felt first and certainly my book at least is naturally saddened to me and the success of it wholesomely spoiled  yet your letter my dearest mona nina arrived in time to give me great great pleasuretrue pleasure indeed and most tenderly do i thank you for it i have had many of such letters from persons loved less and whose opinions had less weight and you will like to hear that in a fortnight after publication chapman had to go to press with the second edition in fact the kind of reception given to the book has much surprised me as i was prepared for an outcry of quite another kind and extravagances in a quite opposite sense this has been left however to the press the post and the tablet who calls aurora a brazenfaced woman and brands the story as a romance in the manner of frederic souliéin reference of course to its gross indecency  i cant leave this subject without noticing by the way what you say of the likeness to the catastrophe of jane eyre i have sent to the library here for jane eyre but havent got it yet in order to refresh my memory on this point but as far as i do recall the facts the hero was monstrously disfigured and blinded in a fire the particulars of which escape me and the circumstance of his being hideously scarred is the thing impressed chiefly on the readers mind certainly it remains innermost in mine now if you read over again those pages of my poem you will find that the only injury received by romney in the fire was from a blow and from the emotion produced by the circumstances of the fire not only did he not lose his eyes in the fire but he describes the ruin of his house as no blind man could he was standing there a spectator afterwards he had a fever and the eyes the visual nerve perished showing no external stainperished as miltons did i believe that a great shock on the nerves might produce such an effect in certain constitutions and the reader on referring as far back as marians letter when she avoided the marriage may observe that his eyes had never been strong that her desire had been to read his notes at night and save them for it was necessary i thought to the bringingout of my thought that romney should be mulcted in his natural sight the examiner saw that tell me if on looking into the book again you modify your feeling at all  dearest mona nina you are well now are you not your last dear letter seems brighter altogether and seems to promise too that quiet in italy will restore the tone of your spirits and health do you know i almost advise you though it is like speaking against my heart to go from marseilles to rome straight and to give us the spring the spring is beautiful in florence and then i should be free to go and see the pictures with you and enjoy you in the indoor and outofdoor way both  you will have heard we heard it only three days ago how our kindest friend who never forgot us remembered us in his will the legacy is eleven thousand pounds six thousand five hundred of which are left to robert marking delicately a sense of trust for which i am especially grateful of course this addition to our income will free us from the pressure which has been upon us hitherto but oh how much sadness goes to making every gain in this world it has been a sad sad christmas to me a great gap is left among friends and the void catches the eyes of the soul whichever way it turns he has been to me in much what my father might have been and now the place is empty twice over  you are yet unconvinced you will be convinced one day i think here are wideawake men some of them most antispiritual to this hour as to theory who agree in giving testimony to facts of one order you shall hear their testimony when you come as to the supernatural if you mean by that the miraculous the suspension of natural law i certainly believe in it no more than you do what happens happens according to a natural law the development of which only becomes fuller and more observable the movement such as it is is accelerated and the whole structure of society in america is becoming affected more or less for good or evil and very often for evil through the extreme tenacity or slowness of those who ought to be leaders in every revolution of thought but who on this subject are pleased to leave their places to the unqualified and the fanatical wise men will be sorry presently when faraday was asked to go and see hume to see a heavy table lifted without the touch of a finger he answered that he had not time time has its revenges  i am very glad that dear mr procter has had some of these last benefits of one beloved by so many what a loss what a loss was there no bequest to yourself we have heard scarcely anything  may god bless you dearest mona nina with the blessing of years old and new  roberts love your ever attached  ba                                        to mrs martin  florence december 29 1856  my dearest mrs martini am very very sorry i feel for you to the bottom of my heart but she was a pure spirit leaning out the way god had marked for her to go and you had not associated this world too much with her as if she could have been meant to stay long in it always you felt that she was about to godid you not dear friendand so that she does not stay cannot be an astonishment to you the pain is the same only it cant be the bitter unnatural pain of certain separations her sweetness has gone to the sweet her lovely nature to the lovely no violence was done to her in carrying her home may god enable you to dwell on this till you are satisfiedglad and not sorry that the spirits do not go far and that they love us still has grown to me surer and surer and yet how death shakes us  yes indeed i too have been very very sad this christmas has come to me like a cloud i can scarcely fancy england without that bright face and sympathetic hand that princely nature in which you might put your trust more reasonably than in princes these ten years back he has stood to me almost in my fathers place and now the place is emptydoubly since the birth of my child seven years since he has allowed usrather insisted on our accepting for my husband was lotha hundred a year and without it we should have often been in hard straits his last act was to leave us eleven thousand pounds and i do not doubt but that if he had not known our preference of a simple mode of life and a freedom from worldly responsibilities born artists as we both are the bequest would have been greater still as it is we shall be relieved from pecuniary pressure and your affectionateness will be glad to hear this but i shall have more comfort from the consideration of it presently than i can at this instant when the loss the empty chair the silent voice the apparently suspended sympathy must still keep painfully uppermost  you will wonder at a paragraph from the athenæum which robert thought out of taste until he came to understand the motive of itthat there had been two days previous to its appearance a brutal attack on the will to the effect that literary persons had been altogether overlooked in the dispositions of the testator in consequence of his being a disappointed literary pretender himself therefore we were brought forward you see together with barry cornwall and dr southey producing a wrong impression on the other sideonly i cant blame the athenæum writer for it nor can anyone i think the effect however to ourselves is most uncomfortable as we are overwhelmed with congratulations on all sides just as if we had not lost a dear tender faithful friend and relativejust as if in fact some stranger had made us a bequest as a tribute to our poetry people are so obtuse in this worldas robert says so dense as lord brougham says so crass  whatever may be your liking or disliking of aurora leigh you will like to hear that its a great success and in a way which i the least expected for a fortnight after the day of publication it had to go to press for the second edition the extravagances written to me about that book would make you laugh if you were in a laughing mood and the strange thing is that the press the daily and weekly press upon which i calculated for furious abuse has been for the most part furious the other way the press newspaper the post and the tablet are exceptions but for the rest the athenæum is the coldest in praising its a puzzle to me altogether i dont know upon what principle the public likes and dislikes poems any way it is very satisfactory at the end of a laborious work for much hard working and hard thinking have gone to it to hear it thus recognised however i must think with some bitterness that the beloved and sympathetic friend to whom it was dedicated scarcely lived to know what would have given him so much pleasure as this  dearest mrs martin mind you tell me the truth exactly i should like much to have pleased you and mr martin but i like the truth best of all from you  dearest friends keep kind thoughts of  your affectionate ba                                        to miss browning  florence january 1857  my dearest sariannaa great many happy years to you and also to the dear nonno i am glad for my part to be out of the last which has been gloomy and almost embittering to me personally but we must throw our burdens behind our backs as far as possible and be cheerful for the rest of the road if robert alone wrote about aurora i wont leave it to him to be alone grateful to dear m milsand for his extraordinary kindness do tell him with my love that i could not have expected it even from himselfwhich is saying much most thankfully i leave everything to his discretion and judgment on this subject i have been from the beginning divided between my strong desire of being translated and my strong fear of being illtranslated harrison ainsworths novels are quite one thing and a poem of mine quite another oh yes and yet so great is my faith in milsand that the touch of his hand and the overseership of his eyes must tranquillise me i am simply grateful  peni has been overwhelmed with gifts this year i gave him on christmas day by his own secret inspiration a sword with a blade to dazzle the eyes robert a box of tools and carpenters bench and we united in a robinson crusoe who was well received then from others he had sleevestuds a silver pencilcase books c according to his own magniloquent phrase he was exceptionally happy he has taken to long words i heard him talking of evidences the other day poor little pen its the more funny that he has by no means yet left off certain of his babyisms of articulation and the combined effects are curious you asked of ferdinando52 penis attachment for ferdinando is undiminished ferdinando cant be found fault with even in gentleness without a burst of tears on penis part lately i ventured to ask not to be left quite alone in the house on certain occasions and though i spoke quite kindly there was peni in tears assuring me that we ought to have another servant to open the door for that poor ferdinando had a great deal too much work when i ventured to demur to that the next charge was plainly i did not love ferdinando as much as i loved penini which i could not deny and then with passionate sobs peni said that i was very unjust indeed indeed indeed dear mama you are unjust ferdinando does everything for you and i do nothing except tease you and even sobbing i am sometimes a very naughty boy i had to mop up his tears with my pockethandkerchief and excuse myself as well as i could from the moral imputation of loving peni better than ferdinando  we have been very glad in a visit from frederick tennyson god bless you robert wont wait  your ever attached ba                                        to mrs jameson  florence february 2 1857 postmark  my dearest mona ninato begin lest i forget before the ending dont mind the sugartongs if you have not actually bought them inasmuch as to my astonishment wilson has found a pair in florence marking the progress of civilisation in this south in paris last winter we sought in vain there was nothing between ones fingers and real silvertoo expensive for poets but now we are supplied splendidlyand at the cost of five pauls let me tell you  always delighted i am to have your letters even when you dont tell me as touchingly as in this that mine are something to you do i not indeed love you and sympathise with you fully and deeply yes indeed on one subject i am afraid to touch but i know why it is you feel so long so undulyso morbidly in a sense people in general knowing themselves to be innocently made to suffer would take comfort in righteous indignation and justified contempt but to you the indignation and contempt would be the worst part of suffering you cant bear it and you are in a strait between the two in fact it relieves you rather to take part against yourself and to conclude on the whole that theres something really bad in you calling on the pure heavens for vengeance yes thats you you sympathise tenderly with your executioner  and as for the criticsyes indeed i agree with you that i have no reason to complain more than that i confess to you that i am entirely astonished at the amount of reception i have met withi who expected to be put in the stocks and pelted with the eggs of the last twenty years singing birds as a disorderly woman and freethinking poet people have been so kind that in the first place i really come to modify my opinions somewhat upon their conventionality to see the progress made in freedom of thought think of quite decent women taking the part of the book in a sort of effervescence which i hear of with astonishment in fact there has been an enormous quantity of extravagance talked and written on the subject and i know itoh i know it i wish i deserved some thingssome things i wish it were all true but i see too distinctly what i ought to have written still it is nearer the mark than my former effortsfuller stronger more sustainedand one may be encouraged to push on to something worthier for i dont feel as if i had done yetno indeed i have had from leigh hunt a very pleasant letter of twenty pages and i think i told you of the two from john ruskin in america also theres great success and the publisher is said to have shed tears over the proofs perhaps in reference to the hundred pounds he had to pay for them and the critics congratulate me on having worked myself clear of all my affectations mannerisms and other morbidities  even blackwood is not to be complained of seeing that the writer evidently belongs to an elder school and judges from his own point of view he is wrong though even in classical matters as it seems to me  i heard one of thackerays lectures the one on george the third and thought it better than goodfine and touching to what is it that people are objecting at any rate they crowd and pay  ah yes you appreciate robert you know what is in his poetry certainly there is no pretension in me towards that profound suggestiveness and i thank you for knowing it and saying it  there is a real poem being lived between mr kirkup and the spirits so called53 if i were to write it in a poem i should beat aurora over and over and such a tragic face the old man has with his bleak white beard even robert is touched  best love from him and your  ever attached ba                                         to mrs martin  florence february 1857  my dearest mrs martini neednt say how much how very much pleasure your letter gave me that the poem should really have touched you reached you with whatever drawbacks is a joy and then that mr martin should have read it with any sort of interest it was more than i counted on as you know thank you dearest mrs martinthank both of you for so much sympathy  in respect to certain objections i am quite sure you do me the justice to believe that i do not willingly give cause for offence without going as far as robert who holds that i couldnt be coarse if i tried only that you will grant that i dont habitually dabble in the dirt its not the way of my mind or life if therefore i move certain subjects in this work it is because my conscience was first moved in me not to ignore them what has given most offence in the book more than the story of marianfar morehas been the reference to the condition of women in our cities which a woman oughtnt to refer to by any manner of means says the conventional tradition now i have thought deeply otherwise if a woman ignores these wrongs then may women as a sex continue to suffer them there is no help for any of uslet us be dumb and die i have spoken therefore and in speaking have used plain wordswords which look like blots and which you yourself would put awaywords which if blurred or softened would imperil perhaps the force and righteousness of the moral influence still i certainly will when the time comes go over the poem carefully and see where an offence can be got rid of without loss otherwise the second edition was issued so early that robert would not let me alter even a comma would not let me look between the pages in order to the least alteration he said the truth that my head was dizzyblind with the book and that if i changed anything it would be probably for the worse like arranging a room in the dark oh no indeed he is not vexed that you should say what you do on the contrary he was pleased because of the much more that you said as to your friend with the susceptible moralswell i could not help smiling indeed i am assured too by a friend of my own that the mamas of england in a body refuse to let their daughters read it still the daughters emancipate themselves and do that is certain for the number of young women not merely the strongminded as a sect but pretty affluent happy women surrounded by all the temptations of english respectability that cover it with the most extravagant praises is surprising to me who was not prepared for that particular kind of welcome its true that theres a quantity of hate to balance the love only i think it chiefly seems to come from the less advanced part of society see how modest that sounds but you will know what i mean i mean from persons whose opinions are not in a state of growth and who do not like to be disturbed from a settled position oh that there are faults in the book no human being knows so well as i defects weaknesses great gaps of intelligence dont let me stop to recount them  the review in blackwood proves to be by mr aytoun and coming from the camp of the enemy artistically and socially cannot be considered other than generous it is not quite so by the north british where another poet patmore who knows more is somewhat depreciatory i cant help feeling  now will you be sick of my literature but you liked to hear you said if you would see besides i would show you what george sent me the other day a number of the national magazine with the most hideous engraving from a medallion you could imaginethe head of a strongminded giantess on the neck of a bull and my name underneath penini said its not a bit like its too old and not half so prettywhich was comforting under the trying circumstance if anything could comfort one in despair  your ever most affectionate ba                                        to miss browning  florence february 1857  my dearest sariannai am delighted and so is robert that you should have found what pleases you in the clock here is peninis letter which takes up so much room that i must be sparing of mineand by the way if you consider him improved in his writing give the praise to robert who has been taking most patient pains with him indeed you will see how the little curly head is turned with carnival doings so gay a carnival never was in our experiencefor until last year when we were absent all masks had been prohibited and now everybody has eaten of the tree of good and evil till not an apple was left peni persecuted me to let him have a domino with tears and embraces he almost never in all his life had had a domino and he would like it so not a black dominono he hated blackbut a blue domino trimmed with pink that was his taste the pink trimming i coaxed him out of but for the rest i let him have his way darling child and certainly it answered as far as the overflow of joy in his little heart went never was such delight morning and evening there he was in the streets running wilson out of breath and lost sight of every ten minutes now lily i do pray you not to call out penini penini not to be known was his immense ambition oh of course he thought of nothing else as to lessons there was an absolute absence of wits all florence being turned out into the streets in one gigantic pantomime one couldnt expect people to be wiser indoors than out for my part the universal madness reached me sitting by the fire whence i had not stirred for three months and you will open your eyes when i tell you that i went in domino and masked to the great opera ball yes i did really robert who had been invited two or three times to other peoples boxes had proposed to return this kindness by taking a box himself at the opera this night and entertaining two or three friends with gallantina and champagne just as he and i were lamenting the impossibility of my going on that very morning the wind changed the air grew soft and mild and he maintained that i might and should go there was no time to get a domino of my own robert himself had a beautiful one made and i am having it metamorphosed into a black silk gown for myself so i sent out and hired one buying the mask and very much amused i was i like to see these characteristic things i shall never rest sarianna till i risk my reputation at the bal de lopéra at paris do you think i was satisfied with staying in the box no indeed down i went and robert and i elbowed our way through the crowd to the remotest corner of the ball below somebody smote me on the shoulder and cried bella mascherina and i answered as imprudently as one feels under a mask at two oclock in the morning however i had to give up and come away being overcome by the heavy air and ingloriously left robert and our friends to follow at halfpast four think of the refinement and gentlenessyes i must call it superiorityof this people when no excess no quarrelling no rudeness nor coarseness can be observed in the course of such wild masked liberty not a touch of license anywhere and perfect social equality ferdinando side by side in the same ballroom with the grand duke and no classs delicacy offended against for the grand duke went down into the ballroom for a short time the boxes however were dear we were on a third tier yet paid 2l 5s english besides entrance money i think that generally speaking theatrical amusements are cheaper in paris in spite of apparent cheapnesses here the pit here and stalls are cheap but women in society cant go there it is said and you must take a whole box if you want two seats in a boxwhich seems to me monstrous people combine generally  ever affectionate ba  i meant to write only a wordand see may it not be overweight                                        to mrs jameson  florence april 9 1857  dearest madonnai must not wait lest i miss you in your transit to naples thank you for your dear letter then the weather has burst suddenly into summer though it rains a little this morning and i have been let out of prison to drive in the cascine and to bellosguardo beautiful beautiful florence how beautiful at this time of year the trees stand in their green mist as if in a trance of joy oh i do hope nothing will drive us out of our paradise this summer for i seem to hate the north more unnaturally than ever  mrs stowe has just arrived and called here yesterday and this morning when robert took her to see the salvators at the end of our street i like her better than i thought i shouldthat is i find more refinement in her voice and mannerno rampant americanisms very simple and gentle with a sweet voice undesirous of shining or posering so it seems to me never did lioness roar more softly that is quite certain and the temptations of a sudden enormous popularity should be estimated in doing her full justice she is nicelooking too and theres something strong and copious and characteristic in her dusky wavy hair for the rest the brow has not very large capacity and the mouth wants something both in frankness and sensitiveness i should say but what can one see in a morning visit i must wait for another opportunity she spends tomorrow evening with us and talks of remaining in florence till the end of next weekso i shall see and hear more her books are not so much to me i confess as the fact is that she above all women yes and men of the age has moved the worldand for good  i hear that mrs gaskell is coming whom i am sure to like and love i know that by her letters though i was stupid or idle enough to let our correspondence go by and by her books which i earnestly admire how anxious i am to see the life of charlotte brontë but we shall have to wait for it here  dearest friend you dont mention madme de goethe but i do hope you will have her with you before long the good to you will be immense and after friendship and reason the sun and moon and earth of italy will work for you in their places may god grant to us all that you may be soon strong enough to throw every burden behind you the griefs that are incurable are those which have our own sins festering in them  on april 6 we had tea out of doors on the terrace of our friend miss blagden in her villa up at bellosguardo not exactly aurora leighs54 mind you seemed to be lifted up above the world in a divine ecstasy oh what a vision  have you read victor hugos contemplations we are doing so at last as for me my eyes and my heart melted over themsome of the personal poems are overcoming in their pathos and nothing more exquisite in poetry can express deeper pain  robert comes back he says that mrs stowe was very simple and pleasant he likes her so shall i i think she has the grace too to admire our florence  your ever affectionate ba  i dare say the illustrations will be beautiful but you are at work on a new book are you not                                        the mention of the contemplations of victor hugo in the preceding letter supplies a clue to the date of the following draft of an appeal to the emperor napoleon on behalf of the poet which has been found among mrs brownings papers an endorsement on the letter says that it was not sent but it is none the less worthy of being printed                                        to the emperor napoleon  april 1857  sirei am only a woman and have no claim on your majestys attention except that of the weakest on the strongest probably my very name as the wife of an english poet and as named itself a little among english poets is unknown to your majesty i never approached my own sovereign with a petition nor am skilled in the way of addressing kings yet having through a studious and thoughtful life grown used to great men among the dead at least i cannot feel entirely at a loss in speaking to the emperor napoleon  and i beseech you to have patience with me while i supplicate you it is not for myself nor for mine  i have been reading with wet eyes and a swelling heart as many who love and some who hate your majesty have lately done a book called the contemplations of a man who has sinned deeply against you in certain of his political writings and who expiates rash phrases and unjustifiable statements in exile in jersey i have no personal knowledge of this man i never saw his face and certainly i do not come now to make his apology it is indeed precisely because he cannot be excused that i think he might worthily be forgiven for this man whatever else he is not is a great poet of france and the emperor who is the guardian of her other glories should remember him and not leave him out ah sire what was written on napoleon le petit does not touch your majesty but what touches you is that no historian of the age should have to write hereafter while napoleon iii reigned victor hugo lived in exile what touches you is that when your people count gratefully the men of commerce arms and science secured by you to france no voice shall murmur but where is our poet what touches you is that however statesmen and politicians may justify his exclusion it may draw no sigh from men of sentiment and impulse yes and from women like myself what touches you is that when your own beloved young prince shall come to read these poems and when you wish him a princely nature you wish sire that such things should move him he may exult to recall that his imperial father was great enough to overcome this great poet with magnanimity  ah sire you are great enough you can allow for the peculiarity of the poetical temperament for the temptations of high gifts for the fever in which poets are apt to rage and suffer beyond the measure of other men you can consider that when they hate most causelessly there is a divine love in them somewhere and that when they see most falsely they are loyal to some ideal light forgive this enemy this accuser this traducer disprove him by your generosity let no tear of an admirer of his poetry drop upon your purple make an exception of him as god made an exception of him when he gave him genius and call him back without condition to his country and his daughters grave  i have written these words without the knowledge of any naturally i should have preferred as a woman to have addressed them through the mediation of the tenderhearted empress eugénie but a wife myself i felt it would be harder for her majesty to pardon an offence against the emperor napoleon than it could be for the emperor  and i am driven by an irresistible impulse to your majestys feet to ask this grace it is a womans voice sire which dares to utter what many yearn for in silence i have believed in napoleon iii passionately loving the democracy i have understood from the beginning that it was to be served throughout europe in you and by you i have trusted you for doing greatly i will trust you besides for pardoning nobly you will be napoleon in this also  elizabeth barrett browning  illustration                                        shortly after this date on april 17 mrs brownings father died in the course of the previous summer an attempt made by a relative to bring about a reconciliation between him and his daughters was met with the answer that they had disgraced his family and although he professed to have forgiven them he refused all intercourse removed his family out of town when the brownings came thither and declined to give his daughter henriettas address to mr kenyons executor who was instructed to pay her a small legacy a further attempt at reconciliation was made by mrs martin only a few months before his death but had no better success his pride stood in the way of his forgiveness to the end  on receiving the news of his death the following letter was written by robert browning to mrs martin but it was not until two months later that mrs browning was able to bring herself to write to anyone outside her own family                                        robert browning to mrs martin  florence may 3 1857  my dear mrs martintruest thanks for your letter we had the intelligence from george last thursday week having been only prepared for the illness by a note received from arabel the day before ba was sadly affected at first miserable to see and hear after a few days tears came to her relief she is now very weak and prostrated but improving in strength of body and mind i have no fear for the result i suppose you know at least the very little that we know and how unaware poor mr barrett was of his imminent death he bade them says arabel make him comfortable for the night but a moment before the last and he had dismissed her and her aunt about an hour before with a cheerful or careless word about wishing them good night so it is all over now all hope of better things or a kind answer to entreaties such as i have seen ba write in the bitterness of her heart there must have been something in the organisation or education at least that would account for and extenuate all this but it has caused grief enough i know and now here is a new grief not likely to subside very soon not that ba is other than reasonable and just to herself in the matter she does not reproach herself at all it is all mere grief as i say that this should have been so and i sympathise with her there  george wrote very affectionately to tell me and dear admirable arabel sent a note the very next day to prove to ba that there was nothing to fear on her account since then we have heard nothing the funeral was to take place in herefordshire we had just made up our minds to go on no account to england this year ba felt the restraint on her too horrible to bear i will or she will no doubt write and tell you of herself and you must write dear mrs martin will you not  kindest regard to mr martin and all  yours faithfully ever robert browning                                        eb browning to mrs martin  florence july 1 1857  thank you thank you from my heart my dearest friendthis poor heart which has been so torn and mangledfor your dear tender sympathy whether expressed in silence or in words of the past i cannot speak you understand yes you understand and when i say that you understand and feel that you do it is an expression of belief in the largeness of your power of understanding seeing that few can understandfew can there has been great bitternessgreat bitterness which is natural and some recoil against myself more perhaps than is quite rational now i am much better calm and not despondingly calm as off and on i have been able to read and talk and keep from vexing my poor husband who has been a good deal tried in all these things through these three months you and what you told me touched me with a thought of comfortcame the nearest to me of all may god bless you and return it to you a hundredfold dear dear friend  i believe hope had died in me long ago of reconciliation in this world strange that what i called unkindness for so many years in departing should have left to me such a sudden desolation and yet it is not strange perhaps  no i cannot write any more you will understand  we shall be in paris next summer this year we remain quietly where we are presently we may creep to the seaside or into the mountains to avoid the great heats but no further my temptation is to lie on the sofa and never stir nor speak only i dont give up be certain i drive out for two or three hours on most days and i hear penis lessons and am good and obedient if i could get into hard regular work of some kind it would be excellent for me i know but the flesh is weak oh no to have gone to england this summer would have helped nobody and would have been very overcoming to me i was not fit for it indeed and robert was averse on his own account  may god bless you both dearest friends my little penini is bright and well i have begun to teach him german i do hope you wont fatigue yourselves too much at colwall enjoy the summer and the roses and be well be well we shall meet next year  once more goodbye  your ever affectionate and grateful ba  roberts love as ever  this is the first letter i have written to anyone out of my own family i hate writing and cant help being stupid                                        to miss ef haworth  florence about july 1857  i write soon you see dearest fanny i thank you for all but i do beseech you dear not to say a word more to me of what is said of me the truth is i am made of paper and it tears me do not dear make no reference to things personal to myself as far as i could read and understand it was absurd perfectly ungenuine i shall say nothing to anybody i have torn that sheet do not refer to the subject to isa blagden and therei have done  noi thank you and i know it was your kindness entirely will you if you love me not touch on the subject i mean on the personal thing to myself in your next letters not even by saying that you were sorry you did once touch on them i know how foolish and morbid i must seem to you so i am made and i cant help my idiosyncrasies  now dont mistake me tell me all about the spirits only not about what they say of me i am very interested the drawback is that without any sort of doubt they personate falsely  we are seething in the heat the last three days have been a composition of gehenna and paradise it is a perpetual steam bath yet robert and i have not finished our plans for escaping mrs jameson is here still recovering her health and spirits the villa hospitality goes on as usual and the evening before last we had tea on the terrace by a divine sunset with a favoring breath or two only even there we wished for lazaruss finger  certainly florence will not be bearable many days longer write to me though at florence as usual  it is said that hume who is back again in paris and under the shadow of the emperors wing has been the means of an extraordinary manifestation two spiritual figures male and female who were recognised by their friends five or six persons including the medium fainted away at this apparition it happened in paris lately  yes i mistrust the mediums less than i do the spirits who write tell me  write and tell me everything with exceptions such as i have set down and forgive my poor brittle body which shakes and breaks may god love you dear  yours in true affection ba                                        at the end of july florence had become unbearable and the brownings removed for the third time to the bagni di lucca whither they were followed by some of their friends notably miss blagden and mr robert lytton unfortunately their holiday was marred by the dangerous illness of lytton which not only kept them in great anxiety for a considerable time but also entailed much labour in nursing on mr browning and miss blagden besides mrs brownings letters a letter from her husband to his sister is given below containing an account of the earlier stages of the illness                                        robert browning to miss browning  bagni di lucca august 18 1857  dearestwe arrived here on the 30th last and two or three days after were followed by miss blagden miss bracken and lyttonall for our sake they not otherwise wanting to come this way lytton arrived unwell got worse soon and last friday week was laid up with a sort of nervous fever caused by exposure to the sun or something acting on his nervous frame since then he has been very ill in beddoctor anxiety c as you may suppose they are exactly opposite us at twelve or fifteen feet distance only through sentimentality and economy combined isa would have no nurse an imbecile arrangement and all has been done by her with me to help i have sate up four nights out of the last five and sometimes been there nearly all day beside55 he is much better today taken broth and will i hope have no relapse poor fellow imagine what a pleasant holiday we all have otherwise the place is very beautiful and cool exceedingly we have done nothing notable yet but all are very well peni particularly so as for me i bathe in the river a rapid little mountain stream every morning at 612 and find such good from the practice that i shall continue it and whatever i can get as like it as possible to the end of my days i hope the strength of all sorts therefrom accruing is wonderful i thought the shower baths perfection but this is far above it i was so rejoiced to hear from you and think you so wise in staying another month i sent the ath to 151 r de g kindest love to papa we cant get news from england but the americans have paid up the rest of the money for aurora by the by in this new book of ruskins the drawing book56 he says aurora leigh is the finest poem written in any language this century there is a review of it which i have not yet got in the rivista di firenze of this month god bless you i will write very soon again do you write at once ba will add a word how fortunate about the books how is milsand pray always remember my best love to him                                        eb browning to miss browning  same date  my dearest sariannarobert will have told you i dare say what a heavy time we have had here with poor lytton it was imprudent of him to come to florence at the hottest of the year and to expose himself perfectly unacclimated and the chance by which he was removed here just in time to be nursed was happy for him and all of us we have had great heat in the days even here of courseno blotting out even by mountains of the italian sun but the cool nights extenuate very muchrefresh and heal now i do hope the corner is turned of the illness isa blagden has been devoted sitting up night after night and robert has sate up four nights that she might not really die at her post there is nothing infectious in the fever so dont be afraid robert is quite well with good appetite and good spirits and peni is like a rose possessed by a fairy they both bathe in the river and profit as i am so glad you do not that its a real river though it has a name the lima a mere mountain stream which curls itself up into holes in the rocks to admit of bathing then as far as they have been able on account of lytton they have had riding on donkeys and mountain ponies peni as bold as a lion  the last words of the letter with the signature have been cut off                                        to mrs jameson  la villa bagni di lucca august 22 1857  as you bid me write my dear friend about lytton i write but i grieve to say we are still very uneasy about him for sixteen days he has been prostrate with this gastric fever and the disease is not baffled though the pulse is not high nor the head at all affected dr trotman however is uncheerful about himis what medical men call cautious in giving an opinion observing that though at present he is not in danger the delicacy of his constitution gives room for great apprehension in the case of the least turning towards relapse robert had been up with him during eight nights and isa blagden eight nights nothing can exceed her devotion to him by night or day we have persuaded her however at last to call in a nurse for the nights i am afraid for robert and in fact a trained nurse can do certain things better than the most zealous and tender friend can pretend to do you may suppose how saddened we all are dear lytton at intervals he talks and can hear reading but this morning he is lower again in fact from the first he has been very apprehensive about himselfinclined to talk of divine things of the state of his soul and gods love and to hold this life but slackly  i feel i am writing a horrible account to you you will conclude the worst from it and that is what i dont want you to do the pulse has never been high and is now much lower and if he can be kept from a relapse he will live i pray god he may live he is not altered in the face and dr trotman reiterated this morning there is no danger at present  you are better i thank god for it oh yes it is very beautiful that cathedral the weather here is cool and enjoyable by day even at nights it is really cold and i have thought of a blanket once or twice as of a thing tolerable i will write again when there is a change the course of the fever may extend to six days more  your ever most affectionate ba                                        to mrs jameson  thursday end of august 1857  dearest friendi think it better to inclose to you this letter which has come to your address thank you for your kind words about lytton which will be very soothing to him he continues better and is preparing to take his first drive today for half an hour with his nurse and robert see how weak he must be and the hollow cheeks and temples remain as signs of the past still he is convalescent and begins to think of poems and apple puddings in a manner other than celestial i do thank god that our anxieties have ended so  robert bathes in the river every morning which does him great good besides the rides at mornings and evenings on mountain ponies with annette bracken and a crimean hero as mrs stisted has it who has turned up at the hotel with one leg and so many agreeable and amiable qualities that everybody is charmed with him  robert had a letter from chapman yesterday not much news he speaks of two penny papers sold lately after making the fortune of their proprietors for twentyfive and thirtyfive thousand pounds if robert could but write bad enough says the learned publisher he should recommend one of them but even charles reade was found too good and the sale fell ten thousand in a few weeks on account of a serial tale of his so he had to make place to his worses chapman hears of a comprehensive review being about to appear in the westminster on aurora whether for or against he cannot tell the third edition sells well  so happy i am to hear that mr procters son is safe we saw his name in the galignani and were alarmed lytton has heard from forster but i had no english news from the letter i get letters from my sisters which make me feel froissée all over except that they seem pretty well my eldest brother has returned from jamaica and has taken a place with a welsh name on the welsh borders for three yearswhat i knew he would do he wrote me some tender words dear fellow  may god bless you  yours in much love ba                                        to miss ef haworth  la villa bagni di lucca september 14 1857 postmark  my dearest fannya letter from me will have crossed yours and told you of all our misadventures it has been a summer to me full of blots vexations anxieties and if in spite of everything i am physically stronger for the fresh air and smell of green leaves thats a proof that soul and body are two  our friends of the hotel went away last saturday and i have a letter from isa blagden with a good account of lytton he goes back to villa bricchieri where they are to house together unless sir edward comes down which he may do to catch up his son and change the plan isa has not quite killed herself with nursing him a little of her being still left to express what has been  now dear fanny i am going to try to tell you of our plans no plans is not the word our thoughts are in the purely elemental state so far but we think of going to rome or naples at the far end of november and of staying here as many days deep into october meanwhile as the cold mountain air will let us on leaving this place we go to florence and wait unless indeed which is possible too we go to egypt and the holy land in which case we shall not remain where we are beyond the end of september  i never could consent to receive my theology or any other species of guidance in factfrom the spirits so called i have no more confidence apart from my own conscience and discretionary selection in spirits out of the body than in those embodied the submission of the whole mind and judgment carries you in either case to the popeor to the devil so i think dont let them bind you hand and foot resist be yourself also where as in the mediumwriting you have the human mixture to evolve the spiritual sentiment from the insecurity becomes doubly insecure  your ever affectionate ba                                        the end of the time at the bagni di lucca was clouded by another anxiety caused by the illness of penini it was not however a long one and early in october the whole party was able to return to florence where they remained throughout the winter and the following spring letters of this period are however scarce and there is nothing particular to record concerning it since the publication of aurora leigh mrs browning had been taking a holiday from poetical composition indeed she never resumed it on a large scale and published no other volume save the poems before congress which were the fruit of a later period of special excitement she had put her whole self into aurora leigh and seemed to have no further message to give to mankind it is evident too that her strength was already beginning to decline and the various family and public anxieties which followed 1856 made demands on what remained of it too great to allow of much application to poetry                                        to miss ef haworth  bagni di lucca monday september 28 1857  you will understand too well why i have waited some days before answering your letter dearest fanny though you bade me write at once when i tell you that my own precious penini has been ill with gastric fever and is even now confined to his bed eleven days ago when he was looking like a live rose and in an exaggeration of spirits he proposed to go with me to run by my portantina in which i went to pay a visit some mile and a half away the portantini men walked too fast for him and he was tired and heated then while i paid my visit he played by the river with a child of the house and returned with me in the dusk he complained of being tired during the return and i took him up into my portantina for ten minutes he was overtired however overheated overchilled and the next day had fever and complained of his head we did not think much of it and the morning after he seemed so recovered that we took him with us to dine in the mountains with some american friends the eckleysdid you hear of them in rometwenty miles in the carriage and ten miles on donkeyback he was in high spirits and came home at night singing at the top of his voiceprobably to keep off the creeping sense of illness for he has confessed since that he felt unwell even then the next day the fever set in the medical man doubted whether it was measles scarlatina or what but soon the symptoms took the decisive aspect he has been in bed strictly confined to bed since last sundayweek nightstrictly confined except for one four hours after which exertion he had a relapse it is the same fever as mr lyttons only not as severe i thank god the attacks coming on at nights chiefly and terrifying us as you may suppose the childs sweetness and goodness too his patience and gentleness have been very trying he said to me you pet dont be unhappy for me think its a poor little boy in the street and be just only a little sorry and not unhappy at all well we may thank god that the bad time seems passed he is still in bed but it is a matter of precaution chiefly the fever is quite in abeyancehas been for two days and we have all to be grateful for two most tranquil nights he amuses himself in putting maps together and cutting out paper and packing up his desk to go to florence which is the idée fixe just now in fact when he can be moved we shall not wait here a day for the rains have set in and the dry elastic air of florence will be excellent for him the medical man an italian promises us almost that we may be able to go in a week from this time but we wont hurry we will run no risks for some days he has been allowed no other sort of nourishment but ten dessertspoonfuls of thin broth twice a dayliterally nothing not a morsel of bread not a drop of tea nothing even now the only change is a few more spoonfuls of the same broth it is hard for his appetite cries out aloud and he has agonising visions of beefsteak pies and buttered toast seen in mirage still his spirits dont fail on the whole and now that the fever is all but gone they rise till we have to beg him to be quiet and not to talk so much he had the flowergirl in by his bedside yesterday and it was quite impossible to help laughing so many florentine airs did he show off per bacco ho una fame terribile e non voglio aver più pazienza con questo dottore the doctor however seems skilful  but you may think how worn out i have been in body and soul and how under these circumstances we think little of jerusalem or of any other place but our home at florence still we shall probably pass the winter either at rome or naples but i know no more than a swaddled baby which also we shant know probably till the end of november when we take out our passports doubt is our element  i must go to my peni i am almost happy about him now and yetoh his lovely rosy cheeks his round fat little shoulders his strength and spring of a month agoat the best we must lose our joy and pride in these for a time may god bless you i know you will feel for me and that makes me so egotistical  your ever affectionate ba                                        to miss browning  florence february 1858  my dearest sariannarobert is going to write to dear m milsand whose goodness is passing that of men of all common friends certainly roberts thanks are worth more than mine and so i shall leave it to robert to thank him  the grippe has gripped us here most universally and no wonder considering our most exceptional weather and better the grippe than the fever which preceded it such cold has not been known here for years and it has extended throughout the south it seems to rome and naples where people are snowed and frozen up so strange the arno for the first time since 47 has had a slice or two of ice on it robert has suffered from the prevailing malady which did not however through the precautions we took touch his throat or chest amounting only to a bad cold in the head peni was afflicted in the same way but in a much slighter degree and both are now quite well as for me i have caught no coldonly losing my breath and my soul in the usual way the cough not being much so that we have no claim any of us on your compassion you see  i think i think miss blackwell has succeeded in frightening you a little in the case of chaos she will fly to england i suppose and even there she may fall on a refugee plot for i have seen a letter of mazzinis in which it was written that people stood on ruins in england and that at any moment there might be a crash certainly confusion in paris would be followed by confusion in italy and everywhere on the continent at least so i should never think of running away let what might happen in 52 and 53 when we were in paris there was more danger than could arise now under a successful plot even for even if the emperor fell the people and the army seem prepared to stand by the dynasty also public order has attained to some of the force of an habitual thing  as to the crime57 it has no more sympathy here than in francebe sure of that that unscrupulous bad party is repudiated by this majorityby this people as a mass i hear nothing but lamentations that italians should be dishonored so by their own hands father prout says that the emperors speech is the most heroic document of this century and in my mind the praise is merited so indignant i feel with mazzini and all who name his name and walk in his steps that i couldnt find it in my heart to write as i was going to do to that poor bewitched jessie on her marriage really when i looked at the pen i couldnt move it  best love from ba                                        to mrs martin  florence march 27 1858  this moment i take up my pen to write to you my dearest mrs martin did you not receive a long letter i wrote to you in paris no answer me categorically  and you are not very strong even now that grieves me but here is the sun to make us all strong for my part my chest has not been particularly wrong this winter nor my cough too troublesome but the weight of the whole year heavy with various kinds of trouble added to a trying winter seems to have stamped out of me the vital fluid and i am physically low to a degree which makes me glad of renewed opportunities of getting the air and i mean to do little but drive out for some time it does not answer to be mastered so for months i have done nothing but dream and read french and german romances and the result of learning a good deal of german isnt the most useful thing in the world one can attain to then of course i teach peni for an hour or so he reads german french and of course italian and plays on the piano remarkably well for which robert deserves the chief credit a very gentle sweet child he is sweet to look at and listen to affectionate and good to live with a real treasure so far his passion is music and as we are afraid of wearing his brain we let him give most of his studytime to the piano  so you want me you expect me i suppose to approve of the miserable undignified unconscientious doings in england on the conspiracy question58 no indeed i would rather we had lost ten battles than stultified ourselves in the house of commons with brummagem brag and derby intrigues before the eyes of europe and america it seems to me utterly pitiful i hold that the most susceptible of nations should not reasonably have been irritated by the walewski despatch which was absolutely true in its statement of facts ah dearest friend how true i know better than you do for i know of knowledge how this doctrine of assassination is held by chief refugees and communicated to their disciples in englandyes to noble hearts and to english hands still innocentmy very soul has bled over these things with my own ears i have heard them justified for nights i have been disturbed in my sleep with the thoughts of them in the name of liberty which i love and of the democracy which i honour i protest against them and if such things can be put down i hold they should be put down and that the conspiracy bill is the smallest and lightest step that can be taken towards the putting down for the rest the great derby intrigue as shown in its acts and as resulting in its state papers nothing in history it seems to me was ever so small and mean  what i think of him why i think he is the only great man of his age speaking of public men i think napoleon iii devant le peuple anglais a magnificent state paper i confess to you it drew the tears to my eyes as i read it so grand so calm so simply true  and now with regard to switzerland you must remember that there is such a thing as an international law and that only last year the swiss appealed in virtue of it to france about the neufchâtel refugees and that france received and acted on that appeal the very translation of the french despatch adds to the injustice done to it in england because insister does not mean to insist upon a thing being done but to urge it upon ones attention  the times the times why the times has intellect but no conscience the times is the most immoral of journals as well as the most able the times on this very question of the conspiracy bill has swerved and veered and dodged till its readers may well be dizzy if they read every paragraph every day  see how i fall into a fury oh liberty i would cry like the woman who did not love liberty more than i dooh liberty what deeds are done in thy name and looking round italy what sorrows are suffered  for i do fear that mazzini is at the root of the evil that man of unscrupulous theory  now you will be enough disgusted with me tell me that you and dear mr martin forgive me i never saw orsini but have heard and known much of him unfortunate man he died better than he livedit is all one can say surely you admit that the permission to read that letter on the trial was largehearted and it has vexed austria to the last degree i am happy to say it was not allowed to be read here by the italian public i mean  our plans are perfectly undefined but we do hope to escape england robert talks of egypt for the winter i dont know what may happen and in the meantime would rather not be pulled and pulled by kind people in england who want me or fancy they do you know everybody is as free as i am now and freer and if they do want me and it isnt fancynever mind we may see you perhaps in paris after all this summer  now let me tell you hume my protégé prophet is in italy think of that he was in pisa and in florence for a day saw friends of his and acquaintances of ours with whom he stayed four months on the last occasion and who implicitly believe in him an englishwoman who from infidel opinions was converted by his instrumentality to a belief in the life after death has died in paris and left him an annuity of £240 english on coming here he paid all his wandering debts i am glad to hear and is even said to have returned certain gifts which had been rendered unacceptable to him from the bad opinion of the givers i hear too that his manners as well as morals are wonderfully improved he is gone to rome and will return here to pay a visit to his friends in florence after a time the object of his coming was health while he passed through tuscany the power seemed to be leaving him but he has recovered it tenfold says my informant so i hope we shall hear of more wonders did you read the article in the westminster the subject se prête au ridicule but ridicule is not disproof the empress eugénie protects his little sister and has her educated in paris  surely i have made up for silence dearest friends both of you may god bless you  your affectionate ba  roberts love and penis                                        in the summer of 1858 an expedition was made to france in order to visit mr brownings father and sister but no attempt was made to extend the journey into england in fact the circle of their flights from florence was becoming smaller and as 1856 saw mrs brownings last visit to england so 1858 saw her last visit to france or indeed beyond the borders of italy at all it was only a short visit toonot longer than the usual expeditions into the mountains to escape the summer heat of florence in the beginning of july they reached paris where they stayed at the hôtel hyacinthe rue st honoré for about a fortnight before going on to havre in company with old mr browning and miss browning there they remained until september when they returned to paris for about a month and thence early in october set out for italy                                        to miss ef haworth  hôtel hyacinthe st honoré wednesday and thursday july 8 1858 postmark  my dearest fannythe scene changes no more cypresses no more fireflies no more dreaming repose on burning hot evenings push out the churches push in the boulevards here i am sitting alone at this moment in an hotel near the tuileries where we have taken an apartment for a week a pretty salon with the complement of velvet sofas and armchairs and lookingglasses and bedrooms to correspond with clocks at distances of three yards as if the time was in desperate danger of forgetting itselfwhich it is of course paris looks more splendid than ever and we were not too much out of breath with fatigue on our arrival last night to admit of various cries of admiration from all of us it is a wonderfully beautiful city and wonderfully cold considering the climate we came from think of our finding ourselves forced into winter suits and looking wistfully at the grate i did so this morning but now there is sunshine  we had a prosperous journey except the sea voyage which prostrated all of usannunziata to the lowest deep of misery at marseilles we slept and again at lyons and dijon taking express trains the whole way so that there was as little fatigue as possible and what with the reviving change of air and these precautions i felt less tired throughout the journey than i have sometimes felt at florence after a long drive and much talking we had scarcely any companions in the carriages and were able to stretch to the full longitude of usa comfort always and i had madame ancelot and doit et avoir which dropped into my bag from isas kind fingers on the last evening and we gathered galignanis and illustrations day by day travelling has really become a luxury i feel the repose of it chiefly yes no possibility of unpleasant visitors no fear of horrible letters quite lifted above the plane of bad news or of the expectation of bad news which is nearly the same thing there you are shut in in a carriage quite out of reach of the telegraph even which you mock at as you run alongside the wires  yes but some visitors some faces and voices are missed and altogether i was very sad at leaving my italy oh very sad  tell me how you like up in the villa life and how long you shall bear it  paris i have not been out of the house except when i came into it but today thursday i mean to drive out a little with robert you know i have a weakness for paris and a passion for italy which would operate thus perhaps that i could easily stay here when once here if there was but a sun to stay with me we are in admiration all of us at everything from cutlets to costumes on the latter point i shall give myself great airs over you barbarians presentlyno offence to zerlindaand to begin pray draw your bonnets more over your faces  i would rather send this bit than wait as i did not write to you from marseilles  may god bless you if you knew how happy i think you for being in italyif you knew  i shiver with the cold i tie up three loves to send you from  your truly affectionate ba                                        to miss i blagden  hôtel hyacinthe st honoré paris thursday july 8 1858  my dearest dear isawe are here having lost nothingneither a carpet bag nor a bit of our true love for you we arrived the evening before last and this letter should have been written yesterday if i hadnt been interrupted such a pleasant journey we had after the curse of the sea where there shall be no more sea beautifies the thought of heaven to me but frederick tennysons prophets shall compound for as many railroads as they please  in fact we did admirably by land we were of unbridled extravagance and slept both at lyons and dijon and travelled by express trains besides so that we were almost alone the whole way and able to lie at full length and talk and read and doit et avoir did duty by me i assure youto say nothing of galignanis and french newspapers i was nearly sorry to arrive and robert suggested the facility of travelling on for ever so he by help of nux was in a heavenly state of mind and never was the french peoplepublic manners private customs general bearing hostelry and cooking more perfectly appreciated than by him and all of us judge of the courtesy and liberality one box had its lid opened and when robert disclaimed smuggling je vous crois monsieur dismissed the others then the passport was never looked at after a glance at marseilles i am thinking of writing to the times or should be if i could keep my temper  so you see dear isa i am really very well for me to be so pert yes indeed i am very well the journey did not overtire me and change of air had its usual reviving effect also robert keeps boasting of his influx of energies and his appetite is renewed we have resolved nothing about our sea plans but have long lists of places and find it difficult to choose among so many enchanting paradises with drawbacks of dearness c c meanwhile we are settled comfortably in an hotel close to the tuileries in a pretty salon and pleasant bedrooms for which we dont pay exorbitantly taken for a week and we shall probably outstay the week robert has the deep comfort of finding his father on whose birthday we arrived looking ten years youngerreally i may say soand radiant with joy at seeing him and peni dear mr browning and sarianna will go with us wherever we go of course  paris looks more beautiful than ever and we were not too dead to see this as we drove through the streets on wednesday evening the development of architectural splendour everywhere is really a sight worth coming to see even from italy observe i always feel the charm and yet i yearn back to my florencethe dearer the farther  we slept at dijon where robert in a passion of friendship went out twice to stand before maison milsand one of the shows of the town and muse and bless the threshold little did he dream that milsand was there at that moment having been called suddenly from paris by the dangerous illness of his mother so we miss our friend but we shall not i think altogether for he talked of following us to the sea sarianna says and even if he is restrained from doing this we shall pass some little time in paris on our return and so see him  mrs jameson is here but goes on saturday to england  incomplete                                        to miss ef haworth  2 rue de perry le havre maison versigny july 23 1858 postmark  my dearest fanny  i gave you an account of our journey to paris which i wont write over again especially as you may have read some things like it in paris we remained a fortnight except a day and i liked it as i always like paris for which i have a decided fancy and yet i did nothing except in one shop and in a fiacre driving round and round and sometimes at a restaurant dining round and round but paris is so full of lifemurmurs so of the fountain of intellectual youth for ever and everthat rolling up the rue de rivoli much more the boulevards suggests a quicker beat of the fancys heart and i like iti like it the architectural beauty is wonderful give me venice on water paris on landeach in its way is a dream city if one had but the sun theresuch a sun as one has in italy or if one had no lungs heresuch lungs as are in me but no under actual circumstances something different from paris must satisfy me also when alls said and sighed i love italyi love my florence i love that hole of a place as father prout called it latelywith all its dust its cobwebs its spiders even i love it and with somewhat of the kind of blind stupid respectable obstinate love which people feel when they talk of beloved native lands i feel this for italy by mistake for england florence is my chimneycorner where i can sulk and be happy but you havent come to that yet in spite of which you will like the baths of lucca just as you like florence for certain advantagesfor the exquisite beauty and the sense of abstraction from the vulgarities and vexations of the age which is the secret of the strange charm of the south perhapswho knows and yet there are vulgarities and vexations even in tuscany if one digs for themor doesnt dig sometimes  in paris we saw father prout who was in great force and kindness and charles sumner passing through the burning torture under the hands of french surgeons which is approved of by the brains of english surgeons do you remember the jesuits agony in the juif errant precisely that exposed to the living coal for seven minutes and the burns taking six weeks to heal mr sumner refused chloroformfrom some foolish heroic principle i imagine and suffered intensely of course he is not able to stir for some time after the operation and cant read or sleep from the pain now he is just healed and is allowed to travel for two months after which he is to return and be burned again isnt it a true martyrdom i ask what is apprehended is paralysis or at best nervous infirmity for life from the effect of the blows on the spine of that savage  then just as we arrived in paris dear lady elgin had another stroke and was all but gone she rallied however with her wonderful vitality and we left her sitting in her garden fixed to the chair of course and not able to speak a word nor even to gesticulate distinctly but with the eloquent soul full and radiant alive to both worlds robert and i sate there talking politics and on other subjects and there she sate and let no word drop unanswered by her bright eyes and smile it was a beautiful sight robert fed her with a spoon from her soupplate and she signed as well as she could that he should kiss her forehead before he went away she was always so fond of robert as women are apt to be you knoweven i a little  forster wrote the other day melancholy with the misfortunes of his friends though he doesnt name dickens landor had just fled to his forsters house in london for protection from an action for libel  see what a letter i have written write to me dearest fanny and love me oh how glad i shall be to be back among you again in my florence  your ever affectionate ba                                        to mrs jameson  maison versigny 2 rue de perry le havre july 24 1858 postmark  dearest mona ninahave you rather wondered at not hearing we have been awandering awandering over the worldhave been to Étretat and failed and now are ignominiously settled at havreyes at havre the name of which we should have scorned a week ago as a mere roaring commercial city but after all as sometimes i say with originality civilisation is a good thing the country about Étretat is very pretty and the coast picturesque with fantastic rocks but the accommodation dear in proportion to its badness which i do believe is the case everywhere with places now and then even with personsdear in proportion to their badness we could get three bedrooms a salon and kitchen one opening into another and no other access and the kitchen presenting the first door all furnished exactly alike except that where the bedroom had a bed the kitchen had a stove wooden chairs en suite not an inch of carpet and just an inch of lookingglass in the best bedroom view a potatopatch and price two hundred francs a month robert took it in a fine phrenzy on which i rebelled and made him give it up on a sacrifice of ten francs which was the only cheap thing in the place as far as i observed anything also the bay is so restricted that whoever takes a step is commanded by all the windows of the primitive hotel and the few villas and as people have nothing whatever to do but to look at you you may imagine the perfection of the analysis i should have been a fly in a microscope feeling my legs and arms counted on all sides and receiving no comfort from the scientific results so you see we gave it up and came here in a sort of despair meaning to take the railroad to dieppe when lo our examining forces find that the place here is very tenable and we take a house close to the sea though the view is interrupted in a green garden and quite away from a suggestion of streets and commerce the bathing is good we have a postoffice and readingrooms at our elbow and nothing distracting of any kind the house is large and airy and our two families are lodged in separate apartments though we meet at dinner in our diningroom certainly the country immediately around havre is not pretty but we came for the sea after all and the sea is open and satisfactory robert has found a hole i can creep through to the very shore without walking many yards and there i can sit on a bench and get strength if so it pleases god  have i not sent you a full account of us now if you would return me a cent per centsoll und haben i want so much to know all about youhow you feel dearest friend and how you are do write and tell me of yourself may god bless you ever and ever  your affectionate and grateful ba                                        to madame braun  2 rue do perry le havre maison versigny august 10 1858  my dearest madame braunif you have not heard from me before it has not been that i have not thought of you anxiously and tenderly but i had the idea that so many must be thinking of you and saying to you with sad faces they were sorry that i kept away not to be the one too many it seems so vain when we sympathise with a suffering friend and yet it is somethingoh yes i have felt that but you knew i must feel for you if i teased you with words or not and i for my part hearing of you from others felt shy as i say till i heard you were better of writing to you myself and you are feeling better mrs jameson tells me and are somewhat more cheerful about your state i thank god for this good news  one of the few reasons for which i regret our absence from england this summer is that i miss seeing you with my own eyes and i should like much to see you and talk to you of things of interest to both of us if illness suppresses in us a few sources of pleasure it leaves the real ich open to influences and keensighted to facts which are as surely natural as the flys wing though we are apt to consider them vaguely as supernatural  more and more life is what we want tennyson wrote long ago and that is the right want indifference to life is disease and therefore not strength but the life here is only half the applea cut out of the apple i should say merely meant to suggest the perfect round of fruitand there is in the world now i can testify to you scientific proof that what we call death is a mere change of circumstances a change of dress a mere breaking of the outside shell and husk this subject is so much the most interesting to me of all that i cant help writing of it to you among all the ways of progress along which the minds of men are moving this draws me most there is much folly and fanaticism unfortunately because foolish men and women do not cease to be foolish when they hit upon a truth there was a man who hung bracelets upon plane trees but it was a treeit is a truthnotwithstanding yes and so much a truth that in twenty years the probability is you will have no more doubters of the immortality of souls and no more need of platos to prove it  we have come here to dip me in warm seawater in order to an improvement in strength for i have been very weak and unwell of late as perhaps mrs jameson has told you but the sea and the change have brought me up again as i hope they may yourself and now i am looking forward to getting back to italy for the winter and perhaps to rome  did you know lady elgin in paris she has been hopelessly in the opinion of her physicians affected by paralysis but is now better her daughter writes to me a most remarkable person lady elgin is we left her sitting in her garden not able to speakto articulate one wordbut with one of the most radiant happy faces i ever saw in man or woman i think i remember that you knew her her salon was one of the most agreeable in paris and she herself with her mixture of learning and simplicity one of the most interesting persons in it  dearest madame braun i wont think of the possibility even of your writing to me so little do i expect to hear indeed i would not write if i considered it would entail writing upon you only believe that i tenderly regard and think of you and always shall may god bless you my dear friend your attached  elizabeth b browning                                        the following letter was written at paris during the stay there which intervened between leaving havre and the return to florence                                        to miss i blagden  6 rue de castiglione place vendôme paris october 2 1858  my dearest isai am saddened saddened by your letter we both are indeed this last news from india must have strucki know it did still to your generous nature long regret for your dear louisa will be impossible and you so given to forget yourself will come to forget a grief which is only your own for she was in the world as not of it in a painful sense she was cut off from the cheerful natural development of ordinary human beings and if as was probable the conviction of this dreary fact had fastened on her mind the result would have been perhaps demoralising certainly depressing more and more rather praise god for her therefore dearest isa that she is gone above the cloud gone where she can exercise active virtues and charities instead of being the mild patient object of the charities and virtues of her friends perhaps she ministers to you now instead of being ministered to by you while the remembrance of her life on earth is tenderly united to you ever a proof before men and angels that your life whatever you may please to say of yourself has not been useless nor barren of good and tender deeds  in this letter and the last such depressed letters you compare your own fate with that of some others with an injustice which god measures and which i too have knowledge of isa you speak you know not what be sure of one thing however that god has not been niggardly towards you and that he never made a creature for which he did not make the work suited to its hand he never made a creature necessarily useless nor gave a life which it was not sin on the creatures part to hold unthankfully and throw back as a poor gift your excellent understanding will work clear your spirits presently some of those whom you think enviable if they showed you their secret griefs unsuspected by you would leave tears in your eyes for them not you every heart knows its own bitterness and god knows when the bitterest drop is necessary for the hearts health may he bless you love you teach you strengthen you make you serene and bright in him dear dear isa i have spoken as to a sister i have spoken as to my own soul in an hour of faintness let us take courage isa  dear i had just folded up your parcel for miss alexander that my brother george should take it tomorrow it has been my first opportunity for englandat least for london but now i will carry it back to you  arabel stays with me till we go which will be in a fortnight perhaps from now we have an apartment in an exquisite situation two paces from the tuileries gardens first floor three best bedrooms and two servants rooms a closet of a diningroom a salonall small but exquisitely comfortable and parisian looking into a court though and we are not tempted to stay the winter no we return to florence faithfully write again and be happy isa it is as if i said be good tell me can it be true that lytton is in florence with his mother as father prout assures us on the authority of lady walpole  write to your ever in word and deed loving  ba                                        in october the travellers were back in florence but this time only for a short stay of some six weeks since it was decided that rome would be more suitable to mrs brownings failing health during the winter on november 24 they reached rome and for the next six months were quartered as in the winter of 18534 at no 43 via bocca di leone here it was that they heard the first mutterings of the storm which was to burst during the following year and to result in the making of italy                                        to miss ef haworth  casa guidi saturday about october 1858  you do not come dearest fanny though i am here waiting and i begin to be uneasy about you do at least write do we have been here since tuesday and here is saturday and every morning there has been an anxious looking forward for you  miss  wrote to me in paris to propose travelling with us which robert lacked chivalry to accede to and in fact our ways of journeying are too uncertain to admit of arrangements with anyone beyond our circle for instance we took nine days to get here from paris spending only one day at chambéry for the sake of les charmettes and rousseau robert played the dream on the old harpsichord the keys of which rattled in a ghastly way as if it were the bones of him who once so dreamed then there was the old watch hung up without a tick in it at st jean de maurienne we got into difficulties with diligences and submitted to being thrown out for the night at lanslebourg i more dead than alive and indeed i suffered much in passing the mountain next morning then again on the sea we had a burrasca and the captain had half a mind when halfway to leghorn to turn back to genoa passengers much frightened including me a little a wretched neapolitan boat with a machine inclined to go to the devil every time the wind went anywhere as i heard a french gentleman on board say afterwards altogether we were so done up after eighteen hours of it that we stayed at leghorn instead of going on straight to florence still now i seem to have got over fatigue and the restand we keep our faces turned undeviatingly to rome mdme du quaire having carefully apprised m mignaty that we left paris on the thirteenth our friends here seem to have made up their minds that we had perished by land or water and annunziatas poor sister had passed three days in tears for instance  now dearest fanny let me confess to you i have not brought the bonnet a bonnet is a personal matter and i would not let anyone choose one for me still as you had more faith in man or woman i would have risked even displeasing you only robert would not let me he said it was absurdi did not know your size i could not know your taste in fact he would not let me perhaps after all it is better you shall see mine which is the last novelty and i will tell you the results of having investigated the bonnet question generally i was told at a fashionable shop that hats might be worn out of ones teens but in paris let me hasten to add you dont see hats walking about except on the heads of small girls in rome it may be otherwise as at the seaside it was bonnets are a great deal larger but you shall see  oh so glad i am to be backso glad so glad  and so happy i shall be to see you dearest fanny whom till now i have not thanked for the pretty pretty sketch i recognised the persons at a glance you threw into them so much character  your ever most affectionate ebb                                        to miss browning  florence about november 1858  roberts uncertainty about rome my dearest sarianna has led him into delay of writing we dropped here upon summer and a few days afterwards just as suddenly the winter dropped upon us such wonderful weather such cold such snowenough to strangle one the rain has come however today and though everything feels wretched enough and i am languid about schemes of travelling we talk of going next week should nothing hinder      if it be possible     after much grief and pain  peni would rather stay i believe his florence is in his heart still  robert will have told you about his bust59 which is exquisite in the clay and will be exhibited in london in the marble next may the likeness the poetry the ideal grace and infantile reality are all there i am so happy to have it i set about teasing robert till he gave it to me and as he really loses nothing thereby i accepted at once as you may suppose i would rather have given up rome and had the bust but the artist was generous and would only accept what would cover the expenses twentyfive guineas he said he would not otherwise do it for us as he asked in the first place to be allowed to make the sketch in clay and would not appear to have laid a trap for an order so we are all three very happy and grateful to one anotherwhich is pleasant i feel the most obliged perhaps of the threeobliged to the other twoand ought to be after the napoleons dropt in paris sarianna  oh no the sea was necessary from genoa the expense of the journey would have been very much increased if we had taken the whole way by land and it was a great thing to escape that rough gulf of lyons the journey to rome will be rendered easy to roberts pocket by the extraordinary chance of mr eckleys empty carriage otherwise the repeated pulls might have pulled us down too low  peni will write to you he loves his nonno and you very muchtell nonno and my love goes with my message  may god bless both of you love to m milsand  your affectionate ba                                        robert browning to miss browning  rome 43 bocca di leone friday november 26 1858 postmark  dearest sisyou received a letter written last thing on wednesday 18th we started next day with perfectly fine mild weather and every sort of comfort and got to our first nights stage poggio bagnoli with great ease with the same advantages next day we passed arezzo and reached camuscia and on saturday slept at perugia having found the journey delightful sunday was rainy but just as mild so ba did not suffer at all we slept at spoleto rain again on monday we reached terni early in the day in order to go to the falls but the thing was impossible for ba eckley his motherinlaw and i went however getting drenched but they were fine the rain and melted snow having increased the waters extraordinarily on tuesday we had fine weather again to cività castellana there we found that on the previous day while we were staying at terni a carriage was stopped and robbed in the road we otherwise should have pursued they said such a thing had not happened for years on wednesday afternoon four oclock we reached rome with beautiful weather so it had been for some four out of our seven days ba bore the journey irregularly well of course she has thus had a week of open air beside the change which always benefits her we always had the windows of the carriage open we passed wednesday night at an hotel in order to profit by any information friends might be able to furnish but we ended by returning to the rooms here we occupied before of which we knew the virtuesa blaze of sun on the front roomsand absolute healthiness rents are enormous we pay only ten dollars a month more than before in consideration of the desire the old landlady had to get us again to anybody else the price would have been 20 more60 in allfor which we are to pay 40 the eckleys took good rooms and pay 1000 £210 or 15 for six months one cant do that the best is that they have thoroughly cleaned and painted the place and everything is very satisfactorily arranged we take the apartment for four months meaning to be at liberty to go to naples if we like we have no fire this morning while i write but it is before breakfast and ba may like the sight of one tho i rather think she will not rome looks very well and i hope we shall have a happier time of it than before many friends are here and everybody is very kind the eckleys were extravagantly good to us something beyond conception almost we have seen miss cushman hatty60 leighton cartwright the storys page and his new third wife gibson beside the brackens and mrs mackenzie and there are others i shall see today ferdinando was sent on by sea with the luggage and met us at the gate it has been an expensive business altogether but i think we shall not regret it i daresay you have mild weather at paris also these premature beginnings of cold break down and leave the rest of the year the warmer if not the better for them dearest sis write and tell me all the news of your two selves do you hear anything about reubens leaving london anything of lady elgin how is madame milsand i will send you the last ath i have received but break off here rather abruptly in order to let ba write goodbye god bless you both kindest love to milsand  yours ever affectionately rb                                        eb browning to miss browning  my dearest sariannai dont know whether this letter from rome will surprise you but we have done it at last our journey was most prosperous the wonderful inrush of winter which buried all italy in snow and for some days rendered the possibility of any change of quarters so more than doubtful i myself gave it up for days having given way to an inrush of summer as wonderful the change was so pleasant that i bore with perfect equanimity the lamentations of certain english acquaintances of ours in florence who declared it was the most frightful and dangerous climate that could be that now one was frozen to death and the next day burnt and melted and that people couldnt be healthy under such transitions but all countries of the south are subject to the same of course wherever there is a southern sun and mountains to retain snow even in paris you complain of something a little like it because of the sun we left florence in a blaze of sunshine accordingly and there and everywhere found the country transfigured back into summer except for two days of april rain of the kindness of our dear friends mr and mrs eckley i am moved when i try to speak they humiliate me by their devotion such generosity and delicacy combined with so much passionate sentiment there is no other word are difficult to represent the americans are great in some respects not that americans generally are like these but that these could scarcely be englishfor instance that mixture of enthusiasm and simplicity we have not our journey was delightful and not without some incidents which might have been accidents we were as nearly as possible thrown once into a ditch and once down a mountain precipice the spirited horses plunging on one side but at last mr eckley lent us his courier who sate on the box by the coachman and helped him to manage better then there was a fight between our oxendrivers one of them attempting to stab the other with a knife and robert rushing in between till peni and i were nearly frantic with fright no harm happened however except that robert had his trousers torn and we escaped afterwards certain banditti who stopped a carriage only the day before on the very road we travelled and robbed it of sixtytwo scudi  here at rome we are still fortunate for with enormous prices rankling around us we get into our old quarters at eleven pounds a month the rooms are smaller than our ambition would fain climb to one climbs also a little too high on the stairs but on the whole the quiet healthfulness and sunshine are excellent things particularly in rome and we are perfectly contented  rome is so full that i am proceeding to lock up my doors throughout the day i cant live without some use of life here must come the break may god bless you both pens love with mine to the dear nonno and yourself  ba                                        to mr ruskin  rome 43 bocca di leone january 1 1859  my dear mr ruskinthere is an impulse upon me to write to you and as it ought to have come long ago i yield to it and am glad that it comes on this first day of a new year to inaugurate the time it may be a good omen for me who knows  we received your letter at florence and very much did it touch meus i should sayand then i would have written if you hadnt bade us wait for another letter which has not come to this day shall i say one thing the sadness of that letter struck me like the languor after victory for you who have fought many good fights and never for a moment seemed to despond before write this word and this after treading the world down in various senses you are tired it is natural perhaps but this evil will pass like other evils and i wish you from my heart a good clear noble year with plenty of work and god consciously over all to give you satisfaction what would this life be dear mr ruskin if it had not eternal relations for my part if i did not believe so i should lay my head down and die nothing would be worth doing certainly but i am what many people call a mystic and what i myself call a realist because i consider that every step of the foot or stroke of the pen here has some real connection with and result in the hereafter  this lifes a dream a fleeting show no indeed that isnt my doxy i dont think that nothing is worth doing but that everything is worth doingeverything good of courseand that everything which does good for a moment does good for ever in art as well as in morals not that i look for arbitrary punishment or reward the last least certainly i would no more impute merit to the human than your spurgeon would but that i believe in a perpetual sequence according to gods will and in what has been called a correspondence between the natural world and the spiritual  here i stop myself with a strong rein it is fatal dear mr ruskin to write letters on new years day one cant help moralising one falls on the metaphysical vein unaware  forgive me  we are in rome you see we have been very happy and found rooms swimming all day in sunshine when there is any sun and yet not ruinously dear i was able to go out on christmas morning a wonderful event for me and hear the silver trumpets in st peters well it was very fine i never once thought of the scarlet lady nor of the mortara case nor anything to spoil the pleasure yes and i enjoyed it both æsthetically and devotionally putting my own words to the music was it wise or wrong  but we have had and are having some cold some tramontana and i have kept house ever since only in rome theres always hope of a good warm scirocco we talk of seeing naples before we turn home to our florence to keep feast for dante  it is delightful to hear of all you are permitted to do for england meanwhile in matters of art and one of these days we shall go north to take a few happy hours of personal advantage out of it all not this year however i think we have done duty to the north too lately now it seems to me we have the right of virtue in spite of what i said on another page or rather because i said it in good human inconsistency the right to have and hold our italy in undisturbed possession i never feel at home anywhere else or to live rightly anywhere else at all its a horrible want of patriotism of course only if i were upon trial i might say in a low voice a few things to soften the judgment against me on account of that sin ah we missed you at havre if you had come it would have been something pleasant to remember that detestable place by besides the saltwater which profited ones health a little we were in paris too some six weeks in all besides eight weeks at havre and paris has a certain charm for me always if we had seen you in paris but no you must have floated past us close close yet we missed you  a good happy new year we wish to mr and mrs ruskin as to yourself and dear mr ruskin to your mother i shall say that my child is developing in a way to make me very contented and thankful yes i thank god for him more and more and she can understand that i know his musical faculty is a decided thing and he plays on the piano quite remarkably for his age through his fathers instruction while i am writing this he is reading aloud to me an italian translation of monte cristo and with a dramatic intelligence which would strike you as it does perhaps that i should select such a book for a child of nine years old to read at all its rather young to be acclimated to french novels is it not but the difficulty of getting italian books is great and theres a good deal in the early part of monte cristo the prison part very attractive his voice was full of sobs when poor dantes was consigned to the château dif do you mean to say mama that that boy is to stay there all his life he made me tell him to make him happy as he said  for the rest he reads french and german and we shall have to begin latin in another year i suppose do you advise that you mr ruskin he has not given up the drawing neither ah but there is a weight beyond the post whatever your goodness may bear and i must leave a little space for robert  may god bless you my dear friend dare i say it it came  affectionately yours always elizabeth barrett browning                                        robert browning to mr ruskin  i am to say something dear ruskin it shall be only the best of wishes for this and all other years go on again like the noble and dear man you are to us all and especially to us two out of them all whenever i chance on an extract a report it lights up the dull newspaper stuff wrapt round it and makes me glad at heart and clearer in head we for our part have just sent off a corrected aurora leigh which is the better for a deal of pains we hope and my wife deserves there will be a portrait from a photograph done at havre without retouchinggood i think truest love to you and yoursyour father and mother do help us by a word every now and then  affectionately yours rb                                        to miss i blagden  rome 43 bocca di leone january 7 1859  my dearest isayour letter seemed long in coming as this will seem to you i fear i ought to have answered mine at once and put off doing so from reason to reason and from day to day very busy i have been sending off seven of the nine books of aurora61 having dizzied myself with the ifs and ands and done some little good i hope at much cost  as to the roman climate we have had some beautiful weather but robert was calling his gods to witness the goddess tussis among them that he never felt it so cold in florencenever fountains frozen isa and the tramontana tremendous but it cant lastthats the comfort at rome and meantime we are housed exquisitely in our lions mouth the new portiere and universal carpeting keeping it snugger than ever and the sun overstreaming us through six windows i have just been saying that whenever i come to rome i shall choose to come here the only fault is the height and the smallness of the rooms and in spite of the last we have managed to have and hold twenty people and upwards through a serata peni has had a bad cold from overstaying the time on the pincio one afternoon and i have kept him in the house these ten days such things one may do by ones lioncubs but the lions are harder to deal with and robert caught cold two or three days ago in spite of which he chose to get up at six every morning as usual and go out to walk with mr eckley only by miracle and nux is he much better today i thought he was going to have a furious grippe as last year and the year before i must admit however that he is extremely well just now to speak generally and that this habit of regular exercise with occasional homoeopathy has thrown him into a striking course of prosperity as to looks spirits and appetite he eats vulpinely he sayswhich means that a lark or two is no longer enough for dinner at breakfast the loaf perishes by gargantuan slices he is plunged into gaieties of all sorts caught from one hand to another like a ball has gone out every night for a fortnight together and sometimes two or three times deep in a one nights engagements so plenty of distraction and no men and women men and women from without instead i am shut up in the house of course and go to bed when he goes outand the worst is that theres a difficulty in getting books still i get what i can and stop up the chinks with swedenborg and in health am very well for me and in tranquillity excellently well not that there are not people more than enough who come to see me but that there is nothing vexatious just now life goes smoothly i thank god and i like rome better than i did last time the season is healthy too for rome i have only heard of one english artist since we came who arrived sickened died and was buried before anyone knew who he was besides ordinary cases of slight roman fever among the english miss sherwood who with her father was at florence has had it slightly and mrs marshall who came to us from tennyson a miss springrice she was but the poor hawthornes suffer seriously una is dissolved to a shadow of herself by reiterated attacks and now miss shepherd is seized with gastric fever mr hawthorne is longing to get awaywhere he knows not  my peni has conquered his cold and when the weather gets milder i shall let him out meanwhile he has taken towhat do you suppose i go into his room at night and find him with a candle regularly settled on the table by him and he reading deeply rapt an italian translation of monte cristo pretty well for a lioncub isnt it he is enchanted with this book lent to him by our padrona and exclaims every now and then oh magnificent magnificent and this morning at breakfast he gravely delivered himself to the following effect dear mama for the future i mean to read novels i shall read all dumass to begin and then i shall like to read papas favourite book madame bovary heavens what a lioncub robert and i could only answer by a burst of laughter it was so funny that little dot of nine and a half full of such hereditary tendencies  and madame bovary in a course of education  may god bless you my muchloved isa for this and other years beyond also i shall love you all that waysays the genius of the ring

child by monroe  60 miss hosmer  61 the fourth edition in which several alterations were made     chapter x  185960   at this point in mrs brownings correspondence we reach the first allusion to the political crisis which had now become acute and of which the letters that follow are full almost to excess on january 1 napoleon had astounded europe by his language to the austrian ambassador at paris in which he spoke of the bad relations unfortunately subsisting between their states on the 10th victor emmanuel declared that he must listen to the cry of pain which came up to him from all italy after this it was clear that there was nothing to do but to prepare for war it was in vain that england pressed for a european congress with the view of arranging a general disarmament sardinia professed willingness to accept it but austria declined and on april 23 sent an ultimatum to victor emmanuel demanding unconditional disarmament which was naturally refused on the 29th austria declared war and her troops crossed the ticinoan act which napoleon had already announced would be considered as tantamount to a declaration of war with france  with regard to the tone of mrs brownings letters during this period of politics and war there are a few considerations to be borne in mind her two deepest political convictions were here united in oneher faith in the honesty of louis napoleon and her enthusiasm for italian freedom and unity there were many persons in england and some in italy itself who held the latter of these faiths without the former but for such she had no tolerance hence not only those who sympathised as no doubt some englishmen did sympathise with austria but also those who while wishing well to italy looked with suspicion upon napoleons interference incurred her uncompromising wrath and not even the conference of villafranca not even the demand for nice and savoy could lead her to question napoleons sincerity or to look with patience on the english policy and english public opinion of that day the instinct of italians has been truer they have recognised the genuine sympathy and support which england extended to them on many occasions during the long struggle for italian unity and the friendship between the two countries today has its root in the events of forty and fifty years ago  that robert browning did not entirely share his wifes views will be clear to all readers of prince hohenstielschwangau but there is not the smallest sign that this caused the least shadow of disagreement between them indeed for the moment the difference was practically annulled since robert browning believed what was very probably the case that the emperors friendship for italy was genuine so far as it went but it may be believed that he was less surprised than she when napoleons zeal for italian independence stopped short at the frontiers of venetia and was transformed into an anxiety to get out of the war without further risk and with an eye to material compensation in savoy and nice  it is also right to bear in mind the failing condition of mrs brownings health the strain of anxiety unquestionably overtaxed her strength and probably told upon her mental tone in a way that may account for much that seems exaggerated and at times even hysterical in her expressions regarding those who did not share her views her errors were noble and arose from a passionate nobility of character to which much might be forgiven if there were much to forgive                                        to miss browning  rome about february 1 1859  i am sure robert has been too long about writing this time dearest sarianna it did not strike either of us till this morning that it was so long we have all been well and robert is whirled round and round so in this most dissipated of places to which paris is really grave and quiet that he scarcely knows if he stands on his feet or his head  since christmas day i have been out twice once to see mr pages gorgeous picture just gone to paris and once to run back again before the wind but i am too susceptible the weather has been glorious to everybody with some common sense in their lungs and today it is possible even to me they say and i am preparing for an effort  pen is quite well and rosy still we hear of illness and i am very particular and nervous about him all mr hawthornes family have been ill one after another and now he is struck himself with the fever  let me remember to say how the professors letter seemed to say so muchtoo much  particularly just now i for one can receive no compliments about english honesty c after the ignoble way we are behaving about italy i dare say dear m milsand who doesnt sympathise much with our italy thinks it imprudent of the emperor to make this move but that it is generous and magnanimous he will admit the only greathearted politician in europebut chivalry always came from france the emotion here is profoundand the terror among the priests  always i expected this from napoleon and if he will carry out his desire peni and i are agreed to kneel down and kiss his feet the pamphlet which proceeds from him is magnificent i said it long agoto jessie white i said it you would destroy said i the only man who has it in his heart and head to do anything for italy  most happily roberts and my protestation went to america in time just before the present contingency yes jessie should not have permitted our names to be used so being passive even was a faultyes and more than a fault robert is in great spirits and very well indeed  ever your most affectionate ba                                        to miss i blagden  rome 43 bocca di leone march 27 1859  my ever dearest isayou dont write not you i wrote last remember and though you may not have liked all the politics of the same you might have responded to some of the love you naughty isa so i think i shall get up a cause célèbre for myself it shall be my turn now and i shall prove or try that nobody has loved me or can up to this date of the 26th of march 1859 dearest isa seriously speaking you must write for i am anxious to know that you are recovering your good looks and proper bodily presence as to weight just now i am scarcely of sane mind about italy it even puts down the spiritsubject i pass through cold stages of anxiety and white heats of rage robert accuses me of being glad that the new times correspondent has been suddenly seized with roman fever it is i who have the true feverin my brain and heart i am chiefly frightened lest austria yield on unimportant points to secure the vital ones and louis napoleon with germany and england against him is in a very hard position god save us all  massimo d azeglio62 has done us the real honor of coming to see us and seldom have i for one been more gratified a noble chivalrous head and that largeness of the political morale which i find nowhere among statesmen except in the head of the french government azeglio spoke bitterly of english policy stigmatised it as belonging to a past age the rags of old traditions he said that louis napoleon had made himself great simply by comprehending the march of civilisation the true christianity said azeglio and by leading it exactly what i have always thought azeglio disbelieves in any aim of territorial aggrandisement on the part of france he is full of hope for italy it is 48 over again said he but with matured actors he finds a unity of determination among the italians wherever he goes  well azeglio is a man seldom have i seen a man whom i felt more sympathy towards he has a large clear attractive sphere as we swedenborgians say  the pamphlet collegno never reached us the papal government has snatched it on the way farinis is very good thank you for all your kindness as to pamphlets not letters isa i distinguish in my gratitude we lent mr trollopes to odo russell63 the english plenipotentiary and to azeglio so that it has produced fruit in our hands  did i write since robert dined with the prince of wales col bruce called here and told me that though the budding royalty was not to be exposed to the influences of mixed society the society of the most eminent men in rome was desired for him and he col bruce knew it would gratify the queen that the prince should make the acquaintance of mr browning afterwards came the invitation or command i told robert to set them all right on italian affairs and to eschew compliments which you know is his weak point he said the other day to mrs story i had a delightful evening yesterday at your house i never spoke to you once and encouraged an artist who was quite dissatisfied with his works as he said humbly by an encouragingbut my dear fellow if you were satisfied you would be so very easily satisfied happy wasnt it well so i exhorted my robert to eschew compliments and keep to italian politics and we both laughed as at a jest but really he had an opportunity the subject was permitted admitted encouraged and robert swears that he talked on it higher than his breath but oh the english the english i am unpatriotic and disloyal to a crime isa just now besides which as a matter of principle i never put my trust in princes except in the parvenus  not that the little prince here talked politics but some of his suite did and he listened he is a gentle refined boy robert says  may god bless you dearest isa i am your very loving  ba                                        to miss browning  rome about april 1859  dearest sariannapeople are distracting the athenæums robert complains as they distract other things but in time you will recover them i hope mr leighton has made a beautiful pencildrawing highly finished to the last degree of him64 very like though not on the poetical side which is beyond leighton of this you shall have a photograph soon and in behalf of it i pardon a drawing of me which i should otherwise rather complain of i confess  we are all much saddened just now in spite of war by the state of una hawthorne a lovely girl of fifteen mr hawthornes daughter who after a succession of attacks of roman fever has had another complicated with gastric which has fallen on the lungs and she only lives from hour to hour homoeopathic treatment persisted in which never answers in these fevers ahthere has been much illness in rome miss cushman has had an attack but you would not recognise other names we are well however pen like a rose and robert still expanding dissipations decidedly agree with robert theres no denying that though hes horribly hypocritical and prefers an evening with me at home which has grown to be a kind of dissipation also  we are in great heart about the war as if it were a peace without need of war arabel writes alarmed about our funded money which we are not likely to lose perhaps precisely because we are not alarmed the subject never occurred to me in fact i was too absorbed in the general questionyes and am  so it dawns upon you sarianna that things at rome and at naples are not quite what they should be a certain english reactionary party would gladly make the pope a paratonnerre to save austria but this wont do the poor old innocent pope would be paralytically harmless but for the austrian who for years has supported the corruptions here against france and even the king of naples would drop flat as a pricked bubble if austria had not maintained that iniquity also we who have lived in italy all these years know the full pestilent meaning of austria everywhere what is suffered in lombardy exceeds what is suffered elsewhere now god be thanked here is light and hope of deliverance still you doubt whether the french are free enough themselves to give freedom well i wont argue the question about what freedom is we shall be perfectly satisfied here with french universal suffrage and the ballot the very same democratical government which advanced liberals are straining for in england but however that may be the italians are perfectly contented at being liberated by the french and entirely disinclined to wait the chance of being more honorably assisted by their free and virtuous friend on the other side of the hedge or channel who is employed at present in buttoning up his own pockets lest peradventure he should lose a shilling giving dinners though and the smaller change to neapolitan exiles whom only this very cry of war has freed  robert and i have been of one mind lately in these things which comforts me much but the chief comfort isthe state of facts  massimo d azeglio came to see us and talked nobly with that noble head of his i was far prouder of his coming than of another personal distinction you will guess at though i dont pretend to have been insensible even to that it is 48 over again said he with matured actors in fact the unity throughout italy is wonderful what has been properly called the crimes of the holy alliance will be abolished this time if god defends the right which he will i think i have faith and hope  but people are preparing to run and perhaps we shall be forced to use the gendarmes against the brigands with whom the country is beset as in all cases of general disturbance when we travel but this is all the difference it will make with us tuscany is only restraining itself out of deference to france and not to complicate her difficulties war must be if it is not already  yes i was not insensible democratical as i am and unenglish as i am said to be col bruce told me that he knew it would be gratifying to the queen that the prince should make roberts acquaintance she wished him to know the most eminent men in rome it might be a weakness but i was pleased  pens and my love to the dearest nonno and you  your affectionate ba                                        in may shortly after the outbreak of war the brownings returned to florence whither a division of french troops had been sent under the command of prince napoleon the grand duke had already retired before the storm and a provisional government had been formed it was here that they heard the news of magenta june 4 and solferino june 24 with their wholly unexpected sequel the armistice and the meeting of the two emperors at villafranca the latter blow staggered even mrs browning for the moment but though her frail health suffered from the shock her faith in louis napoleon was proof against all attack she could not have known the good military reasons he had for not risking a reversal of the successes which he had won more through his enemys defects than through the excellence of his own army or dispositions but she found an explanation in the supposed intrigues of england and germany which frustrated his good intentions                                        to miss browning  florence about may 1859  my dearest sariannayou will like to hear if only by a scratch that we are back in tuscany with all safety after a very pleasant journey through an almost absolute solitude florence is perfectly tranquil and at the same time most unusually animated what with the french troops and the passionate gratitude of the people we have two great flags on our terrace the french flag and the italian and peni keeps a moveable little flag between them which as he says he can take out in the carriage sometimes pen is enchanted with the state of things in general and the french camp in particular which he came home from only in the dusk last night having enjoyed himself so very much in seeing those dear french soldiers play at blindmans buff they wont however remain long here unless the austrians threaten to come down on us which i trust they will be too much absorbed to do the melancholy point in all this is the dirt eaten and digested with a calm face by england and the english now that i have exhausted myself with indignation and protestation robert has taken up the same note which is a comfort i would rather hear my own heart in his voice certainly it must be still more bitter for him than for me seeing that he has more national predilections than i have and has struggled longer to see differently not only the prestige but the very respectability of england is utterly lost hereand nothing less is expected than her ultimate and open siding with austria in the war if she does we shall wash our hands like so many pilates which will save us but not england  we are intending to remain here as long as we can bear the heat which is not just now too oppressive though it threatens to be so we must be somewhere near to see after our property in the case of an austrian approach which is too probable we some of us think and i just hear that a body of the french will remain to meet the contingency our italians are fighting as well as soldiers can  tell m milsand with my love that if i belonged to his country i should feel very proud at this time as to the emperor he is sublime he will appear so to all when he comes out of this war as i believe with clean and empty hands  robert gives ten scudi a month a little more than two guineas to the war as long as it lasts and peni is to receive half a paul every day he is good at his lessons that he also may give to the great cause i must write a word to the dear nonno may god bless both of you says your  affectionate sister ba                                        to mr browning senior  same date  yes indeed i missed the revolution in tuscany dearest nonno which was a lossbut perhaps in compensation who knows i shall be in for an austrian bombardment or brigandage or something as good or bad but after all you are not to be anxious about us because of a jest of mine we have tuscan troops on the frontier and french troops in the city and although the duchess of parma has graciously given leave they say to the austrians to cross her dominions in order to get into tuscany we shall be well defended we are all full of hope and calm and never doubt of the result if ever there was a holy cause it is this if ever there was a war on which we may lawfully ask gods blessing it is this the unanimity and constancy of the italian people are beautiful to witness the affliction of ten years has ripened these souls never was a contrast greater than what is today and what was in 48 no more distrust nor division nor vacillation and a gratitude to the french nation which is quite pathetic  peni is all in a glow about italy and wishes he was great boy enough to fight meantime he does his lessons for the fightershalf a paul a day when he is good  mr del bene thought him much improved in his music and i hope he gets on in other things and that when we bring him back to you crowned with italian laurels you will think so too meanwhile think of us and love us dearest nonno i always think of your kindness to me  your ever affectionate daughter ba                                        to mr ruskin  casa guidi june 3 1859  my dear mr ruskinwe send to you every now and then somebody hungry for a touch from your hand we who are famished for it ourselves but this time we send you a man whom you will value perfectly for himself and be kind to from yourself quite spontaneously he is the american artist page an earnest simple noble artist and man who carries his christianity down from his deep heart to the point of his brush draw him out to talk to you and you will find it worth while he has learnt much from swedenborg and used it in his views upon art much of it if new may sound to you wild and dreamybut the dream will admit of logical inference and philosophical induction and when you open your eyes it is still there  he has not been successful in lifefew are who are uncompromising in their manner of life when i speak of life i include art which is life to him i should like you to see what a wonder of light and colour and space and breathable air he put into his venus rising from the searefused on the ground of nudity at the paris exhibition this summer the loss will be great to him i fear  you will recognise in this name page the painter of roberts portrait which you praised for its venetian colour and criticised in other respects in fact mr page believes that he has discovered titians secretand what is more he will tell it to you in love and indeed to anybody else in charity so i dont say that to bribe you  dear dear mr ruskin we thank you and love you more than ever for your good word about our italy oh if you knew how hard it is and has been to receive the low selfish ignoble words with which this great cause has been pelted from england not from her derby government only but from her parliament her statesmen her reformers her leaders of the liberal party her free pressto receive such words full in our faces nay in the quick of our hearts till we grow sick with loathing and hot with indignationif you knew what it was and is you would feel how glad and grateful we must be to have a right word from john ruskin dear mr ruskin england has done terribly ill ignobly ill which is worse that men of all parties should have spoken as they have proves a state of public morals lamentable to admit whatnot even our poets with clean hands alfred tennyson abetting lord derby that to me was the heaviest blow of all  meanwhile we shall have a free italy at least for everything goes well here massimo d azeglio came to see us in rome and he said then it is 48 with matured actors indeed there is a wonderful unanimity calm and resolution everywhere in italy all parties are broken up into the one great national party the feeling of the people is magnificent the painful experience of ten years has borne fruit in their souls no more distrust no more division no more holding back no more vacillation and louis napoleonwell i think he is doing me creditand you dear mr ruskinfor you too held him in appreciation long ago a great man  i beseech you to believe on my word and we have our information from good and reliable sources that the times newspaper built up its political ideas on the broadest foundation of lies i use the bare word you wont expel it in the manner of the paris exhibition for its nudityliesnot mistakes for instance while the very peasants here are giving their crazie the very labourers their days work once in a week or sowhile everyone gives and every man almost who can go goesthe times says that piedmont had derived neither paul nor soldier from tuscany tell me what people get by lying so faustus sold himself to the devil does austria pay a higher price i wonder  such things i could tell youthings to moisten your eyesto wring that burning eloquence of yours from your lips but robert waits to take this letter penini has adorned our terrace with two tricolour flags the italian tricolour and the french may god bless you dear friend speak again for italy if you could see with what eyes the italian speaks of the english our love to you mr and mrs ruskinif we maybecause we must write to us do  ever affectionately yours rb and ebb                                        to miss browning  florence about june 1859  my dearest sariannathere is a breath of air giving one strength to hold ones pen at this moment how people can use swords in such weather its difficult to imagine we have been melting to nothing like the lump of sugar in ones tea or rather in ones lemonade for tea grows to be an abomination before the sun the heat which lingered unusually has come in on us with a rush of flame for some days past suggesting however the degree beyond itself which is coming we stay on at florence because we cant bear to go where the bulletin twice a day from the war comes less directly and certainly we shall stay till we cant breathe here any more on which contingency our talk is to go somewhere for two months meanwhile we stay  you cant conceive of the intense interest which is reigning here you cant realise it scarcely in paris there is vivid interest of course but that is from less immediate motives except with persons who have relations in the army here it is as if each one had a personal enemy in the street below struggling to get up to him when we are anxious we are pale when we are glad we have tears in our eyes this unnecessary and inexcusable war as it has been called in england represents the only hope of a nation agonising between death and life you talk about our living or dying but we live or die thats the difference between you and us  we shall live however the hope is rising into triumph nobody any more will say that the italians fight ill remember that garibaldi has with him simply the volunteers from all parts of italy not the trained troops he and they are heroic as with such conviction and faith they were sure to be and the trained troops not less so worthy of fighting side by side with the french says the emperor while the french are worthy of their fame the great military power crumbles before them because souls are stronger than bodies always there is no such page of glory in the whole history of france great motives and great deeds the feeling of profound gratitude to napoleon iii among this people here is sublime from its unanimity and depth  all this excitement has made florence quite unlike its quiet self in spite of the flight of many residents and nearly all travellers even we have been stirred up to wander about more than our custom here theres something that forbids us to sit at home we run in and out after the bulletins and to hear and give opinions and then in the rebound we have been caught and sent several times to the theatre so unusual for us to see the great actor salvini who is about to leave florence we saw him in othello and in hamlet and he was very great in both robert thought as well as i only his houses pine because as he says the true tragedies spoil the false and the italians have given up the theatres for the cafés at this moment of crisis  in best love ba                                        after villafranca the immediate anxiety for news from the seat of war naturally came to an end and the brownings were able to escape from the heat of florence to siena where they remained about three months                                        to miss browning  siena julyaugust 1859  dearest sariannathis to certify that i am alive after all yes and getting stronger and intending to be strong before long though the sense left to me is of a peculiar frailty of being no very marked opinion upon my hold of life but life will last as long as god finds it useful for myself and otherswhich is enough both for them and me  so well i was with all the advantages of rome in me looking so well that i was tired of hearing people say so but though it may sound absurd to you it was the blow on the heart about the peace after all that excitement and exultation that walking on the clouds for weeks and months and then the sudden stroke and fall and the impotent rage against all the nations of the earthselfish inhuman wickedwho forced the hand of napoleon and truncated his great intentions many young men of florence were confined to their beds by the emotion of the news as for me i was struck couldnt sleep talked too much and the intense heat rendering one more susceptible perhaps at last this bad attack came on robert has been perfect to me for more than a fortnight he gave up all his nights rest to me and even now he teaches pen they are well i thank god we stay till the end of september our italians have behaved magnificently steadfast confident never forgetting except in the case of individuals of course their gratitude to france nor their own sense of dignity things must end well with such a people few would have expected it of the italians i hear the french ambassador was present at the opening of the chambers the other day at florence which was highly significant  i suppose you are by the sea and i hope you and the dearest nonno are receiving as much good from air and water as you desired may god bless you both  your ever affectionate sister ba                                        to miss i blagden  villa alberti siena wednesday julyaugust 1859  my ever dearest kindest isai cant let another day go without writing just a word to you to say that i am alive enough to love you in fact dear i am a great deal better no longer ground to dust with cough able to sleep at nights and preparing today to venture on a little minced chicken which i have resisted all the advances of hitherto this proves my own opinion of myself at least i am extremely weak reeling when i ought to walk and glad of an arm to steer by but the attack is over the blister to the side tell dr gresonowsky conquered the uneasiness there and did me general good i think now i have only to keep still and quiet and do nothing useful or the contrary if possible and not speak and not vex myself more than is necessary on politics i had a letter from jessie mario dated bologna the other day and feel a little uneasy at what she may be about there it was a letter not written in very good taste blowing the trumpet against all napoleonists most absurd for the rest cavour had promised ln tuscany for his cousin as the price of his intervention in italy and prince napoleon finding on his arrival here that it wouldnt do the peace was made in a huff  absurd certainly  robert advises me not to answer and it may be as well perhaps  i dreamed lately that i followed a mystic woman down a long suite of palatial rooms she was in white with a white mask on her head the likeness of a crown i knew she was italy but i couldnt see through the mask all through my illness political dreams have repeated themselves in inscrutable articles of peace and eternal provisional governments walking on the mountains of the moon hand in hand with a dream more beautiful than them all then falling suddenly on the hard earthground on ones head no wonder that one should suffer oh isa the tears are even now in my eyes to think of it  and yet i have hope and the more i consider the more i hope  there will be no intervention to interfere with us in tuscany and there is something better behind which we none of us see yet  we read today of the florence elections may god bless my florence  dearest isa dont you fancy that you will get off with a day and night here no indeed also i would rather you waited till i could talk and go out and enjoy you properly and just now i am a mere rag of a ba hung on a chair to be out of the way  robert is so very kind as to hear pens lessons which keeps me easy about the child  heat we have had and have but theres a great quantity of airsuch blowings as you boast of at your villaand i like this good open air and the quiet i have seen nobody yet  dearest isa i miss you and love you how perfect you are to me always  roberts true love with pens and i may send my love to miss field may i not  yours in tender affection ba  do write and tell me everything  yes england will do a little dabbling about constitutions and the like where theres nothing to lose or risk and why does mrs trollope say god bless them for it i never will forgive england the most damnable part she has taken on italian affairs never the pitiful cry of invasion is the continuation of that hounds cry observe must we live and bear                                        to miss ef haworth  villa alberti siena august 24 1859 postmark  dearest fannythis is only to say that i wrote to you before your letter reached me directing mine simply to the postoffice of cologne and that i write now lest what went before should miss for want of the more specific address thank you dear friend for caring to hear of my health that at least is pleasant i keep recovering strength by air quiet and asses milk and by hope for italy which consolidates itself more and more  you will wonder at me but these public affairs have half killed me you know i cant take things quietly your complaint and mine fanny are just opposite for weeks and weeks in my feverish state i never closed my eyes without suffering punishment under eternal articles of peace and unending lists of provisional governments do you wonder  observei believe entirely in the emperor he did at villafranca what he could not help but do since then he has simply changed the arena of the struggle he is walking under the earth instead of on the earth but straight and to unchanged ends  this country meanwhile is conducting itself nobly it is worthy of becoming a great nation  and god for us all  so you go to england really which i doubted till your letter came  it is well that you did not spend the summer here for the heat has been ferocious hotter people from corfu say than it was ever felt there italy however is apt to be hottish in the summer as we know very well  the country about here though not romantic like lucca is very pretty and our windows command sunsets and night winds i have not stirred out yet after three weeks of it you may suppose how reduced i must be i could scarcely stand at one time the active evil however is ended and strength comes somehow or other robert has had the perfect goodness not only to nurse me but to teach peni who is good too and rides a pony just the colour of his curls to his pure delight then we have books and newspapers english and italianthe books from florenceso we do beautifully  mr landor is here theres a long story absolute revolution and abdication from the florence villa he appeared one day at our door of casa guidi with an oath on his soul never to go back the end of it all is that robert has accepted office as landors guardian  and is to see to him at the request of his family in england and theres to be an arrangement for wilson to undertake him in a florence apartment which she is pleased at he visited the storys who are in a villa here the only inhabitants and were very kind to him now he is in rooms in a house not far from us waiting till we return to florence i have seen him only once and then he looked better than he did in florence where he seemed dropping into the grave scarcely able to walk a hundred yards he longs for england but his friends do not encourage his return and so the best that can be done for him must be now he is in improved spirits and has taken to writing latin alcaics on garibaldi which is refreshing i suppose  ask at the postoffice for my letter but dont fancy that it may be a line more lively than this no alcaics from me one soul has gone from me at least the soul that writes letters  may god bless you dearest kindest fanny love me a little dont leave off feeling on private affairs too much for that  roberts best love with that of your loving ba                                        to mrs jameson  villa alberti siena august 26 1859  dearest friend what have you thought of me  i was no more likely to write to you about the peace than about any stroke of personal calamity the peace fell like a bomb on us all and for my part you may still find somewhere on the ground splinters of my heart if you look hard but by the time your letter reached me we had recovered the blow spiritually had understood that it was necessary and that the emperor napoleon though forced to abandon one arena was prepared to carry on the struggle for italy on another  therefore i should have answered your letter at once if i had not been seized with illness indeed my dear dear friend you will hear from me no excuses i have not been unkind simply incapable  i believe it was the violent mental agitation the reaction from a state of exultation and joy in which i had been walking among the stars so many months and the grief anxiety the struggle the talking all coming on me at a moment when the ferocious heat had made the body peculiarly susceptible but one afternoon i went down to the trollopes had sight of the famous ducal orders about bombarding florence and came home to be ill violent palpitations and cough in fact the worst attack on the chest i ever had in italy for two days and two nights it was more like angina pectoris as i have heard it described but this went off and the complaint ran into its ancient pattern thank god and kept me only very ill with violent cough all night long my poor robert who nursed me like an angel prevented from sleeping for full three weeks when there was a possibility i was lifted into a carriage and brought here stayed two days at the inn in siena and then removed to this pleasant airy villa very ill i was after coming and great courage it required to come but change of air was absolutely a condition of living and the event justified the risk for now i am quite myself have done crying wolf and end this lamentable history by desiring you to absolve me for my silence we have been here nearly a month my strength which was so exhausted that i could scarcely stand unsupported is coming back satisfactorily and the cough has ceased to vex me at all still i am not equal to driving out i hope to take my first drive in a very few days though and the very asses are ministering to mein milk all the english physicians had found it convenient the beloved grand duke being absent to leave florence and zanetti was attending the piedmontese hospitals so that i had to attend me none of the old oraclesonly a prussian physician dr gresonowsky a very intelligent man of whom we knew a little personally and who had a strong political sympathy with me he and i used to sit together on isa blagdens terrace and relieve ourselves by abusing each others country and whether he expressed most moral indignation against england or i against prussia remained doubtful afterwards he came to cure me and was as generous in his profession as became his politics people are usually very kind to us i must say think of that man following us to siena uninvited and attending me at the hotel two days then refusing recompense  well now let me speak of our italy and the peace immoral you say yes immoral but not immoral on the part of napoleon who had his hand forced only immoral on the part of those who by infamies of speech and intrigue in england and germany against which i for one had been protesting for months brought about the complicated results which forced his hand never was a greater or more disinterested deed intended and almost completed than this french intervention for italian independence and never was a baser and more hideous sight than the league against it of the nations let me not speak  for the rest if it were not for venetia zurich65 keeps its secrets so far the peace would have proved a benefit rather than otherwise we have had time to feel our own strength to stand on our own feet the vain talk about napoleons intervening militarily on behalf of the grand duke has simply been the consequence of statements without foundation in the english and german papers and also in some french ultramontane papers napoleon with his own lips after the peace assured our delegates that no force should be used and he has repeated this on every possible occasion at villafranca when the emperor of austria insisted on the return of the dukes he acceded on condition they were recalled he did not come to italy to dispossess the sovereigns as he had previously observed but to give the power of election to the people before we left rome this spring he had said to the french ambassador if the tuscans like to recall their grand duke questce que cela me fait he simply said the same at villafranca  count de reiset was sent to florence modena and parma to constater not to impose and the whole policy of napoleon has been to draw out a calm and full expression of the popular mind nobly have the people of italy responded surely there is not in history a grander attitude than this assumed by a nation half born half constituted scarcely named yet but already capable of selfrestraint and dignity and magnanimous faith we are full of hope and should be radiant with joy except for venetia  dearest friend the war did more than give a province to piedmont the first french charge freed italy potentially from north to south at this moment austria cannot stir anywhere here we live breathe and have our national being certainly if napoleon did what the times has declared he would dointervene with armed force against the people prevent the elections or tamper with the elections by means ofsuch means as he was familiar with if he did these things i should cry aloud immoral vile a traitor but the facts deny all these imputations he has walked steadily on along one path and the development of italy as a nation is at the end of it  of course the first emotion on the subject of the peace was rage as well as grief for one day in florence all his portraits and busts disappeared from the shop windows and i myself to peninis extreme disgust who insisted on it that his dear napoleon couldnt do anything wrong and that the fault was in the telegraph wouldnt let him wear his napoleon medal afterwardsas ferdinando saidsiamo stati un po troppo furiosi davvero signora that came to be the general conviction out came the portraits again in the sun and the emperors bust side by side with victor emanuels adorns the room of our general assembly there are individuals of course who think that through whatever amount of difficulty and complication he should have preserved his first programme but these are not the wiser thinkers he had to judge for france as well as for italy as mr trollope said to me in almost the first fever it is upon the cards that he has acted in the wisest and most conscientious manner possible for allor it is on the cards etc  the difficulty now is at naples  there will be a congress of course a congress was in the first programme after the war a congress  but dearest mona nina if you want to get calumniated hated lied upon and spat upon in a spiritual sense try and do a good deed from disinterested motives in this world thats my lesson  i have been told upon rather good authority that cavours retirement is simply a feint and that he will recover his position presently  what weighs on my heart is venetia can they do anything at zurich to modify that heavy fact  you see i am not dead yet dear dearest friend and while alive at all i cant help being in earnest on these questions i am a ba you know forgive me when i get too much riled by your england  you will know by this time that the proposition you approved of was french  what made the very help of prussia unacceptable to austria was the circumstance of prussias using that opportunity of austrias need to wriggle herself to the military headship of the confederation austria would rather have lost lombardy and more than have accepted such a disadvantage hence the coldness the cause of which is scarcely avowable selfish and pitiful nations  dear isa blagden writes me all the political news of florence she is well and will come to pay us a visit before long we remain here till september ends and then return to casa guidi  i had a letter from bologna from jessie which threw me into a terror lest the mazzinians should come to italy just in time to ruin us the letter not unkind to me was as contrary to facts and reason as possible i was too ill to write at the time and robert would not let me answer it afterwards  the remainder of this letter is missing                                        to mrs martin  villa alberti siena september 1859  my dearest mrs martinas you talk of palpitations and the newspapers and then tell me or imply that you are confined for light and air to the times on the italian question i am moved with sympathy and compassion for you and anxious not to lose a post in answering your letter my dear dear friends i beseech you to believe nothing which you have read are reading or are likely to read in the times newspaper unless it contradicts all that went before the criminal conduct of that paper from first to last and the immense amount of injury it has occasioned in the world make me feel that the hanging of the smethursts and ellen butlers would be irredeemable cruelty while these writers are protected by the law  of course you must feel perplexed the paper takes up different sets of falsities quite different and contradictory and treats them as facts and writes leaders on them as if they were facts the reader at last falls into a state of confusion and sees nothing clearly except that somehow or other for something that he has done or hasnt done has intended or hasnt intended louis napoleon is a rascal and we ought to hate him and his  well leave the timesthough from the times and the like base human movements in england and germany resulted more or less directly that peace of villafranca which threw us all here into so deep an anguish that i for one have scarcely recovered from it even to this day  let me tell you we were living in a glow of triumph and gratitude and for me it seemed to me as if i walked among the angels of a newcreated world all faces at florence shone with one thought and one love you can scarcely realise to yourself what it was at that time friends were more than friends and strangers were friends the rapture of the italianstheir gratitude to the french the simple joy with which the french troops understood down to the privates that they had come to deliver their brothers and to go away with empty hands all these things which have been calumniated and denied were wonderfully beautiful scarcely ever in my life was i so happy i was happy not only for italy but for the worldbecause i thought that this great deed would beat under its feet all enmities and lift up england itself at last above its selfish and base policy then on a sudden came the peace it was as if a thunderbolt fell for one day every picture and bust of the emperor vanished and the men who would have died for him before that sun half articulated a curse on his head but the next day we were no longer mad and as the days past we took up hope again and the more thoughtful among our politicians began to understand the situation there was however a painful change before difference of opinion was unknown and there was no sort of anxiety a doubt of the result of the war never crossing anyones mind napoleon in the thickest of the fire with one epaulette shot off was a symbol intelligible to the whole population but when he disappeared from the field and entered the region of spirits and diplomatswhen he walked under the earth instead of on the surfacethough he walked with equal loyalty and uprightness then people were sanguine or fearful according to their temperament and the english and austrian newspapers attributing the worst motives and designs troubled the thoughts of many still both the masses with their blind noble faith and the leaders with their intelligence held fast their hopes and the consequence has been the magnificent spectacle which this nation now offers to europe and which for dignity calm and unanimous determination may seek in vain for its parallel in history now we are very happy again full of hope and faith  we shall probably go to rome again for the winter as florence is considered too cold there will be disturbances that way in all probability but we are bold as to such things the pope is hard to manage even for the emperor it is hard to cut up a feather bed into sandwiches with the finest damascus blade but the end will be attained somehow i wish i could see clearly about venetia there are intelligent and thoughtful italians who are hopeful even for venetia and certainly the emperor of austrias offer to tuscany not made to the assembly as the times said but murmured about by certain agents implies a consciousness on his part of holding venetia with a broken wrist at least  as to the duchies never for a moment did i believe in armed intervention napoleon distinctly with his own lips promised our delegates after the peace and before he left italy that he would neither do it nor permit it and afterwards in paris again and again he accepted the austrian proposition under the condition simply that the dukes were recalled by the people not in defiance of the popular will he has been loyal throughout both to austria and to italy and to his own original programme which did not contemplate dispossessing sovereigns but freeing peoples  italy for the italiansand so it will be for prince napoleon when he was in florence he might have remained there and delighted everybody i know even that a person high in office felt the way towards a proposal of the kind and that he answered in a manner considered too tranchant no no that would suit neither the emperor nor england et pour moi je ne le voudrais pas he used every opportunity at that time of advising the fusion about which people were much less unanimous than they are now  but calumny never dies like me mr russell lord johns nephew the quasiminister at rome very acute and liberal too by the english standard being on his road to rome from london last week proposed paying us a visit and we had him here two days in a valuable spare room he told me that napoleon had been too fin for the english government he had induced them to acknowledge the tuscan voteobserve that fact dearest friends induced them to acknowledge the tuscan vote and now here was his game he had forbidden piedmont to accept the fusion66 and therefore piedmont must refuse the consequence of which would be that there must be another vote in tuscany which would favor prince napoleon and that we having accepted the first vote must accept the second the emperor throwing up his hands and crying who would have thought it  we told him that he and the english government were so far out in their conclusions that piedmont instead of refusing would accept conditionally but he sighed hoped it might be so in the way in which preposterous opinions are civilly put away  scarcely was he gone when the conditional acceptance was known  how much more i could tell you but one cant write all the first battle in the north of italy freed italy potentially from north to south our political life here in the centre is a proof of this the conduct of the italians is admirable but last year they could not have assumed this attitude they were a bound people and even now if the emperor removed his hand from austria we should have the foreign intervention and no hope  we are ready and willing to fight observe the times may take back its words but to oppose the whole austrian empire with our unorganised however heroic forces is impossible we might die indeed  may god bless both of you always i have pretty good letters from home home whats home  your ever affectionate and grateful ba  read la foi des traités it is from the hand of louis napoleon so that i was prepared for the amnesty and for what follows                                        the following letters to mr chorley relate to mrs brownings poem a tale of villafranca which was published in the athenæum for september 24 and subsequently included in the volume of poems before congress poetical works iv 195                                        to mr chorley  villa alberti siena september 12 1859  my dear mr chorleythis isnt a letter as you will see at a glance i should have written to you long since and have also sent this poem which solicits a place in the athenæum if i had not been very ill and been very slow in getting well we wanted to answer your kind letter and shall as for my poem be so good as to see it put in in spite of its good and true politics which you athenæum people being english will dissent from altogether say so if you please but let me in strike but hear me i have been living and dying for italy lately you dont know how vivid these things are to us which serve for conversation at london dinner parties  ahdear mr chorley the bad news about poor lady arnould will have affected you as it did robert a few days ago i do pity so our unhappy friend sir joseph tell us if you can and will what you hear  we came here from florence five or six weeks since when i was very unfit for moving but change of air and a cooler air and repose had grown necessary we are at a villa two miles from siena where we look at scarlet sunsets over purple hills and have the wind nearly all day mr and mrs story are half a mile off in another villa and mr landor at a stones cast otherwise the solitude is absolute mr russell spent two days with us on his way to resume office at rome i should remember that                                        to mr chorley  siena sunday septemberoctober 1859  thank you my dear mr chorley i submit gratefully to being snubbed for my politics in return i will send to your private ear an additional stanza which should interpose as the real seventh but was left out i did not send it to you the day after my note though sorely tempted to do so because it seemed to me likely to annul any small chance of athenæum tolerance which might fall to me would it have done so do you think      a great deed in this world of ours       unheard of the pretence is     it plainly threatens the great powers       is fatal in all senses     a just deed in the world call out     the rifles  be not slack about       the national defences  certainly if i dont guess the sphinx right some of your english guessers in the times and elsewhere fail also as events prove the clever princenapoleonforcentralitaly guess67 for instance has just fallen through by declaration of the moniteur most absurd it was always at one time the prince might have taken the crown by acclamation he was almost rude about it when he was in tuscany and even after the peace members of the present government were not averse were much the contrary indeed at that time the autonomy was still dear we had not made up our minds to the fusion now è altra cosa and to imagine that a man like the french emperor would have waited till now producing by the opportunities he has given the present complication in order to impose the prince is absurd on the very face of it  while standersby guess the comfort is that circumstances ripen we are in spirits about our italy the dignity the constancy the calm are admirable as the unanimity of the people is wonderful even the contadini have rallied to the government and the cry of enthusiasm to which the cross of savoy was uncovered in the market place of siena yesterday was a thrilling thing also we will fight be it understood whenever fighting shall be necessary at present the right arm of austria is broken she cannot hold the sword since solferino at least in central italy let those who doubt our debt to france remember where we were last year and see what our political life is nowreal vivid unhindered our moral qualities are our own but our practical opportunities come from another we could not have made them by force of moral qualities great as those are allowed to be and how striking the growth of this people since 1848 massimo d azeglio said to robert and me it is 48 over again with matured actors but it is even more than that it is 48 over again with regenerated actors all internal jealousies at an end all suspicions quenched all selfish policies dissolved florence forgets herself for italy this is grand would that england that pattern of moral nations would forget herself for the sake of something or someone beyond that would be grand  i wish you were here my dear mr chorley since i am wishing in vain though we are almost at the close of our stay in this pretty country we have a villa with beautiful sights from all the windows and there on the hill opposite live mr and mrs story and within a stones throw in a villino lives the poor old lion landor who being sorely buffeted by his family at fiesole far beyond kissing with tears though robert did what he could took refuge with us at casa guidi one day brokenhearted and in wrath he stays here while we stay and then goes with us to florence where robert has received the authorisation of his english friends to settle him in comfort in an apartment of his own with my late maid wilson who married our italian manservant to take care of him and meanwhile the quiet of this place has so restored his health and peace of mind that he is able to write awful latin alcaics to say nothing of hexameters and pentameters on the wickedness of louis napoleon yes dear mr chorley poems which might appear in the athenæum without disclaimer and without injury to the reputation of that journal  am i not spiteful i assure you i couldnt be spiteful a short time ago so very ill i have been now it is different and every day the strength returns what remains however is a certain necessity of not facing the florence wind this winter and of going again to rome in spite of probable revolutions there we talk of going in the early part of november why wont you come to rome and give us meeting foolish speech when i know you wont we shall be in florence probably at the end of the present week to stay there until the journey further south begins i shall regret this silence and little penini too will have his regrets for he has been very happy here made friends with the contadini has helped to keep the sheep to run after straggling cows to play at nocini did you ever hear of that game and to pick the grapes at the vintagedriving in the grapecarts exactly of the shape of the greek chariots with the grapes heaped up round him and then riding on his own pony which robert is going to buy for him though robert never spoils him no not he it is only i who do that galloping through the lanes on this pony the colour of his curls i was looking over his journal pen keeps a journal and fell on the following memorial which i copy for youi must  this is the happiest day of my hole sic life for now dearest vittorio emanuele is really nostro re  pens weak point does not lie in his politics mr chorley but in his spelling when his contadini have done their days work he takes it on him to read aloud to them the poems of the revolutionary venetian poet dall ongaro to their great applause then i must tell you of his music he is strong in music for ten years oldand plays a sonata of beethoven already in e flatopera 7 and the first four books of stephen heller to say nothing of various pieces by modern german composers in which there is need of considerable execution robert is the maestro and sits by him two hours every day with an amount of patience and persistence really extraordinary also for two months back since i have been thrown out of work robert has heard the child all his other lessons isnt it very very good of him  do write to us and tell me how your sister is and also how you are in spirits and towards the things of the world give her my lovewill you  i had a letter some time ago from poor jessie mario from bologna respect her she hindered her husband from fighting with garibaldi for his country because garibaldi fought under ln which was so highly improper her letter was not unkind to me but altogether and insanely wrong as i considered not more wrong though and much less wicked than the times i was too ill at the time to answer it and afterwards robert would not let me but i should have liked to do it its such a comfort to a woman and a man to sfogarsi as we say here also i was really uneasy at what might be doing at bologna so in spite of friendship it was a relief to me to hear of the police taking charge of all overt possibilities in that direction  is it really true that adam bede is the work of miss evans the woman as i have heard of her and the author as i read her do not hold together may god bless you my dear friend robert shall say so for himself  ever affectionately yours elizabeth barrett browning  my dear mr chorleyreading over what i have written i find that i have been so basely ungrateful as not to say the thing i would when i would thank you your dedication will be accepted with a true sense of kindness and honor together i shall be proud and thankful but perhaps you have changed your mind in the course of this long silence  and now wheres room for robert                                        to miss i blagden  villa alberti siena tuesday septemberoctober 1859  ever dearest isayes i am delighted  evviva il nostro re it isnt a very distinct acceptance however but as distinct as could be expected reasonably68 under conditions of course  on friday morning before noon up to our door came mr russells carriage he had closed with roberts proposition at once and we made room for him without much difficulty and were very glad to see him i didnt go in to dinner and he and robert went to the storys in the eveningso that it wasnt too much for meand then i really like himhe is refined and amiable and acute and liberal as an englishman can be full of traditions or prejudices to use the right word to my surprise he knew scarcely anything and as i modestly observed to robert didnt understand the italian question half as well as i understand it of course there was a quantity of gossip in the antinapoleon sense how the emperor told the king of the peace over the soup twirling his moustache and how the king swore like a trooper at the emperor in consequence and how the emperor took it all very welldidnt mind at all and how and howthings which are manifestly impossible and which robert tells me i ought not to repeat in order not to multiply such vain tales there is metternich the younger ambassador in paris a personal friend of odo russells in whose bosom louis napoleon seems to pour the confidences of his heart about that coquin de cavour who led him into the italian war c c but it simply proves to you and me how an austrian can lie which we could guess before  my facts are these first ferdinando iv69 has an ambassador in rome who has been received officially by the pope  the coolest thing that ever was and is paid out of the private purse of the royal highness there is another ambassador at naples and another at viennaon the same terms so let no one talk of déchéance  then let me tell you what mr russell said to me napoleon said he has been too fin for the english government he made us acknowledge the tuscan vote now he has strictly forbidden piedmont to accept and piedmont must therefore refuse the consequences of which will be that there must be another vote in tuscany by which prince napoleon will be elected and we having acknowledged the first vote must acknowledge the second  of course i protested disbelieved in the forbidding and believed in the accepting he hoped it might be soin the civil way with which people put away preposterous opinionsand left us on saturday night at ten just too late to hear of the fait accompli  out of all that i rescue my fact that napoleon made the english government acknowledge the tuscan vote  dont let kate put any of this into american papers because mr russell was our guest observe and spoke trustingly to us he had just arrived from england and went on to rome without further delay  the word venice makes my heart beat has guiducci any grounds for hope about venice if austria could be bought off at any price something has evidently been promised at villafranca on the subject of venice and evidently the late strengthening of the hands of piedmont will render the austrian occupation on any terms more and more difficult and precarious  i should agree with you on prince napoleon if it were not that i want the emperors disinterestedness to remain in its high place we cant spare great men and great deeds out of the honour of the world there are so few  for the rest the prince would have been a popular and natural choice at one time and as far as central italy was concerned also he is very liberal in opinion and full of ideas i have been told  but the fusion is a wiser step now and altogethereven if we could spare the emperors fame do you remember the obloquy he suffered for neufchâtel and how it came out that if he pressed his conditions it was simply because he meant to fight for the independence of the state and how at last the swiss delegates went to paris to offer their gratitude for the deliverance he had attained for the people his loyalty will come out clean before the eyes of his enemies now as then we agree absolutely and robert does not dissent i think facts begin to be conclusive to him  you are an angel dearest isa with the tact of a woman of the world this in reference to the note you sent me and your answer you could not have done betternot at all  our kind love to kateand mind you give our regards to dr gresonowsky also to mr jarvespoor mr jarveshow sorry i am about the pictures  robert will write another time he says with kindest love                                        to miss browning  siena septemberoctober 1859  my dearest sariannawe are on the verge of returning to florence for a short timeonly to pack up i believe and go further southto meet the revolution tell the dearest nonno with my love the case is that though i am really convalescent and look well robert has even let me take to penini a little which is conclusive it is considered dangerous for me to run the risk of even a florence winter you see i have been very ill the physician thought there was pressure of the lungs on the heart and under those circumstances that i must avoid irritation of the lungs by any cold say nothing which can reach my sisters and frighten them and after all i care very little about doctors except that i do know myself how hard renewals of the late attack would go with me but i mean to take care and use gods opportunities of getting strong again also it seems to me that i have taken a leap within these ten days and that the strength comes back in a fuller tide after all it is not a cruel punishment to us to have to go to rome again this winter though it will be an undesirable expense and though we did wish to keep quiet this winter the taste for constant wanderings having passed away as much for me as for robert we begin to see that by no possible means can one spend as much money to so small an end and then we dont work so welldont live to as much use either for ourselves or others isa blagden bids us observe that we pretend to live at florence and are not there much above two months in the year what with going away for the summer and going away for the winter its too true its the drawback of italy to live in one place here is impossible for us almost just as to live out of italy at all is impossible for us it isnt capricethats all i mean to sayon our part  siena pleases us very much the silence and repose have been heavenly things to me and the country is very pretty though no more than prettynothing marked or romantic no mountains did you fancy us on the mountains except so far off as to be like a cloud only on clear days and no water pretty dimpled ground covered with low vineyards purple hills not high with the sunsets clothing them but i like the place and feel loth to return to florence from this halffurnished villa and stone floors the weather is still very hot but no longer past bearing and we are enjoying it staying on from day to day robert proposed palermo instead of rome but i shrink a little from the prospect of our being cut up into mincemeat by patriotic sicilians though the english fleet which he reminds me of might obtain for you and for england the most satisfactory compensation of the pecuniary kind at rome i shall not be frightened knowing my italians then there will be more comfort and besides no horrible seavoyage some americans have told us that the mediterranean is twice as bad as the atlantic i always thought it twice as bad as anything as people say elegantly we shall not leave florence till november robert must see w landor his adopted son sarianna settled in his new apartment with wilson for a duenna its an excellent plan for him and not a bad one for wilson he will pay a pound english a week for his three rooms and she is to receive twentytwo pounds a year for the care she is to take of him besides what is left of his rations forgive me if robert has told you this already dear darling robert amuses me by talking of his gentleness and sweetness a most courteous and refined gentleman he is of course and very affectionate to robert as he ought to be but of selfrestraint he has not a grain and of suspiciousness many grains wilson will run certain risks and i for one would rather not meet them what do you say to dashing down a plate on the floor when you dont like whats on it and the contadini at whose house he is lodging now have been already accused of opening desks still upon that occasion though there was talk of the probability of landors throat being cut in his sleep as on other occasions robert succeeded in soothing him and the poor old lion is very quiet on the whole roaring softly to beguile the time in latin alcaics against his wife and louis napoleon he laughs carnivorously when i tell him that one of these days he will have to write an ode in honour of the emperor to please me  little pen has been in the utmost excitement lately about his pony which robert is actually going to buy for him i am said to be the spoiler but mark i will confess to you that considering how we run to and fro it never would have entered into the extravagance of my love to set up a pony for penini when i heard of it first i opened my eyes wide only no amount of discretion on my part could enable me to take part against both pen and robert in a matter which pleases pen i hope they wont combine to give me an austrian daughterinlaw when peni is sixteen so i say yes yes certainly and the pony is to be bought and carried to rome fancy that and we are to hunt up some small italian princes and princesses to ride with him at rome i object to hatty hosmer who has been thrown thirty times70 in fact pen has been very coaxing about the pony he has beset robert in private and then as privately entreated me if papa spoke to me about the pony not to discourage him so i discouraged nobody but am rather triumphantly glad upon the whole that we have done such a very foolish extravagant thing  robert will have told you i am sure what a lovely picture mr wilde the american artist staying with the storys has made of penini on horseback and presented to me it is to be exhibited in the spring in london but before then either at rome or florence we will have a photograph made from it to send you by the way mr monroe failed us about the photograph from the bust he said he had tried in vain once but would try again the child is no less pretty and graceful than he was and he rides as he does everything with a grace which is striking he gallops like the wind and with an absolute fearlessnesshe who is timid about sleeping in a room by himself poor darling he has had a very happy time here besides the pony having made friends with all the contadini who adore him and helped them to keep the sheep catch the stray cows drive the oxen in the grapecarts and to bring in the vintage generally besides reading and expounding revolutionary poems to them at evening the worst of it was while it lasted that he ate so many grapes he could eat nothing else whatever still he looks rosy and well and theres nothing to regret  robert has let his moustache and beard grow together and looks very picturesque i thought i should not like the moustache but i do he is in very good looks altogether though in spite of remonstrances he has given up walking before breakfast and doesnt walk at any time half enough i was in fault chiefly because he both sate up at night with me and kept by me when i was generally ill in the mornings so i oughtnt to grumblebut i do love to dear m milsand we are in increasing spirits on italian affairs  your very affectionate ba                                        in october they returned to florence though only for about six weeks before moving on to rome for the winter                                        to mrs jameson  florence casa guidi friday october 1859  ever dearest mona ninahere we are at our florence very thankful for the advantages of our siena residence god has been kind when i think how i went away and how i came back it seems to me wonderful for the latter fortnight the tide of life seemed fairly to set in again and now i am quite well if not as strongwhich of course could not be in the time my doctor opened his eyes to see me yesterday so right in looks and ways but we spend the winter in rome because the great guns of the revolution and even the small daggers will be safer to encounter than any sort of tramontana to tell you the truth dearest friend there have been moments when i have despaired of the republicthat is doubted much whether i should ever be quite well again i mean as tolerably well as it is my normal state to be so severe the attack was altogether  as to political affairs i will use the word of peninis musicmaster when asked the other day how they went ondivinamente said he things are certainly going divinamente i observe that while politicians by profession by the way have various opinions and hope and fear according to their temperaments the people here are steadily sanguine distrusting nobody if it isnt a mazzinian or a codino and looking to the end with a profound interest of course but not any inquietude divinamente things are going on  there is an expectation indeed of fighting but only with the popes troops and we all know what a soldato del papa means or with such mongrel defenders as can be got up by the convicts of modena or tuscany to give us an occasion of triumph presently the expected outburst in sicily and the neapolitan states will simply extend the movement thats our way of thinking and hoping may god defend the right  mr probyn a liberal mp has come out here to appreciate the situation and said last night that after visiting the north of italy and speaking with the chiefs he is full of hope not quite so is cartwright whom you know and who came to us at siena but mr cartwright exceeds dr cumming in the view of napoleon who isnt antichrist to him but is assuredly the devil i like mr cartwright observe but i dont like his modes of political thinking which are after the strictest sect and the reddesttape english he and his family are gone to rome and find the whole city to be hired family men in general are not likely to go there this winter and we shall find the coast very clear and youdearest friend you seem to have given up italy altogether this winter unless you come to rome we shall not be the better for your crossing the alps the eckleys have settled in florence till next year the perkinses also isa blagden is at her villa which if she lets she may pay miss cushman a visit in rome towards the spring but scarcely earlier  after the dreary track of physical discomfort was passed i enjoyed siena much and so did robert and the next time we have to spend a summer in tuscany we shall certainly turn our faces that way when able to drive i drove about with robert and enjoyed the lovely country and once on the last day i ventured into the gallery and saw the divine eve of sodoma for the second time but i never entered the cathedralthink of that there were steps to be mounted but i have the vision of it safe within me since nine years ago the storys let me remember to tell you gratefully were very kind and very delicate offering all kindnesses i could receive and no other  did i tell you that jessie mario had written to me from romagna you know in any case that she and her husband were arrested subsequently and sent into switzerland the other day i had two printed letters from the newspaper evening star enclosed to me by herself or her brother i supposeone the production of her husband and one of brofferio the advocate i thought both were written in a detestable spirit attempting to throw an odium on the governments of central italy which they should all three have rather died in their own poor personal reputations than have wished to hazard under present circumstances mazzini and his party have only to keep still if indeed they do not desire to swamp the great italian cause every movement made by them is a gain to austriaa clear gain every word spoken by them even if it applaud us goes against the cause whoever has a conscience among them let him consider this and be still                                        to miss ef haworth  casa guidi november 2 1859  my dearest fannyi this moment receive your letter and hasten to answer it lest i should be too late for you in paris dear fanny you seem in a chronic transitional state its always crisis with you i cant advise but i do rather wonder that you dont go at once to england and see your friends till you can do your business you can get at pictures in england and at artistic society also if you please and making a slancio into germany or to paris would not be impossible to you occasionally  does this advice sound too disinterested on my part never think so we only stand ourselves on one foot in florenceforced to go away in the summer forced to go away in the winter robert was so persuaded even last winter before my illness of my being better at rome that he would have taken an apartment there and furnished it except that i prevented him then we have calls from the north and on most summers we must be in england and paris to stay on through the summer in florence is impossible to us at least think of thermometers being a hundred and two in the shade this year so i consider your case dispassionately and conclude we are not worth your consideration in reference to prospects connected with any place we are rolling stones gathering no moss theres no use for anyone to run after us but we may roll anyones way i say this penetrated by your affectionate feeling for us may god bless you and keep you my dear friend  as for me i have been nearly as ill as possiblethats the truthsuffering so much that the idea of the evils recurrence makes me feel nervous all the italians who came near me gave me up as a lost life but god would not have it so this time and my old vitality proved itself strong still at present i am remarkably well i had a return of threatening symptoms a fortnight ago but they passed i think i had been talking too much now i feel quite as free and well as usual about the chest and buoyant as to general spirits affairs in italy seem going well and napoleon does not forget us whatever his townsfolk of a certain class may do the french newspapers remember us well i am happy to see also but my dear fanny who am i to give letters to garibaldi i dont know him nor does he know me have you acquaintance with madame swartz she could help mr spicer but she has just gone to rome and we are going to rome did not sarianna tell you that we go on my account to avoid the tramontana here people say we are foolhardy on account of the state of the country but you are aware we are no more frightened of revolutions than m charles is of the tiger prices at rome will be more reasonable at any rate nobody pays high for a probability of being massacred what im most afraid of after all is lest the holiness of our lord should agree to reform at the last moment its too late it must be too lateit ought to be too late  poor mr landor is in perfect health and in rather good spirits seeming reconciled to his fate of exile in the summer he moaned over it sadly never could be happy except in england and i rather leant to sending him back i confess but mr forster and other friends seemed to think that if he went back he could never be kept from the attack all would come over again and really that was probable still i feared for him before he went to siena it does not do to shake hourglasses at his age and though he had been acclimated here by an eleven years residence stillwell there was nothing for it but to keep him here he sighs a little still that it does not agree with him and that florence is a very ugly town and so on but still he is evidently much stronger than when he went to siena can walk for an hour together instead of failing at the end of the street and looks quite vigorous with his snowwhite beard and moustache through which the carnivorous laugh runs and rings he doesnt know yet we are going away he will miss robert dreadfully roberts goodness to him has really been apostolical and think of the effect of a goodness which can quote at every turn of a phrase something from an authors book isnt it more bewitching than other goodnesses to certain authors that is  dearest fanny keep up your spirits do write to me to say you are less sad and love not less your  affectionate ba                                        to mr chorley  casa guidi november 25 1859  my dear friendi thank you with all my heart for your most graceful and touching dedication71 and do assure you that i feel it both as honour and as pleasure  and yet do you know robert says that you might peradventure by the dedication of your book to me mean a covert lecture or sarcasm who knows even if you did the kindness of the personal address would make up for it who wouldnt bear both lecture and sarcasm from anyone who begins by speaking so therefore i am honoured and pleased and grateful all the sameyes and will be  but dear mr chorley you dont silence me notwithstanding the spell of your dedication hasnt fastened me up in an oak for ever your book is very clever your characters very incisively given princess and patriots admirably cut out and up half truths everywhere to which one says how true but one might as well and better say how false seeing that dear mr chorley it does really take two halves to make a whole and we know it the whole truth is not herenot even suggested hereand let me add that the half truth on this occasion is cruel  one thing is ignored in the book under all the ridiculousness under all the wickedness even of such men and women lies a cause a right inherent a wrong committed the cant presupposes a doctrine and the pretension a real heroism your best people in your book seem to have no notion of this your heroine deserves to be a victim not because she was rash and ignorant but because she was selfish and foolish the world wasnt lost for her because she lovedeither a cause or a manbut because she wanted change and excitement if she had felt on the abstract question as i have known women to feel even when they have acted like fools i should pity her more as it is the lesson was necessary if she had not married rashly an italian birbante she would have married rashly an english blackguard and i myself see small difference in the kinds with you however to your mind it is different and in this view of yours seems to me to lie the main fault of your book you evidently think that god made only the english the english are a peculiar people their worst is better than the best of the exterior nations over the rest of the world he has cast out his shoe even supposing that a foreigner does by extraordinary exception some good thing its only in reaction from having murdered somebody last year or at least left his children to starve the year before truth generosity nobleness of will and mind these things do not exist beyond the influence of the times newspaper and the saturday review by the way it would be extraordinary if it were so  well i have lived thirteen years on the continent and far as england is from italy far as the heavens are from the earth i dissent from you dissent from you dissent from you  i say so and there is an end it is relief to me and will make no impression on you but for my sake you permit me to say it i feel sure  dear mr chorley robert and i have had true pleasure in spite of all this faultfinding in feeling ourselves close to you in your book volume after volume we have exchanged talking of you praising you here blaming you there but always feeling pleasure in reading your words and speaking your name dont say its the last novel you who can do so much write us another at once rather doing justice to our sublime azeglios and acute cavours and energetic farinis if i could hear an english statesman conservative or liberal speak out of a large heart and generous comprehension as i did azeglio this last spring i should thank god for it i fear i never shall my boy may perhaps red tape has garrotted this political generation  i persist in being in high hopes for my italy  ever affectionately yours elizabeth b browning                                        early in december the move to rome took place and they found rooms at 28 via del tritone during the winter mrs browning was preparing for the press her last volume the poems before congress while her husband in a fit of disinclination to write poetry occupied himself by trying his hand at sculpture                                        to miss browning  rome december 1859  dearest sariannarobert will have told you of the success of our journey which the necessities of mr landor very nearly pushed back into the cold too late we had even resolved that if the wind changed before morning we would accept it as a sign and altogether give up rome we were all but run to ground you see happily it didnt end so and here we are in a very nice sunny apartment which would have been far beyond our means last year or any year except just now when the popes obstinacy and the rumoured departure of the french have left rome a solitude and called it peacevery problematical peace peni in despair at leaving florence urged on us that for mama to have cold air in her chest would be better than to have a cannonball in her stomach but she was unreasonably more afraid of one than of the other apartments here for which friends of ours paid forty pounds english the month last winter are going for fifteen or underor rather not goingfor nobody scarcely comes to take them the popes reforms seem to be limited in spite of his alarming position which is breaking his heart he told a friend of mrs stowes the other day and out of which he looks to be relieved only by some special miracle the american was quite affected to hear the old man bewail himself to an edict against crinolines the same being forbidden to sweep the sacred pavement of st peters this is true though it sounds like a joke  even florence has very few english a crisis is looked for everywhere prices there are rising fast but one is prepared to pay more for liberty carriages are dearer than in paris by our new tariff which is an item important to me we left mr landor in great comfort i went to see his apartment before it was furnished rooms small but with a look out into a little garden quiet and cheerful and he doesnt mind a situation rather out of the way he pays four pound ten english the month wilson has thirty pounds a year for taking care of him which sounds a good deal but it is a difficult position he has excellent generous affectionate impulses but the impulses of the tiger every now and then nothing coheres in him either in his opinions or i fear affections it isnt age he is precisely the man of his youth i must believe still his genius gives him the right of gratitude on all artists at least and i must say that my robert has generously paid the debt robert always said that he owed more as a writer to landor than to any contemporary at present landor is very fond of him but i am quite prepared for his turning against us as he has turned against forster who has been so devoted for years and years only one isnt kind for what one gets by it or there wouldnt be much kindness in this world  i keep well and of course at rome there is more chance for me than there was in florence but i hated to inflict an unpopular journey of which the advantage was solely mine poor peni said that if he had to leave his florence he would rather go to paris than to rome i dare say he would then his florentines frightened him with ideas of the awful massacre we were to be subjected to here the pony travelled like a glorified houyhnhnm and we have brought a second male servant to take care of him it was an economy for the wages of rome are inordinate pens tender love to his nonno and you with that of  your ever affectionate sister ba                                        to miss ef haworth  rome 28 via tritone friday winter 1859  my dearest fannyset me down as a wretch but hear me i have been ill again in the first place then as weak as a rag in consequence and then with business accumulated on impotent hands proofs to see to and the like you may have heard in the buzz of newspapers of certain presentation swords subscribed for by twenty thousand romans at a franc each and presented in homage and gratitude to napoleon iii and victor emmanuel castellani72 of course was the artist and the whole business had to be huddled up at the end because of his holiness denouncing all such givers of gifts as traitors to the see so just as the swords had to be packed up and disappear some one came with a shut carriage to take me for a sight of these most exquisite works of art it was five oclock in the evening and raining but not cold so that the whole world here agreed it couldnt hurt me i went with robert therefore we were received at castellanis most flatteringly as poets and lovers of italy were asked for autographs and returned in a blaze of glory and satisfaction to collapse as far as im concerned in a near approach to mortality you see i cant catch a simple cold all my bad symptoms came back suffocations singular heartaction cough tearing one to atoms a gigantic blister however let me crawl out of bed at the end of a week and the advantage of a roman climate told i dare say for the attack was less violent and much less long than the one in the summer only i feel myself brittle and become aware of increased susceptibility dr gresonowsky warns me against florence in the winter i must be warm they say well never mind now i am well again and i dont know why i should have whined so to you i am well and living on asses milk by way of sustaining the mental calibre yes and able to have têteàtêtes with theodore parker who believes nothing you know and has been writing a little christmas book for the young just now to prove how they should keep christmas without a christ and a mr hazard a spiritualist who believes everything walks and talks with spirits and impresses robert with a sense of veracity which is more remarkable i like the man much he holds the subject on high grounds takes the idea and lives on it above the earth for years he has given himself to investigation and has seen the impossible certainly enough robert met him and conversed with him and came back to tell me what an intelligent and agreeable new american acquaintance he had made without knowing that he was hazard the spiritualist rather famous in his department dont fall out of heart with investigation it takes patient investigation to establish the number of legs of a newly remarked fly nothing riles me so much as the dogmatism of the people who pronounce on there being nothing to see because in half a dozen experiments perhaps they have seen nothing conclusive      yet could not all creation pierce     beyond the bottom of his eye  mediums cheat certainly so do people who are not mediums i congratulate you on liking anybody better thats pleasant for you at any rate my changes are always the other way i begin by seeing the beautiful in most people and then comes the disillusion it isnt caprice or unsteadiness oh no its merely fate my fate i mean alas my bubbles my bubbles  but im growing too original and will break off my emperor at least has not deceived me and im going into the fire for him with a little brochure of political poems which you shall take at chapmans with the last edition of aurora when you go to england thank you a hundred times from both robert and me for the interesting relation of cobdens sayings on him if cobden had not rushed beyond civilisation i should like to offer him my little book i should like it selflove is the great malady of england and immortal would the statesman be who could and would tear a wider horizon for the popular mind as to the rifle cry i never doubted for one that it had its beginning with interested persons never was any cry more ignoble a rescues b from being murdered by c and e cries out what if a should murder me thats the logic of the subject and the sentiment is worthy of the logic  i expect to be torn to pieces by english critics for what i have ventured to write  write me one of your amusing letters and take our love especially  your ever affectionate bas  there is no roman news people are so scarce the storys have given a ball italians chiefly we think of little but politics                                        to mrs martin  28 via del tritone rome december 29 1859  it was pleasant to have news of you dearest friends and to know of your being comfortably established at pau this cold winter as it seems to be in the north we came here flying from the florence tramontana at the very close of november on the perugia road after having been weatherbound at casa guidi till we almost gave up our roman plan most happily the cold spared us during our six days journey which was very pleasant i like travelling by vetturino the fatigue is small and if you take a supply of books with you the time does not hang fire we had some old balzacs which came new he is one of our godsheathen you will say and we had besides charles reades love me little love me long which is full of ability then peni had his pony as a source of interest the pony was fastened to the vettura horses and came into rome not merely fresh but fat and we have fallen into pleasant places by way of lodgings here our friends having prepared a list to choose from so that i had only to drop out of the hotel into bright sunny rooms which do not cost too much on account of the comparative desertion of this holy city this year we arrived on december 3 and here it is nearly january 1almost a month the older one grows the faster time passes do you observe that you catch the wind of the wheels in your face it seems as you get nearer the end i observe it strongly  let me say of myself first that i am particularly well and feel much more sure and steady than since my illness how are you both i do hope and trust you can give me good news of yourselves do you read aloud to one another or each alone robert and i do the last always may god bless you both in health of body and soul and every source of happiness for the coming and other years i wish and pray it out of my heart  and you are studying music i honour you for it do tell me dearest mrs martin did you know nothing of music before and have you taken up the piano i hold a peculiar heresy as to the use hereafter of what we learn here when there is no longer any growth in me i desire to diefor one and at present i by no means desire to die  so you and others upbraid me with having put myself out of my natural place what is ones natural place i wonder for the chinese it is the inner side of the wall for the red man it is the forest the natural place of everybody i believe is within the crust of all manner of prejudices social religious literary that is as men conceive of natural places but in the highest sense i ask you how can a man or a woman leave his or her natural place wherever gods universe is round and gods law above there is a natural place circumstances the force of natural things have brought me here and kept me it is my natural place and intellectually speaking having grown to a certain point by help of certain opportunities my way of regarding the world is also natural to me my opinions are the natural deductions of my mind isnt it so still i do beg to say both to you and to others accusing that italy is not my adopted country i love italy but i love france too and certainly i love england because i have broken through what seems to me the english little pedlingtonism am i to be supposed to take up an italian little pedlingtonism no indeed i love truth and justice or i try to love truth and justice more than any platos or shakespeares country73 i certainly do not love the egotism of england nor wish to love it i class england among the most immoral nations in respect to her foreign politics and her national defence cry fills me with disgust but this by no means proves that i have adopted another countryno indeed in fact patriotism in the narrow sense is a virtue which will wear out sooner or later everywhere jew and greek must drop their antagonisms and if christianity is ever to develop it will not respect frontiers  as to italy though i nearly broke my heart over her last summer and love the italians deeply i should feel passionately any similar crisis anywhere you cannot judge the people or the question out of the times newspaper whose sole policy is it seems to me to get up a war between france and england though the world should perish in the struggle the amount of fierce untruth uttered in that paper and sworn to by the saturday review makes the moral sense curdle within one you do not know this as we do and you therefore set it down as matter of continental prejudice on my part well time will prove as to italy i have to put on the rein to prevent myself from hoping into the ideal again i am on my guard against another fall from that chariot of the sun but things look magnicently and if i could tell you certain facts which i cant you would admit it odo russell the english minister here in an occult sense who with a very acute mind is strongly russell and english and was full of the english distrust of ln when with us at siena last september came to me two days ago and said it is plain now the emperor is rather italian than french he has worked and is working only for italy and whatever has seemed otherwise has been forced from him in order to keep on terms with his colleagues the kings and queens of europe everything that comes out proves it more and more in fact he has risked everything for the italians except their cause i am delighted among other things at cavours representation of italy at the congress antonelli and his party are in desperation gnashing their teeth at the tuileries the position of the emperor is most difficult but his great brain will master it we are rather uneasy about the english ministryits work in congress it might go out for me falling to pieces on the pitiful suez question or otherwise but we do want it at congress                                        to mrs jameson  28 via del tritone rome february 22 1860  dearest naughtiest mona ninawhere is the place of your soul your body abiding at brighton that never no never do i hear from you it seems hard last summer i was near to slipping out of the world and then except for a rap you might have called on me in vain and said rap you wouldnt have believed in also even this winter even in this rome the city of refuge i have had an attack less long and sharp indeed but weakening and though i am well now and have corrected the proofs of a very thin and wicked brochure on italian affairs in verse of course yet still i am not too strong for codliver oil and the affectionateness of such friends as you i speak as if i had a shoal of such friendspovera mi write to me therefore especially as the english critics will worry me alive for my book and you will have to say well done critics so write before you read it to say ba i love you that makes up for everything oh i know you did write to me in the summer and then i wrote to you and then there came a pause which is hard on me i repeat  geddie has come here lamenting also besides we have been somewhat disappointed by your not coming to italy never will you come to rome as geddie expects late in the spring to take an apartment close to her looking charmingly on the river i told her quite frankly that you would not be so unwise rome is empty of foreigners this year a few americans standing for all then in the midst of the quiet deeply does the passion work on one side with the people on the other in the despair and rage of the papal government the pope cant go out to breakfast to drink chocolate and talk about divine things to the christian youth but he stumbles upon the term new ideas and falling precipitately into a fury neither evangelical nor angelical calls napoleon a sicario cutthroat and vittorio emanuele an assassino the french head of police who was present whispered to acquaintances of ours comme il enrage le saint père in fact all dignity has been repeatedly forgotten in simple rage affairs of italy generally are going on to the goal and we look for the best and glorious results perhaps not without more fighting certainly we cant leave venetia in the mouth of austria by a second villafranca we cannot and will not and sooner or later the emperor is prepared i think to carry us through odo russell told me without my putting any question to him that everything as it came out proved how true he had been to italythat in fact he had rather acted as an italian than as a frenchman and mr russell while liberal is himself very english and free from buonaparte tendencies from hair to heel  we often have letters from dear isa blagden who sends me the florence news more shining from day to day central italy seems safe  but let me tell you of my thin slice of a wicked book yes i shall expect you to read it and i send you an order for it to chapman therefore everybody will hate me for it and so you must try hard to love me the more to make up for that say its mad and bad and sad but add that somebody did it who meant it thought it felt it throbbed it out with heart and brain and that she holds it for truth in conscience and not in partisanship i want to tell you oh i cant help telling you that when the ode was read before peni at the part relating to italy his eyes overflowed and down he threw himself on the sofa hiding his face the child has been very earnest about italian politics the heroine of that poem called the dance74 was madame di laiatico the court lady is an individualisation of a general fashion the ladies at milan having gone to the hospitals in full dress and in open carriages macmahon taking up the child75 is also historical i believe the facts to be in the book he has done it all76 were cavours words when you see an advertisement and have an opportunity to apply at chapmans do so by this sign enclosed i read of you in the papers stirring up the women  write and say how you are and where you are  part of this letter is missing  your ever very affectionate ba  i hope you liked the article on the immorality of luncheonrooms in your highminded saturday review   footnotes  62 prime minister of piedmont from 184952 and one of the most honourable and patriotic of italian statesmen  63 subsequently english ambassador at berlin and one of the plenipotentiaries at the berlin congress of 1878 created lord ampthill in 1881 and died in 1884  64 now in the possession of mr r barrett browning  65 the conferences for the arrangement of the final treaty of peace were held at zurich  66 of tuscany with piedmont which was voted by tuscany in august modena parma and romagna did the same and so made the critical step towards the creation of a united italy  67 it was supposed that napoleon contemplated constituting central italy or at least tuscany into a kingdom for his brother jerome and that it was for this reason that the latter had been sent to florence with a french corps at the beginning of the war  68 napoleon being opposed to the idea of a united italy victor emmanuel did not consider it wise to accept the proffered crown of central italy while a french army was still in the country and the terms of peace were not finally settled  69 the new duke of tuscany he had succeeded to this now very shadowy throne on july 21 of this year  70 not on account of bad riding be it observed but of daring and venturesome riding  71 mr chorley had dedicated his last novel roccabella to mrs browning  72      do you see this ring                  tis romework made to match     by castellanis imitative craft      etrurian circlets etc      the ring and the book i 14  73 mrs browning is here quoting from her own preface to poems before congress  74 poetical works iv 190  75 see napoleon iii in italy stanza 11 ibid p 181 the incident occurred at macmahons entry into milan three days after magenta  76 ibid stanza 12     chapter xi  18601861   early in 1860 the promised booklet poems before congress was published in england and met with very much the reception the authoress had anticipated it contained only eight poems all but one relating to the italian question published at a time when the events to which they alluded were still matters of current controversy they could not but be regarded rather as pamphleteering than as poetry and it could hardly be expected that the ordinary englishman whose sympathy with italy did not abolish his mistrust eminently justifiable as later revelations have shown it to be of louis napoleon should read with equanimity the continual scorn of english policy and motives or the continual exaltation of the emperor looking back now over a distance of nearly forty years and when the second empire with all its merits and its sins has long gone to its account we can at least in part put aside the politics and enjoy the poetry though pieces like the dance and a court lady are not of much permanent value there are many fine passages notably in napoleon iii in italy and italy and the world in which a true and noble enthusiasm is expressed in living and burning words worthy of a poet  for attacks on her italian politics mrs browning was prepared as the foregoing letters show but one incident caused her real and quite unexpected annoyance the reviewer in the athenæum apparently mr chorley by some unaccountable oversight took the curse for a nation to apply to england instead of being as it obviously is a denunciation of american slavery consequently he referred to this poem in terms of strong censure as improper and unpatriotic on the part of an english writer and a protest from mrs browning only elicited a somewhat grudging editorial note in a tone which implied that the interpretation which the reviewer had put upon the poem was one which it would naturally bear one can hardly be surprised at the annoyance which this treatment caused to mrs browning though some of the phrases in which she speaks of it bear signs of the excitement which characterised so much of her thought in these years of mental strain and stress and bodily weakness and decay                                        to mrs jameson  fragment early in 1860  i remember well your kindness to it nothing was said then about the fit arguments for poetry and i recovered from it to write aurora leigh of which however many people did say that it was built on an unfit argument and besides was a very indecent corrupting book have i not heard of ladies of sixty who had never felt themselves pure since reading it but now consider since you did not lose hope for me in casa guidi windows because the line of politics was your own why need you despair of me in the poems before congress although i do praise the devil in them a mistake is not fatal to a critic need it be to a poet does napoleons being wicked if he is so make italy less interesting or unfit for poetry historical subjects like the dance or the court lady meanwhile that thinskinned people the americans exceed some of you in generosity rendering thanks to reprovers of their ill deeds and understanding the pure love of the motive77 let me tell you rather for their sake than mine i have extravagant praises and prices offered to me from over the western sun in consequence of these very poems before congress the nation is generous in these things and not thinskinned  as to england i shall be forgiven in time the first part of a campaign and the first part of a discussion are the least favourable to english successes after a while by the time you have learnt to shoot cats with the new rifles you will put them away and arrive at the happy second thought which corrects the first thought that second thought will not be of invasion prophesies a headless prophet time was when heads were off a man would die a manyes but a woman we die hard you know  here an end i hope you will write to me some day and ease me by proving to me that i have ceased to be bitter to the palate of your soul believe thisthat rather than be a serious sadness to you i would gladly sit on in the pillory under the aggressive mud of that mob of saturday reviewers who take their mud and their morals from the same place and use voices hoarse with hooting down unenglish poetesses to cheer on the english champion tom sayers for me i neither wish for the belt78 nor martyrdom but if i were ambitious of anything it might be to be wronged where for instance cavour is wronged                                        to miss i blagden  rome friday end of march 1860  my ever dearest isa i am scarcely in heart yet for writing letters and did not mean to write today you heard of the unexpected event which brought me the loss of a very dear friend dear dear mrs jameson79 it was of course a shock to me as such things are meant to be  and now i come to what makes me tax you with a dull letter i feeling so dully and dear it is with dismay i have to tell you that the letter you addressed under cover to mr russell has never reached us till your last communication this moment received i had hoped that the contents of it might have been less important than opapers must be what is to be done or thought i beseech you to write and tell me if harm is likely to follow from this seizure the other inclosure came to me quite safely because it came by the government messenger i think you sent it through corbet but mr russells post letters are as liable to opening as mine are his name is no security whenever you send a nazione newspaper through him it never reaches us though we receive our monitore through him regularly why because in his position he is allowed to have newspapers for his own use he takes in for himself no monitore so ours goes to his account but he does take in a nazione therefore ours is seized as being plainly for other hands than his own licensed ones  i am very much grieved about this loss of your letter and its contents first theres my fear lest harm should come of this and then theres my own personal mulcting of what would have been of such deep interest to me i am revelling see how little  robert wrote in a playful vein to kate and you must not and will not care for that he had understood from your letter that you and the majority had all like the athenæum understood the curse for a nation to be directed against england robert was furious about the athenæum no other word describes him and i thought that both i and mr chorley would perish together seeing that even the accusation such a one made me infamous it seemed  the curious thing is that it was at roberts suggestion that that particular poem was reprinted there it never had appeared in england though barkis was willing i had no manner of objection i never have to justice  mr chorleys review is objectionable to me because unjust a reviewer should read the book he gives judgment on and he could not have read from beginning to end the particular poem in question and have expounded its significance so i wrote a letter on the subject to the athenæum to correct this misstatement which i cared for chiefly on roberts account  in fact i cursed neither england nor america i leave such things to our holy father here the poem only pointed out how the curse was involved in the action of slaveholding  i never saw robert so enraged about a criticism he is better now let me add  in the matter of savoy80 it has vexed and vexes me i do confess to you its a handle given to various kinds of dirty hands it spoils the beauty and glory of much the uncontested admiration of which would have done good to the world at the same time as long as piedmont and savoy agree in the annexation to france there is nothing to object tonot to object to with a reasonable mind and it seems to be understood it is stated in fact that the cession is under condition of the assent of the populations the vote is necessary to the honour of france i do not doubt that it will be consulted meantime there is too much haste i think there is a haste somewhat indelicate in the introduction of french garrisons into savoy previous to the popular conclusion being known there should have been mixed garrisons french and piedmontese till the vote was taken napoleon should have been more particular in savoy than he was even in central italy as to the advance of any occasion of the current charge of pressure  altogether the subject is an anxious onewould be even if less rancorous violence on the part of his enemies were wreaked upon it the english tories are using it with the frenzy of despair and no wonder  lamoricières arrival is another proof of the internal coalition against the empire  now i must end robert says or i shall lose the post my true best love and robertsand penis  write to me do dearest isa and tell me if the mss sent were nuisibles the excommunication just out is said to include the emperor  your ever loving ba                                        to miss browning  rome about march 1860  dearest sariannait is impossible to have a regret for dear lady elgin she has been imprisoned here under double chains too long to be out of the dark and the restraint is a blessing to that spirit and must be felt so by all who love her of course i shall write to lady augusta bruce  no i dont think there is much to be forgiven by my countrymen in my book what i reproach them for none of them deny they certainly took no part in the war nor will they if there is more war and certainly the existence of the rifle clubs is a fact  robert and i began to write on the italian question together and our plan was roberts own suggestion to publish jointly when i showed him my ode on napoleon he observed that i was gentle to england in comparison to what he had been but after villafranca the palmerston ministry having come in he destroyed his poem and left me alone and i determined to stand alone what robert had written no longer suited the moment but the poetical devil in me burnt on for an utterance i have spoken nothing but historical truths as far as the outline is concerned but the spirit of the whole is of course opposed to the national feeling or i should not in my preface suppose it to be offended  with every deference to you dearest sarianna i cannot think that you who live as the english usually do quite aside and apart from french society can judge of the interest in france for italy i see french lettersletters of french men and womengiving a very contrary impression the french newspapers give a very contrary impression and the statistics of books and pamphlets published and circulated in france on the italian question this year are in most prodigious disaccord with such a conclusion compare them with the same statistics in england and then judge  besides the english to do them justice can be active and generous in any cause in which they are really interested and it is a fact that we could not get up a subscription in england even for garibaldis muskets lately while france is always giving  not that there are not and have not been many english of generous sympathies towards italy that i well know but it is a small protesting minority lord john has done very well as far as words can go but it has been simply in giving effect to the intentions of france who wanted much a respectable conservative power like england to endorse her bill of revolution with the retrograde european governments  i will spare what i think of the treatment in england of the savoy question we are losing all moral prestige in the eyes of the world with our small jealousies and factional struggles for power  ah dear sarianna i dont complain for myself of an unappreciating publici have no reason but just for that reason i complain more about robert only he does not hear me complain to you i may say that the blindness deafness and stupidity of the english public to robert are amazing of course milsand had heard his name well the contrary would have been strange robert is all england cant prevent his existence i suppose but nobody there except a small knot of preraffaelite men pretends to do him justice mr forster has done the best in the press as a sort of lion robert has his range in society and for the rest you should see chapmans returns while in america hes a power a writer a poet he is readhe lives in the hearts of the people browning readings here in boston browning evenings there for the rest the english hunt lions too sarianna but their favourite lions are chosen among lords chiefly or railroad kings its worth eating much dirt said an englishman of high family and character here to get to lady s soirée americans will eat dirt to get to us theres the difference english people will come and stare at me sometimes but physicians dentists who serve me and refuse their fees artists who give me pictures friends who give up their carriages and make other practical sacrifices are not englishnothough english woolner was generous about a bust let me be just at least  there is a beautiful photograph of wildes picture of pen on horseback which shall go to you the likeness better than in the picture  i can scarcely allude to the loss of my loved friend mrs jameson its a blot more on the world to me best love to you and the dear nonno from pen and myself the editor of the atlas writes to thank me for the justice and courage of my international politics english clergyman stops at the door to say to the servant he does not know me but applauds my sentiments so there may be ten just persons who spare  your affectionate sister                                        to miss i blagden  rome saturday april 1860  my dearest dear isa not well that must be the first word by return of post dear let me have a better letter to say that you are well and bright again and brilliant isa as customary  and now join me in admiration of the husband browning isnt he a miracle whoever else may be the wife browning not to name most other human beings would have certainly put the monitore receipt into the fire or at best lost it in fact whisper it not in the streets of askelon but she had forgotten even the fact of its having been sent and was quietly concluding that wilson had lost it in a fog and that we should have patiently to pay twice not at all up rises the husband browning superior to his mate and with eyes all fire holds up the receipt like an heroic rifleman looking to a french invasion at the end of a hundred years blessed be they who keep receipts it is a beatitude beyond my reach  only i do hope my tuscan friends of the monitore are only careless and forgetful in their business habits and that they didnt think of annexingeh isa no i dont believe it was dishonesty it might have so very well been oblivion  may the paper come today thats all we get the galignani but cant afford to miss our italian news then not only we ourselves but half a dozen tuscan exiles here in rome who are not allowed to read a freely breathed word come to us for that paper friends of ferdinandos living in rome first he lent them the paper then they got frightened for fear of being convicted through some spy of reading such a thing81 and prayed to come to this house to read it there have been six of them sometimes in the evening we keep a sort of café in rome observe and your monitore is necessary to us  you have seen by this time lamoricières82 address to the papal array its extraordinary while the french are still here that such a publication should be permitted obvious as the position taken must be to all and personally displeasing to the emperor as the man is known to be magnanimity is certainly a great feature of napoleons mind and now what next the french are going of course you would suppose an attack on romagna imminent and better so let us have it out at once  i have the papers i am much the better for some things in them theres to be the universal suffrage the withdrawal of troops whatever i wanted cavours despatch to the swiss is also excellent those injured martyrs wanted the bone in their teeth thats all  the wailing in england for swiss and savoyards while other nationalities are to be trodden under foot without intervention except whats called aggression is highly irritating to me  dearest isa robert tore me from my last sentence to you i was going to say that i cared less for the attacks of the press on my book than i care for your sympathy thank you for feeling mad for me but be sane again dear its not worth being mad for  in the advertised blackwood do you see an article called poetic aberration it came into my head that it might be a stone thrown at me and robert went to monaldinis to glance at it sure enough it is a stone he says a violent attack and let me do him justice it was only the misstatement in the athenæum which overset him only the first fire which made him wink now he turns a heros face to all this cannonading he doesnt care a straw he says and whats more he doesnt really so i who was only sorry for him cant care observe isa if there had been less violence and more generosity the poems would obviously have been less deserved  the english were not always so thinskinned lord byron and moore have  the rest of the letter is lost                                        to miss i blagden  rome april 2 1860  ever dearest isahere are the letters i am sorry i wrote rashly yesterday but from an expression of yours i took for granted that the packet went by the post and i have been really very anxious about it  no isa i dont like the tone of these letters so well i can understand that what is said of belgium and the rhine provinces is in the event of a certain coalition and eventual complication but it doesnt do even in a thought and theory to sacrifice a country like belgium i respect france and lidée napoléonienne yes but conscience and the populations more  as to napoleons waiting for the bribe of savoy before he would pass beyond villafranca this is making him ignoble and i do not believe it in the least also it contradicts the letterwriters previous letter in which he said that savoy had been from the beginning the sous entendre of venetia no i can see that an italy in unity a great newly constituted nation might be reasonably asked by her liberator to shift her frontier from beyond the alps but for victor emmanuel to be expected at milan to put his hand into his pocket and pay without completion of facts or consultation of peoples this would be to faire le marchand indeed and i could write no odes to a man who could act so i dont sell my soul to napoleon and applaud him quand même but absolutely i disbelieve in this version isa if the war had not stopped at villafranca it would have been european that if not clear at the time is clear nowclear from the official statement of prussia by putting diplomacy in the place of the war a great deal was absolutely attained besides a better standpoint for a renewal of the war should that be necessary hence those tearsof villafranca  the letterwriter is very keen and evidently hears a good deal while he selects after his own judgment i am glad to hear that lopinion nationale represents the efficient power thats comfortable whats to be done next in the south here rests with us it seems but what of the occupation of rome and what is the meaning of lamoricière being here with the consent of the emperor lamoricière can mean no good either to the french government or to italy and the emperor knows it well  my dearest isa let us make haste to say that of course i shall be glad to let my book be used as is proposed how will we get a copy to m fauvety i enclose an order to chapman and hall which m dall ongaro83 may enclose to his friend who must enclose it on to england with a letter conveying his address in paris then the book may be sent by the book post wouldnt that do  i shall give a copy to dall ongaro when i can get a supply and one for the trollopes also never forgetting dear kate and i do expect copies through the embassy but i have not seen a word of the book yet i only know that being cæsars wife i am not merely suspected poor wife but dishonored before the athenæum world as an unnatural vixen who instead of staying at home and spinning wool stays at home84 and curses her own land it is my own my native land if indeed i had gone abroad and cursed other peoples lands there would have been no objection that poem as addressed to america has always been considered rather an amiable and domestic trait on my part but england heavens and earth what a crime the very suspicion of it is guilt  the fact is between you and me isa certain of those quoted stanzas do fit england as if they were made for her which they were not though  according to your letters venetia seems pushed off into the future a little dont you think  still they are interesting very get dall ongaro to remember me in future the details about antonelli shall go to him i am delighted at the idea of being translated by him  write to me my dearly loved isa you who are true let me touch you  yours ever from the heart ba                                        to miss i blagden  28 via del tritone monday and tuesday april 1860  ever dearest isai send you under this enclosure an abstract of some papers given to me by somebody who cant be named with a sketch of antonelli i wasnt allowed to copy i was only to abstract but everything is in the whole has been verified and may be absolutely relied on i hear so long i have waited for them should i have translated them into italian i wonder or can dall ongaro get to the bottom of them so dates of birth are not mentioned i observe from another quarter i may get those about has the character of romancing a little  not a word do you say of your health do another time remember that your previous letter left you in bed  dearest isa how it touched me your putting away the saturday review but dear dont care more for me than i do for myself that very review lent to us we lent to the storys dear the abuse of the press is the justification of the poems so dont be reserved about these attacks i was a little little vexed by a letter this morning from my brother george but pazienza we must bear these things robert called yesterday on odo russell who observed to him that the article in the saturday review was infamous and that the general tone of the newspaper had grown to be so offensive he should cease to take it in not on my account observe but said mr russell its extraordinary the sensation your wifes book has made every paper i see has something to say about it added he it is curious the offence has been less in the objections to england than in the praise of napoleon certainly monckton milnes said a good thing when he was asked lately in paris what after all you english wanted we want he answered first that the austrians should beat you french thoroughly next we want that the italians should be free and then we want them to be very grateful to us for doing nothing towards it this concluded russell sums up the whole question mark he is very english but he cant help seeing what lies before him having quick perceptions moreover then men have no courage milnes for instance keeps his sarcasm for paris and in england supports his rifle club and all parliamentary decencies  mind you read blackwood though i was rather vexed by georges letter he is awfully vexed i couldnt help laughing at my sister henrietta who accepts the interpretation of the athenæum having read the poems and exclaims but oh ba such dreadful curses  mrs apthorp has arrived but i have not seen her nor received the paper pins were right though i should have liked some smaller monitores arrived up at the 12 beyond nothing i hear that mr apthorp was struck with the brilliant conversation between you and miss cobbe you made an impression too on mrs apthorp  oh isa how i should like to be with you in our florence today yes yes i think of you here the day is gloomy and with a sprinkling now and then of rain i trust you may have more sun god bless the city and the hills and the people who dwell therein  i have just sent a lyric to thackeray for his magazine85 he begged me for something long ago robert suggested that now he probably wanted nothing from such profane hands so i told him that in that case he might send me back my manuscripts in the more favorable case it may be still too late for this month the poem is meek as maid though the last thing i wroteno touch of deboraha musical instrument how good this cornhill magazine is anthony trollope is really superb86 i only just got leave from robert to send something he is so averse to the periodicals as mediums  lamoricières arrival produces a painful sensation among the people here and the withdrawal of the french troops has become most unpopular i am anxious if the emperor has consented to his coming it was pure magnanimity and very characteristic but the cost of this should be paid by france and not italy we must feel besides i am content about savoy  dearest isa you and your saturday reviewer shall have roberts portrait are you sure he didnt ask for mine how good you are to us and landor god bless you says  your tenderly loving ba                                        to mr chorley  28 via del tritone rome april 13 1860  my dear mr chorleyit is always better to be frank than otherwise sometimes it is necessary to be frankthat is when one would fain keep a friend yet has a thing against him which burns in one i shall put my foot on this spark in a moment but first i must throw it out of my heart you see and here it is  dearest mr chorley you have not been just to me in the matter of my poems before congress why have you not been just to me you are an honest man and my friend those two things might go together your opinions critical or political are free from stress of friendship i never expected from you favor or mercy because you were my friend it would have been unworthy of us both but i did expect justice from you although you were my friend that is reasonable  and i consider that as a conscientious critic you were bound to read through the whole of the rhyme called a curse for a nation before ticketing it for the public and i complain that after neglecting to do so and making a mistake in consequence you refused the poor amends of printing my letter in full a loose paragraph like this found today in your athenæum about mrs browning wishing to state that the curse was levelled at america quoad negroslavery and the satisfaction of her english readers in this correction of what was generally thought as if mrs browning stated it arbitrarily perhaps from fright and as if the poem stated nothing distinctly and as if the intention of it could be generally thought what the athenæum critic took it to be except by following his lead or adopting his process of a general skipping of half the said poemthis loose paragraph does not cover a great fault it seems to me well i have spoken  as to the extent of the general thought we cannot of course judge here where it is so difficult to get access to periodicals we have seen however two virulent articles from enemies in blackwood and the saturday review the latter sparing none of its native mud through three columns not to speak of a renewal of the charge in several political articles with a most flattering persistency both these writers being enemies keep clear of the general thought suggested by a friend and accepted indeed by friendly and generous reviewers in the atlas and daily news therefore i feel perfectly unaggrieved by all the enemies hard words they speak from their own point of view and have a right to speak  in fact in printing the poems i did not expect to help my reputation in england but simply to deliver my soul to get the relief to my conscience and heart which comes from a pentup word spoken or a tear shed whatever i may have ever written of the least worth has represented a conviction in me something in me felt as a truth i never wrote to please any of you not even to please my own husband every genuine artist in the world whatever his degree goes to heaven for speaking the truth it is one of the beatitudes of art and attainable without putting off the flesh  to be plain and not mystical it is obvious that if i had expected compliments and caresses from the english press to my poems before congress the said poems would have been little deserved in england and a greater mistake on my part than any committed by the athenæum which is saying much  there i have done the spark is under my shoe if in losing my temper i have lost my music dont let it be said that i have lost my friend by my own fault and choice also  for i would not willingly lose him though he should be unjust to me thrice instead of this once throughout our intercourse affectionately yours dear mr chorley  elizabeth barrett browning                                        to mr chorley  28 via del tritone rome may 2 1860  my dear mr chorleyi make haste to answer your letter and beg you to do the like in putting out of your life the least touch of pain or bitterness connected with me it is true true true that some of my earliest gladness in literary sympathy and recognition came from you i was grateful to you then as a stranger and i am not likely ever to forget it as a friend believe this of me as i feel it of you  in the matter of reviews and of my last book and before leaving the subject for ever i want you distinctly to understand that my complaint related simply to the mistake in facts and not to any mistake in opinion the quality of neither mercy nor justice should be strained in the honest reviewer by the personal motive and because you felt a regard for me that was no kind of reason why you should like my book  in printing the poems i well knew the storm of execration which would follow your zephyr from the athenæum was the first of it gentle indeed in comparison with various gusts from other quarters all fair it was from your standpoint to see me as a prophet without a head or even as a woman in a shrewish temper and if my husband had not been especially pained by my being held up at the end of a fork as the unnatural shemonster who had cursed her own country following the holy father i should have left the mistake to right itself without troubling the athenæum office with the letter they would not insert in fact robert was a little vexed with me for not being vexed enough i was only vexed enough when the athenæum corrected its misstatement in its own way that did extremely vex me for it made me look ungenerous cowardly meanas if in haste to escape from the dogs in england i threw them the good name of america mrs browning now states  well dear mr chorley it was not your doing so the thing that vexed me enough in you was a mistake of mine let us forgive one another our mistakes and there an end i was wrong in taking for granted that the letter which referred to your review was entrusted to you to dispose of and you were not right in being in too much haste to condemn a book you disliked to give the due measure of attention to every page of it the insurgents being plainly insurgents you shot one at least of them without trial as was done in spain the other day true that even favorable critics have fallen here and there into your very mistake but is not that mainly attributable to the suggestive power of the athenæum do you not believe so yourself thais led the way  and now that we clasp hands again my dear friend let me say one word as to the argument of my last poems once in a kind and generous review of aurora leigh you complained a little of new lights now i appeal to you is it not rather you than i who deal in new lights if the liberation of a people and the struggle of a nation for existence have ceased in your mind to be the right arguments for poetry observe i may be wrong or right about napoleon he may be snake scoundrel devil in his motives but the thing he did was done before the eyes of all his coming here was real the stroke of his sword was indubitable the rising and struggle of the people was beyond controversy and the state of things at present is a fact what if the father of poetry homer to go back to the oldest lights made a mistake about the cause of achilles wrath what if achilles really wanted to get rid of briseis and the war together and sulked in his tent in a great sham should we conclude against the artistic propriety of the poets argument therefore  you greatly surprise me by such objections it is objected to new lights as far as i know that we are apt to be too metaphysical selfconscious subjective everything for which there are hard german words the reproaches made against myself have been often of this nature as you must be well aware beyond human sympathies is a phrase in use among critics of a certain school but that in any school any critic should consider the occasions of great tragic movements such as a war for the life of a nation unfit occasions for poetry improper arguments fills me with an astonishment which i can scarcely express adequately and pardon me i can only understand your objection by a sad return on the english persistency in its mode of looking at the italian war you have looked at it always too much as a mere table for throwing diceso much for frances ambition so much for piedmonts so much stuff for intrigue in an english parliament for ousting whigs or inning conservatives you have not realised to yourselves the dreadful struggle for national life you who thank god have your life as a nation safe a calm scholastic italian friend of ours said to my husband at the peace its sad to think how the madhouses will fill after this you do not conceive clearly the agony of a whole people with their house on fire though lord brougham used that very figure to recommend your international neutrality no if you conceived of it if you did not dispose of it lightly in your thoughts as of a roccabella conspiracy full half vanity and only half seriousa mazzini explosion not a quarter justified and taking place often on an affair of métieryou a thoughtful and feeling man would cry aloud that if poets represent the deepest things the most tragic things in human life they need not go further for an argument and i say my dear mr chorley that if while such things are done and suffered the poets business is to rhyme the stars and walk apart i say that mr carlyle is right and that the world requires more earnest workers than such dreamers can be  for my part i have always conceived otherwise of poetry i believe that if anything written by me has been recognised even by you the cause is that i have written not to please you or any critic but the deepest truth out of my own heart and head i dont dream and make a poem of it art is not either all beauty or all use it is essential truth which makes its way through beauty into use not that i say this for myself artistically i may have failed in these poemsthat is for the critic to consider but in the choice of their argument i have not failed artistically i think or my whole artistic life and understanding of life have failed  there i cannot persuade you of this but i believe it i have tried to stand on the facts of things before i began to feel dithyrambically thought out coldly then felt upon warmly i will not admit of being heated out of fairness i deny it and stand upon my innocency  and after all casa guidi windows was a book that commended itself to you mr chorley  the rest of this letter is missing                                        to john forster  28 via del tritone rome monday may 1860  i have tried and taken pains to see the truth and have spoken it as i have seemed to see it if the issue of events shall prove me wrong about the e napoleon the worse for him i am bold to say rather than for me who have honored him only because i believed his intentions worthy of the honor of honest souls  if he lives long enough he will explain himself to all so far i cannot help persisting in certain of my views because they have been held long enough to be justified by the past on many points the intervention in italy while it overwhelmed with joy did not dazzle me into doubts of the motive of it but satisfied a patient expectation and fulfilled a logical inference thus it did not present itself to my mind as a caprice of power to be followed perhaps by an onslaught on belgium and an invasion of england these things were out of the beat and are there may follow hungarian polish or other questionsbut there wont follow an english question unless the english make it which i grieve to think looks every day less impossible  dear mr f have you read la foi des traités written some of it by lns own hand do you consider abouts carte de leurope as the times does a dull jeu desprit the wit isnt dull and the serious intention hid in those mummy wrappings is not inauthentic officialcertainly not but napoleonicyes i believe so and i seem to myself to have strong reasons  but you are sorry that cavour loves popularity in england i cried rather bitterly better so a complete injustice comes to nearly the same thing as a complete justice have we not watched for a year while every saddle of iniquity has been tried on the napoleonic back and nothing fitted wasnt he to crush piedmontese institutions like so many eggshells was he ever going away with his army and hadnt he occupied houses in genoa with an intention of bombarding the city didnt he keep troops in the north after villafranca on purpose to come down on us with a grand duke at best or otherwise with a swamping kingdom of etruria and plonplon to rule it and wouldnt he give back bologna to the pope bound by seven devils fiercer than the first and prove austria bettered by solferino also were not cipriani farini and other patriots his mere creatures in treacherous correspondence with the tuileries doing his dirty work keeping things in suspense till destruction should arrange itself on falsehood have i not read and heard from the most intelligent english journals and the bestinformed english politicians men with one foot and two ears in the cabinet these true things written and repeated and watched while they died out into the vast inane and immense absurd from which they were born  so i would rather have a rounded complete injustice as we cant have the complete justice after all the thing done is only a nation saved hurry up the men who did it on the same cord ought not cavour to be there  and if the savoy cession is a crime he is criminal he who undeniably from the beginning contemplated it not as the price of the war but as the condition of a newly constituted italy and the condition implies more than is understood more than the consenting parties dare to confesscan at present afford to confessunless i am deceived by information which has hitherto justified itself in the event be patient with me one momentfor if i differ from you i seem to have access to another class of facts than you see if italy for instance expands itself to a nation of twentysix millions would you blame the emperor who did it all cavours own phrase for providing an answer to his own people in some small foresight about the frontier when in the course of fifty or a hundred years they may reproach his memory with the existence of an oppressive rival or enemy next door mr russell said to me last january everything that comes out proves the emperor to have acted towards italy like an italian rather than a frenchman at which we applaud that is you and mr r and i and the italians generally applaud butlet us be justthat would not be a satisfactory opinion in france of the head of the state would it do you think it was obviously his duty not to be negligent of certain eventualities in the case of his own country to be a frenchman there  oh savoy has given me pain and i would rather for the worlds sake that a great action had remained out of reach of the hypothetical whispers of depreciators i would rather not hear robert say for instance it was a great action but he has taken eighteenpence for it which is a pity i dont think this judgment fairand much worse judgments are passed than that which is very painful but after all this thing may have been a necessary duty on lns part and i can understand that it was so for this loss of the italians that is not to be dwelt on while for the savoyards none knew better than cavour not even ln the leaning of those populations towards france for years back it has been an inconvenient element of his government whether there are or are not natural frontiers there are natural barriers and the alps hinder trade and make direct influence difficult and what the popular vote would be nobody here doubted be sure that nobody did in switzerland the swiss have been insincere it seems to metalking of terror when they thought chiefly of territory but i feel tenderly for poor heroic garibaldi who has suffered he and his minority he is not a man of much brain which makes the subject the more cruel to him but i cant write of garibaldi this morning so anxious we are after an unpleasant despatch yesterday he is a hero and has led a forlorn hope out to sicily to succeed for italy or to fail for himself its imprudence if he fails if otherwise who shall praise him enough its salvation and glory                                        to miss ef haworth  rome 28 via del tritone may 18 1860 postmark  my dearest fannyit seems to me that you have drunk so much england which cheers and inebriates as to have forgotten your italian friends here have i been waiting with my load of gratitude till my shoulders ache under it not knowing to what address to carry it sarianna sent me one address of your london lodgings with the satisfactory addition that you were about to move immediately you really might have written to me before unkindest and falsest of fannies or else understand you should not have sent me those graceful and suggestive drawings for which only now i am able to thank you thank you thank you thank you it was very kind of you to let me have them  then pray how did you get my poems before congress was i not to send you an order here i send one at least whether you scorn my gift or not and by this sign you will inherit also an aurora leigh  yes i expected nothing better from the british public which strictly conforming itself to the higher civilisation of the age gives sympathy only where it gives the belt87 as the favorite hero says in his last eloquent letter in all my actions whether in private or public life may i be worthy of having had the honor  of a notice in the times he concludes of the abuse of the saturday review c c say i  for the rest being turned out of the old world i fall on my feet in the new world where people have been generous and even publishers turned liberal think of my having an offer on the ground of that book from a periodical in new york of a hundred dollars for every single poem though as short as a sonnetthat is for its merely passing through their pages on the road to the publishers proper oh i shall cry aloud and boast since people choose to abuse me did you see how i was treated in blackwood in fact you and all women though you hated me should be vexed on your own accounts as for me its only what i expected and i have had that deep satisfaction of speaking though i died for it which we are all apt to aspire to now and then do you know i was half inclined to send my little book to mr cobden and then i drew back into my shell with native snailshyness  we remain here till the end of may when we remove back to florence meanwhile i am in great anxiety about sicily garibaldis hardy enterprise may be followed by difficult complications  let us talk away from politics which set my heart beating uncomfortably and dont particularly amuse you  have you read the mill on the floss and what of it the author is here they say with her elective affinity and is seen on the corso walking or in the vatican musing always together they are said to visit nobody and to be beheld only at unawares theodore parker removed to florence in an extremity of illhealth and is dead there i feel very sorry there was something high and noble about the manthough he was not deep in proportion hatty hosmer has arrived in america and found her father alive and better but threatened with another attack which must be final gibson came to us yesterday and we agreed that we never found him so interesting i grieve to hear that mr pages pictures another venus and a moses have been rejected at your academy  robert deserves no reproaches for he has been writing a good deal this winterworking at a long poem88 which i have not seen a line of and producing short lyrics which i have seen and may declare worthy of him for me if i have attained anything of force and freedom by living near the oak the better for me but i hope you dont think that i mimic him or lose my individuality penini sends his love with roberts he rides his pony and learns his latin and looks as pretty as everto my way of thinking if you dont write directly address to florence  we have another thick indian letter for you but robert is afraid of sending it till you give us a safe address                                        to miss i blagden  rome about may 1860  the beginning of this letter is wanting  when the english were raging about savoy i heard a word or two from pantaleone which convinced me that the imperial wickedness did not strike him as the sin against the holy ghost precisely in fact i doubt much that he an intimate friend of massimo d azeglio knew all about it before the war  by the by why does azeglio write against rome being the capital just now it seems to us all very illadvised italy may hereafter select the capital she pleases but now her game ought to be to get rome as an indispensable part of the play as soon as possible there are great difficulties in the waythats very sure its quite time indeed that mrs trollopes heart should warm a little towards the emperor for no ruler has risked so much for a nation to which he did not belong unless he wished to conquer it as napoleon has for this nation he has been tortuous in certain respectsin the official presentation of the points he was resolute on carryingbut from first to last there has been one steady intentionthe liberation of italy without the confusion of a general war moreover his eyes are upon venice and have been since villafranca what i see in the very suggestion to england about stopping garibaldi from attacking the mainland was a preparation to the english mind towards receiving the consequence of unity namely the seizure of venice you must be prepared for that you see where you are going you wont cry out when france joins her ally again lord john didnt see the necessity no of course he didnt he never does see except what he runs against he protested to the last by the blue book against gs attack he was of opinion to the last that italy would be better in two kingdoms but he wouldnt intervene in which he was perfectly right of course only that people should see where their road goes even when they walk straight and mark if france had herself prevented garibaldis landing lord john would simply have protested he said so france might have done it without the least inconvenience therefore and she did not she confined herself to observing that if ve might have naples he must have venice and that there could be no good in objecting to logical necessities of accepted situations in spite of which every sort of weight was hung on the arms of france that no aid should be given for venetia certain things written to austria and uttered through lord cowley i cant forgive lord john for my heart does not warm except with rage to think of writing only the other day to an austrian court all we can do for you is to use our strongest influence with france that she should not help italy against you in venetia and in our opinion you will always be strong enough to baffle italy italy cant fight you alone the words i am not sure of but the idea is a transcript and the threats uttered through lord cowley were worsemorally hideous i think  napoleons position in france is hard enough of itself forty thousand priests with bishops of the colour of mon dorléans and company having of course a certain hold on the agricultural population which forms so large a part of the basis of the imperial throne then add to that the parties the liberals so called and others who use this question as a weapon simply in the senate and legislative body they havent forgotten how to talk have theythese french the passion and confusion seem to have been extreme after all we shall get a working majority i do hope and trust for all the intelligent supporters of the government are with us and the chamber will be dissolved at need there is talk of it already in rome  at last we see your advertisement viva agnes tremorne89 we find it in orley farm how admirably this last opens we are both delighted with it what a pity it is that so powerful and idiomatic a writer should be so incorrect grammatically and scholastically speaking robert insists on my putting down such phrases as these the cleeve was distant from orley two miles though it could not be driven under five one rises up the hill as good as him possessing more acquirements than he would have learned at harrow learning acquirements yes they are faults and should be put away by a firstrate writer like anthony trollope its always worth while to be correct but do understand through the pedantry of these remarks that we are full of admiration for the book the movement is so excellent and straightforwardwalking like a man and rising uphill and not going round and round as thackeray has taken to do lately hes clever always but he goes round and round till im dizzy for one and dont know where i am i think somebody has tied him up to a post leaving a tether dearest isa the day before yesterday i had two letters from madame m to ask us to take rooms he is coming directly to rome she says he has much to tell me and its evident of course that an italian senator native to the roman states wouldnt come here just now without mission or permission i am full of expectation but will say no more  dearest isa have i been long in writing indeed you see i let so many letters accumulate which i hadnt the heart to reply to that on taking up the account i had over much to do in writing letters then i have been working a little at some italian lyrics three more are gone lately to the independent and another is ready to go all this with helping pen to prepare for the abbé has filled my hands and they are soon tired my isa nowadays when the sun goes down i am down at eight i generally am in bed or little after and people will come in occasionally in the day and annul me i had a visit from lady annabella noel lately lord byrons granddaughter very quiet and very intense i should say she is going away and i shall not see her more than that once i dare say but she looked at me so with her still deep eyes and spoke so feelingly that i kissed her when she went away another new acquaintance is lady marion alford the marquis of northamptons daughter very eager about literature and art and robert for all which reasons i should care for her also hatty calls her divine i thought there was the least touch of affectation of fussiness but it may not be so she knelt down before hatty the other day and gave herplaced on her fingerthe most splendid ring you can imagine a ruby in the form of a heart surrounded and crowned with diamonds hatty is frankly delighted and says so with all sorts of fantastical exaggerations  tell me what you think of the photographs which robert sends with his best love i think the head perfect and the other very poetical and picturesque i wish i had mine to send kate tell her with my dear love but i have not one nor can get one perhaps i may have to sit again before leaving rome and then she shall be remembered and robert will give her his  pray dont apologise for your borden he is very much to be liked mrs bruen is charmed he has been three times to talk with me and robert has called on him twice robert is quite vexed at your pretension about having friends not good enough for his acquaintance yes really he was vexed isa never understood himnot she  is there not reason we may murmur but the truth is he is always ready be pleased to know to honour your drafts in acquaintanceship and chooses to be considered ready  the remainder of this letter is wanting                                        to miss ef haworth  florence june 16 1860 postmark  my dearest fannyi must use my opportunity of sending you these photographs because i think you will care to have them peni is himself not a likeness but an identity i like a devil or the emperor napoleon am not as black as i seem but pen looks lovely enough to satisfy my vanity  your indian poets letter was despatched to you from rome and so apollo saved me ohif you knew how i hate giving opinions i think a poets opinion of another poet should be paid by some triple fee i at least always feel that after being ingenuous on these occasions and advising persons who can barely spell against publishing their epic poems one is supposed to be secretly influenced by the fear of a rival or worse give me a triple fee  poor dearest fanny of course you are in the chain being in england you are moved to set down the emperor as the beast 666 of course if he crushes garibaldi you must give him up yes but what an if if you stab miss heaton with a golden bodkin right through the heart under circumstances of peculiar cruelty i shall have to give up you if i bake penini in a pie and eat him youll have to give up me  the emperor napoleon is faithful and will be faithful to the italian cause and to the cause of the nationalities as long as and wherever it is prudent for the general interest possible without dangerous complications he has risked enough for it to be trusted a little i thinkhis life and dynasty certainly at this moment i hear from rome of a great dinner given by lamoricière to his staff or by his staff to him i dont know which only that the health of henri cinq was suggested and drunk at it gorgon telegraphed the news to paris what then english newspapers even such papers as the daily news have stated that lamoricière was doing napoleonic business at rome perhaps this is of it  chapman junior is in florence doing business upon lever i believe and he maintains that i have done myself no mortal harm by the congress poems which incline to a second edition after all had it been otherwise i yet never should have repented speaking the word out of me which burnt in me printing that book did me real good for the rest aurora leigh is in the press for a fifth edition read the word for truth by a seaman written by a naval officer of high reputation  we left rome on the 4th of june and travelled by vettura through orvieto and chiusi beautiful scenery interesting pictures and tombs but a fatiguing journey at least pens pony and i were both of us unusually fatigued and scarcely at the end of a week am i myself yet i am not as strong since my illness last summer we stay here till the early part of july and then remove to siena to the villa we had last year and there pen keeps tryst with his abbé and the latin he has made great progress this winter in latin and much besides and he isnt going to be a wretched little papist as some of our friends precipitately conclude from the fact of his having a priest for a tutor indeed pen has to be restrained into politeness and tolerance towards ecclesiastical dignities think of his addressing his instructor who complained of the weather at rome one morning thusin choice tuscan of course its the excommunication the prophet says that a curse begins with the cursers own house and so it is with the holy fathers curse wasnt that clever of pen and impertinent but our abbé only tried at gravity he sympathises secretly with the insorgimento d italia and besides is very fond of pen poor pen innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck how his mama has been wickedly cursing her native country after chorley its hard upon me fanny that you wont tell me of the spirits you who can see here is even robert whose heart softens to the point of letting me have the spiritual magazine from england do knock at mrs milner gibsons doors till you get to see the hands and the heads and the bodies and the celestial garlands which she has the privilege of being familiar with touch the hands has mr monckton milnes seen anything so as to believe is it true that lord lyndhurst was lifted up in a chair does he believe i hear through mr trollope and chapman that edwin landseer has received the faith and did everything possible to persuade dickens to investigate which dickens refused afraid of the truth of course having deeply committed himself to negatives this is a moral lâcheté hard for my feminine mind to conceive of dickens too who is so fond of ghoststories as long as they are impossible  i can scarcely imagine the summers passing without a struggle on the continent of italy it cant be i think at least we are prepared for it here  we find wilson well mr landor also he had thrown a dinner out of the window only once and a few things of the kind but he lives in a chronic state of ingratitude to the whole world except robert who waits for his turn i am glad to think that poor mr landor is well unsympathetical to me as he is in his morale he has the most beautiful seafoam of a beard you ever saw all in a curl and white bubblement of beauty he informed us the other morning that he had quite given up thinking of a future statehe had had thoughts of it once but that was very early in life mr kirkup who is deafer than a post now tries in vain to convert him to the spiritual doctrine landor laughs so loud in reply that kirkup hears him  pray keep mr  off till we have settled the independence and unity of italy it isnt the hour for peace and we dont want a second villafranca by the way i dare say nobody in england lays his face in the dust and acknowledges in consequence of the official declaration of the prussian minister to the effect that prussia was to attack on the crossing of the mincio and that nothing but the unexpected conclusion of hostilities hindered the general waracknowledges that napoleon stands fully justified in making that peace i cannot expect so much justice in an englishman he would rather bury his past mistake in a present mistake than simply confess it  now no more may god bless you do be happy and do write to me we talk of paris and england for next year  your very affectionate ba  roberts love and pens                                        to miss browning  florence about june 1860  i didnt write last time dearest sarianna not only because of being overbusy or overtired but because i had not the heart that day peni had another touch of fever and was forced to have a doctor and cataplasms to his feet it was only a days anxiety but i didnt like writing just then he had been in the sun or the wind or something i was glad to get away from rome there were two cases of fever in our courtyard and both the sun and the shade were suspectés as far as pen is concerned the evil was averted and i assure you he is looking in the full bloom of health and we have been congratulated on all sides on his appearance and growth since we returned to florence riding so much has agreed well with him and the general results of the roman campaign cannot be said to be otherwise than favourable set down as much for robert everybody exclaims at his stoutness in fact never since i have known him has he condescended to put on such an air of robustness theres no other word for it shall we give the glory to rome or to nux to which he is constant for two years and a half he has had recourse to no other remedy and it has not yet failed to produce its effect how do you unbelievers account for that at the same time i never would think of using it in any active or inflammatory malady and where a sudden revolution or scosso is required from the remedial agent  we find poor mr landor tolerably amenable to wilson and well in health though he cant live more than three months he says and except when robert keeps him soothed by quoting his own works to him considers himself in a very wretched condition which is a sort of satisfaction too he is a man of great genius and we owe him every attention on that ground otherwise i confess to you he is to me eminently unsympathetic  if  turns catholic as you say on the ground of the organisation of certain institutions it will be a proof of very peculiar ignorance this power of organisation is french and not catholic you look for it in vain in rome for instance except where the organisation comes from france the soeurs de charité who are of all catholic nations are organised entirely by the french the institutions here are branch institutions in rome the tendency of everything is to confusion and individuality with separate pockets lamoricière was in despair at it all and even now people talk of his resigning though he gave a dinner the other day to his staff with the toast of henri cinq  individuality is an excellent thing in its place and an infamous thing out of it in england we have some very successful efforts at organisationthe post office which is nearly perfect and society in which the demarcation between class and class is much too perfect to be humane in other respects we are apt to fail  we do not fail however in organisation only with regard to these charitable institutions we are very hard and unsympathetic in them a distinguished woman has been here latelya miss cobbe a fellowworker with miss carpenterwho having overworked herself was forced by her physician to come here for three months and rest under dire penalties she went to isa blagdens and returned to england and her work just now she is very acute and so perfectly without continental prejudices that she didnt pretend to much interest even in our italian movement having her heart in england and with the poor but she was much struck not merely with the order of foreign institutions but with their superior tenderness and sympathy the account she gave of the english workhouses and hospitals was very sad very cruel corresponding in fact to what i have heard from other quarters  ah sarianna charming old men who call the tuscans angels except that they lie what an exception can be mistaken like others that passes for liberality does it we are not angels and we dont lietheres no more lying in italy than in england i begin to affirm also m tassinari was in prison not a week but a monthand well did he deserve it we deal now in french coinage and are to see no more pauls after the middle of next month robert thinks it will destroy the last vestige of our cheapness but i am very favorable to a unification of international coinage it agrees with my theories you know  we are all talking and dreaming garibaldi just now in great anxiety scarcely since the world was a world has there been such a feat of arms all modern heroes grow pale before him it was necessary however for us all even here and at turin just as in paris to be ready to disavow him the whole good of central italy was hazarded by it if it had not been success it would have been an evil beyond failure the enterprise was forlorner than a forlorn hope the hero if he had perished would scarcely have been sure of his epitaph even  and intervention does mean quite a different thing at naples and in lombardy in lombardy there was the foreign tyrant at naples italians deal with italians and the austrian influence is indirect so also at rome it is this which makes the difficulty of dealing with southern italy and the difference of treatment which you observe in certain french papers  i am sure though you dont like photographs you say that you will find nothing lacking in what we send you and dearest nonno of our penini it isnt like him its himself as for me i murmur in the depths of my vanity that like the emperor napoleon and the devil im not so black as im painted but i forgive everything for pens sake robert is not very favourably represented i think the beard on the upper lip had not been properly clipped and makes the space seem too long for him another time i will mend that i was very unusually tired after my journey but am getting past it weather was hot but within two days we have had some cooling rain  give my best love to m milsand beside the photographs and thank him for not being offended in his patriotism by my congress poems if he approved of the preface as he says i cant see how he can have written anything about intervention which i would not accept nothing could have ended the intervention of austria except the intervention of france and it was on that account that we feel the latter to be a great and chivalrous action italy is grateful and if france were in difficulty she might count on this delivered nation as on herself in spite of all the bad words hurled at me in every english newspaper and periodical nearly and i assure you i have been put in the pillory among them the poems are going into a second edition chapman says and aurora leigh into a fifth also chapman junior who has come out here to see after lever smoothes me down a little about robert and says that the sale is bettering itself and that a new edition of the poems will soon be wanted i just now see a pleasant notice of myself in bentleys magazine abuse of the congress poems of course then a side stroke at aurora leigh which was original of course because its my way to stand alone and attack people but the principal merit of which otherwise was the suggestion of lucille lyttons new poemlucille says the critic being superior in holiness and virtue and that sort of thing to aurora of course  they subscribed in england five thousand pounds for tom sayers theres the advance of civilisation napoleon has gone to baden to arrange the world a little more comfortably i hope  mr lewes and miss evans have been here and are coming back to settle into our congenial bosom i admire her books so much that certainly i shall not refuse to receive her though she is not a medium sarianna  your ever affectionate sister                                        the programme of the previous year was repeated in 1860 returning from rome to florence at the beginning of june the brownings in july went to siena to avoid the extreme heat of the summer at florence staying as before at the villa alberti their visit to siena was however rather shorter than the previous one lasting only till september  there is no doubt that mrs browning during all this time was losing ground in point of health and she now received another severe blow in the news of the serious illness of her sister henrietta mrs surtees cook the anxiety lasted for several months and ended with the death of mrs cook in the following winter                                        to mrs martin  villa alberti siena august 21 1860  i thank you my dearest friend from my heart for your letter and the ray of sunshine it brought with it do you know i was childish enough to kiss it as if it knew what it did i wish i could kiss you yes i have been very unhappy not giving way on the whole going about my work as usual but with a sense of a black veil between me and whatever i did sometimes feeling incapable of crawling down to sit on the cushion under my own figtree for an hours vision of this beautiful countrysometimes in des transes mortelles of fear  but we must not be atheists as a friend said to me the other day i hope i do not live quite as if i were but it was a great shock from the beginning henrietta always seemed so strong that i never feared that way  my first impulse was to rush to england but this has been overruled by everybody and i believe wisely with my usual luck i should just have increased the sum of evil instead of bringing a single advantage to anyone the best thing i can do for the others is to keep quiet and try not to give cause for trouble on my account to be patient and live on gods daily bread from day to day i had a crumb or two the day before yesterday through storm who thought there might be a little less painand here you have sent me almost a slicemay god be thanked how good you were to mention the doctor it is grievous to me to think of her suffering darling  i knew how strong your sympathy and personal feeling would be and even on that account i had not the heart and courage to write to you but no dearest friends i did not receive the letter you speak of though i heard of your grief a good while afterwards and so sorry i waswe both wereso sorry for fanny so sorry for you may god bless you all how the spiritual world gets thronged to us with familiar faces till at last perhaps the world here will seem the vague and strange world even while we remain  still it is beautiful out of this window and of public affairs in italy i am stirred to think with the most vivid interest through all the rapture is not as in the northern war last year because you dont understand that in england last year we fought the austrian and now it is italian against italian90 which tempers every triumph with a certain melancholy also the italian question in the south was decided in the north and remained only a question of time abbreviated many think rashly by our hero garibaldi for the crisis so quickened involves very serious dangers and most solemn thoughts the southern difficulty may be considered solvedso we thinkbut just now that very solution opens out as we all fear a new austrian invasion in the north backed indirectly at least by prussia and germany who will use the opportunity in carrying out the coalition against france there seems no doubt of the mischief hatched at toeplitz i wish i had known that englands influence was not used in drawing together those two powers prussia deserves to bewhat shall i saydocked of her rhenish provinces it would be a too slight punishment she caused the villafranca halt according to her official confession by the mouth of baron schleinitz last spring and now this second time would she interrupt the liberation of italy the aspect of affairs looks very grave as to england england wishes well to this country at this present time but she will make no sacrifices not even of her hatreds least of all perhaps of her blind hatreds for the sake of ten italys tell dear mr martin that after the speech for the defences i gave up lord palmerston for ever he plays double he is too shrewd to believe in the probability of invasions c c but he wants a shield to guard his swordarm the statesmanship of england pines for new blood for ideas of the epoch and the russell oldfogyism will not do any more at all these old bottles wont hold the new wine people are positively calling on the muse and william pitt its religion to hate france and to set up a boney as a raw head and bloody bones sort of scarecrow but it wont do as the revolutionists say È troppo tardi  i am not however in furies all day dearest mrs martin i answer satisfactorily your question whether i am ever calm the newspapers from various parts of italy thunder down on us here not to speak of galignanis and saturday reviews see how calmblooded i must be to bear the saturday review i consider it a curiosity in vice certainly then we have books from the subscription library in florence and sights of the cornhill and political pamphlets by the bookpost nay even the spiritual magazine sent by chapman and hall in the last number of which that clever and brave william howitt who like a man is foolish sometimes suggests gravely in an article that i have lately been biologised by infernal spirits in order to the production of certain bad works in the service of moloch meaning of course ln oh and did anyone tell you how harriet martineau in her political letters to america set me down with her air of serene superiority but such things never chafe menever they dont even quicken my pulsation and the place we are passing the summer in is very calma great lonely villa in the midst of purple hills and vineyards olivetrees and figtrees like foresttrees a deep soothing silence a mile off we have friends and my dear friend miss blagden is in a villa half a mile off this for the summer also we brought with us from florence and dropped in a villino not far our friend mr landor walter savage who is under roberts guardianship having quarrelled with everybody in and out of england i call him our adopted son you did not know i had a son of eightysix and more wilson lives with him and robert receives from his family in england means for his support but really the office is hard and i tell robert that he must be prepared for the consequences an outbreak and a printed statement that he robert instigated by his wicked wife had attempted to poison him landor slowly such an extraordinary union of great literary gifts and incapacity of will has seldom surprised the world of course he does not live with us you know either here or in florence but my husband manages every detail of his life and both the responsibility and trouble are considerable still he is a great writer we owe him some gratitude therefore  penini has his pony here and rides with his father we have had the coolest summer i ever remember in italy i could have been very happy but god who tempers the wind finds it necessary for the welfare of some of us to temper the sunshine also  as the very poorest proof of gratitude for your letter robert suggests that i should enclose this photograph of penini and myself taken at rome this last spring you will like to have them we fancy but it is roberts gift i was half inclined last year to send you a photograph from field talfourds picture of me91 but i shrank back knowing that dear mr martin would cry out at the flattery of it which he well might do but this photograph from nature cant be flattered so i hazard it you see the locks are dark still not white and the sun in spite has blackened the face to complete the harmony pen is very like and very sweet we think  do when you write speak of yourselfyourselves i hope you like the mill on the floss  our love to dearest mr martin and you  let me be as ever  your affectionate and grateful ba                                         to miss ef haworth  villa alberti siena sardegna august 25 1860  my dearest fannyi received your letter with thanks upon thanks it seemed long since i heard or wrote i have been very sad verywith a stone hung round my heart and a black veil between me and all that i do think or look at one of my sisters is very ill in englandmy married sisteran internal tumour accompanied with considerable suffering and doubtful enough as to its issue to keep us all i can answer at least for myself in great misery robert says i exaggerate and i think and know that consciously or unconsciously he wants to save me pain she went to london and the medical man called it an anxious case we all know what that must mean for a little time i was in an anguish of fear and though come to believe now that no great change any way is to be expected quickly you would pity what i feel when the letters are at hand may god have mercy on us all i wanted at first to get to england but everyone here and there was against it and i suppose it would have been a pure selfishness on my part to persist in going seeing that the fatigue and the cold in england alone would have broken me up to a faggot though of not so much use as to burn so that i should have complicated other peoples difficulties without much mending my own still it would have been comfort to me however selfish to have just held her hand but no oh i am resigned to its being wiser i am shaken even at this distance she has three children younger than my peni dont let me talk of it any more  you see fanny my destiny has always been to be entirely useless to the people i should like to help except to my little pen sometimes in pushing him through his lessons and even so the help seems doubtful scholastically speaking to robert and to have only power at the end of my pen and for the help of people i dont care for at moments lately thanks from a stranger for this or that have sounded ghastly to me who cant go to smooth a pillow for my own darling sister now i wont talk of it any more after all i try to be patient and wait quietly and there ought to be hope and faith meantime  the penutilities themselves dont pass uncontested as you observe yes i see the spiritual magazine and remarked how i was scourged in the house of my friends robert shouted in triumph at it and hoped i was pleased and as for myself it really did make me smile a little which was an advantage in the sad humour i was in at the time biologised by infernal spirits since casa guidi windows yet casa guidi windows was not wholly vicious it seems to me nor aurora utterly corrupt and mr howitt is both a clever man and an honest and brave man for all his sweeping opinions biologised and beharrised he is certainly what an extraordinary admiration i wonder at that more than at any of the external spiritual phenomena dearest fanny you were very very good and generous to take my part with the editorbut laissez faire these things do one no harmand for me they dont even vex me i had an anonymous letter from england the other day from somebody who recognised me he said in some prodigious way as a great ageteacher all but divine i believe and now gave me up on account of certain atrocitiesfirst for the poem pan92 in the cornhill considered immoral and then for having had my brain so turned by the private attentions and flatteries of the emperor napoleon when i was in paris that i have devoted myself since to help him in the gratification of his selfish ambitions conceive of this written with an air of conviction and on the best information now of the two imputations i much prefer the inspiration from hell theres something grandiose about that to say nothing of the superior honesty of the position  what a mountainous me i am piling up in this letter i who want rather to write of you  italy ought not to draw you just now fanny we are all looking for war and wondering where the safety is a piccolomini said yesterday that it was as safe at rome as in florence which only proved florence unsafe austria may come down on central italy any day and sooner or later there must be war the storys are alarmed enough to avoid going back to rome until the end of november when things may be a little arranged the indignation here is great against questa canaglia di germania toeplitz means mischief both against france and italythat is plain the prince of prussia gave his parole de gentilhomme meaning the word of a rascal my poor venice but you will see presently only the fear is that our fire here may flash very far in any case it would not be desirable for englishmen to come southwards this year our plans for the winter depend entirely on circumstances if we can go to rome in any reasonable security i suppose we shall go but i have no heart for plans just now  dear isa blagden is spending the summer in a rough cabin a quarter of an hours walk from here and mr landor is hard by in the lane this with the storys a mile off makes a sort of colonisation of the country here otherwise its a solitude very triste say the english not even an english church even in the city of siena we get books from florence and newspapers from everywhere or one couldnt get on quite well as it is i like it very much i like the quiet the lying at length on a sofa in an absolute silence nobody speaking for hours together robert rides a great deal not a chance of morning visitors no voices under the windows the repose would help me much if it were not that circumstances of pain and fear walk in upon me through windows and doors using ones own thoughts till they tremble pen has had an abbé to teach him latin and his pony to ride on and he and robert are very well and strong thank god  thank you for your words on spiritualism i have not yet seen the last cornhill it pleases me that thackeray has had the courage to maintain the facts before the public i think much the better of him for doing so owens book i shall try to get there is a weak reference to the subject in the saturday review against it and i see an article advertised in once a week all proving that the public is awaking to a consideration of the class of phenomena investigation is all i desire the spiritual magazine lingers so this month that i fear and robert hopes something may have happened to it                                        on returning to rome for the winter which they did about september the brownings found quarters at 126 via felice the following letter was written shortly after the death of mrs brownings sister                                        to miss ef haworth  rome autumn 1860  in one word my dearest fanny i will thank you for what is said and not said for sympathy true and tender each way it is a great privilege to be able to talk and cry but i cannot you know i have suffered very much and feel tired and beaten now its all being lived down thrown behind or pushed before as such things must be if we are to live not forgetting not feeling any tie slackened loving unchangeably and believing how mere a line this is to overstep between the living and the dead  do you know the first thing from without which did me the least good was a letter from america from dear mrs stowe since we parted here in the spring neither of us had written and she had not the least idea of my being unhappy for any reason in fact her thought was to congratulate me on public affairs knowing how keenly i felt about them but her letter dwelt at length upon spiritualism she had heard she said for the fifth time from her boy the one who was drowned in that awful manner through carrying out a college jest without any seeking on her part she gave me a minute account of a late manifestation not seeming to have a doubt in respect to the verity and identity of the spirit in fact secret things were told reference to private papers made the evidence was considered most satisfying and she says that all of the communications descriptive of the state of that spirit though coming from very different mediums some high calvinists and others low infidels tallied exactly she spoke very calmly about it with no dogmatism but with the strongest disposition to receive the facts of the subject with all their bearings and at whatever loss of orthodoxy or sacrifice of reputation for common sense i have a high appreciation of her power of forming opinions let me add to this it is one of the most vital and growing minds i ever knew besides the inventive the critical and analytical faculties are strong with her how many women do you know who are religious and yet analyse point by point what they believe in she lives in the midst of the traditional churches and is full of reverence by nature and yet if you knew how fearlessly that woman has torn up the old cerements and taken note of what is a dead letter within yet preserved her faith in essential spiritual truth you would feel more admiration for her than even for writing uncle tom there are quantities of irreverent women and men who profess infidelity but this is a woman of another order observe devout yet brave in the outlook for truth and considering not whether a thing be sound but whether it be true her views are swedenborgian on some points beyond him where he departs from orthodoxy on one or two points adhering to the orthodox creed on certain others she used to come to me last winter and open out to me very freely and i was much interested in the character of her intellect dr manning tried his converting power on her it might have answered she said if one side of her mind had not confuted what the other side was receptive of in fact she caught at all the beauty and truth and good of the roman catholic symbolism saw what was better in it than protestantism and also just as clearly what was worse she admired manning immensely and was very keen and quick in all her admirations had no national any more than ecclesiastical prejudices didnt take up anglosaxon outcries of superiority in morals and the rest which makes me so sick from american and english mouths by the way i must tell sarianna that for m milsand a clever englishwoman married to a frenchman told robert the other day that she believed in a special hell for the anglosaxon race on account of its hypocrisy  meanwhile you will care for roman news and i have not much to tell you i am very much in my corner and very quiet robert who has been most dear and tender and considerate to me through my trial kept all the people off and even now when the door is open a little gloomy lionesses with wounded paws dont draw the public i thank god and i am not much teased if at all sir john bowring came with a letter of introduction and intimate relations with napoleon to talk of and he has confirmed certain views of mine which i was glad to hear confirmed by a disciple of bentham and true liberal of distinguished intelligence he said that nothing could be more ludicrous and fanatical than the volunteer movement in england rising out of the most incredible panic which ever arose without a reason i only hope that if the volunteers ever have to act indeed they may behave better than at naples where they left the worst impression of english morals and discipline they embarked to return home dead drunk all of them and the drunkenness was not the worst sir john bowring has been ill since he came so perhaps he may go before i see him again then madame swab schwabe whom i slightly knew in paris has been with me today talking on italian affairs there is room for anxiety about the neapolitans but dont believe in exaggerations we shall do better than our enemies desire there will be war probably  robert has taken to modelling under mr story at his studio and is making extraordinary progress turning to account his studies on anatomy he has copied already two busts the young augustus and the psyche and is engaged on another enchanted with his new trade working six hours a day in the evening he generally goes out as a bachelorfree from responsibility of crinolinewhile i go early to bed too happy to have him a little amused in florence he never goes anywhere you know even here this winter he has had too much gloom about him by far but he looks entirely wellas does penini i am weak and languid i struggle hard to live on i wish to live just as long as and no longer than to grow in the soul  may god bless you dearest fanny write  america is making me very anxious just know if they compromise in the north it is a moral death but a merely physical dissolution of the states would be followed by a resurrection in honor and i should not fear what are you painting  your affectionate as ever ba  did you see lacordaire received those are things i care to see in paris wishing however to guizot the king of prussia and all prigs the contempt they deserve                                        to miss i blagden  126 via felice rome monday november december 1860  ever dearest isahow you grieve me by this news of your being unwell dear i wondered at having no letter and now with the letter and all the proofs of your remembering me newspaper and pens comes the bad word of your being ill  i myself am not very well i thought i was going to have a bad attack of the oppression but this morning it seems to have almost gone and without a blister i had one night very bad probably a sudden call from the tramontana brought it even frost we had only on the whole and considering accounts from other places rome has distinguished itself for mildness this year and i hope i shall keep from bad attacks having not much strength in body nerve or spirit to bear up resistingly against them  sir john bowring has been to see us yes he speaks with great authority and conviction and it carries the more emphasis because he is not without antigallican prejudice i observed he told me that the panic in england about invasion had reached at one time a point of phrenzy which would be scarcely credible to anyone who had not witnessed it people were in terrors expecting their houses to be burnt and sacked directly placards of the most inflammatory character calling passionately on the riflemen to arm arm arm he himself was hissed at edinburgh for venturing to say that the riflelocks would be very rusty if only used against invading napoleons  he told me that the emperors intentions towards italy had been undeviatingly ignored and that whatever had seemed equivocal had been misunderstood or was the consequence of misunderstanding or of the press of some otherwise great difficulty the italian question was only beginning to be understood in england i said in my sarcastic way that at first they had seemed to understand it upside down to which he replied that when at the opening of the revolution he came over with several english officers from india they were all prepared in case england didnt fight on the hapsburg side to enter the austrian army as volunteers to help them to keep down italy  but men like mr trollope find it easy to ignore all this it is we who have done the most for italywe who did nothing yes i admit so far we abstained from helping the austrians with an open force  that now we wish well to the italian cause is true i hope but at best it is a noble inconsistency and that we should set up a claim to a nations gratitude on these grounds seems to me worse than absurd the more we are in earnest now the more ashamed we should be for what has been  i have been sorry about gaeta93 but there is somewhere a cause and perhaps not hard to find that the emperor is ready to do for italy whatever will not sacrifice france i am convinced more than ever and even the romans who have benefited least think so one of the patriots here a watchmaker was saying to ferdinando the other day that he had subscribed to garibaldis fund and had given his name for viterbo94 but that there was one man in whom he believed most and never ceased to believelouis napoleon and this is the common feeling mr trollope said that they only ventured to unbosom themselves to the english now my belief is that the italians seldom do this to the english as far as napoleon is concerned the italians are furbi assai and wish to conciliate us and are perfectly aware of our national jealousies i myself have observed the difference in an italian when speaking to my own husband before me and speaking to me alone  since we came here i have had a letter from ruskin written in a very desponding state about his work and life and the world  life goes on heavily with me but it goes on it has rolled into the ruts again and goes  write to me my isa and love me  i am your ever loving ba                                        to miss i blagden  rome novemberdecember 1860    now while i remember it let me tell you what i quite forgot yesterday if through kates dealing with american papers you get to hear of a lyric of mine called de profundis95 you are to understand that it was written by me nearly twenty years ago before i knew robert you will observe it is in my early manner as they say of painters it is a personal poem of course but was written even so in comparatively a state of retrospect catching a grief in the rebound a little you know i never can speak or cry so it isnt likely i should write verses the poem written however when i was very low lay unprinted all those years till it turned up at florence just when poor mrs howards bereavement and mr beechers funeral sermon in the independent suggested the thought of iton which by an impulse i enclosed it to the editor who wanted more verses from me now you see it comes out just when people will suppose the motive to be an actual occasion connected with myself dont let anyone think so dear isa in the first place there would be great exaggeration and in the second its not my way to grind up my green griefs to make bread of but that poem exaggerates nothingrepresents a condition from which the writer had already partly emerged after the greatest suffering the only time in which i have known what absolute despair is  dont notice this when you write  write take the love of us three yes i love you dearest isa and shall for ever  ba                                        to mrs martin  126 via felice rome friday about december 1860  i have not had courage to write my dearest friend but you will not have been severe on me i have suffered very muchfrom suspense as well as from certainty if i could open my heart to you it would please me that your sympathy should see all but i cant write and i couldnt speak of that it is well for those who in their griefs can speak and write i never could  but to you after all it is not needful you understand and have understood  my husband has been very good to me and saved me all he could so that i have had solitude and quiet and time to get into the ruts of the world again where one has to wheel on till the road ends in this respect it has been an advantage being at rome rather than florence now i can read and have seen a few faces one must live and the only way is to look away from oneself into the larger and higher circle of life in which the merely personal grief or joy forgets itself  for the rest even i ought to have comfort i know i believe that love in its most human relations is an eternal thing i do believe it only through inconsistency and much weakness i falter  also there are other beliefs with me with regard to the spiritual world and the measuring of death which ought if i had ordinary logic to rescue me from what people in general suffer in circumstances like these only i am weak and foolish and when the tender past came back to me day by day i have dropped down before it as one inconsolable  dearest mr martingive him my grateful love for every kind thought and to yourself  now that page is turned  i wish i knew that you were stronger and at pau it is unfortunate that just on this bitter winter you have been unable to get away from england  here though there was snow once we have fared mildly as to climate and our rooms are very warm penini has his pony and rides and studies with his abbé and looks very rosy and well i help him to prepare his lessons but that is all except hearing him read a little german now and then and robert sees to the music and the getting up of the arithmetic for the first time i have had pain in looking into his face latelywhich you will understand  i saw a man from naples two days since an englishman of intelligence and impartiality who has resided there for months in the heart of the politics he told me that the exaggeration of evils was great evils there were certainly and no government succeeding garibaldis could have satisfied a public trained to expect the impossible our poor garibaldi hero as he is and an honest hero is in truth the weakest and most malleable of men and had become at last the mere mouthpiece of the mazzinians if the bourbons fall had not been a little delayed north and south italy would have broken in two so i was assured by my friend who gave reasons and showed facts  that the neapolitans are not equal to the other italians is too plain and if corrupt governments did not corrupt the government they would be less hateful to all of us of course but a little time will give smoothness to the affairs of italy and none of my old hopes are in the meanwhile disturbed  the design as to rome seems to be to starve out the pope by the financial question to let the rotten fruit fall at last as much by its own fault as possible and by the gentlest shake of the tree i hear of those who doubted most in the emperors designs beginning to confess that he cant mean ill by italy  possibly you and dear mr martin think more just now of america than of this country which i can understand the crisis has come earlier than anyone expected it is a crisis and if the north accepts such a compromise as has been proposed the nation perishes morally which would be sadder than the mere dissolution of states however sad it is the difference between the death of the soul and of the body  there might and ought to be a pecuniary compromise but a compromise of principle would be fatal  i am anxious that before we go too far with the minghetti project here separate administration of provinces we should learn from america that a certain degree of centralisation not carried out too far is necessary to a strong and vital government and italy will want a strong government for some years to come there is much talk of war in the spring and if austria will not cede venetia war must be even if she should satisfy her other provinces which she will probably fail to do  this is a dull lecture but you will pardon it and me  i know all your goodness and sympathy do not think that i think that any bond is broken or that anything is lost we have been fed on the hillside and now there are twelve baskets full of fragments remaining  may god bless you and love you both  your ever affectionate and grateful ba                                        to miss i blagden  126 via felice rome tuesday january 1861  ever dearest isai wrote a long letter which you have received i do hope and am waiting for a long one from you to tell me that you are not suffering any more this is on business merelythat is it is merely to give you trouble the customary way for me to do business in these latter days will you dear without putting yourself to too much inconvenience by overhaste direct the nazione people to send the journal to which we must subscribe for three months to se le général comte de noue comandante della piazza di roma no other name the general who can do what he pleases pleases to receive our paper our kind abbé mediating on condition that we do not talk of it and so at last i shall attain to getting out of this dark into the free upper air it is insufferable to be instructed by the giornale di roma as to how cialdini writes to turin that his piedmontese are perfectly demoralised and that the besieged dance for triumph each time an italian cannon is fired into the vague on the other hand i hear regularly every morning from the romans that gaeta is taken96 with the most minute particulars which altogether is exasperating the last rumour is of typhus fever in the fortress but i have grown sceptical and believe nothing on either side now one thing is clear that it wasnt only the french fleet which prevented our triumph  robert came home this morning between three and four a great ball at mrs hookersmagnificent he says all the princes in rome and even cardinals present the rooms are splendid and the preparations were in the best taste the princess ruspoli a buonaparte appeared in the tricolor she is most beautiful robert says  so you see our americans can dance even while the republic goes to pieces i think i would not do it not that i despair of americagod forbid if the north will be faithful to its conscience there will be only an increase of greatness after a few years even though it may rain blood betwixt then and now mr story takes it all very quietly he would be content to let the south go and accept the isolation of the north as final we should do better without the south said he i dont agree in this i think that the unity of the state should be asserted with a strong hand and the south forced to pay taxes and submit to law  mdme swab schwabe told me that a friend of hers had travelled with klapka from constantinople and that k had said there would not be war till next yeardiplomacy would take its course for the present year perhaps he did not speak sincerely i cant understand how the austrian provinces will hold out in mere talk for twelve months more do you mark the tone of the opinion nationale on austria and about hungary being a natural ally of france and also what is said in the morning chronicle which always more or less reflects the face of the french government then it seems to me that the emperors speech is not eminently pacific though he desires peace i hear from rather good authority what i hope is possible that teliki accepted as a condition of his liberation not simply that he would not personally act against austria but that he would use his endeavours to prevent any action on the part of his compatriots men are base  mr prinsep97 is here last autumn he made a walking tour into cornwall with alfred tennyson to tread in the steps of king arthur tennyson was dreadfully afraid of being recognised and mobbed and desired to be called the other gentleman which straightway became convertible now and then into the old gentleman much to his vexation but mr prinsep is in the roses and lilies of youth and comparatively speaking of course the great laureate was an ancient he is in considerable trouble too by their building a fort in front of his house on the southern coast of the isle of wight i couldnt help saying that he deserved it for having written riflemen arm its a piece of pure poetical justice really  here i end  write to me my isa and do me good with your tender warm thoughts do you think i have no comfort in feeling them stroke me softly through the dark and distance  may god love you dearest isa  always your loving ba  roberts true love and pens  the weather is wonderfully warm in fact the winter has been very mildmilder than usual for even rome                                        to miss ef haworth  126 via felice rome tuesday about january 1861  you really astonish me dearest fanny so much by your letter that i must reply to it at once i ask myself under what new influence strictly clerical is she now that she should write so and has she forgotten me never read aurora leigh never heard of me or from me that before spiritualism came up in america i have been called orthodox by infidels and heterodox by churchpeople and gone on predicting to such persons as came near enough to me in speculative liberty of opinion to justify my speaking that the present churches were in course of dissolution and would have to be followed by a reconstruction of christian essential verity into other than these middleage scholastic forms believing in christs divinity which is the life of christianity i believed this otherwise if the end were hereif we were to be covered over and tucked in with the thirtynine articles or the like and goodnight to us for a sound sleep in sound doctrinei should fear for a revealed religion incapable of expansion according to the needs of man what comes from god has life in it and certainly from all the growth of living things spiritual growth cannot be excepted but i shun religious controversyit is useless i never disturb anybodys mind as it is calledlet those sleep who can if i had not known that your mind was broken up rather broadly by truths out of swedenborg i should not have mooted the subject be sure have you given up swedenborg this by the way having done so i am anxious to set you right about mrs stowe as the author of the most successful book printed by man or woman perhaps i a little underrated her the book has genius but did not strike me as it did some other readers her sunny memories i liked very little when she came to us in florence some years ago i did not think i should like her nor did robert but we were both of us surprised and charmed with her simplicity and earnestness at rome last year she brought her inner nature more in contact with mine and i who had looked for what one usually finds in women was startled into much admiration and sympathy by finding in her a largeness and fearlessness of thought which coming out of a clerical and puritan culdesac and combined with the most devout and reverent emotions really is fine so you think that since uncle tom she has turned infidel because of her interest in spiritualism her last words to me when we parted were those who love the lord jesus christ never see one another for the last time thats the attitude of the mind which you stigmatise as corrupting  with regard to spiritualism so called you might as well say books are dangerous without specifying the books surely you know that every sort of doctrine is enjoined by these means from church of englandism to free love a lady was with me this very morning who was converted from infidelity to christianity solely by these means and i am told that thousands declare the same as far as i am concerned i never heard or read a single communication which impressed me in the least what does impress me is the probability of there being communications at all i look at the movement what are these intelligences separated yet relating and communicating what is their state what their aspiration have we had part or shall we have part with them is this the corollary of mans life on the earth or are they unconscious echoes of his embodied soul that anyone should admit a fact such as a man being lifted into the air for instance and not be interested in it is so foreign to the habits of my mind which cant insulate a fact from an inference and rest there that i have not a word to say only i see that if this class of facts however grotesque be recognised among thinkers our reigning philosophy will modify itself scientific men will conceive differently from humboldt for instance of the mystery of life the materialism which stifles the higher instincts of men will be dislodged and the rationalism which divides oxford with romanism nothing between we hear will receive a blow  no truth can be dangerous what if jesus christ be taken for a medium do you say well what then as perfect man he possessed i conclude the full complement of a mans faculties but if he walked on the sea as a medium if the virtue went out of him as a mesmeriser he also spoke the words which never man spoke was born for us and died for us and rose from the dead as the lord god our saviour but the whole theory of spiritualism all the phenomena are strikingly confirmatory of revelation nothing strikes me more than that humes argument against miracles a strong argument disappears before it and strausss conclusions from a priori assertion of impossibility fall in pieces at once  now i have done with this subject upon the whole it seems to me better really that you should not mix yourself up with it any more also i wish you joy of the dismissal of m pierart there was no harm that he took away your headache if he did not presume on that you tell me not to bid you to beware of counting on us in paris and yet dearest fanny i must the future in this shifting world what is it as for me whom you recognise as so much myself dear i have a stout pen and till its last blot it will write perhaps with its usual insolence as a friend once said but if you laid your hand on this heart you would feel how it stops and staggers and fails i have not been out yet and am languid in spirits i gather myself up by fits and starts and then fall back do you know i think with positive terror sometimes less of the journey than of having to speak and look at people if it were possible to persuade robert i should send him with pen but he wouldnt go alone and he must go this year oh i daresay i shall feel more up to the friction of things when once i have been out its stupid to give way also my sister arabel talks of meeting me in france though i might have managed that difficulty but that robert should see his father is absolutely necessary meanwhile we dont talk of it and by may or june i shall be feeling another woman probably  so you are going to work hard in germany that is well only beware of the english periodicals theres a rage for new periodicals and because the cornhill answers other speculations crowd the market overcrowd it there will be failures presently  i have written a long letter when i meant to write a short one may god keep you and love you and make you happy your ever affectionate  ba  i am anxious about america fearing a compromise in the north all other dangers are comparatively null                                        to miss ef haworth  126 via felice rome saturday about january 1861  ah dearest fanny i cant rest without telling you that i am sorry at your receiving such an impression from my letter may god save me from such a sin as arrogance i have not generally a temptation to it through knowing too well what i am myself at the same time i do not dispute my belief in what you have so often confessed that you dont hold your attainments and opinions sufficiently irrespectively of persons believing which of you i said under what new influence and if i said anything with too much vivacity forgive me with that sweetness of nature which is at least as characteristic of you as the intellectual impressionability really i would not wound you for the worldbut i myself perhaps may have been overexcitable irritable just then who knows and in fact i was considerably vexed at the moment that from anything said by me you would infer what was so injurious and unjust to a woman like mrs stowe i named her in this relation because she struck me as a remarkable example of the compatibility of freedom of thought with reverence of sentiment you generally get one or the other the one excluding the other i never considered her a deep thinker but singularly large and unshackled considering the associations of her life she certainly is when i hinted at her stepping beyond swedenborg in certain of her ideas i referred to her belief that the process called regeneration may commence in certain cases beyond the grave and in her leaning to universal salvation views which you dont get at through swedenborg  for the rest i dont think if you will allow of my saying so that you apprehend swedenborgs meaning very accurately always if swedenborg saw sin and danger in certain communications for instance why did he consider it privilege on his own part to live in the world of spirits as he did true he spoke of danger but it was to those who themselves weak and unclean did not hold by the lord he distinctly said that in the first unfallen churches there was incessant communion and that the new church as it grew would approximate more and more to that earlier condition there is a distinct prospect given in swedenborg of an increasing aptitude in the bodies and souls of men towards communication with the disembodied i consider that he foresaw not only what we are seeing if these manifestations be veritable but greater and more frequent phenomena of the same classwhich does not in any way exclude considerable danger to some persons in the meanwhile and do you think i doubt that no indeed unsettled minds especially when under affliction will lose their balance at momentsthere is danger it is not the occasion for passion and fanaticism of sentiment but for calm and reasonable inquiry into facts let us establish the facts first and then try the spirits as the apostle directs afterwards remains the difficulty of assuring oneself of the personalities i dont think you should complain of the subject being unsatisfactory to you because you dont get a sublime communication or a characteristic evidence of some spirit known to you much less would satisfy me but it seemed to me that the consideration of the subject disturbed you made you uncomfortable and that you didnt approach any conclusion and with that impression and not because of contempt be sure i advised you to let it rest why should we beat our heads against an obstacle which we cant walk through then your liability to influence is against you here as much as your attraction towards such high speculations is in your favour you have an open mind yes but you leave all the doors open and you let people come in every now and then and lock them and keep them locked as long as said people stand by the teachings of spiritualism are much like the teachings in the world there are excellent things taught and iniquitous things taught only the sublime communications are as far as i know decidedly absent swedenborg directs you to give no more weight to what is said by a spiritman than by a man in the body and theres room for the instruction heralds of progress on one side heralds of light on the other if a right thing is said judge ye if infidels are here there are devout yes and very orthodox christians there  i beg to say that when i speak of old cerements being put off i presuppose a living body in resurrection also i dont call marriage for instance an old cerement we must distinguish with regard to the common notion of a hell as you ask me i dont believe in it i dont believe in any such thing as arbitrary reward or punishment but in consequences and logical results that seems to me gods way of working the scriptural phrases are simply symbolical it seems to me and swedenborg helps you past the symbol then as to the redemption and its modelet us receive the thing simply dr adam clarke whose piety was never doubted used to say vicarious suffering is vicarious nonsense which does not hinder the fact that the suffering of the lord was necessary in order that we should not suffer and that through his work and incarnation his worlds recovered the possibility of good it comes to the same thing the manner in which preachers analyse the infinite pass the divine through a sieve has ceased to be endurable to thinking men you speak of luther we all speak of luther did you ever read any of his theological treatises he was a schoolman of the most scholastic sect most offensive most absurd presenting my idea of old cerements to the uttermost we are entering on a reformation far more interior than luthers and the misfortune is that if we dont enter we must drop under the lintel do you hear of the storms in england about essays and reviews i have seen the book simply by reviews in abstract and extract i should agree with the writers in certain things but certainly not in all i have no sort of sympathy with what is called rationalism which is positivism in a form the vulgar idea of miracles being put into solution leaves you with the higher law and spiritual causation which the rationalists deny and which you and i hold faithfully but whatever one holds free discussion has become necessary that it is full of danger that in consequence of it many minds will fall into infidelity doubt and despair is certain but through this moral crisis men must pass or the end will be worse still thats my belief i have seen it coming for years back  the hungry flock looks up and is not fed except with chopped hay of the schools go into any church in england or out of england and you hear men preaching in pattens walking gingerly lest a speck of natural moisture touch a stocking seeking whats sound not whats true now if only on theology they must not think there will be soon a close for theologians educated men disbelieve to a degree quite unsuspected that i know of knowledge  no swedenborg does not hold the existence of devils in the ordinary meaning spiritual temptation comes he says through disembodied corrupt spirits out of this or other earths the word satan remember he conceives to represent a company of such evil spirits  now in what spirit have i written all this gently this time i do hope if you knew in what an agonised state of humiliation i am sometimes you would not suspect me of despising you oh no indeed but i am much in earnest and cant prophesy smooth things at moments of strong conviction who can  indeed indeed yes i am very anxious about what passes in paris do you know that kellers infamous discourse was corrected by guizots own hand mr pentland who was with the prince of wales knows g and this he p has just come from paris he knows the sommités there and considers that though there is danger yet on the whole the emperor dominates the situation prince ns speech in its general outline was submitted to the e and had his full sympathy persigny said to p or in his presence let no one ever speak ill of prince n before me i read all the seventeen columns in the moniteur and most magnificent was the discourse rome is greatly excited but hopeful there may be delay however  surely you dont think the large head of robert bad why it is exquisite i cant read over and send this scratch that you may pardon me before you go not to lose the post  sarianna says that squires carries about his own table in which case i give him up dont you write                                        to miss i blagden  126 via felice rome early in 1861  dearest dear isawe dont get the paper will you ask why heres a special address enclosed  i have just heard from what seems excellent authority fp zanetti has been here that a french company is to be withdrawn from rome today and that all the troops will be immediately withdrawn from the rs except rome and cività vecchia the french generals however were not aware of this yesterday morning though prepared for much and thus i cant help a certain scepticism there is an impression in french quarters that the delay arises from a fear of a coup on the part of austria if she didnt see france hereabouts but gorgon means to try to get away before the crisis which isnt in his tastes at all de noue has gonewent yesterday  i heard yesterday of sir john bowring telling somebody that the time had resolved itself now into an affair of days still there are people i suppose who hold fast their opinions of the antique form like mr massy dawson for instance who called on me yesterday with moustaches and a bride but otherwise unchanged he still maintains that napoleon will perish in defence of the papacy and that from first to last he has been thwarted in italy i know that sir john bowring diomed pantaleone mrs browning bowing graciously to me in that complimentary frame of body which befits disputants with female creatures and other persons better informed than i am think differently and in fact if i looked only at facts and at the worldly circumstances of the case i should agree with you all but reading the apocalypse as i do i find myself before a fixed conclusion imagine this dearest isa mine his bride sitting in a delicate dovecoloured silk on the sofa as tame as any dove and not venturing to coo even i suppose she thought it quite satisfactory what a woman with a brain could be made to suffer under certain casualties he quoted simply st john and mr kinglake mr kinglake plainly running a little with st john wasnt he kinglake a member of parliament and a lawyer and if his allegation wasnt true and if napoleon did not propose to francis joseph to swap lombardy for the rhine provinces why was there no contradiction on the part of the french emperor  now do mark the necessity of napoleons saying i didnt really pick mr joness pocket of his best foulard last mondayno though it hung out a tempting end pray dont let the volunteers think so ill of me  that would have been like our emperorwouldnt it  by the way i had yesterday a crowd of people and all at once so that i was in a flutter of weakness and didnt get over it quickly mrs bruen brought miss sewell amy herbert and lady juliana knox whom annunziata takes in as a homoeopathic dose È molto curioso questo cognome precisamente come la medicinanux tale quale she lady juliana had just been presented to the pope just before his illness and was much touched when at the close of the reception of indiscriminately catholics and protestants he prayed a simple prayer in french and gave them all his benediction ending in a sad humble voice priez pour le pape  it was touchingwas it not poor old man when you feel the human flesh through the ecclesiastical robe you get into sympathy with him at once  miss sewell will come and see me again she promised and then i shall talk with her more i couldnt get at her through the people yesterday she is very nice gentlelooking cheerful respectable sort ofsinglewomanish person decidedly single of the olden type very small slim quiet with the nearest approach to a poky bonnet possible in this sinful generation i in my confusion did not glance at her petticoats but judging a priori i should predicate a natural incompatibility with crinoline but really i liked her liked her there were gentleness humility and consciencethree great gifts of course we can touch only on remote points but i hope for my own sake we may touch on these and another day i mean to try she said one thing which i liked speaking of convents she considered that women must deteriorate by any separation from men now thats not only true but it is not on the surface of things as seen from her standpoint  i had a visit a day ago from m carl grün a prussian with a letter of introduction from dall ongaro i feel a real regard and liking for dall ongaro and would welcome any friend of his nomy isa i would prefer him as my translator to any young lady of twenty heavens never whisper it to the marchesa but i confide to you that my blood ran cold at that thought i know what poets of twenty must in all probability bedall ongaro is a poet and has a remarkable command of language  i have tried my hand at turning into literal italian prose only marking the lines a lyric on rome sent lately to america and i may show it to you one of these days  now i must send off this in tender love  your ba                                        to miss i blagden  rome 126 via felice march 20 1861    let me answer your questions concerning non pio ve se non vero ben trovato very happy and i hope true probably enough it may be true though i never heard it but from you there was a banner with viva pio ix on one side and viva ve re ditalia on the otherthats true and various devices we have had miraculous rains of revolutionary placards among the rest the french have taken to protect our demonstrations here half by way of keeping them under perhapsalthough the sympathy between the people and the troops gorgon apart has been always undeniable you know there was to be a gigantic demonstration to meet the declaration in the north it was fixed to spread itself over three days the french politely begged the papalini to keep out of sight and then they marched with the roman demonstration for two daystwenty thousand romans gathered together i hear from those who were there the greatest order observedtricolors insinuated into the costume of all the women after a certain time french officer turns round and addresses the populace gioventù romana basta cosí adesso bisogna andare a casa poichè mi farebbe grandissimo dispiacere d aprire ad alcuno la strada delle carceri the last words said smilingas words to the wise grazie grazie grazie were replied on all sides and the people dispersed in the best humour possible yesterday san giuseppe we were to have had it repeated but it rained hard which was fortunate perhaps and i hear something of cannons being placed in evidence and of gorgon saying de haute voix that he couldnt allow it to go on but everybody understands gorgon he has certainly up to a point papal sympathies and is as tender as he dares be to the holy father and the irritation and wrath of the priestly party is naturally great on the other hand the whole body of french troops and their officers are as much vexed by gorgon as gorgon can vex me and theres fraternisation with the romans to an extraordinary degree  penini came home three days ago in a state of ecstasy nohe never had been so happy in all his life oh mama i am so happy what had happened i asked why pen being on the pincio had fallen on the french troops had pushed through and heard lordre du jour read had made friends with ever so many captains had marched in the ranks round the pincio and into the caserne had talked a great deal about chopin stephen heller c with musical officers and most about politics and had been goodnaturedly brought back to our door because he was too little to come alone through the crowd what had they not told him such things about italy they hoped said pen that i would not think they were like the papalini no indeed they hoped i knew the french were different quite and that though they protected the holy father they certainly didnt mean to fight for him what they wanted was ve king of italy napoléon veut litalie libre i was to understand that and remember it the attention and the desire to conciliate pens good opinion had perfectly turned the childs head it will be dearest napoleon more than ever of course he had invited the officers to come in and see mama only they were too discreet for this  pantaleone is exiledordered to go in eight days three of which are passed he is still in hopes of gaining more time but the pope is said to be resolutely set against him i am very sorry not surprised he told robert yesterday that nothing can be surer than that napoleon has been throughout a true friend to italy which is a good deal for a man to admit who began with all the irritation against napoleon of a roman of 1849 even after the war through villafranca the bad feeling returned and as he lives so much among the english it was only natural that he should receive certain influences he is with odo russell who calls him pant nearly every day and mr cartwright is very intimate with him besides but p is above all things italian and the italian of the most incisive intellect i ever talked with he praises lord john                                        to miss browning  rome end of march 1861 postmark  we take ourselves to be dismally aggrieved ever dearest sarianna by your criticisms on our photographs after deep reflection i cant help feeling sure against roberts impression that he sent younot the right one but one which has undeniably a certain grin i prevail with him to let you have the twothird likeness this time in order to decide the point if you keep your opinion why then all artistic rome is against you without exception nobody likes the sepiacoloured thing of last year in comparison every album in rome gives up its dead and insists on the new likenessnot only is it considered more like but so infinitely superior in expression and poetical convenance that it ought to be more like so everybody thinks with regard to the head i am of opinion that the head is beautiful and the eyes singularly full of expression for photographed eyes but there may be more difference of opinion about the head the twothird view you certainly cant have seen why we had even resolved as we couldnt hope to grow younger to stand or fall with posterity by this production ecco  as to ageno its cruel of you to talk so roberts beard was tolerably white when he was in paris last and in fact his moustache is less so than the rest therefore there cant be and isnt in this respect so rapid a decline and fall in his appearance the clipping of the side whiskers which are very grey is an advantage and as to the hair it is by no means cut short like an épicier no indeed the épicier is bushy and curly about the ears see an example in galignani and moreover will keep the colour of the curl if he dyes for itan extremity to which robert and i will never be drivenhaving too much the fear of attentive friends and affectionate biographers before our eyesas suggested by poor balzacs but robert is looking remarkably well and youngin spite of all lunar lights in his hair though my hair keeps darker with a certain sprinkle however underneath which forces its way outwards i would willingly change on the whole with him if he were not my own robert he is not thin or worn as i amno indeedand the women adore him everywhere far too much for decency in my own opinion he is infinitely handsomer and more attractive than when i saw him first sixteen years agowhich does not mean as much as you may suppose that i myself am superannuated and wholly anile and incompetent therefore for judgment no indeed i believe people in general would think the same exactly and as to the modellingwell i told you that i grudged a little the time from his own particular artand that is true but it does not do to dishearten him about his modelling he has given a great deal of time to anatomy with reference to the expression of form and the clay is only the new medium which takes the place of drawing also robert is peculiar in his ways of work as a poet i have struggled a little with him on this pointfor i dont think him rightthat is to say it wouldnt be right for meand i heard the other day that it wouldnt be right for tennyson tennyson is a regular worker shuts himself up daily for so many hours and we are generally so made that a regular hour is good even for so uncertain an influence as mesmerism but robert waits for an inclinationworks by fits and startshe cant do otherwise he says98 then reading hurts him as long as i have known him he has not been able to read long at a timehe can do it now better than in the beginning of time the consequence of which is that he wants occupation and that an active occupation is salvation to him with his irritable nerves saves him from ruminating bitter cud and from the process which i call beating his dear head against the wall till it is bruised simply because he sees a fly there magnified by his own two eyes almost indefinitely into some saurian monster he has an enormous superfluity of vital energy and if it isnt employed it strikes its fangs into him he gets out of spirits as he was at havre nobody understands exactly whyexcept me who am in the inside of him and hear him breathe for the peculiarity of our relation is that even when hes displeased with me he thinks aloud with me and cant stop himself and i know ultimately that whatever takes him out of a certain circle where habits of introvision and analysis of flylegs are morbidly exercised is life and joy to him i wanted his poems done this winter very muchand here was a bright room with three windows consecrated to use but he had a room all last summer and did nothing then he worked himself out by riding for three or four hours togetherthere has been little poetry done since last winter when he did much he was not inclined to write this winter the modelling combines bodywork and soulwork and the more tired he has been and the more his back ached poor fellow the more he has exulted and been happyno nothing ever made him so happy beforealso the better he has looked and the stouter grown so i couldnt be much in opposition against the sculpturei couldnt in fact at all he has the material for a volume and will work at it this summer he says his power is much in advance of strafford which is his poorest work of all oh the brain stratifies and matures creatively even in the pauses of the pen  at the same time his treatment in england affects him naturallyand for my part i set it down as an infamy of that publicno other word he says he has told you some things you had not heard and which i acknowledge i always try to prevent him from repeating to anyone i wonder if he has told you besides no i fancy not that an english lady of rank an acquaintance of ours observe that asked the other day the american minister whether robert was not an american the minister answered is it possible that you ask me this why there is not so poor a village in the united states where they would not tell you that robert browning was an englishman and that they were very sorry he was not an american very pretty of the american ministerwas it notand literally true besides  i have been meditating sarianna dear whether we might not make our summer out at fontainebleau in the picturesque part of the forest it would be quiet and not very dear and we might dine together and take hands as at havrefor we will all insist on roberts doing the hospitality i confess to shrinking a good deal about the noise of pariswe might try paris later what do you say the sea is so very farit is such a journeyit looks so to me just now and the south of france is very hotas hot as italybesides making you pay greatly for your whistle switzerland would increase both expenses and journey for everybody fontainebleau is said to be delicious in the summer and if you dont mind losing your sea bathing it might answer arabel wants me to go to england but as i did not last year my heart and nerves revolt from it now besides we belong to the nonno and you this summer arabel can and i dare say will join us and milsand you say once in three years not quite so i think in any case it has been far worse with some of mine all the days of the three times of meeting in fourteen years can only be multiplied together into three weeks and this after a life of close union also it was not her faultshe had not pecuniary means i am bitter against myself for not having gone to england for a week or two in the havre year i could have done it robert would have let me but now no more it was the war the year before last and my unsteadiness of health last year which kept us from our usual visit to you this time we shall come  only we shall avoid the alps coming and going out of prudence then for next winter we return to rome  why do you believe all the small gossip set in movement by the emperors enemies in paris against his friends as in foreign countries against himself its a league of lies against him and his intriguing lacqueys thats a sweeping phrase for all persons of distinction in france except members of the opposition that men like de morny and walewski may speculate unduly i dont doubt but even the times says now that these things have been probably exaggerated i have heard great good of both these men as to prince napoleon he has spoken like a man and a prince we are at his feet here in italy tell our dear friend milsand that i read the seventeen columns of the speech in the moniteur robert said magnificent i had tears in my eyes there may have been fault in the ps private lifeand may be still where is a clean man but for the rest he has done and spoken worthilyand what is better we have reason to believe here that the emperor sympathises with him wholly odo russell knows the princesays that he is pétillant desprit and has great weight with the emperor  the remainder of this letter is missing                                        to mrs martin  rome 126 via felice april 1861  my very dear friends how am i to thank you both i receive the photograph with a heart running over it is perfect never could a likeness be more satisfactory it is himself form expression the whole man and soul on which years cannot leave the least dint of a tooth the youthfulness is extraordinary we are all crying out against our black lines laying them all to the sun of course and even pretty women of our acquaintance in rome come out with some twenty years additional on their heads to their great dissatisfaction but my dear mr martin is my dear mr martin still unblacked unchanged as when i knew him in the sun long ago when suns were content to make funny places instead of drawing pictures how good of dearest mrs martin it was she i think to send this to me i wish she or he had sent me hers besides how grasping some of us are  then she sent me a short time since a book for my peni which he seized on with blazing eyes and an exclamation oh what fun a work by his great author mayne reid who outshines all other authors unless its robinson crusoe who of course wrote his own life it was so very very good of you robert had repeatedly tried in rome to buy a new volume of mayne reid for the child and never could get one our drawback in rome relates to books we subscribe to a french library not good and snatch at accidental waifs and then the newspapers which i intrigue about and get smuggled through the courteous hands of french generals are absorbing enough  i had a letter from george yesterday with good news of dearest mrs martin may it be true but i cant understand whether you have spent this winter in devonshire or worcestershire or where the thick gloom of it is over now yet i find myself full of regrets its so hard to have to get out into the workday world daylight open air and all and theres a duty on me to go to france that robert may see his father you would pity me if you could see how i dread it arabel will meet me and spend at least the summer with us probably in the neighbourhood of paris and after just the first weeven imay be the happier dont tell anyone that i feel so i should like to go into a cave for the year not that i havent taken to work again and to my old interests in politics one doesnt quite rot in ones selfishness after all in fact i think of myself as little as possible its the only way to bear life to throw oneself out of the personal  and my italy goes on well in spite of some neapolitan troubles which are exaggerated i can certify to you rome according to my information as well as my instincts approaches the crisis we desire in respect to venetia we may perhaps must have a struggle for it which might have been unnecessary if england had frankly accepted coaction with france instead of doing a little liberalism and a great deal of suspicion on her own account as it is theres an impression in europe that considerations about the east to say nothing of the ionian islands will be stronger than vattel and forbid our throwing over our natural ally for the sake of our natural enemy  i am sure you must have been anxious lately on account of america there seems to be a good deal of weakness even on the part of lincoln who if he had not the means of defending fort sumter and maintaining the union should not have spoken as he did not that it may not be as well to let the southern states secede perhaps better so what i feared most was that the north would compromise and i fear still that they are not heroically strong on their legs on the moral question i fear it much if they can but hold up it will be noble  we remain here where we have had the mildest of winters till somewhat late in may when we go to florence for a week or two on our way to paris  you see my emperor is crowning the edifice99 it is the beginning sir john bowring says that the more liberty he can give the better he will like it he told sir john so  is it right and loyal meanwhile of guizot and his party to oppose the empire by upholding the enemies of italy i ask you such things i hear from paris guizot corrected kellers speech with his own hand  may god bless you pens love and gratitude if robert were here he would be named love me and think of me a little  your ever affectionate and grateful ba                                        to miss browning  rome may 11 1861 postmark  your account of the dearest nonno was very pleasant on the whole only of course you will be very careful with him and then dearest sarianna you yourself have not been well the grippe seems to have been bitter against you this is the time of year when it generally rages and even pen has had a small cough which makes me austere about hours in fact the weather in the north has reverberated here and we have paid for our mild winter by a considerable lingering of cold wind from snow on the mountains they say as for me its much to my disadvantage in getting air and strength i hope you are quite well again as is pen and that the loved nonno is as strong as he ever was do you get good wine for him the vintages are said to have suffered which grieves me for poor dear milsand from the frost we hear of travellers in snowstorms through england where the cold has been great and that in paris too there has been snow i do hope the opening summer will not copy the last  dearest sarianna try to find out if fontainebleau is damp because i was assured the other day that it was besides being subject to intense heats also will you see if there is a completed railroad to trouville robert denies that seaair ever disagrees with him seabathing does and it may be good for you and for pen to say nothing of arabel who is coming in the course of the summer the objection is the journey but if the railroad is there it would not prolong the journey in relation to fontainebleau more than two or three hours if so much would it we ought to inquire a little beforehand we shall get to you as early as we can the weather is against us everywhere we shall cut florence quite short by the way we have the satisfaction of seeing a precipitation of the tuscan funds down down which only makes robert wish for more power of buying in causing the eyes of a florentine frescobaldi to open in wonder at so much audacity but robert generally so timid in such things has caught a flush of my rashness and is alarmed by neither sinking funds nor rising loans we have a strong faith in italyitalia fattaparticularly since that grand child garibaldi has turned good again the troubles in the neapolitan states are exaggerated are perilous even so and i dare say milsand thinks we are all going to pieces but we shall not there are great men here and there will be a great nation presently an australian englishman very acute and free from the political faults as i see them of england did all he could to prepare me for failure in italy to save my heart from breaking as he said and we have had drawbacks since then yet my hope remains as strong  the duchesse de grammont french embassy sent us a card for peninimatinée denfantsand he went and was rather proud of being received under a fulllength portrait of napoleon who is as dear as ever to him it was a very splendid affair quite royal pen wore a crimson velvet blouse and was presented to various small italian princes colonnas dorias piombinos and had the honor of talking ponies and lessons and playing leapfrog with them the ambassadors own boy the little grammont has a pony tale quale like pens only superannuated rather which gives us the advantage  i wonder if he will confide to you his tender admiration for the young queen of naples whom between you and me he pursues and receives in return ever so many smiles from that sad lovely face when charged with a love affair pen answered gravely that he did feel a kind of interest he told us that two days since she stood up in her carriage three times to smile at him something it may be for the ponys sake but also pen confessed to an impression that his new jacket attracted fancy little pen robert says she is very pretty and for pen who makes it a point of conscience to consider the whole razza of bourbons and papalini as questi infami birboni to be so drawn there must be a charm after all poor little creature she acted heroically from her point of sight and if the king had minded her he would have made liberal concessions in time perhaps the wretched queenmother and herself were at daggers drawn from the beginning  i hear that jessie mario and her husband have been taken up at ferrara they were only going to begin the war with austria on their own account mazzini deserves what i should be sorry to inflict he is a man without conscience and thats no reason why jessie and her party should use him for theirs mario is only the husband of his wife  robert has brought me home a most perfect copy of a small torso of venusfrom the greekin the clay it is wonderfully done say the learned he says all his happiness lies in clay now that was his speech to me this morning not a compliment but said so sincerely and fervently that i could not but sympathise and wish him a lifeload of clay to riot in its the mixture of physical and intellectual effort which makes the attraction i imagine certainly he is very well and very gay  i am happy to see that the north british quarterly has an article on him that gives hope for england thackeray has turned me out of the cornhill for indecency but did it so prettily and kindly that i who am forgiving sent him another poem he says that plain words permitted on sundays must not be spoken on mondays in england and also that his magazine is for babes and sucklings i thought it was for the volunteers  may god bless you dearest sarianna and nonno pens love                                        the incident alluded to in the last paragraph deserves fuller mention for the credit it does to both parties concerned in it the letters that passed between thackeray and mrs browning on the subject have been given by mrs richmond ritchie in the cornhill magazine for july 1896 from which i am allowed to quote them mrs browning in reply to a request from thackeray for contributions to the then newly established cornhill had sent him among other poems lord walters wife100 of which though the moral is unimpeachable the subject is not absolutely virginibus puerisque the editor in this difficulty wrote the following admirable letter                                        wm thackeray to mrs browning  36 onslow square april 2 1861  my dear kind mrs browninghas browning ever had an aching tooth which must come out i dont say mrs browning for women are much more courageousa tooth which must come out and which he has kept for months and months away from the dentist i have had such a tooth a long time and have sate down in this chair and never had the courage to undergo the pull  this tooth is an allegory i mean this one its your poem that you sent me months ago and who am i to refuse the poems of elizabeth browning and set myself up as a judge over her i cant tell you how often i have been going to write and have failed you see that our magazine is written not only for men and women but for boys girls infants sucklings almost and one of the best wives mothers women in the world writes some verses which i feel certain would be objected to by many of our readers not that the writer is not pure and the moral most pure chaste and right but there are things my squeamish public will not hear on monday though on sundays they listen to them without scruple in your poem you know there is an account of unlawful passion felt by a man for a woman and though you write pure doctrine and real modesty and pure ethics i am sure our readers would make an outcry and so i have not published this poem  to have to say no to my betters is one of the hardest duties i have but im sure we must not publish your verses and i go down on my knees before cutting my victims head off and say madam you know how i respect and regard you brownings wife and peninis mother and for what i am going to do i most humbly ask your pardon  my girls send their very best regards and remembrances and i am dear mrs browning  always yours  wm thackeray                                        mrs brownings answer follows                                        to wm thackeray  rome 126 via felice april 21 1861  dear mr thackeraypray consider the famous tooth a wise tooth as extracted under chloroform and no pain suffered by anybody  to prove that i am not sulky i send another contribution which may prove too much perhapsand if you think so dispose of the supererogatory virtue by burning the manuscript as i am sure i may rely on your having done with the last  i confess it dear mr thackeray never was anyone turned out of a room for indecent behaviour in a more gracious and conciliatory manner also i confess that from your cornhill standpoint paterfamilias looking on you are probably right ten times over from mine however i may not be wrong and i appeal to you as the deep man you are whether it is not the higher mood which on sunday bears with the plain word so offensive on monday during the cheating across the counter i am not a fast woman i dont like coarse subjects or the coarse treatment of any subject but i am deeply convinced that the corruption of our society requires not shut doors and windows but light and air and that it is exactly because pure and prosperous women choose to ignore vice that miserable women suffer wrong by it everywhere has paterfamilias with his oriental traditions and veiled female faces very successfully dealt with a certain class of evil what if materfamilias with her quick sure instincts and honest innocent eyes do more towards their expulsion by simply looking at them and calling them by their names see what insolence you put me up to by your kind way of naming my dignitiesbrownings wife and peninis mother  and i being vain turn some people out of a room and you dont humble them properly retort withmaterfamilias  our friend mr story has just finished a really grand statue of the african sybil it will place him very high  where are you all annie minniewhy dont you come and see us in rome  my husband bids me give you his kind regards and i shall send pens love with mine to your dear girls  most truly yours elizabeth barrett browning  we go to florence in the latter part of may                                        before leaving florence however the following letter was written to mr thackeray which i quote from the same article by mrs ritchie the poem alluded to must however be the north and the south101 mrs brownings last poem written with reference to hans andersens visit to rome not a musical instrument as mrs ritchie suggests which had been written some time previously                                        to wm thackeray  rome 126 via felice may 21 1861  dear mr thackerayi hope you received my note and last poem i hope still more earnestly that you wont think i am putting my spite against your chastening hand into a presumptuous and troublesome fluency  but hans christian andersen is here charming us all and not least the children so i wrote these versesnot for cornhill this month of coursethough i send them now that they may lie over at your service if you are so pleased for some other month of the summer  we go to florence on the first of june and lo here is the twentyfirst of may  with love to dear annie and minny  i remain most truly yours elizabeth barrett browning                                         to miss i blagden  rome saturday about may 1861  ever dearest isanow that roberts letter is gone i am able for shame to write his waiting did not mean a slackness of kindness but a tightness of entanglement in other things and then absolutely he has got to the point of doing without reading nothing but clay does he care for poor lost soul but you will see i hope from what he has written to judge by what he speaks that he is not so lost as to be untouched by agnes102  i send you dear two more translations for dall ongaro you will have given him my former message i began that letter to him and was interrupted and then considering the shortness of our time here would not begin another you will have explained and will make him thoroughly understand that in sending him a verbal and literal translation i never thought of exacting such a thing from him but simply of letting him have the advantage of seeing the raw naked poetry as it stands in fact my translation is scarcely italian i know very well i mean it for english rather conventional and idiomatical italian forms have been expressly avoided i have used the italian as a net to catch the english in for the use of an italian poet let him understand  we shall be soon in our florence now i am rather stronger but so weak still that my eyes dazzle to think of it povera me  tell dall ongaro that his friend m carl grün had enough of me in one visit he never came again though i prayed him to come i have not been equal to receiving in the evening and perhaps he expected an invitation i go to bed at eight on most nights im the rag of a ba yet i am stronger and look much so it seems to me mr story is doing roberts bust which is likely to be a success103 hatty brought us a most charming design for a fountain for lady marion alford the imagination is unfolding its wings in hatty she is quite of a mind to spend the summer with you at florence or elsewhere the storys talk of switzerland  andersen the dane came to see me yesterdaykissed my hand and seemed in a general verve for embracing he is very earnest very simple very childlike i like him pen says of him he is not really pretty he is rather like his own ugly duck but his mind has developed into a swan  that wasnt bad of pen was it he gets on with his latin too and isa he has fastened a halffranc to his buttonhole for the sake of the beloved image and no power on earth can persuade him out of being so ridiculous i was base enough to say that it wouldnt please the queen of spain and he responded he chose her to know that he did love napoleon  isa i send these two last poems that dall ongaro may be aware of my sympathys comprehending more sides than one of italian experience  we have taken no apartment yet                                        to miss browning  florence june 7 1861 postmark  i cant let roberts disagreeable letter go alone dearest sarianna though my word will be as heavy as a stone at the bottom of it i am deeply sorry you should have had the vain hope of seeing robert and pen as for me i know my place i am only good for a drag chain but dear dont fancy it has been the fault of my will in fact i said almost too much at rome to robert till he fancied i had set my selfwill on tossing myself up as a halfpenny and coming down on the wrong side now in fact it was not at all nearly for arabel that i wished to go only i did really wish and do my best to go he on the other hand before we left rome had made up his mind helped by a stray physician of mine whom he met in the street that it would be a great risk to carry me north he robert always a little exaggerates the difficulties of travelling and theres no denying that i have less strength than is usual to me even at the present time i touched the line of vexing him with my resistance to the decision but he is so convinced that repose is necessary for me and that the lions in the path will be all asleep by this time next year that i yielded certainly he has a right to command me away from giving him unnecessary anxieties what does vex me is that the dearest nonno should not see his peni this year and that you dear should be disappointed on my account again thats hard on us all we came home into a cloud here i can scarcely command voice or hand to name cavour104 that great soul which meditated and made italy has gone to the diviner country if tears or blood could have saved him to us he should have had mine i feel yet as if i could scarcely comprehend the greatness of the vacancy a hundred garibaldis for such a man there is a hope that certain solutions had been prepared between him and the emperor and that events will slide into their grooves may god save italy dear m milsand had pleased me so by his appreciation but there are great difficulties the french press tell him has on the whole done great service except that part of it under the influence of the ultramontane and dynastic opposition parties and as to exaggerated statements it is hard even here to get at the truth with regard to the state of the south and many italian liberals have had hours of anxiety and even of despondency english friends of ours very candid and liberal have gone to naples full of hope and returned hoping nothingyet they are wrong unless this bitter loss makes them right  your loving ba  robert tears me away                                        with this letter the correspondence of mrs browning so far at least as it is extant or accessible comes to an end the journey to paris had been abandoned but it does not appear that there was any cause to apprehend that her life could now be reckoned only by days yet so it was for the past three years it is evident her strength had been giving way attacks of physical illness weakened her without being followed by any adequate rally but more than all the continuous stress and strain of mental anxiety wore her strength away the war of 1859 the liberation of sicily and naples the intense irritation of feeling in connection with english opinion of louis napoleon and his policy the continual ebb and flow of rumours concerning venetia and the papal states the illness and death of her sister henriettaall these sources of anxiety told terribly on her sensitive emotional mind and thereby on her enfeebled body the fragility of her appearance had always struck strangers so far back as 1851 bayard taylor remarked that her frame seemed to be altogether disproportionate to her soul her fiery soul did indeed with a far more literal truth than can often be the case fret her puny body to decay and oerinformed its tenement of clay her last illnessor it may more truly be said the last phase of that illness which had been present with her for yearswas neither long nor severe but she had no more strength left to resist it shortly after her return to casa guidi another bronchial attack developed itself to all appearance just like many others that she had had before but this time there was no recovery  of the last scene no other account need be asked or wished for than that given by mr browning himself in a letter to miss haworth dated july 20 1861105  my dear friendi well know you feel as you say for her once and for me now isa blagden perfect in all kindness to me will have told you something perhaps and one day i shall see you and be able to tell you myself as much as i can the main comfort is that she suffered very little pain none beside that ordinarily attending the simple attacks of cold and cough she was subject to had no presentiment of the result whatever and was consequently spared the misery of knowing she was about to leave us she was smilingly assuring me that she was better quite comfortable if i would but come to bed to within a few minutes of the last i think i foreboded evil at rome certainly from the beginning of the weeks illness but when i reasoned about it there was no justifying fear she said on the last evening it is merely the old attack not so severe a one as that of two years ago there is no doubt i shall soon recover and we talked over plans for the summer and next year i sent the servants away and her maid to bed so little reason for disquietude did there seem through the night she slept heavily and brokenlythat was the bad sign but then she would sit up take her medicine say unrepeatable things to me and sleep again at four oclock there were symptoms that alarmed me i called the maid and sent for the doctor she smiled as i proposed to bathe her feet well you are determined to make an exaggerated case of it then came what my heart will keep till i see her again and longerthe most perfect expression of her love to me within my whole knowledge of her always smilingly happily and with a face like a girls and in a few minutes she died in my arms her head on my cheek these incidents so sustain me that i tell them to her beloved ones as their right there was no lingering nor acute pain nor consciousness of separation but god took her to himself as you would lift a sleeping child from a dark uneasy bed into your arms and the light thank god annunziata thought by her earnest ways with me happy and smiling as they were that she must have been aware of our partings approach but she was quite conscious had words at command and yet did not even speak of peni who was in the next room the last word was when i asked how do you feel beautiful  so ended on earth the most perfect example of wedded happiness in the history of literatureperfect in the inner life and perfect in its poetical expression it was on june 29 1861 that mrs browning died she was buried at florence where her body rests in a sarcophagus designed by her friend and her husbands friend frederic leighton the future president of the royal academy at a later date when her husband was laid to rest in westminster abbey her remains might have been transferred to england to lie with his among the great company of english poets in which they had earned their places but it was thought better on the whole to leave them undisturbed in the land and in the city which she had loved so well and which had been her home so long in life and in death she had been made welcome in florence the italians as her husband said seemed to have understood her by an instinct and upon the walls of casa guidi is a marble slab placed there by the municipality of florence and bearing an inscription from the pen of the italian poet tommaséo       qui scrisse e morÌ      elisabetta barrett browning      che in cuore di donna conciliava      scienza di dotto e spirito di poeta      e fece del suo verso aureo anello      fra italia e inghilterra      pone questa lapide      firenze grata      1861  it is with words adapted from this memorial that her husband seven years later closed his own great poem praying that the ring to which he likens it might but                 lie outside thine lyric love     thy rare gold ring of verse the poet praised     linking our england to his italy   footnotes  77 this refers to the curse for a nation  78 see note on p 387 transcribers note reference is to footnote 87  79 mrs jameson died on march 17 1860  80 the surrender to france of savoy and nice which though propounded by napoleon to cavour before the war was only definitely demanded at the end of february 1860  81 rome it will be remembered was still under papal government  82 the french general appointed by the pope in april 1860 to command the papal army  83 the italian poet  84 so in the original but probably a slip for goes abroad  85 the cornhill magazine the first number of which was published under thackerays editorship in december 1859 mrs brownings poem a musical instrument poetical works v 10 was published in the number for july 1860  86 his framley parsonage was then appearing in the cornhill  87 the championship trophy of the prize ring the great fight between sayers and heenan had just taken place april 17 1860 and had engrossed the interest of all england to say nothing of america  88 it is not clear what this can be browning published nothing between 1855 men and women and 1864 dramatis personæ and there is no long poem in the latter unless a death in the desert and sludge the medium may be so described the latter is not unlikely to have been written now when homes performances were rampant his next really long poem was the ring and the book which certainly had not yet been begun  89 a novel by miss blagden  90 garibaldi was now engaged in his neapolitan campaign sicily except messina had been cleared of the neapolitan troops by the end of july and on august 19 garibaldi had landed in calabria  91 now in the national portrait gallery a reproduction of it is given as the frontispiece to vol v of the poetical works  92 a musical instrument see p 377 above  93 gaeta the last remaining stronghold of the neapolitan government was besieged by the italian forces from november to january during the first two months of the siege the french fleet prevented the italians from operating against it by sea and it was ultimately through the intervention of the english government that napoleon was persuaded to withdraw his ships  94 viterbo had declared for the italian government but had been occupied by french troops on behalf of the pope many of the inhabitants left it and a body of italian volunteers entered the country in support of them it is presumably to this movement that the passage in the text refers  95 poetical works v 3 the poem evidently refers to the loss of her brother edward but might be supposed being published at this moment to refer to the death of her sister henrietta shortly after which this letter was evidently written  96 gaeta fell on january 15 1861  97 mr val prinsep ra  98 mrs orrs life shows that this was only a temporary phase in later life especially he was very regular in his hours of poetical work  99 it is curious that these are the very words which as a translation from the greek robert browning used ten years later as the motto of his study of louis napoleon in prince hohenstielschwangau but the crowning was of a very different kind then      attempting one more labour in a trice     alack with ills i crowned the edifice  100 poetical works iv 252  101 poetical
