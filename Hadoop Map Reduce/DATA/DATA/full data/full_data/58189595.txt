lxiv     c a alvord stereotyper  printer new york       illustration violet and peony put the finishing touches to the       snow girl     the snowimage  a childish miracle   one afternoon of a cold winters day when the sun shone forth with chilly brightness after a long storm two children asked leave of their mother to run out and play in the newfallen snow the elder child was a little girl whom because she was of a tender and modest disposition and was thought to be very beautiful her parents and other people who were familiar with her used to call violet but her brother was known by the style and title of peony on account of the ruddiness of his broad and round little phiz which made everybody think of sunshine and great scarlet flowers the father of these two children a certain mr lindsey it is important to say was an excellent but exceedingly matteroffact sort of man a dealer in hardware and was sturdily accustomed to take what is called the commonsense view of all matters that came under his consideration with a heart about as tender as other peoples he had a head as hard and impenetrable and therefore perhaps as empty as one of the iron pots which it was a part of his business to sell the mothers character on the other hand had a strain of poetry in it a trait of unworldly beautya delicate and dewy flower as it were that had survived out of her imaginative youth and still kept itself alive amid the dusty realities of matrimony and motherhood  so violet and peony as i began with saying besought their mother to let them run out and play in the new snow for though it had looked so dreary and dismal drifting downward out of the gray sky it had a very cheerful aspect now that the sun was shining on it the children dwelt in a city and had no wider playplace than a little garden before the house divided by a white fence from the street and with a peartree and two or three plumtrees overshadowing it and some rosebushes just in front of the parlor windows the trees and shrubs however were now leafless and their twigs were enveloped in the light snow which thus made a kind of wintry foliage with here and there a pendent icicle for the fruit  yes violetyes my little peony said their kind mother you may go out and play in the new snow  accordingly the good lady bundled up her darlings in woollen jackets and wadded sacks and put comforters round their necks and a pair of striped gaiters on each little pair of legs and worsted mittens on their hands and gave them a kiss apiece by way of a spell to keep away jack frost forth sallied the two children with a hopskipandjump that carried them at once into the very heart of a huge snowdrift whence violet emerged like a snowbunting while little peony floundered out with his round face in full bloom then what a merry time had they to look at them frolicking in the wintry garden you would have thought that the dark and pitiless storm had been sent for no other purpose but to provide a new plaything for violet and peony and that they themselves had been created as the snowbirds were to take delight only in the tempest and in the white mantle which it spread over the earth  at last when they had frosted one another all over with handfuls of snow violet after laughing heartily at little peonys figure was struck with a new idea  you look exactly like a snowimage peony said she if your cheeks were not so red and that puts me in mind let us make an image out of snowan image of a little girland it shall be our sister and shall run about and play with us all winter long wont it be nice  o yes cried peony as plainly as he could speak for he was but a little boy that will be nice and mamma shall see it  yes answered violet mamma shall see the new little girl but she must not make her come into the warm parlor for you know our little snowsister will not love the warmth    illustration violet and peony have a snowball fight  and forthwith the children began this great business of making a snowimage that should run about while their mother who was sitting at the window and overheard some of their talk could not help smiling at the gravity with which they set about it they really seemed to imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever in creating a live little girl out of the snow and to say the truth if miracles are ever to be wrought it will be by putting our hands to the work in precisely such a simple and undoubting frame of mind as that in which violet and peony now undertook to perform one without so much as knowing that it was a miracle so thought the mother and thought likewise that the new snow just fallen from heaven would be excellent material to make new beings of if it were not so very cold she gazed at the children a moment longer delighting to watch their little figuresthe girl tall for her age graceful and agile and so delicately colored that she looked like a cheerful thought more than a physical realitywhile peony expanded in breadth rather than height and rolled along on his short and sturdy legs as substantial as an elephant though not quite so big then the mother resumed her work what it was i forget but she was either trimming a silken bonnet for violet or darning a pair of stockings for little peonys short legs again however and again and yet other agains she could not help turning her head to the window to see how the children got on with their snowimage  indeed it was an exceedingly pleasant sight those bright little souls at their tasks moreover it was really wonderful to observe how knowingly and skilfully they managed the matter violet assumed the chief direction and told peony what to do while with her own delicate fingers she shaped out all the nicer parts of the snowfigure it seemed in fact not so much to be made by the children as to grow up under their hands while they were playing and prattling about it their mother was quite surprised at this and the longer she looked the more and more surprised she grew  what remarkable children mine are thought she smiling with a mothers pride and smiling at herself too for being so proud of them what other children could have made any thing so like a little girls figure out of snow at the first trial wellbut now i must finish peonys new frock for his grandfather is coming tomorrow and i want the little fellow to look handsome  so she took up the frock and was soon as busily at work again with her needle as the two children with their snowimage but still as the needle travelled hither and thither through the seams of the dress the mother made her toil light and happy by listening to the airy voices of violet and peony they kept talking to one another all the time their tongues being quite as active as their feet and hands except at intervals she could not distinctly hear what was said but had merely a sweet impression that they were in a most loving mood and were enjoying themselves highly and that the business of making the snowimage went prosperously on now and then however when violet and peony happened to raise their voices the words were as audible as if they had been spoken in the very parlor where the mother sat o how delightfully those words echoed in her heart even though they meant nothing so very wise or wonderful after all  but you must know a mother listens with her heart much more than with her ears and thus she is often delighted with the trills of celestial music when other people can hear nothing of the kind  peony peony cried violet to her brother who had gone to another part of the garden bring me some of that fresh snow peony from the very furthest corner where we have not been trampling i want it to shape our little snowsisters bosom with you know that part must be quite pure just as it came out of the sky  here it is violet answered peony in his bluff tone but a very sweet tone tooas he came floundering through the halftrodden drifts here is the snow for her little bosom o violet how beautiful she begins to look  yes said violet thoughtfully and quietly our snowsister does look very lovely i did not quite know peony that we could make such a sweet little girl as this  the mother as she listened thought how fit and delightful an incident it would be if fairies or still better if angelchildren were to come from paradise and play invisibly with her own darlings and help them to make their snowimage giving it the features of celestial babyhood violet and peony would not be aware of their immortal playmatesonly they would see that the image grew very beautiful while they worked at it and would think that they themselves had done it all  my little girl and boy deserve such playmates if mortal children ever did said the mother to herself and then she smiled again at her own motherly pride  nevertheless the idea seized upon her imagination and ever and anon she took a glimpse out of the window half dreaming that she might see the goldenhaired children of paradise sporting with her own goldenhaired violet and brightcheeked peony  now for a few moments there was a busy and earnest but indistinct hum of the two childrens voices as violet and peony wrought together with one happy consent violet still seemed to be the guiding spirit while peony acted rather as a laborer and brought her the snow from far and near and yet the little urchin evidently had a proper understanding of the matter too  peony peony cried violet for her brother was again at the other side of the garden bring me those light wreaths of snow that have rested on the lower branches of the peartree you can clamber on the snowdrift peony and reach them easily i must have them to make some ringlets for our snowsisters head  here they are violet answered the little boy take care you do not break them well done well done how pretty  does she not look sweetly said violet with a very satisfied tone and now we must have some little shining bits of ice to make the brightness of her eyes she is not finished yet mamma will see how very beautiful she is but papa will say tush nonsensecome in out of the cold  let us call mamma to look out said peony and then he shouted lustily mamma mamma mamma look out and see what a nice ittle girl we are making  the mother put down her work for an instant and looked out of the window but it so happened that the sunfor this was one of the shortest days of the whole yearhad sunken so nearly to the edge of the world that his setting shine came obliquely into the ladys eyes so she was dazzled you must understand and could not very distinctly observe what was in the garden still however through all that bright blinding dazzle of the sun and the new snow she beheld a small white figure in the garden that seemed to have a wonderful deal of human likeness about it and she saw violet and peonyindeed she looked more at them than at the imageshe saw the two children still at work peony bringing fresh snow and violet applying it to the figure as scientifically as a sculptor adds clay to his model indistinctly as she discerned the snowchild the mother thought to herself that never before was there a snowfigure so cunningly made nor ever such a dear little girl and boy to make it  they do every thing better than other children said she very complacently no wonder they make better snowimages  she sat down again to her work and made as much haste with it as possible because twilight would soon come and peonys frock was not yet finished and grandfather was expected by railroad pretty early in the morning faster and faster therefore went her flying fingers the children likewise kept busily at work in the garden and still the mother listened whenever she could catch a word she was amused to observe how their little imaginations had got mixed up with what they were doing and were carried away by it they seemed positively to think that the snowchild would run about and play with them  what a nice playmate she will be for us all winter long said violet i hope papa will not be afraid of her giving us a cold shant you love her dearly peony  o yes cried peony and i will hug her and she shall sit down close by me and drink some of my warm milk  o no peony answered violet with grave wisdom that will not do at all warm milk will not be wholesome for our little snowsister little snowpeople like her eat nothing but icicles no no peony we must not give her any thing warm to drink  there was a minute or two of silence for peony whose short legs were never weary had gone on a pilgrimage again to the other side of the garden all of a sudden violet cried out loudly and joyfully  look here peony come quickly a light has been shining on her cheek out of that rosecolored cloud and the color does not go away is not that beautiful  yes it is beautiful answered peony pronouncing the three syllables with deliberate accuracy o violet only look at her hair it is all like gold  o certainly said violet with tranquillity as if it were very much a matter of course that color you know comes from the golden clouds that we see up there in the sky she is almost finished now but her lips must be made very redredder than her cheeks perhaps peony it will make them red if we both kiss them  accordingly the mother heard two smart little smacks as if both her children were kissing the snowimage on its frozen mouth but as this did not seem to make the lips quite red enough violet next proposed that the snowchild should be invited to kiss peonys scarlet cheek  come ittle snowsister kiss me cried peony  there she has kissed you added violet and now her lips are very red and she blushed a little too  o what a cold kiss cried peony  just then there came a breeze of the pure west wind sweeping through the garden and rattling the parlor windows it sounded so wintry cold that the mother was about to tap on the windowpane with her thimbled finger to summon the two children in when they both cried out to her with one voice the tone was not a tone of surprise although they were evidently a good deal excited it appeared rather as if they were very much rejoiced at some event that had now happened but which they had been looking for and had reckoned upon all along  mamma mamma we have finished our little snow sister and she is running about the garden with us  what imaginative little beings my children are thought the mother putting the last few stitches into peonys frock and it is strange too that they make me almost as much a child as they themselves are i can hardly help believing now that the snowimage has really come to life  dear mamma cried violet pray look out and see what a sweet playmate we have  the mother being thus entreated could no longer delay to look forth from the window the sun was now gone out of the sky leaving however a rich inheritance of his brightness among those purple and golden clouds which make the sunsets of winter so magnificent but there was not the slightest gleam or dazzle either on the window or on the snow so that the good lady could look all over the garden and see every thing and everybody in it and what do you think she saw there violet and peony of course her own two darling children ah but whom or what did she besides why if you will believe me there was a small figure of a girl dressed all in white with rosetinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hue playing about the garden with the two children a stranger though she was the child seemed to be on as familiar terms with violet and peony and they with her as if all the three had been playmates during the whole of their little lives the mother thought to herself that it must certainly be the daughter of one of the neighbors and that seeing violet and peony in the garden the child had run across the street to play with them so this kind lady went to the door intending to invite the little runaway into her comfortable parlor for now that the sunshine was withdrawn the atmosphere out of doors was already growing very cold    illustration violet peony and the snow girl run through the snow  but after opening the house door she stood an instant on the threshold hesitating whether she ought to ask the child to come in or whether she should even speak to her indeed she almost doubted whether it were a real child after all or only a light wreath of the newfallen snow blown hither and thither about the garden by the intensely cold west wind there was certainly something very singular in the aspect of the little stranger among all the children of the neighborhood the lady could remember no such face with its pure white and delicate rosecolor and the golden ringlets tossing about the forehead and cheeks and as for her dress which was entirely of white and fluttering in the breeze it was such as no reasonable woman would put upon a little girl when sending her out to play in the depth of winter it made this kind and careful mother shiver only to look at those small feet with nothing in the world on them except a very thin pair of white slippers nevertheless airily as she was clad the child seemed to feel not the slightest inconvenience from the cold but danced so lightly over the snow that the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its surface while violet could but just keep pace with her and peonys short legs compelled him to lag behind  once in the course of their play the strange child placed herself between violet and peony and taking a hand of each skipped merrily forward and they along with her almost immediately however peony pulled away his little fist and began to rub it as if the fingers were tingling with cold while violet also released herself though with less abruptness gravely remarking that it was better not to take hold of hands the whiterobed damsel said not a word but danced about just as merrily as before if violet and peony did not choose to play with her she could make just as good a playmate of the brisk and cold west wind which kept blowing her all about the garden and took such liberties with her that they seemed to have been friends for a long time all this while the mother stood on the threshold wondering how a little girl could look so much like a flying snowdrift or how a snowdrift could look so very like a little girl  she called violet and whispered to her  violet my darling what is this childs name asked she does she live near us  why dearest mamma answered violet laughing to think that her mother did not comprehend so very plain an affair this is our little snowsister whom we have just been making  yes dear mamma cried peony running to his mother and looking up simply into her face this is our snowimage is it not a nice ittle child  at this instant a flock of snowbirds came flitting through the air as was very natural they avoided violet and peony butand this looked strangethey flew at once to the whiterobed child fluttered eagerly about her head alighted on her shoulders and seemed to claim her as an old acquaintance she on her part was evidently as glad to see these little birds old winters grandchildren as they were to see her and welcomed them by holding out both her hands hereupon they each and all tried to alight on her two palms and ten small fingers and thumbs crowding one another off with an immense fluttering of their tiny wings one dear little bird nestled tenderly in her bosom another put its bill to her lips they were as joyous all the while and seemed as much in their element as you may have seen them when sporting with a snowstorm  violet and peony stood laughing at this pretty sight for they enjoyed the merry time which their new playmate was having with these smallwinged visitants almost as much as if they themselves took part in it  violet said her mother greatly perplexed tell me the truth without any jest who is this little girl  my darling mamma answered violet looking seriously into her mothers face and apparently surprised that she should need any further explanation i have told you truly who she is it is our little snowimage which peony and i have been making peony will tell you so as well as i  yes mamma asseverated peony with much gravity in his crimson little phiz this is ittle snowchild is not she a nice one but mamma her hand is oh so very cold  while mamma still hesitated what to think and what to do the streetgate was thrown open and the father of violet and peony appeared wrapped in a pilotcloth sack with a fur cap drawn down over his ears and the thickest of gloves upon his hands mr lindsey was a middleaged man with a weary and yet a happy look in his windflushed and frostpinched face as if he had been busy all the day long and was glad to get back to his quiet home his eyes brightened at the sight of his wife and children although he could not help uttering a word or two of surprise at finding the whole family in the open air on so bleak a day and after sunset too he soon perceived the little white stranger sporting to and fro in the garden like a dancing snowwreath and the flock of snowbirds fluttering about her head  pray what little girl may that be inquired this very sensible man surely her mother must be crazy to let her go out in such bitter weather as it has been today with only that flimsy white gown and those thin slippers  my dear husband said his wife i know no more about the little thing than you do some neighbors child i suppose our violet and peony she added laughing at herself for repeating so absurd a story insist that she is nothing but a snowimage which they have been busy about in the garden almost all the afternoon  as she said this the mother glanced her eyes toward the spot where the childrens snowimage had been made what was her surprise on perceiving that there was not the slightest trace of so much laborno image at allno piledup heap of snownothing whatever save the prints of little footsteps around a vacant space  this is very strange said she  what is strange dear mother asked violet dear father do not you see how it is this is our snowimage which peony and i have made because we wanted another playmate did not we peony  yes papa said crimson peony this be our ittle snowsister is she not beautiful but she gave me such a cold kiss  poh nonsense children cried their good honest father who as we have already intimated had an exceedingly commonsensible way of looking at matters do not tell me of making live figures out of snow come wife this little stranger must not stay out in the bleak air a moment longer we will bring her into the parlor and you shall give her a supper of warm bread and milk and make her as comfortable as you can meanwhile i will inquire among the neighbors or if necessary send the citycrier about the streets to give notice of a lost child  so saying this honest and very kindhearted man was going toward the little white damsel with the best intentions in the world but violet and peony each seizing their father by the hand earnestly besought him not to make her come in  dear father cried violet putting herself before him it is true what i have been telling you this is our little snowgirl and she cannot live any longer than while she breathes the cold west wind do not make her come into the hot room  yes father shouted peony stamping his little foot so mightily was he in earnest this be nothing but our ittle snowchild she will not love the hot fire  nonsense children nonsense nonsense cried the father half vexed half laughing at what he considered their foolish obstinacy run into the house this moment it is too late to play any longer now i must take care of this little girl immediately or she will catch her deathacold    illustration the children with their father and the snow girl  husband dear husband said his wife in a low voicefor she had been looking narrowly at the snowchild and was more perplexed than everthere is something very singular in all this you will think me foolishbutbutmay it not be that some invisible angel has been attracted by the simplicity and good faith with which our children set about their undertaking may he not have spent an hour of his immortality in playing with those dear little souls and so the result is what we call a miracle no no do not laugh at me i see what a foolish thought it is  my dear wife replied the husband laughing heartily you are as much a child as violet and peony  and in one sense so she was for all through life she had kept her heart full of childlike simplicity and faith which was as pure and clear as crystal and looking at all matters through this transparent medium she sometimes saw truths so profound that other people laughed at them as nonsense and absurdity  but now kind mr lindsey had entered the garden breaking away from his two children who still sent their shrill voices after him beseeching him to let the snowchild stay and enjoy herself in the cold west wind as he approached the snowbirds took to flight the little white damsel also fled backward shaking her head as if to say pray do not touch me and roguishly as it appeared leading him through the deepest of the snow once the good man stumbled and floundered down upon his face so that gathering himself up again with the snow sticking to his rough pilotcloth sack he looked as white and wintry as a snowimage of the largest size some of the neighbors meanwhile seeing him from their windows wondered what could possess poor mr lindsey to be running about his garden in pursuit of a snowdrift which the west wind was driving hither and thither at length after a vast deal of trouble he chased the little stranger in a corner where she could not possibly escape him his wife had been looking on and it being nearly twilight was wonderstruck to observe how the snowchild gleamed and sparkled and how she seemed to shed a glow all round about her and when driven into the corner she positively glistened like a star it was a frosty kind of brightness too like that of an icicle in the moonlight the wife thought it strange that good mr lindsey should see nothing remarkable in the snowchilds appearance  come you odd little thing cried the honest man seizing her by the hand i have caught you at last and will make you comfortable in spite of yourself we will put a nice warm pair of worsted stockings on your frozen little feet and you shall have a good thick shawl to wrap yourself in your poor white nose i am afraid is actually frostbitten but we will make it all right come along in  and so with a most benevolent smile on his sagacious visage all purple as it was with the cold this very wellmeaning gentleman took the snowchild by the hand and led her towards the house she followed him droopingly and reluctant for all the glow and sparkle was gone out of her figure and whereas just before she had resembled a bright frosty stargemmed evening with a crimson gleam on the cold horizon she now looked as dull and languid as a thaw as kind mr lindsey led her up the steps of the door violet and peony looked into his facetheir eyes full of tears which froze before they could run down their cheeksand again entreated him not to bring their snowimage into the house  not bring her in exclaimed the kindhearted man why you are crazy my little violetquite crazy my small peony she is so cold already that her hand has almost frozen mine in spite of my thick gloves would you have her freeze to death  his wife as he came up the steps had been taking another long earnest almost awestricken gaze at the little white stranger she hardly knew whether it was a dream or no but she could not help fancying that she saw the delicate print of violets fingers on the childs neck it looked just as if while violet was shaping out the image she had given it a gentle pat with her hand and had neglected to smooth the impression quite away  after all husband said the mother recurring to her idea that the angels would be as much delighted to play with violet and peony as she herself was after all she does look strangely like a snowimage i do believe she is made of snow  a puff of the west wind blew against the snowchild and again she sparkled like a star  snow repeated good mr lindsey drawing the reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold no wonder she looks like snow she is half frozen poor little thing but a good fire will put every thing to rights    illustration the children watch with their mother as their father       pulls the snow girl towards the house  without further talk and always with the same best intentions this highly benevolent and commonsensible individual led the little white damseldrooping drooping drooping more and moreout of the frosty air and into his comfortable parlor a heidenberg stove filled to the brim with intensely burning anthracite was sending a bright gleam through the isinglass of its iron door and causing the vase of water on its top to fume and bubble with excitement a warm sultry smell was diffused throughout the room a thermometer on the wall furthest from the stove stood at eighty degrees the parlor was hung with red curtains and covered with a red carpet and looked just as warm as it felt the difference betwixt the atmosphere here and the cold wintry twilight out of doors was like stepping at once from nova zembla to the hottest part of india or from the north pole into an oven o this was a fine place for the little white stranger  the commonsensible man placed the snowchild on the hearthrug right in front of the hissing and fuming stove  now she will be comfortable cried mr lindsey rubbing his hands and looking about him with the pleasantest smile you ever saw make yourself at home my child  sad sad and drooping looked the little white maiden as she stood on the hearthrug with the hot blast of the stove striking through her like a pestilence once she threw a glance wistfully toward the windows and caught a glimpse through its red curtains of the snowcovered roofs and the stars glimmering frostily and all the delicious intensity of the cold night the bleak wind rattled the windowpanes as if it were summoning her to come forth but there stood the snowchild drooping before the hot stove  but the commonsensible man saw nothing amiss  come wife said he let her have a pair of thick stockings and a woollen shawl or blanket directly and tell dora to give her some warm supper as soon as the milk boils you violet and peony amuse your little friend she is out of spirits you see at finding herself in a strange place for my part i will go around among the neighbors and find out where she belongs  the mother meanwhile had gone in search of the shawl and stockings for her own view of the matter however subtle and delicate had given way as it always did to the stubborn materialism of her husband without heeding the remonstrances of his two children who still kept murmuring that their little snowsister did not love the warmth good mr lindsey took his departure shutting the parlor door carefully behind him turning up the collar of his sack over his ears he emerged from the house and had barely reached the streetgate when he was recalled by the screams of violet and peony and the rapping of a thimbled finger against the parlor window  husband husband cried his wife showing her horrorstricken face through the windowpanes there is no need of going for the childs parents  we told you so father screamed violet and peony as he reentered the parlor you would bring her in and now our poordearbeautiful little snowsister is thawed  and their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears so that their father seeing what strange things occasionally happen in this every day world felt not a little anxious lest his children might be going to thaw too in the utmost perplexity he demanded an explanation of his wife she could only reply that being summoned to the parlor by the cries of violet and peony she found no trace of the little white maiden unless it were the remains of a heap of snow which while she was gazing at it melted quite away upon the hearthrug  and there you see all that is left of it added she pointing to a pool of water in front of the stove  yes father said violet looking reproachfully at him through her tears there is all that is left of our dear little snowsister  naughty father cried peony stamping his foot andi shudder to sayshaking his little fist at the commonsensible man we told you how it would be what for did you bring her in  and the heidenberg stove through the isinglass of its door seemed to glare at good mr lindsey like a redeyed demon triumphing in the mischief which it had done  this you will observe was one of those rare cases which yet will occasionally happen where commonsense finds itself at fault the remarkable story of the snowimage though to that sagacious class of people to whom good mr lindsey belongs it may seem but a childish affair is nevertheless capable of being moralized in various methods greatly for their edification one of its lessons for instance might be that it behooves men and especially men of benevolence to consider well what they are about and before acting on their philanthropic purposes to be quite sure that they comprehend the nature and all the relations of the business in hand what has been established as an element of good to one being may prove absolute mischief to another even as the warmth of the parlor was proper enough for children of flesh and blood like violet and peonythough by no means very wholesome even for thembut involved nothing short of annihilation to the unfortunate snowimage  but after all there is no teaching any thing to wise men of good mr lindseys stamp they know every thingoh to be sureevery thing that has been and every thing that is and every thing that by any future possibility can be and should some phenomenon of nature or providence transcend their system they will not recognize it even if it come to pass under their very noses  wife said mr lindsey after a fit of silence see what a quantity of snow the children have brought in on their feet it has made quite a puddle here before the stove pray tell dora to bring some towels and sop it up
