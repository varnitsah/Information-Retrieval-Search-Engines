22406350	the gift of the magi  by o henry     one dollar and eightyseven cents that was all and sixty cents of it was in pennies pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until ones cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied three times della counted it one dollar and eightyseven cents and the next day would be christmas  there was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl so della did it which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating  while the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second take a look at the home a furnished flat at 8 per week it did not exactly beggar description but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad  in the vestibule below was a letterbox into which no letter would go and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name mr  james dillingham young  the dillingham had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid 30 per week now when the income was shrunk to 20 though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming d but whenever mr james dillingham young came home and reached his flat above he was called jim and greatly hugged by mrs james dillingham young already introduced to you as della which is all very good  della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag she stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard tomorrow would be christmas day and she had only 187 with which to buy jim a present she had been saving every penny she could for months with this result  twenty dollars a week doesnt go far expenses had been greater than she had calculated they always are only 187 to buy a present for jim her jim many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him something fine and rare and sterlingsomething just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by jim  there was a pierglass between the windows of the room perhaps you have seen a pierglass in an 8 flat a very thin and very agile person may by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks  della being slender had mastered the art  suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass  her eyes were shining brilliantly but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length  now there were two possessions of the james dillingham youngs in which they both took a mighty pride one was jims gold watch that had been his fathers and his grandfathers the other was dellas hair had the queen of sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate her majestys jewels and gifts had king solomon been the janitor with all his treasures piled up in the basement jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed just to see him pluck at his beard from envy  so now dellas beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters it reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her and then she did it up again nervously and quickly once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet  on went her old brown jacket on went her old brown hat with a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street  where she stopped the sign read mne sofronie hair goods of all kinds one flight up della ran and collected herself panting madame large too white chilly hardly looked the sofronie  will you buy my hair asked della  i buy hair said madame take yer hat off and lets have a sight at the looks of it  down rippled the brown cascade  twenty dollars said madame lifting the mass with a practised hand  give it to me quick said della  oh and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings forget the hashed metaphor she was ransacking the stores for jims present  she found it at last it surely had been made for jim and no one else there was no other like it in any of the stores and she had turned all of them inside out it was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentationas all good things should do it was even worthy of the watch as soon as she saw it she knew that it must be jims it was like him quietness and valuethe description applied to both twentyone dollars they took from her for it and she hurried home with the 87 cents with that chain on his watch jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company  grand as the watch was he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain  when della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason she got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love which is always a tremendous task dear friendsa mammoth task  within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny closelying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy she looked at her reflection in the mirror long carefully and critically  if jim doesnt kill me she said to herself before he takes a second look at me hell say i look like a coney island chorus girl but what could i dooh what could i do with a dollar and eightyseven cents  at 7 oclock the coffee was made and the fryingpan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops  jim was never late della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered then she heard his step  on the stair away down on the first flight and she turned white for just a moment she had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things and now she whispered please god make him think i am still pretty  the door opened and jim stepped in and closed it he looked thin and very serious poor fellow he was only twentytwoand to be burdened with a family he needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves  jim stopped inside the door as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail his eyes were fixed upon della and there was an expression in them that she could not read and it terrified her it was not anger nor surprise nor disapproval nor horror nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for he simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face  della wriggled off the table and went for him  jim darling she cried dont look at me that way i had my hair cut off and sold because i couldnt have lived through christmas without giving you a present itll grow out againyou wont mind will you i just had to do it my hair grows awfully fast say merry christmas jim and lets be happy you dont know what a nicewhat a beautiful nice gift ive got for you  youve cut off your hair asked jim laboriously as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor  cut it off and sold it said della dont you like me just as well anyhow im me without my hair aint i  jim looked about the room curiously  you say your hair is gone he said with an air almost of idiocy  you neednt look for it said della its sold i tell yousold and gone too its christmas eve boy be good to me for it went for you maybe the hairs of my head were numbered she went on with sudden serious sweetness but nobody could ever count my love for you  shall i put the chops on jim  out of his trance jim seemed quickly to wake he enfolded his della for ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction eight dollars a week or a million a yearwhat is the difference a mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer the magi brought valuable gifts but that was not among them this dark assertion will be illuminated later on  jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table  dont make any mistake dell he said about me i dont think theres anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less but if youll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first  white fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper and then an ecstatic scream of joy and then alas a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat  for there lay the combsthe set of combs side and back that della had worshipped long in a broadway window beautiful combs pure tortoise shell with jewelled rimsjust the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair they were expensive combs she knew and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession and now they were hers but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone  but she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jim  and then della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh oh  jim had not yet seen his beautiful present she held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm the dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit  isnt it a dandy jim i hunted all over town to find it youll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now give me your watch  i want to see how it looks on it  instead of obeying jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled  dell said he lets put our christmas presents away and keep em a while theyre too nice to use just at present i sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs and now suppose you put the chops on  the magi as you know were wise menwonderfully wise menwho brought gifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of giving christmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication and here i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house  but in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisest everywhere they are wisest they are the magi
