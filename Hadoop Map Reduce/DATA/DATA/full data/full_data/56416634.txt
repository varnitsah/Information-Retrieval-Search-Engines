to the dark lady of the sonnets     how the play came to be written  i had better explain why in this little piece doccasion written for a performance in aid of the funds of the project for establishing a national theatre as a memorial to shakespear i have identified the dark lady with mistress mary fitton  first let me say that i do not contend that the dark lady was mary fitton because when the case in marys favor or against her if you please to consider that the dark lady was no better than she ought to have been was complete a portrait of mary came to light and turned out to be that of a fair lady not of a dark one  that settles the question if the portrait is authentic which i see no reason to doubt and the ladys hair undyed which is perhaps less certain  shakespear rubbed in the ladys complexion in his sonnets mercilessly for in his day black hair was as unpopular as red hair was in the early days of queen victoria  any tinge lighter than raven black must be held fatal to the strongest claim to be the dark lady  and so unless it can be shewn that shakespears sonnets exasperated mary fitton into dyeing her hair and getting painted in false colors i must give up all pretence that my play is historical  the later suggestion of mr acheson that the dark lady far from being a maid of honor kept a tavern in oxford and was the mother of davenant the poet is the one i should have adopted had i wished to be up to date  why then did i introduce the dark lady as mistress fitton  well i had two reasons  the play was not to have been written by me at all but by mrs alfred lyttelton and it was she who suggested a scene of jealousy between queen elizabeth and the dark lady at the expense of the unfortunate bard  now this if the dark lady was a maid of honor was quite easy  if she were a tavern landlady it would have strained all probability  so i stuck to mary fitton  but i had another and more personal reason  i was in a manner present at the birth of the fitton theory  its parent and i had become acquainted and he used to consult me on obscure passages in the sonnets on which as far as i can remember i never succeeded in throwing the faintest light at a time when nobody else thought my opinion on that or any other subject of the slightest importance  i thought it would be friendly to immortalize him as the silly literary saying is much as shakespear immortalized mr w h as he said he would simply by writing about him  let me tell the story formally     thomas tyler  throughout the eighties at least and probably for some years before the british museum reading room was used daily by a gentleman of such astonishing and crushing ugliness that no one who had once seen him could ever thereafter forget him  he was of fair complexion rather golden red than sandy aged between fortyfive and sixty and dressed in frock coat and tall hat of presentable but never new appearance his figure was rectangular waistless neckless ankleless of middle height looking shortish because though he was not particularly stout there was nothing slender about him  his ugliness was not unamiable it was accidental external excrescential  attached to his face from the left ear to the point of his chin was a monstrous goitre which hung down to his collar bone and was very inadequately balanced by a smaller one on his right eyelid  natures malice was so overdone in his case that it somehow failed to produce the effect of repulsion it seemed to have aimed at  when you first met thomas tyler you could think of nothing else but whether surgery could really do nothing for him  but after a very brief acquaintance you never thought of his disfigurements at all and talked to him as you might to romeo or lovelace only so many people especially women would not risk the preliminary ordeal that he remained a man apart and a bachelor all his days  i am not to be frightened or prejudiced by a tumor and i struck up a cordial acquaintance with him in the course of which he kept me pretty closely on the track of his work at the museum in which i was then like himself a daily reader  he was by profession a man of letters of an uncommercial kind  he was a specialist in pessimism had made a translation of ecclesiastes of which eight copies a year were sold and followed up the pessimism of shakespear and swift with keen interest  he delighted in a hideous conception which he called the theory of the cycles according to which the history of mankind and the universe keeps eternally repeating itself without the slightest variation throughout all eternity so that he had lived and died and had his goitre before and would live and die and have it again and again and again  he liked to believe that nothing that happened to him was completely novel  he was persuaded that he often had some recollection of its previous occurrence in the last cycle  he hunted out allusions to this favorite theory in his three favorite pessimists  he tried his hand occasionally at deciphering ancient inscriptions reading them as people seem to read the stars by discovering bears and bulls and swords and goats where as it seems to me no sane human being can see anything but stars higgledypiggledy  next to the translation of ecclesiastes his magnum opus was his work on shakespears sonnets in which he accepted a previous identification of mr w h the onlie begetter of the sonnets with the earl of pembroke william herbert and promulgated his own identification of mistress mary fitton with the dark lady  whether he was right or wrong about the dark lady did not matter urgently to me  she might have been maria tompkins for all i cared  but tyler would have it that she was mary fitton and he tracked mary down from the first of her marriages in her teens to her tomb in cheshire whither he made a pilgrimage and whence returned in triumph with a picture of her statue and the news that he was convinced she was a dark lady by traces of paint still discernible  in due course he published his edition of the sonnets with the evidence he had collected  he lent me a copy of the book which i never returned  but i reviewed it in the pall mall gazette on the 7th of january 1886 and thereby let loose the fitton theory in a wider circle of readers than the book could reach  then tyler died sinking unnoted like a stone in the sea  i observed that mr acheson mrs davenants champion calls him reverend  it may very well be that he got his knowledge of hebrew in reading for the church and there was always something of the clergyman or the schoolmaster in his dress and air  possibly he may actually have been ordained  but he never told me that or anything else about his affairs and his black pessimism would have shot him violently out of any church at present established in the west  we never talked about affairs  we talked about shakespear and the dark lady and swift and koheleth and the cycles and the mysterious moments when a feeling came over us that this had happened to us before and about the forgeries of the pentateuch which were offered for sale to the british museum and about literature and things of the spirit generally  he always came to my desk at the museum and spoke to me about something or other no doubt finding that people who were keen on this sort of conversation were rather scarce  he remains a vivid spot of memory in the void of my forgetfulness a quite considerable and dignified soul in a grotesquely disfigured body     frank harris  to the review in the pall mall gazette i attribute rightly or wrongly the introduction of mary fitton to mr frank harris  my reason for this is that mr harris wrote a play about shakespear and mary fitton and when i as a pious duty to tylers ghost reminded the world that it was to tyler we owed the fitton theory frank harris who clearly had not a notion of what had first put mary into his head believed i think that i had invented tyler expressly for his discomfiture for the stress i laid on tylers claims must have seemed unaccountable and perhaps malicious on the assumption that he was to me a mere name among the thousands of names in the british museum catalogue  therefore i make it clear that i had and have personal reasons for remembering tyler and for regarding myself as in some sort charged with the duty of reminding the world of his work  i am sorry for his sake that marys portrait is fair and that mr w h has veered round again from pembroke to southampton but even so his work was not wasted  it is by exhausting all the hypotheses that we reach the verifiable one and after all the wrong road always leads somewhere  frank harriss play was written long before mine  i read it in manuscript before the shakespear memorial national theatre was mooted and if there is anything except the fitton theory which is tylers property in my play which is also in mr harriss it was i who annexed it from him and not he from me  it does not matter anyhow because this play of mine is a brief trifle and full of manifest impossibilities at that whilst mr harriss play is serious both in size intention and quality  but there could not in the nature of things be much resemblance because frank conceives shakespear to have been a brokenhearted melancholy enormously sentimental person whereas i am convinced that he was very like myself  in fact if i had been born in 1556 instead of in 1856 i should have taken to blank verse and given shakespear a harder run for his money than all the other elizabethans put together  yet the success of frank harriss book on shakespear gave me great delight  to those who know the literary world of london there was a sharp stroke of ironic comedy in the irresistible verdict in its favor  in critical literature there is one prize that is always open to competition one blue ribbon that always carries the highest critical rank with it  to win you must write the best book of your generation on shakespear  it is felt on all sides that to do this a certain fastidious refinement a delicacy of taste a correctness of manner and tone and high academic distinction in addition to the indispensable scholarship and literary reputation are needed and men who pretend to these qualifications are constantly looked to with a gentle expectation that presently they will achieve the great feat now if there is a man on earth who is the utter contrary of everything that this description implies whose very existence is an insult to the ideal it realizes whose eye disparages whose resonant voice denounces whose cold shoulder jostles every decency every delicacy every amenity every dignity every sweet usage of that quiet life of mutual admiration in which perfect shakespearian appreciation is expected to arise that man is frank harris  here is one who is extraordinarily qualified by a range of sympathy and understanding that extends from the ribaldry of a buccaneer to the shyest tendernesses of the most sensitive poetry to be all things to all men yet whose proud humor it is to be to every man provided the man is eminent and pretentious the champion of his enemies  to the archbishop he is an atheist to the atheist a catholic mystic to the bismarckian imperialist an anacharsis klootz to anacharsis klootz a washington to mrs proudie a don juan to aspasia a john knox  in short to everyone his complement rather than his counterpart his antagonist rather than his fellowcreature  always provided however that the persons thus confronted are respectable persons  sophie perovskaia who perished on the scaffold for blowing alexander ii to fragments may perhaps have echoed hamlets       oh god horatio what a wounded name      things standing thus unknowni leave behind  but frank harris in his sonia has rescued her from that injustice and enshrined her among the saints  he has lifted the chicago anarchists out of their infamy and shewn that compared with the capitalism that killed them they were heroes and martyrs  he has done this with the most unusual power of conviction  the story as he tells it inevitably and irresistibly displaces all the vulgar mean purblind spiteful versions  there is a precise realism and an unsmiling measured determined sincerity which gives a strange dignity to the work of one whose fixed practice and ungovernable impulse it is to kick conventional dignity whenever he sees it     harris durch mitleid wissend  frank harris is everything except a humorist not apparently from stupidity but because scorn overcomes humor in him  nobody ever dreamt of reproaching miltons lucifer for not seeing the comic side of his fall and nobody who has read mr harriss stories desires to have them lightened by chapters from the hand of artemus ward  yet he knows the taste and the value of humor  he was one of the few men of letters who really appreciated oscar wilde though he did not rally fiercely to wildes side until the world deserted oscar in his ruin i myself was present at a curious meeting between the two when harris on the eve of the queensberry trial prophesied to wilde with miraculous precision exactly what immediately afterwards happened to him and warned him to leave the country  it was the first time within my knowledge that such a forecast proved true  wilde though under no illusion as to the folly of the quite unselfish suitatlaw he had been persuaded to begin nevertheless so miscalculated the force of the social vengeance he was unloosing on himself that he fancied it could be stayed by putting up the editor of the saturday review as mr harris then was to declare that he considered dorian grey a highly moral book which it certainly is  when harris foretold him the truth wilde denounced him as a fainthearted friend who was failing him in his hour of need and left the room in anger  harriss idiosyncratic power of pity saved him from feeling or shewing the smallest resentment and events presently proved to wilde how insanely he had been advised in taking the action and how accurately harris had gauged the situation  the same capacity for pity governs harriss study of shakespear whom as i have said he pities too much but that he is not insensible to humor is shewn not only by his appreciation of wilde but by the fact that the group of contributors who made his editorship of the saturday review so remarkable and of whom i speak none the less highly because i happened to be one of them myself were all in their various ways humorists     sidneys sister  pembrokes mother  and now to return to shakespear  though mr harris followed tyler in identifying mary fitton as the dark lady and the earl of pembroke as the addressee of the other sonnets and the man who made love successfully to shakespears mistress he very characteristically refuses to follow tyler on one point though for the life of me i cannot remember whether it was one of the surmises which tyler published or only one which he submitted to me to see what i would say about it just as he used to submit difficult lines from the sonnets  this surmise was that sidneys sister  pembrokes mother set shakespear on to persuade pembroke to marry and that this was the explanation of those earlier sonnets which so persistently and unnaturally urged matrimony on mr w h  i take this to be one of the brightest of tylers ideas because the persuasions in the sonnets are unaccountable and out of character unless they were offered to please somebody whom shakespear desired to please and who took a motherly interest in pembroke  there is a further temptation in the theory for me  the most charming of all shakespears old women indeed the most charming of all his women young or old is the countess of rousillon in alls well that ends well  it has a certain individuality among them which suggests a portrait  mr harris will have it that all shakespears nice old women are drawn from his beloved mother but i see no evidence whatever that shakespears mother was a particularly nice woman or that he was particularly fond of her  that she was a simple incarnation of extravagant maternal pride like the mother of coriolanus in plutarch as mr harris asserts i cannot believe  she is quite as likely to have borne her son a grudge for becoming one of these harlotry players and disgracing the ardens  anyhow as a conjectural model for the countess of rousillon i prefer that one of whom jonson wrote       sidneys sister  pembrokes mother      death  ere thou has slain another      learnd and fair and good as she      time shall throw a dart at thee  but frank will not have her at any price because his ideal shakespear is rather like a sailor in a melodrama and a sailor in a melodrama must adore his mother  i do not at all belittle such sailors  they are the emblems of human generosity but shakespear was not an emblem he was a man and the author of hamlet who had no illusions about his mother  in weak moments one almost wishes he had     shakespears social standing  on the vexed question of shakespears social standing mr harris says that shakespear had not had the advantage of a middleclass training  i suggest that shakespear missed this questionable advantage not because he was socially too low to have attained to it but because he conceived himself as belonging to the upper class from which our public school boys are now drawn  let mr harris survey for a moment the field of contemporary journalism  he will see there some men who have the very characteristics from which he infers that shakespear was at a social disadvantage through his lack of middleclass training  they are rowdy illmannered abusive mischievous fond of quoting obscene schoolboy anecdotes adepts in that sort of blackmail which consists in mercilessly libelling and insulting every writer whose opinions are sufficiently heterodox to make it almost impossible for him to risk perhaps five years of a slender income by an appeal to a prejudiced orthodox jury and they see nothing in all this cruel blackguardism but an uproariously jolly rag although they are by no means without genuine literary ability a love of letters and even some artistic conscience  but he will find not one of the models of his type i say nothing of mere imitators of it below the rank that looks at the middle class not humbly and enviously from below but insolently from above  mr harris himself notes shakespears contempt for the tradesman and mechanic and his incorrigible addiction to smutty jokes  he does us the public service of sweeping away the familiar plea of the bardolatrous ignoramus that shakespears coarseness was part of the manners of his time putting his pen with precision on the one name spenser that is necessary to expose such a libel on elizabethan decency  there was nothing whatever to prevent shakespear from being as decent as more was before him or bunyan after him and as selfrespecting as raleigh or sidney except the tradition of his class in which education or statesmanship may no doubt be acquired by those who have a turn for them but in which insolence derision profligacy obscene jesting debt contracting and rowdy mischievousness give continual scandal to the pious serious industrious solvent bourgeois  no other class is infatuated enough to believe that gentlemen are born and not made by a very elaborate process of culture  even kings are taught and coached and drilled from their earliest boyhood to play their part  but the man of family i am convinced that shakespear took that view of himself will plunge into society without a lesson in table manners into politics without a lesson in history into the city without a lesson in business and into the army without a lesson in honor  it has been said with the object of proving shakespear a laborer that he could hardly write his name  why  because he had not the advantage of a middleclass training  shakespear himself tells us through hamlet that gentlemen purposely wrote badly lest they should be mistaken for scriveners but most of them then as now wrote badly because they could not write any better  in short the whole range of shakespears foibles  the snobbishness the naughtiness the contempt for tradesmen and mechanics the assumption that witty conversation can only mean smutty conversation the flunkeyism towards social superiors and insolence towards social inferiors the easy ways with servants which is seen not only between the two gentlemen of verona and their valets but in the affection and respect inspired by a great servant like adam  all these are the characteristics of eton and harrow not of the public elementary or private adventure school they prove as everything we know about shakespear suggests that he thought of the shakespears and ardens as families of consequence and regarded himself as a gentleman under a cloud through his fathers ill luck in business and never for a moment as a man of the people  this is at once the explanation of and excuse for his snobbery  he was not a parvenu trying to cover his humble origin with a purchased coat of arms  he was a gentleman resuming what he conceived to be his natural position as soon as he gained the means to keep it up     this side idolatry  there is another matter which i think mr harris should ponder  he says that shakespear was but little esteemed by his own generation he even describes jonsons description of his little latin and less greek as a sneer whereas it occurs in an unmistakably sincere eulogy of shakespear written after his death and is clearly meant to heighten the impression of shakespears prodigious natural endowments by pointing out that they were not due to scholastic acquirements now there is a sense in which it is true enough that shakespear was too little esteemed by his own generation or for the matter of that by any subsequent generation  the bargees on the regents canal do not chant shakespears verses as the gondoliers in venice are said to chant the verses of tasso a practice which was suspended for some reason during my stay in venice  at least no gondolier ever did it in my hearing  shakespear is no more a popular author than rodin is a popular sculptor or richard strauss a popular composer  but shakespear was certainly not such a fool as to expect the toms dicks and harrys of his time to be any more interested in dramatic poetry than newton later on expected them to be interested in fluxions and when we come to the question whether shakespear missed that assurance which all great men have had from the more capable and susceptible members of their generation that they were great men ben jonsons evidence disposes of so improbable a notion at once and for ever  i loved the man says ben this side idolatry as well as any  now why in the name of common sense should he have made that qualification unless there had been not only idolatry but idolatry fulsome enough to irritate jonson into an express disavowal of it jonson the bricklayer must have felt sore sometimes when shakespear spoke and wrote of bricklayers as his inferiors  he must have felt it a little hard that being a better scholar and perhaps a braver and tougher man physically than shakespear he was not so successful or so well liked  but in spite of this he praised shakespear to the utmost stretch of his powers of eulogy  in fact notwithstanding his disclaimer he did not stop this side idolatry  if therefore even jonson felt himself forced to clear himself of extravagance and absurdity in his appreciation of shakespear there must have been many people about who idolized shakespear as american ladies idolize paderewski and who carried bardolatry even in the bards own time to an extent that threatened to make his reasonable admirers ridiculous     shakespears pessimism  i submit to mr harris that by ruling out this idolatry and its possible effect in making shakespear think that his public would stand anything from him he has ruled out a far more plausible explanation of the faults of such a play as timon of athens than his theory that shakespears passion for the dark lady cankered and took on proud flesh in him and tortured him to nervous breakdown and madness  in timon the intellectual bankruptcy is obvious enough  shakespear tried once too often to make a play out of the cheap pessimism which is thrown into despair by a comparison of actual human nature with theoretical morality actual law and administration with abstract justice and so forth  but shakespears perception of the fact that all men judged by the moral standard which they apply to others and by which they justify their punishment of others are fools and scoundrels does not date from the dark lady complication  he seems to have been born with it  if in the comedy of errors and a midsummer nights dream the persons of the drama are not quite so ready for treachery and murder as laertes and even hamlet himself not to mention the procession of ruffians who pass through the latest plays it is certainly not because they have any more regard for law or religion  there is only one place in shakespears plays where the sense of shame is used as a human attribute and that is where hamlet is ashamed not of anything he himself has done but of his mothers relations with his uncle  this scene is an unnatural one  the sons reproaches to his mother even the fact of his being able to discuss the subject with her is more repulsive than her relations with her deceased husbands brother  here too shakespear betrays for once his religious sense by making hamlet in his agony of shame declare that his mothers conduct makes sweet religion a rhapsody of words  but for that passage we might almost suppose that the feeling of sunday morning in the country which orlando describes so perfectly in as you like it was the beginning and end of shakespears notion of religion  i say almost because isabella in measure for measure has religious charm in spite of the conventional theatrical assumption that female religion means an inhumanly ferocious chastity  but for the most part shakespear differentiates his heroes from his villains much more by what they do than by what they are  don john in much ado is a true villain  a man with a malicious will but he is too dull a duffer to be of any use in a leading part and when we come to the great villains like macbeth we find as mr harris points out that they are precisely identical with the heroes  macbeth is only hamlet incongruously committing murders and engaging in handtohand combats  and hamlet who does not dream of apologizing for the three murders he commits is always apologizing because he has not yet committed a fourth and finds to his great bewilderment that he does not want to commit it  it cannot be he says but i am pigeonlivered and lack gall to make oppression bitter else ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slaves offal  really one is tempted to suspect that when shylock asks hates any man the thing he would not kill he is expressing the natural and proper sentiments of the human race as shakespear understood them and not the vindictiveness of a stage jew     gaiety of genius  in view of these facts it is dangerous to cite shakespears pessimism as evidence of the despair of a heart broken by the dark lady  there is an irrepressible gaiety of genius which enables it to bear the whole weight of the worlds misery without blenching  there is a laugh always ready to avenge its tears of discouragement  in the lines which mr harris quotes only to declare that he can make nothing of them and to condemn them as out of character richard iii immediately after pitying himself because       there is no creature loves me      and if i die no soul will pity me  adds with a grin       nay wherefore should they since that i myself      find in myself no pity for myself  let me again remind mr harris of oscar wilde  we all dreaded to read de profundis  our instinct was to stop our ears or run away from the wail of a broken though by no means contrite heart  but we were throwing away our pity  de profundis was de profundis indeed  wilde was too good a dramatist to throw away so powerful an effect but none the less it was de profundis in excelsis  there was more laughter between the lines of that book than in a thousand farces by men of no genius  wilde like richard and shakespear found in himself no pity for himself  there is nothing that marks the born dramatist more unmistakably than this discovery of comedy in his own misfortunes almost in proportion to the pathos with which the ordinary man announces their tragedy  i cannot for the life of me see the broken heart in shakespears latest works  hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings is not the lyric of a broken man nor is clotens comment that if imogen does not appreciate it it is a vice in her ears which horse hairs and cats guts and the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot can never amend the sally of a saddened one  is it not clear that to the last there was in shakespear an incorrigible divine levity an inexhaustible joy that derided sorrow  think of the poor dark lady having to stand up to this unbearable power of extracting a grim fun from everything  mr harris writes as if shakespear did all the suffering and the dark lady all the cruelty  but why does he not put himself in the dark ladys place for a moment as he has put himself so successfully in shakespears  imagine her reading the hundred and thirtieth sonnet       my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun      coral is far more red than her lips red      if snow be white why then her breasts are dun      if hairs be wire black wires grow on her head      i have seen roses damasked red and white      but no such roses see i in her cheeks      and in some perfumes is there more delight      than in the breath that from my mistress reeks      i love to hear her speak yet well i know      that music hath a far more pleasing sound      i grant i never saw a goddess go      my mistress when she walks treads on the ground           and yet by heaven i think my love as rare           as any she belied with false compare  take this as a sample of the sort of compliment from which she was never for a moment safe with shakespear  bear in mind that she was not a comedian that the elizabethan fashion of treating brunettes as ugly woman must have made her rather sore on the subject of her complexion that no human being male or female can conceivably enjoy being chaffed on that point in the fourth couplet about the perfumes that shakespears revulsions as the sonnet immediately preceding shews were as violent as his ardors and were expressed with the realistic power and horror that makes hamlet say that the heavens got sick when they saw the queens conduct and then ask mr harris whether any woman could have stood it for long or have thought the sugred compliment worth the cruel wounds the cleaving of the heart in twain that seemed to shakespear as natural and amusing a reaction as the burlesquing of his heroics by pistol his sermons by falstaff and his poems by cloten and touchstone     jupiter and semele  this does not mean that shakespear was cruel  evidently he was not but it was not cruelty that made jupiter reduce semele to ashes  it was the fact that he could not help being a god nor she help being a mortal  the one thing shakespears passion for the dark lady was not was what mr harris in one passage calls it  idolatrous  if it had been she might have been able to stand it  the man who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves is tolerable even by a spoilt and tyrannical mistress but what woman could possibly endure a man who dotes without doubting who knows and who is hugely amused at the absurdity of his infatuation for a woman of whose mortal imperfections not one escapes him  a man always exchanging grins with yoricks skull and inviting my lady to laugh at the sepulchral humor of the fact that though she paint an inch thick which the dark lady may have done to yoricks favor she must come at last  to the dark lady he must sometimes have seemed cruel beyond description  an intellectual caliban  true a caliban who could say       be not afeard  the isle is full of noises      sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not      sometimes a thousand twangling instruments      will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices      that if i then had waked after long sleep      will make me sleep again and then in dreaming      the clouds methought would open and shew riches      ready to drop on me  that when i wakd      i cried to dream again  which is very lovely but the dark lady may have had that vice in her ears which cloten dreaded  she may not have seen the beauty of it whereas there can be no doubt at all that of my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun c not a word was lost on her  and is it to be supposed that shakespear was too stupid or too modest not to see at last that it was a case of jupiter and semele shakespear was most certainly not modest in that sense  the timid cough of the minor poet was never heard from him       not marble nor the gilded monuments      of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme  is only one out of a dozen passages in which he possibly with a keen sense of the fun of scandalizing the modest coughers proclaimed his place and his power in the wide world dreaming of things to come the dark lady most likely thought this side of him insufferably conceited for there is no reason to suppose that she liked his plays any better than minna wagner liked richards music dramas  as likely as not she thought the spanish tragedy worth six hamlets  he was not stupid either  if his class limitations and a profession that cut him off from actual participation in great affairs of state had not confined his opportunities of intellectual and political training to private conversation and to the mermaid tavern he would probably have become one of the ablest men of his time instead of being merely its ablest playwright  one might surmise that shakespear found out that the dark ladys brains could no more keep pace with his than anne hathaways if there were any evidence that their friendship ceased when he stopped writing sonnets to her  as a matter of fact the consolidation of a passion into an enduring intimacy generally puts an end to sonnets  that the dark lady broke shakespears heart as mr harris will have it she did is an extremely unshakespearian hypothesis  men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love says rosalind  richard of gloster into whom shakespear put all his own impish superiority to vulgar sentiment exclaims       and this word love which greybeards call divine      be resident in men like one another      and not in me  i am myself alone  hamlet has not a tear for ophelia  her death moves him to fierce disgust for the sentimentality of laertes by her grave and when he discusses the scene with horatio immediately after he utterly forgets her though he is sorry he forgot himself and jumps at the proposal of a fencing match to finish the day with  as against this view mr harris pleads romeo orsino and even antonio and he does it so penetratingly that he convinces you that shakespear did betray himself again and again in these characters but selfbetrayal is one thing and selfportrayal as in hamlet and mercutio is another  shakespear never saw himself as actors say in romeo or orsino or antonio  in mr harriss own play shakespear is presented with the most pathetic tenderness  he is tragic bitter pitiable wretched and broken among a robust crowd of jonsons and elizabeths but to me he is not shakespear because i miss the shakespearian irony and the shakespearian gaiety  take these away and shakespear is no longer shakespear  all the bite the impetus the strength the grim delight in his own power of looking terrible facts in the face with a chuckle is gone and you have nothing left but that most depressing of all things  a victim  now who can think of shakespear as a man with a grievance  even in that most thoroughgoing and inspired of all shakespears loves  his love of music which mr harris has been the first to appreciate at anything like its value there is a dash of mockery  spit in the hole man and tune again  divine air  now is his soul ravished  is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale the souls out of mens bodies  an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him  there is just as much shakespear here as in the inevitable quotation about the sweet south and the bank of violets  i lay stress on this irony of shakespears this impish rejoicing in pessimism this exultation in what breaks the hearts of common men not only because it is diagnostic of that immense energy of life which we call genius but because its omission is the one glaring defect in mr harriss otherwise extraordinarily penetrating book  fortunately it is an omission that does not disable the book as in my judgment it disabled the hero of the play because mr harris left himself out of his play whereas he pervades his book mordant deepvoiced and with an unconquerable style which is the man     the idol of the bardolaters  there is even an advantage in having a book on shakespear with the shakespearian irony left out of account  i do not say that the missing chapter should not be added in the next edition  the hiatus is too great  it leaves the reader too uneasy before this touching picture of a writhing worm substituted for the invulnerable giant but it is none the less probable that in no other way could mr harris have got at his man as he has  for after all what is the secret of the hopeless failure of the academic bardolaters to give us a credible or even interesting shakespear and the easy triumph of mr harris in giving us both  simply that mr harris has assumed that he was dealing with a man whilst the others have assumed that they were writing about a god and have therefore rejected every consideration of fact tradition or interpretation that pointed to any human imperfection in their hero  they thus leave themselves with so little material that they are forced to begin by saying that we know very little about shakespear  as a matter of fact with the plays and sonnets in our hands we know much more about shakespear than we know about dickens or thackeray  the only difficulty is that we deliberately suppress it because it proves that shakespear was not only very unlike the conception of a god current in clapham but was not according to the same reckoning even a respectable man  the academic view starts with a shakespear who was not scurrilous therefore the verses about lousy lucy cannot have been written by him and the cognate passages in the plays are either strokes of characterdrawing or gags interpolated by the actors  this ideal shakespear was too well behaved to get drunk therefore the tradition that his death was hastened by a drinking bout with jonson and drayton must be rejected and the remorse of cassio treated as a thing observed not experienced  nay the disgust of hamlet at the drinking customs of denmark is taken to establish shakespear as the superior of alexander in selfcontrol and the greatest of teetotallers  now this system of inventing your great man to start with and then rejecting all the materials that do not fit him with the ridiculous result that you have to declare that there are no materials at all with your wastepaper basket full of them ends in leaving shakespear with a much worse character than he deserves  for though it does not greatly matter whether he wrote the lousy lucy lines or not and does not really matter at all whether he got drunk when he made a night of it with jonson and drayton the sonnets raise an unpleasant question which does matter a good deal and the refusal of the academic bardolaters to discuss or even mention this question has had the effect of producing a silent verdict against shakespear  mr harris tackles the question openly and has no difficulty whatever in convincing us that shakespear was a man of normal constitution sexually and was not the victim of that most cruel and pitiable of all the freaks of nature  the freak which transposes the normal aim of the affections  silence on this point means condemnation and the condemnation has been general throughout the present generation though it only needed mr harriss fearless handling of the matter to sweep away what is nothing but a morbid and very disagreeable modern fashion  there is always some stock accusation brought against eminent persons  when i was a boy every wellknown man was accused of beating his wife  later on for some unexplained reason he was accused of psychopathic derangement  and this fashion is retrospective  the cases of shakespear and michel angelo are cited as proving that every genius of the first magnitude was a sufferer and both here and in germany there are circles in which such derangement is grotesquely reverenced as part of the stigmata of heroic powers all of which is gross nonsense  unfortunately in shakespears case prudery which cannot prevent the accusation from being whispered does prevent the refutation from being shouted  mr harris the deepvoiced refuses to be silenced  he dismisses with proper contempt the stupidity which places an outrageous construction on shakespears apologies in the sonnets for neglecting that perfect ceremony of love which consists in returning calls and making protestations and giving presents and paying the trumpery attentions which men of genius always refuse to bother about and to which touchy people who have no genius attach so much importance  no leader who had not been tampered with by the psychopathic monomaniacs could ever put any construction but the obvious and innocent one on these passages  but the general vocabulary of the sonnets to pembroke or whoever mr w h really was is so overcharged according to modern ideas that a reply on the general case is necessary     shakespears alleged sycophancy and perversion  that reply which mr harris does not hesitate to give is twofold first that shakespear was in his attitude towards earls a sycophant and second that the normality of shakespears sexual constitution is only too well attested by the excessive susceptibility to the normal impulse shewn in the whole mass of his writings  this latter is the really conclusive reply  in the case of michel angelo for instance one must admit that if his works are set beside those of titian or paul veronese it is impossible not to be struck by the absence in the florentine of that susceptibility to feminine charm which pervades the pictures of the venetians  but as mr harris points out though he does not use this particular illustration paul veronese is an anchorite compared to shakespear  the language of the sonnets addressed to pembroke extravagant as it now seems is the language of compliment and fashion transfigured no doubt by shakespears verbal magic and hyperbolical as shakespear always seems to people who cannot conceive so vividly as he but still unmistakable for anything else than the expression of a friendship delicate enough to be wounded and a manly loyalty deep enough to be outraged  but the language of the sonnets to the dark lady is the language of passion  their cruelty shews it  there is no evidence that shakespear was capable of being unkind in cold blood  but in his revulsions from love he was bitter wounding even ferocious sparing neither himself nor the unfortunate woman whose only offence was that she had reduced the great man to the common human denominator  in seizing on these two points mr harris has made so sure a stroke and placed his evidence so featly that there is nothing left for me to do but to plead that the second is sounder than the first which is i think marked by the prevalent mistake as to shakespears social position or if you prefer it the confusion between his actual social position as a penniless tradesmans son taking to the theatre for a livelihood and his own conception of himself as a gentleman of good family  i am prepared to contend that though shakespear was undoubtedly sentimental in his expressions of devotion to mr w h even to a point which nowadays makes both ridiculous he was not sycophantic if mr w h was really attractive and promising and shakespear deeply attached to him  a sycophant does not tell his patron that his fame will survive not in the renown of his own actions but in the sonnets of his sycophant  a sycophant when his patron cuts him out in a love affair does not tell his patron exactly what he thinks of him  above all a sycophant does not write to his patron precisely as he feels on all occasions and this rare kind of sincerity is all over the sonnets  shakespear we are told was a very civil gentleman  this must mean that his desire to please people and be liked by them and his reluctance to hurt their feelings led him into amiable flattery even when his feelings were not strongly stirred  if this be taken into account along with the fact that shakespear conceived and expressed all his emotions with a vehemence that sometimes carried him into ludicrous extravagance making richard offer his kingdom for a horse and othello declare of cassio that       had all his hairs been lives my great revenge      had stomach for them all  we shall see more civility and hyperbole than sycophancy even in the earlier and more coldblooded sonnets     shakespear and democracy  now take the general case pled against shakespear as an enemy of democracy by tolstoy the late ernest crosbie and others and endorsed by mr harris  will it really stand fire  mr harris emphasizes the passages in which shakespear spoke of mechanics and even of small master tradesmen as base persons whose clothes were greasy whose breath was rank and whose political imbecility and caprice moved coriolanus to say to the roman radical who demanded at least good words from him       he that will give good words to thee will flatter      beneath abhorring  but let us be honest  as political sentiments these lines are an abomination to every democrat  but suppose they are not political sentiments  suppose they are merely a record of observed fact  john stuart mill told our british workmen that they were mostly liars carlyle told us all that we are mostly fools  matthew arnold and ruskin were more circumstantial and more abusive  everybody including the workers themselves know that they are dirty drunken foulmouthed ignorant gluttonous prejudiced  in short heirs to the peculiar ills of poverty and slavery as well as coheirs with the plutocracy to all the failings of human nature  even shelley admitted 200 years after shakespear wrote coriolanus that universal suffrage was out of the question  surely the real test not of democracy which was not a live political issue in shakespears time but of impartiality in judging classes which is what one demands from a great human poet is not that he should flatter the poor and denounce the rich but that he should weigh them both in the same balance  now whoever will read lear and measure for measure will find stamped on his mind such an appalled sense of the danger of dressing man in a little brief authority such a merciless stripping of the purple from the poor bare forked animal that calls itself a king and fancies itself a god that one wonders what was the real nature of the mysterious restraint that kept eliza and our james from teaching shakespear to be civil to crowned heads just as one wonders why tolstoy was allowed to go free when so many less terrible levellers went to the galleys or siberia  from the mature shakespear we get no such scenes of village snobbery as that between the stage country gentleman alexander iden and the stage radical jack cade  we get the shepherd in as you like it and many honest brave human and loyal servants beside the inevitable comic ones  even in the jingo play henry v we get bates and williams drawn with all respect and honor as normal rank and file men  in julius caesar shakespear went to work with a will when he took his cue from plutarch in glorifying regicide and transfiguring the republicans  indeed heroworshippers have never forgiven him for belittling caesar and failing to see that side of his assassination which made goethe denounce it as the most senseless of crimes  put the play beside the charles i of wills in which cromwell is written down to a point at which the jack cade of henry vi becomes a hero in comparison and then believe if you can that shakespear was one of them that crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning  think of rosencrantz guildenstern osric the fop who annoyed hotspur and a dozen passages concerning such people  if such evidence can prove anything and mr harris relies throughout on such evidence shakespear loathed courtiers  if on the other hand shakespears characters are mostly members of the leisured classes the same thing is true of mr harriss own plays and mine  industrial slavery is not compatible with that freedom of adventure that personal refinement and intellectual culture that scope of action which the higher and subtler drama demands  even cervantes had finally to drop don quixotes troubles with innkeepers demanding to be paid for his food and lodging and make him as free of economic difficulties as amadis de gaul  hamlets experiences simply could not have happened to a plumber  a poor man is useful on the stage only as a blind man is  to excite sympathy the poverty of the apothecary in romeo and juliet produces a great effect and even points the sound moral that a poor man cannot afford to have a conscience but if all the characters of the play had been as poor as he it would have been nothing but a melodrama of the sort that the sicilian players gave us here and that was not the best that lay in shakespears power  when poverty is abolished and leisure and grace of life become general the only plays surviving from our epoch which will have any relation to life as it will be lived then will be those in which none of the persons represented are troubled with want of money or wretched drudgery  our plays of poverty and squalor now the only ones that are true to the life of the majority of living men will then be classed with the records of misers and monsters and read only by historical students of social pathology  then consider shakespears kings and lords and gentlemen  would even john ball or jeremiah complain that they are flattered  surely a more mercilessly exposed string of scoundrels never crossed the stage  the very monarch who paralyzes a rebel by appealing to the divinity that hedges a king is a drunken and sensual assassin and is presently killed contemptuously before our eyes in spite of his hedge of divinity  i could write as convincing a chapter on shakespears dickensian prejudice against the throne and the nobility and gentry in general as mr harris or ernest crosbie on the other side  i could even go so far as to contend that one of shakespears defects is his lack of an intelligent comprehension of feudalism  he had of course no prevision of democratic collectivism  he was except in the commonplaces of war and patriotism a privateer through and through nobody in his plays whether king or citizen has any civil public business or conception of such a thing except in the method of appointing constables to the abuses in which he called attention quite in the vein of the fabian society  he was concerned about drunkenness and about the idolatry and hypocrisy of our judicial system but his implied remedy was personal sobriety and freedom from idolatrous illusion in so far as he had any remedy at all and did not merely despair of human nature  his first and last word on parliament was get thee glass eyes and like a scurvy politician seem to see the thing thou dost not  he had no notion of the feeling with which the land nationalizers of today regard the fact that he was a party to the enclosure of common lands at wellcome  the explanation is not a general deficiency in his mind but the simple fact that in his day what english land needed was individual appropriation and cultivation and what the english constitution needed was the incorporation of whig principles of individual liberty     shakespear and the british public  i have rejected mr harriss view that shakespear died brokenhearted of the pangs of love despised  i have given my reasons for believing that shakespear died game and indeed in a state of levity which would have been considered unbecoming in a bishop  but mr harriss evidence does prove that shakespear had a grievance and a very serious one  he might have been jilted by ten dark ladies and been none the worse for it but his treatment by the british public was another matter  the idolatry which exasperated ben jonson was by no means a popular movement and like all such idolatries it was excited by the magic of shakespears art rather than by his views  he was launched on his career as a successful playwright by the henry vi trilogy a work of no originality depth or subtlety except the originality depth and subtlety of the feelings and fancies of the common people  but shakespear was not satisfied with this  what is the use of being shakespear if you are not allowed to express any notions but those of autolycus  shakespear did not see the world as autolycus did  he saw it if not exactly as ibsen did for it was not quite the same world at least with much of ibsens power of penetrating its illusions and idolatries and with all swifts horror of its cruelty and uncleanliness  now it happens to some men with these powers that they are forced to impose their fullest exercise on the world because they cannot produce popular work  take wagner and ibsen for instance  their earlier works are no doubt much cheaper than their later ones still they were not popular when they were written  the alternative of doing popular work was never really open to them  had they stooped they would have picked up less than they snatched from above the peoples heads  but handel and shakespear were not held to their best in this way  they could turn out anything they were asked for and even heap up the measure  they reviled the british public and never forgave it for ignoring their best work and admiring their splendid commonplaces but they produced the commonplaces all the same and made them sound magnificent by mere brute faculty for their art  when shakespear was forced to write popular plays to save his theatre from ruin he did it mutinously calling the plays as you like it and much ado about nothing  all the same he did it so well that to this day these two genial vulgarities are the main shakespearian stockintrade of our theatres  later on burbages power and popularity as an actor enabled shakespear to free himself from the tyranny of the box office and to express himself more freely in plays consisting largely of monologue to be spoken by a great actor from whom the public would stand a good deal  the history of shakespears tragedies has thus been the history of a long line of famous actors from burbage and betterton to forbes robertson and the man of whom we are told that when he would have said that richard died and cried a horse a horse he burbage cried was the father of nine generations of shakespearian playgoers all speaking of garricks richard and keans othello and irvings shylock and forbes robertsons hamlet without knowing or caring how much these had to do with shakespears richard and othello and so forth  and the plays which were written without great and predominant parts such as troilus and cressida alls well that ends well and measure for measure have dropped on our stage as dead as the second part of goethes faust or ibsens emperor or galilean  here then shakespear had a real grievance and though it is a sentimental exaggeration to describe him as a brokenhearted man in the face of the passages of reckless jollity and serenely happy poetry in his latest plays yet the discovery that his most serious work could reach success only when carried on the back of a very fascinating actor who was enormously overcharging his part and that the serious plays which did not contain parts big enough to hold the overcharge were left on the shelf amply accounts for the evident fact that shakespear did not end his life in a glow of enthusiastic satisfaction with mankind and with the theatre which is all that mr harris can allege in support of his brokenheart theory  but even if shakespear had had no failures it was not possible for a man of his powers to observe the political and moral conduct of his contemporaries without perceiving that they were incapable of dealing with the problems raised by their own civilization and that their attempts to carry out the codes of law and to practise the religions offered to them by great prophets and lawgivers were and still are so foolish that we now call for the superman virtually a new species to rescue the world from mismanagement  this is the real sorrow of great men and in the face of it the notion that when a great man speaks bitterly or looks melancholy he must be troubled by a disappointment in love seems to me sentimental trifling  if i have carried the reader with me thus far he will find that trivial as this little play of mine is its sketch of shakespear is more complete than its levity suggests  alas its appeal for a national theatre as a monument to shakespear failed to touch the very stupid people who cannot see that a national theatre is worth having for the sake of the national soul  i had unfortunately represented shakespear as treasuring and using as i do myself the jewels of unconsciously musical speech which common people utter and throw away every day and this was taken as a disparagement of shakespears originality  why was i born with such contemporaries  why is shakespear made ridiculous by such a posterity    the dark lady of the sonnets was first performed at the haymarket theatre on the afternoon of thursday the 24th november 1910 by mona limerick as the dark lady suzanne sheldon as queen elizabeth granville barker as shakespear and hugh tabberer as the warder     the dark lady of the sonnets  fin de siecle 151600  midsummer night on the terrace of the palace at whitehall overlooking the thames  the palace clock

father  elizabeth         zounds  now by                     she stops to grind her teeth with rage  the dark lady     she will have me whipped through                     the streets  oh god  oh god  shakespear  learn to know yourself better madam  i am an honest gentleman of unquestioned parentage and have already sent in my demand for the coatofarms that is lawfully mine  can you say as much for yourself  elizabeth  almost beside herself  another word and i begin with mine own hands the work the hangman shall finish  shakespear  you are no true tudor  this baggage here has as good a right to your royal seat as you  what maintains you on the throne of england  is it your renowned wit your wisdom that sets at naught the craftiest statesmen of the christian world  no  tis the mere chance that might have happened to any milkmaid the caprice of nature that made you the most wondrous piece of beauty the age hath seen elizabeths raised fists on the point of striking him fall to her side  that is what hath brought all men to your feet and founded your throne on the impregnable rock of your proud heart a stony island in a sea of desire  there madam is some wholesome blunt honest speaking for you  now do your worst  elizabeth  with dignity  master shakespear  it is well for you that i am a merciful prince  i make allowance for your rustic ignorance  but remember that there are things which be true and are yet not seemly to be said i will not say to a queen for you will have it that i am none but to a virgin  shakespear  bluntly  it is no fault of mine that you are a virgin madam albeit tis my misfortune  the dark lady  terrified again  in mercy madam hold no further discourse with him  he hath ever some lewd jest on his tongue  you hear how he useth me calling me baggage and the like to your majestys face  elizabeth  as for you mistress i have yet to demand what your business is at this hour in this place and how you come to be so concerned with a player that you strike blindly at your sovereign in your jealousy of him  the dark lady  madam  as i live and hope for salvation  shakespear  sardonically  ha  the dark lady  angrilyay im as like to be saved as thou that believest naught save some black magic of words and versesi say madam as i am a living woman i came here to break with him for ever  oh madam if you would know what misery is listen to this man that is more than man and less at the same time  he will tie you down to anatomize your very soul  he will wring tears of blood from your humiliation and then he will heal the wound with flatteries that no woman can resist  shakespear  flatteries  kneeling  oh madam i put my case at your royal feet  i confess to much  i have a rude tongue  i am unmannerly  i blaspheme against the holiness of anointed royalty but oh my royal mistress am i a flatterer  elizabeth  i absolve you as to that  you are far too plain a dealer to please me  he rises gratefully  the dark lady  madam  he is flattering you even as he speaks  elizabeth  a terrible flash in her eye  ha  is it so  shakespear  madam  she is jealous and heaven help me not without reason  oh you say you are a merciful prince but that was cruel of you that hiding of your royal dignity when you found me here  for how can i ever be content with this blackhaired blackeyed blackavised devil again now that i have looked upon real beauty and real majesty  the dark lady  wounded and desperate  he hath swore to me ten times over that the day shall come in england when black women for all their foulness shall be more thought on than fair ones  to shakespear scolding at him  deny it if thou canst  oh he is compact of lies and scorns  i am tired of being tossed up to heaven and dragged down to hell at every whim that takes him  i am ashamed to my very soul that i have abased myself to love one that my father would not have deemed fit to hold my stirrupone that will talk to all the world about methat will put my love and my shame into his plays and make me blush for myself therethat will write sonnets about me that no man of gentle strain would put his hand to  i am all disordered  i know not what i am saying to your majesty  i am of all ladies most deject and wretched  shakespear  ha  at last sorrow hath struck a note of music out of thee  of all ladies most deject and wretched  he makes a note of it  the dark lady  madam  i implore you give me leave to go  i am distracted with grief and shame  i  elizabeth  go the dark lady tries to kiss her hand  no more go  the dark lady goes convulsed  you have been cruel to that poor fond wretch master shakespear  shakespear  i am not cruel madam but you know the fable of jupiter and semele  i could not help my lightnings scorching her  elizabeth  you have an overweening conceit of yourself sir that displeases your queen  shakespear  oh madam can i go about with the modest cough of a minor poet belittling my inspiration and making the mightiest wonder of your reign a thing of nought  i have said that not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive the words with which i make the world glorious or foolish at my will  besides i would have you think me great enough to grant me a boon  elizabeth  i hope it is a boon that may be asked of a virgin queen without offence sir  i mistrust your forwardness and i bid you remember that i do not suffer persons of your degree if i may say so without offence to your father the alderman to presume too far  shakespear  oh madam i shall not forget myself again though by my life could i make you a serving wench neither a queen nor a virgin should you be for so much longer as a flash of lightning might take to cross the river to the bankside  but since you are a queen and will none of me nor of philip of spain nor of any other mortal man i must een contain myself as best i may and ask you only for a boon of state  elizabeth  a boon of state already  you are becoming a courtier like the rest of them  you lack advancement  shakespear  lack advancement  by your majestys leave  a queenly phrase  he is about to write it down  elizabeth  striking the tablets from his hand  your tables begin to anger me sir  i am not here to write your plays for you  shakespear  you are here to inspire them madam  for this among the rest were you ordained  but the boon i crave is that you do endow a great playhouse or if i may make bold to coin a scholarly name for it a national theatre for the better instruction and gracing of your majestys subjects  elizabeth  why sir are there not theatres enow on the bankside and in blackfriars  shakespear  madam  these are the adventures of needy and desperate men that must to save themselves from perishing of want give the sillier sort of people what they best like and what they best like god knows is not their own betterment and instruction as we well see by the example of the churches which must needs compel men to frequent them though they be open to all without charge  only when there is a matter of a murder or a plot or a pretty youth in petticoats or some naughty tale of wantonness will your subjects pay the great cost of good players and their finery with a little profit to boot  to prove this i will tell you that i have written two noble and excellent plays setting forth the advancement of women of high nature and fruitful industry even as your majesty is  the one a skilful physician the other a sister devoted to good works  i have also stole from a book of idle wanton tales two of the most damnable foolishnesses in the world in the one of which a woman goeth in mans attire and maketh impudent love to her swain who pleaseth the groundlings by overthrowing a wrestler whilst in the other one of the same kidney sheweth her wit by saying endless naughtinesses to a gentleman as lewd as herself  i have writ these to save my friends from penury yet shewing my scorn for such follies and for them that praise them by calling the one as you like it meaning that it is not as i like it and the other much ado about nothing as it truly is and now these two filthy pieces drive their nobler fellows from the stage where indeed i cannot have my lady physician presented at all she being too honest a woman for the taste of the town  wherefore i humbly beg your majesty to give order that a theatre be endowed out of the public revenue for the playing of those pieces of mine which no merchant will touch seeing that his gain is so much greater with the worse than with the better  thereby you shall also encourage other men to undertake the writing of plays who do now despise it and leave it wholly to those whose counsels will work little good to your realm for this writing of plays is a great matter forming as it does the minds and affections of men in such sort that whatsoever they see done in show on the stage they will presently be doing in earnest in the world which is but a larger stage  of late as you know the church taught the people by means of plays but the people flocked only to such as were full of superstitious miracles and bloody martyrdoms and so the church which also was just then brought into straits by the policy of your royal father did abandon and discountenance the art of playing and thus it fell into the hands of poor players and greedy merchants that had their pockets to look to and not the greatness of this your kingdom  therefore now must your majesty take up that good work that your church hath abandoned and restore the art of playing to its former use and dignity  elizabeth  master shakespear  i will speak of this matter to the lord treasurer  shakespear  then am i undone madam for there was never yet a lord treasurer that could find a penny for anything over and above the necessary expenses of your government save for a war or a salary for his own nephew  elizabeth  master shakespear  you speak sooth yet cannot i in any wise mend it  i dare not offend my unruly puritans by making so lewd a place as the playhouse a public charge and there be a thousand things to be done in this london of mine before your poetry can have its penny from the general purse  i tell thee master will it will be three hundred years and more before my subjects learn that man cannot live by bread alone but by every word that cometh from the mouth of those whom god inspires  by that time you and i will be dust beneath the feet of the horses if indeed there be any horses then and men be still riding instead of flying  now it may be that by then your works will be dust also  shakespear  they will stand madam  fear nor for that  elizabeth  it may prove so  but of this i am certain for i know my countrymen that until every other country in the christian world even to barbarian muscovy and the hamlets of the boorish germans have its playhouse at the public charge england will never adventure  and she will adventure then only because it is her desire to be ever in the fashion and to do humbly and dutifully whatso she seeth everybody else doing  in the meantime you must content yourself as best you can by the playing of those two pieces which you give out as the most damnable ever writ but which your countrymen i warn you will swear are the best you have ever done  but this i will say that if i could speak across the ages to our descendants i should heartily recommend them to fulfil your wish for the scottish minstrel hath well said that he that maketh the songs of a nation is mightier than he that maketh its laws and the same may well be true of plays and interludes  the clock chimes the first quarter  the warder returns on his round  and now sir we are upon the hour when it better beseems a virgin queen to be abed than to converse alone with the naughtiest of her subjects  ho there  who keeps ward on the queens lodgings tonight  the warder  i do ant please your majesty  elizabeth  see that you keep it better in future  you have let pass a most dangerous gallant even to the very door of our royal chamber lead him forth and bring me word when he is safely locked out for i shall scarce dare disrobe until the palace gates are between us  shakespear  kissing her hand  my body goes through the gate into the darkness madam but my thoughts follow you  elizabeth  how to my bed  shakespear  no madam to your prayers in which i beg you to remember my theatre  elizabeth  that is my prayer to posterity  forget not your own to god and so goodnight master will  shakespear  goodnight great elizabeth  god save the queen  elizabeth  amen  exeunt severally  she to her chamber  he in custody of the warder to the gate nearest blackfriars   ayot st lawrence 20th june 1910
