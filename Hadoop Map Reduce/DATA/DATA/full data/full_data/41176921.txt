41176921	is shakespeare dead                             from my autobiography                                  mark twain                         harper  brothers publishers                            new york and london                                 m c m i x     chapter i   scattered here and there through the stacks of unpublished manuscript which constitute this formidable autobiography and diary of mine certain chapters will in some distant future be found which deal with claimantsclaimants historically notorious satan claimant the golden calf claimant the veiled prophet of khorassan claimant louis xvii claimant william shakespeare claimant arthur orton claimant mary baker g eddy claimantand the rest of them  eminent claimants successful claimants defeated claimants royal claimants pleb claimants showy claimants shabby claimants revered claimants despised claimants twinkle starlike here and there and yonder through the mists of history and legend and traditionand oh all the darling tribe are clothed in mystery and romance and we read about them with deep interest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorous resentment according to which side we hitch ourselves to  it has always been so with the human race  there was never a claimant that couldnt get a hearing nor one that couldnt accumulate a rapturous following no matter how flimsy and apparently unauthentic his claim might be  arthur ortons claim that he was the lost tichborne baronet come to life again was as flimsy as mrs eddys that she wrote science and health from the direct dictation of the deity yet in england near forty years ago orton had a huge army of devotees and incorrigible adherents many of whom remained stubbornly unconvinced after their fat god had been proven an impostor and jailed as a perjurer and today mrs eddys following is not only immense but is daily augmenting in numbers and enthusiasm orton had many fine and educated minds among his adherents mrs eddy has had the like among hers from the beginning  her church is as well equipped in those particulars as is any other church  claimants can always count upon a following it doesnt matter who they are nor what they claim nor whether they come with documents or without  it was always so  down out of the longvanished past across the abyss of the ages if you listen you can still hear the believing multitudes shouting for perkin warbeck and lambert simnel  a friend has sent me a new book from englandthe shakespeare problem restatedwell restated and closely reasoned and my fifty years interest in that matterasleep for the last three yearsis excited once more  it is an interest which was born of delia bacons bookaway back in that ancient day1857 or maybe 1856  about a year later my pilotmaster bixby transferred me from his own steamboat to the pennsylvania and placed me under the orders and instructions of george ealerdead now these many many years  i steered for him a good many monthsas was the humble duty of the pilotapprentice stood a daylight watch and spun the wheel under the severe superintendence and correction of the master  he was a prime chess player and an idolater of shakespeare  he would play chess with anybody even with me and it cost his official dignity something to do that  alsoquite uninvitedhe would read shakespeare to me not just casually but by the hour when it was his watch and i was steering  he read well but not profitably for me because he constantly injected commands into the text  that broke it all up mixed it all up tangled it all upto that degree in fact that if we were in a risky and difficult piece of river an ignorant person couldnt have told sometimes which observations were shakespeares and which were ealers  for instance      what man dare i dare      approach thou what are you laying in the leads for what a hell of     an idea like the rugged ease her off a little ease her off rugged     russian bear the armed rhinoceros or the there she goes meet her     meet her didnt you know shed smell the reef if you crowded it     like that  hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves     shell be in the woods the first you know stop the starboard come     ahead strong on the larboard back the starboard    now then     youre all right come ahead on the starboard straighten up and go     long never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert     damnation cant you keep away from that greasy water pull her down     snatch her snatch her baldheaded with thy sword if trembling i     inhabit then lay in the leadsno only the starboard one leave     the other alone protest me the baby of a girl  hence horrible     shadow eight bellsthat watchmans asleep again i reckon go down     and call brown yourself unreal mockery hence  he certainly was a good reader and splendidly thrilling and stormy and tragic but it was a damage to me because i have never since been able to read shakespeare in a calm and sane way  i cannot rid it of his explosive interlardings they break in everywhere with their irrelevant what in hell are you up to now pull her down more morethere now steady as you go and the other disorganizing interruptions that were always leaping from his mouth  when i read shakespeare now i can hear them as plainly as i did in that longdeparted timefiftyone years ago  i never regarded ealers readings as educational  indeed they were a detriment to me  his contributions to the text seldom improved it but barring that detail he was a good reader i can say that much for him  he did not use the book and did not need to he knew his shakespeare as well as euclid ever knew his multiplication table  did he have something to saythis shakespeareadoring mississippi pilotanent delia bacons book  yes  and he said it said it all the time for monthsin the morning watch the middle watch the dog watch and probably kept it going in his sleep  he bought the literature of the dispute as fast as it appeared and we discussed it all through thirteen hundred miles of river four times traversed in every thirtyfive daysthe time required by that swift boat to achieve two round trips we discussed and discussed and discussed and disputed and disputed and disputed at any rate he did and i got in a word now and then when he slipped a cog and there was a vacancy  he did his arguing with heat with energy with violence and i did mine with the reserve and moderation of a subordinate who does not like to be flung out of a pilothouse that is perched forty feet above the water  he was fiercely loyal to shakespeare and cordially scornful of bacon and of all the pretensions of the baconians  so was iat first  and at first he was glad that that was my attitude  there were even indications that he admired it indications dimmed it is true by the distance that lay between the lofty bosspilotical altitude and my lowly one yet perceptible to me perceptible and translatable into a complimentcompliment coming down from above the snowline and not well thawed in the transit and not likely to set anything afire not even a cubpilots selfconceit still a detectable compliment and precious  naturally it flattered me into being more loyal to shakespeareif possiblethan i was before and more prejudiced against baconif possible than i was before  and so we discussed and discussed both on the same side and were happy  for a while  only for a while  only for a very little while a very very very little while  then the atmosphere began to change began to cool off  a brighter person would have seen what the trouble was earlier than i did perhaps but i saw it early enough for all practical purposes  you see he was of an argumentative disposition  therefore it took him but a little time to get tired of arguing with a person who agreed with everything he said and consequently never furnished him a provocative to flare up and show what he could do when it came to clear cold hard rosecut hundredfaceted diamondflashing reasoning  that was his name for it  it has been applied since with complacency as many as several times in the baconshakespeare scuffle  on the shakespeare side  then the thing happened which has happened to more persons than to me when principle and personal interest found themselves in opposition to each other and a choice had to be made i let principle go and went over to the other side  not the entire way but far enough to answer the requirements of the case  that is to say i took this attitude to wit i only believed bacon wrote shakespeare whereas i knew shakespeare didnt  ealer was satisfied with that and the war broke loose  study practice experience in handling my end of the matter presently enabled me to take my new position almost seriously a little bit later utterly seriously a little later still lovingly gratefully devotedly finally fiercely rabidly uncompromisingly  after that i was welded to my faith i was theoretically ready to die for it and i looked down with compassion not unmixed with scorn upon everybody elses faith that didnt tally with mine  that faith imposed upon me by selfinterest in that ancient day remains my faith today and in it i find comfort solace peace and neverfailing joy  you see how curiously theological it is  the rice christian of the orient goes through the very same steps when he is after rice and the missionary is after him he goes for rice and remains to worship  ealer did a lot of our reasoningnot to say substantially all of it the slaves of his cult have a passion for calling it by that large name we others do not call our inductions and deductions and reductions by any name at all  they show for themselves what they are and we can with tranquil confidence leave the world to ennoble them with a title of its own choosing  now and then when ealer had to stop to cough i pulled my inductiontalents together and hove the controversial lead myself always getting eight feet eightandahalf often nine sometimes even quarterlesstwainas i believed but always no bottom as he said  i got the best of him only once  i prepared myself  i wrote out a passage from shakespeareit may have been the very one i quoted a while ago i dont rememberand riddled it with his wild steamboatful interlardings  when an unrisky opportunity offered one lovely summer day when we had sounded and buoyed a tangled patch of crossings known as hells half acre and were aboard again and he had sneaked the pennsylvania triumphantly through it without once scraping sand and the a t lacey had followed in our wake and got stuck and he was feeling good i showed it to him  it amused him  i asked him to fire it off read it read it i diplomatically added as only he could read dramatic poetry  the compliment touched him where he lived  he did read it read it with surpassing fire and spirit read it as it will never be read again for he knew how to put the right music into those thunderous interlardings and make them seem a part of the text make them sound as if they were bursting from shakespeares own soul each one of them a golden inspiration and not to be left out without damage to the massed and magnificent whole  i waited a week to let the incident fade waited longer waited until he brought up for reasonings and vituperation my pet position my pet argument the one which i was fondest of the one which i prized far above all others in my ammunitionwagon to wit that shakespeare couldnt have written shakespeares works for the reason that the man who wrote them was limitlessly familiar with the laws and the lawcourts and lawproceedings and lawyertalk and lawyerwaysand if shakespeare was possessed of the infinitelydivided stardust that constituted this vast wealth how did he get it and where and when  from books  from books  that was always the idea  i answered as my readings of the champions of my side of the great controversy had taught me to answer that a man cant handle glibly and easily and comfortably and successfully the argot of a trade at which he has not personally served  he will make mistakes he will not and cannot get the tradephrasings precisely and exactly right and the moment he departs by even a shade from a common tradeform the reader who has served that trade will know the writer hasnt  ealer would not be convinced he said a man could learn how to correctly handle the subtleties and mysteries and freemasonries of any trade by careful reading and studying  but when i got him to read again the passage from shakespeare with the interlardings he perceived himself that books couldnt teach a student a bewildering multitude of pilotphrases so thoroughly and perfectly that he could talk them off in book and play or conversation and make no mistake that a pilot would not immediately discover  it was a triumph for me  he was silent awhile and i knew what was happening he was losing his temper  and i knew he would presently close the session with the same old argument that was always his stay and his support in time of need the same old argument the one i couldnt answerbecause i dasnt the argument that i was an ass and better shut up  he delivered it and i obeyed  oh dear how long ago it washow pathetically long ago  and here am i old forsaken forlorn and alone arranging to get that argument out of somebody again  when a man has a passion for shakespeare it goes without saying that he keeps company with other standard authors  ealer always had several highclass books in the pilothouse and he read the same ones over and over again and did not care to change to newer and fresher ones  he played well on the flute and greatly enjoyed hearing himself play  so did i  he had a notion that a flute would keep its health better if you took it apart when it was not standing a watch and so when it was not on duty it took its rest disjointed on the compassshelf under the breastboard  when the pennsylvania blew up and became a drifting rackheap freighted with wounded and dying poor souls my young brother henry among them pilot brown had the watch below and was probably asleep and never knew what killed him but ealer escaped unhurt  he and his pilothouse were shot up into the air then they fell and ealer sank through the ragged cavern where the hurricane deck and the boiler deck had been and landed in a nest of ruins on the main deck on top of one of the unexploded boilers where he lay prone in a fog of scalding and deadly steam  but not for long  he did not lose his head long familiarity with danger had taught him to keep it in any and all emergencies  he held his coatlappels to his nose with one hand to keep out the steam and scrabbled around with the other till he found the joints of his flute then he is took measures to save himself alive and was successful  i was not on board  i had been put ashore in new orleans by captain klinefelter  the reasonhowever i have told all about it in the book called old times on the mississippi and it isnt important anyway it is so long ago     chapter ii   when i was a sundayschool scholar something more than sixty years ago i became interested in satan and wanted to find out all i could about him i began to ask questions but my classteacher mr barclay the stonemason was reluctant about answering them it seemed to me  i was anxious to be praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects when there wasnt another boy in the village who could be hired to do such a thing  i was greatly interested in the incident of eve and the serpent and thought eves calmness was perfectly noble  i asked mr barclay if he had ever heard of another woman who being approached by a serpent would not excuse herself and break for the nearest timber  he did not answer my question but rebuked me for inquiring into matters above my age and comprehension  i will say for mr barclay that he was willing to tell me the facts of satans history but he stopped there he wouldnt allow any discussion of them  in the course of time we exhausted the facts  there were only five or six of them you could set them all down on a visitingcard  i was disappointed  i had been meditating a biography and was grieved to find that there were no materials  i said as much with the tears running down  mr barclays sympathy and compassion were aroused for he was a most kind and gentlespirited man and he patted me on the head and cheered me up by saying there was a whole vast ocean of materials  i can still feel the happy thrill which these blessed words shot through me  then he began to bail out that oceans riches for my encouragement and joy  like this it was conjecturedthough not establishedthat satan was originally an angel in heaven that he fell that he rebelled and brought on a war that he was defeated and banished to perdition  also we have reason to believe that later he did soandso that we are warranted in supposing that at a subsequent time he travelled extensively seeking whom he might devour that a couple of centuries afterward as tradition instructs us he took up the cruel trade of tempting people to their ruin with vast and fearful results that byandby as the probabilities seem to indicate he may have done certain things he might have done certain other things he must have done still other things  and so on and so on  we set down the five known facts by themselves on a piece of paper and numbered it page 1 then on fifteen hundred other pieces of paper we set down the conjectures and suppositions and maybes and perhapses and doubtlesses and rumors and guesses and probabilities and likelihoods and we are permitted to thinks and we are warranted in believings and might have beens and could have beens and must have beens and unquestionablys and without a shadow of doubtsand behold  materials  why we had enough to build a biography of shakespeare  yet he made me put away my pen he would not let me write the history of satan  why  because as he said he had suspicions suspicions that my attitude in this matter was not reverent and that a person must be reverent when writing about the sacred characters  he said any one who spoke flippantly of satan would be frowned upon by the religious world and also be brought to account  i assured him in earnest and sincere words that he had wholly misconceived my attitude that i had the highest respect for satan and that my reverence for him equalled and possibly even exceeded that of any member of any church  i said it wounded me deeply to perceive by his words that he thought i would make fun of satan and deride him laugh at him scoff at him whereas in truth i had never thought of such a thing but had only a warm desire to make fun of those others and laugh at them  what others  why the supposers the perhapsers the mighthavebeeners the couldhavebeeners the musthavebeeners the withoutashadowofdoubters the wearewarrantedinbelievingers and all that funny crop of solemn architects who have taken a good solid foundation of five indisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it a conjectural satan thirty miles high  what did mr barclay do then  was he disarmed  was he silenced  no he was shocked  he was so shocked that he visibly shuddered  he said the satanic traditioners and perhapsers and conjecturers were themselves sacred  as sacred as their work  so sacred that whoso ventured to mock them or make fun of their work could not afterward enter any respectable house even by the back door  how true were his words and how wise  how fortunate it would have been for me if i had heeded them  but i was young i was but seven years of age and vain foolish and anxious to attract attention  i wrote the biography and have never been in a respectable house since     chapter iii   how curious and interesting is the parallelas far as poverty of biographical details is concernedbetween satan and shakespeare  it is wonderful it is unique it stands quite alone there is nothing resembling it in history nothing resembling it in romance nothing approaching it even in tradition  how sublime is their position and how overtopping how skyreaching how supremethe two great unknowns the two illustrious conjecturabilities  they are the bestknown unknown persons that have ever drawn breath upon the planet  for the instruction of the ignorant i will make a list now of those details of shakespeares history which are factsverified facts established facts undisputed facts    facts   he was born on the 23d of april 1564  of good farmerclass parents who could not read could not write could not sign their names  at stratford a small back settlement which in that day was shabby and unclean and densely illiterate  of the nineteen important men charged with the government of the town thirteen had to make their mark in attesting important documents because they could not write their names  of the first eighteen years of his life nothing is known  they are a blank  on the 27th of november 1582 william shakespeare took out a license to marry anne whateley  next day william shakespeare took out a license to marry anne hathaway she was eight years his senior  william shakespeare married anne hathaway  in a hurry  by grace of a reluctantlygranted dispensation there was but one publication of the banns  within six months the first child was born  about two blank years followed during which period nothing at all happened to shakespeare so far as anybody knows  then came twins1585  february  two blank years follow  then1587he makes a tenyear visit to london leaving the family behind  five blank years follow  during this period nothing happened to him as far as anybody actually knows  then1592there is mention of him as an actor  next year1593his name appears in the official list of players  next year1594he played before the queen  a detail of no consequence other obscurities did it every year of the fortyfive of her reign  and remained obscure  three pretty full years follow  full of playacting  then  in 1597 he bought new place stratford  thirteen or fourteen busy years follow years in which he accumulated money and also reputation as actor and manager  meantime his name liberally and variously spelt had become associated with a number of great plays and poems as ostensibly author of the same  some of these in these years and later were pirated but he made no protest  then161011he returned to stratford and settled down for good and all and busied himself in lending money trading in tithes trading in land and houses shirking a debt of fortyone shillings borrowed by his wife during his long desertion of his family suing debtors for shillings and coppers being sued himself for shillings and coppers and acting as confederate to a neighbor who tried to rob the town of its rights in a certain common and did not succeed  he lived five or six yearstill 1616in the joy of these elevated pursuits  then he made a will and signed each of its three pages with his name  a thoroughgoing business mans will  it named in minute detail every item of property he owned in the worldhouses lands sword silvergilt bowl and so onall the way down to his secondbest bed and its furniture  it carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among the members of his family overlooking no individual of it  not even his wife the wife he had been enabled to marry in a hurry by urgent grace of a special dispensation before he was nineteen the wife whom he had left husbandless so many years the wife who had had to borrow fortyone shillings in her need and which the lender was never able to collect of the prosperous husband but died at last with the money still lacking no even this wife was remembered in shakespeares will  he left her that secondbest bed  and not another thing not even a penny to bless her lucky widowhood with  it was eminently and conspicuously a business mans will not a poets  it mentioned not a single book  books were much more precious than swords and silvergilt bowls and secondbest beds in those days and when a departing person owned one he gave it a high place in his will  the will mentioned not a play not a poem not an unfinished literary work not a scrap of manuscript of any kind  many poets have died poor but this is the only one in history that has died this poor the others all left literary remains behind  also a book  maybe two  if shakespeare had owned a dogbut we need not go into that we know he would have mentioned it in his will  if a good dog susanna would have got it if an inferior one his wife would have got a dower interest in it  i wish he had had a dog just so we could see how painstakingly he would have divided that dog among the family in his careful business way  he signed the will in three places  in earlier years he signed two other official documents  these five signatures still exist  there are no other specimens of his penmanship in existence  not a line  was he prejudiced against the art  his granddaughter whom he loved was eight years old when he died yet she had had no teaching he left no provision for her education although he was rich and in her mature womanhood she couldnt write and couldnt tell her husbands manuscript from anybody elsesshe thought it was shakespeares  when shakespeare died in stratford it was not an event  it made no more stir in england than the death of any other forgotten theatreactor would have made  nobody came down from london there were no lamenting poems no eulogies no national tearsthere was merely silence and nothing more  a striking contrast with what happened when ben jonson and francis bacon and spenser and raleigh and the other distinguished literary folk of shakespeares time passed from life  no praiseful voice was lifted for the lost bard of avon even ben jonson waited seven years before he lifted his  so far as anybody actually knows and can prove shakespeare of stratfordonavon never wrote a play in his life  so far as anybody knows and can prove he never wrote a letter to anybody in his life  so far as any one knows he received only one letter during his life  so far as any one knows and can prove shakespeare of stratford wrote only one poem during his life  this one is authentic  he did write that onea fact which stands undisputed he wrote the whole of it he wrote the whole of it out of his own head  he commanded that this work of art be engraved upon his tomb and he was obeyed  there it abides to this day  this is it      good friend for iesus sake forbeare     to digg the dust encloased heare     blest be ye man yt spares thes stones     and curst be he yt moves my bones  in the list as above set down will be found every positively known fact of shakespeares life lean and meagre as the invoice is  beyond these details we know not a thing about him  all the rest of his vast history as furnished by the biographers is built up course upon course of guesses inferences theories conjecturesan eiffel tower of artificialities rising skyhigh from a very flat and very thin foundation of inconsequential facts     chapter ivconjectures   the historians suppose that shakespeare attended the free school in stratford from the time he was seven years old till he was thirteen there is no evidence in existence that he ever went to school at all  the historians infer that he got his latin in that schoolthe school which they suppose he attended  they suppose his fathers declining fortunes made it necessary for him to leave the school they supposed he attended and get to work and help support his parents and their ten children  but there is no evidence that he ever entered or retired from the school they suppose he attended  they suppose he assisted his father in the butchering business and that being only a boy he didnt have to do fullgrown butchering but only slaughtered calves  also that whenever he killed a calf he made a highflown speech over it  this supposition rests upon the testimony of a man who wasnt there at the time a man who got it from a man who could have been there but did not say whether he was or not and neither of them thought to mention it for decades and decades and decades and two more decades after shakespeares death until old age and mental decay had refreshed and vivified their memories  they hadnt two facts in stock about the longdead distinguished citizen but only just the one he slaughtered calves and broke into oratory while he was at it curious  they had only one fact yet the distinguished citizen had spent twentysix years in that little townjust half his lifetime  however rightly viewed it was the most important fact indeed almost the only important fact of shakespeares life in stratford  rightly viewed  for experience is an authors most valuable asset experience is the thing that puts the muscle and the breath and the warm blood into the book he writes  rightly viewed calfbutchering accounts for titus andronicus the only playaint itthat the stratford shakespeare ever wrote and yet it is the only one everybody tries to chouse him out of the baconians included  the historians find themselves justified in believing that the young shakespeare poached upon sir thomas lucys deer preserves and got haled before that magistrate for it  but there is no shred of respectworthy evidence that anything of the kind happened  the historians having argued the thing that might have happened into the thing that did happen found no trouble in turning sir thomas lucy into mr justice shallow  they have long ago convinced the worldon surmise and without trustworthy evidencethat shallow is sir thomas  the next addition to the young shakespeares stratford history comes easy  the historian builds it out of the surmised deerstealing and the surmised trial before the magistrate and the surmised vengeanceprompted satire upon the magistrate in the play result the young shakespeare was a wild wild wild oh such a wild young scamp and that gratuitous slander is established for all time  it is the very way professor osborn and i built the colossal skeleton brontosaur that stands fiftyseven feet long and sixteen feet high in the natural history museum the awe and admiration of all the world the stateliest skeleton that exists on the planet  we had nine bones and we built the rest of him out of plaster of paris  we ran short of plaster of paris or wed have built a brontosaur that could sit down beside the stratford shakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was biggest or contained the most plaster  shakespeare pronounced venus and adonis the first heir of his invention apparently implying that it was his first effort at literary composition  he should not have said it  it has been an embarrassment to his historians these many many years  they have to make him write that graceful and polished and flawless and beautiful poem before he escaped from stratford and his family1586 or 87age twentytwo or along there because within the next five years he wrote five great plays and could not have found time to write another line  it is sorely embarrassing  if he began to slaughter calves and poach deer and rollick around and learn english at the earliest likely momentsay at thirteen when he was supposably wrenched from that school where he was supposably storing up latin for future literary usehe had his youthful hands full and much more than full  he must have had to put aside his warwickshire dialect which wouldnt be understood in london and study english very hard  very hard indeed incredibly hard almost if the result of that labor was to be the smooth and rounded and flexible and letterperfect english of the venus and adonis in the space of ten years and at the same time learn great and fine and unsurpassable literary form  however it is conjectured that he accomplished all this and more much more learned law and its intricacies and the complex procedure of the law courts and all about soldiering and sailoring and the manners and customs and ways of royal courts and aristocratic society and likewise accumulated in his one head every kind of knowledge the learned then possessed and every kind of humble knowledge possessed by the lowly and the ignorant and added thereto a wider and more intimate knowledge of the worlds great literatures ancient and modern than was possessed by any other man of his timefor he was going to make brilliant and easy and admirationcompelling use of these splendid treasures the moment he got to london  and according to the surmisers that is what he did yes although there was no one in stratford able to teach him these things and no library in the little village to dig them out of  his father could not read and even the surmisers surmise that he did not keep a library  it is surmised by the biographers that the young shakespeare got his vast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurate acquaintance with the manners and customs and shoptalk of lawyers through being for a time the clerk of a stratford court just as a bright lad like me reared in a village on the banks of the mississippi might become perfect in knowledge of the behring strait whalefishery and the shoptalk of the veteran exercisers of that adventurebristling trade through catching catfish with a trotline sundays  but the surmise is damaged by the fact that there is no evidenceand not even traditionthat the young shakespeare was ever clerk of a law court  it is further surmised that the young shakespeare accumulated his lawtreasures in the first years of his sojourn in london through amusing himself by learning booklaw in his garret and by picking up lawyertalk and the rest of it through loitering about the lawcourts and listening  but it is only surmise there is no evidence that he ever did either of those things  they are merely a couple of chunks of plaster of paris  there is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holding horses in front of the london theatres mornings and afternoons  maybe he did  if he did it seriously shortened his lawstudy hours and his recreationtime in the courts  in those very days he was writing great plays and needed all the time he could get  the horseholding legend ought to be strangled it too formidably increases the historians difficulty in accounting for the young shakespeares eruditionan erudition which he was acquiring hunk by hunk and chunk by chunk every day in those strenuous times and emptying each days catch into next days imperishable drama  he had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time and a knowledge of soldierpeople and sailorpeople and their ways and talk also a knowledge of some foreign lands and their languages for he was daily emptying fluent streams of these various knowledges too into his dramas  how did he acquire these rich assets  in the usual way by surmise  it is surmised that he travelled in italy and germany and around and qualified himself to put their scenic and social aspects upon paper that he perfected himself in french italian and spanish on the road that he went in leicesters expedition to the low countries as soldier or sutler or something for several months or yearsor whatever length of time a surmiser needs in his businessand thus became familiar with soldiership and soldierways and soldiertalk and generalship and generalways and generaltalk and seamanship and sailorways and sailortalk  maybe he did all these things but i would like to know who held the horses in the meantime and who studied the books in the garret and who frollicked in the lawcourts for recreation  also who did the callboying and the playacting  for he became a callboy and as early as 93 he became a vagabondthe laws ungentle term for an unlisted actor and in 94 a regular and properly and officially listed member of that in those days lightlyvalued and not much respected profession  right soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theatres and manager of them  thenceforward he was a busy and flourishing business man and was raking in money with both hands for twenty years  then in a noble frenzy of poetic inspiration he wrote his one poemhis only poem his darlingand laid him down and died      good friend for iesus sake forbeare     to digg the dust encloased heare     blest be ye man yt spares thes stones     and curst be he yt moves my bones  he was probably dead when he wrote it  still this is only conjecture we have only circumstantial evidence  internal evidence  shall i set down the rest of the conjectures which constitute the giant biography of william shakespeare  it would strain the unabridged dictionary to hold them  he is a brontosaur nine bones and six hundred barrels of plaster of paris     chapter vwe may assume   in the assuming trade three separate and independent cults are transacting business  two of these cults are known as the shakespearites and the baconians and i am the other onethe brontosaurian  the shakespearite knows that shakespeare wrote shakespeares works the baconian knows that francis bacon wrote them the brontosaurian doesnt really know which of them did it but is quite composedly and contentedly sure that shakespeare didnt and strongly suspects that bacon did we all have to do a good deal of assuming but i am fairly certain that in every case i can call to mind the baconian assumers have come out ahead of the shakespearites  both parties handle the same materials but the baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and rational and persuasive results out of them than is the case with the shakespearites the shakespearite conducts his assuming upon a definite principle an unchanging and immutable lawwhich is 2 and 8 and 7 and 14 added together make 165  i believe this to be an error  no matter you cannot get a habitsodden shakespearite to cipherup his materials upon any other basis  with the baconian it is different  if you place before him the above figures and set him to adding them up he will never in any case get more than 45 out of them and in nine cases out of ten he will get just the proper 31  let me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and homely way calculated to bring the idea within the grasp of the ignorant and unintelligent  we will suppose a case take a lapbred housefed uneducated inexperienced kitten take a rugged old tom thats scarred from stem to rudderpost with the memorials of strenuous experience and is so cultured so educated so limitlessly erudite that one may say of him all catknowledge is his province also take a mouse  lock the three up in a holeless crackless exitless prisoncell  wait half an hour then open the cell introduce a shakespearite and a baconian and let them cipher and assume  the mouse is missing the question to be decided is where is it  you can guess both verdicts beforehand  one verdict will say the kitten contains the mouse the other will as certainly say the mouse is in the tomcat  the shakespearite will reason like thisthat is not my word it is his  he will say the kitten may have been attending school when nobody was noticing therefore we are warranted in assuming that it did so also it could have been training in a courtclerks office when no one was noticing since that could have happened we are justified in assuming that it did happen it could have studied catology in a garret when no one was noticingtherefore it did it could have attended catassizes on the shedroof nights for recreation when no one was noticing and harvested a knowledge of cat courtforms and cat lawyertalk in that way it could have done it therefore without a doubt it did it could have gone soldiering with a wartribe when no one was noticing and learned soldierwiles and soldierways and what to do with a mouse when opportunity offers the plain inference therefore is that that is what it did  since all these manifold things could have occurred we have every right to believe they did occur  these patiently and painstakingly accumulated vast acquirements and competences needed but one thing moreopportunityto convert themselves into triumphant action  the opportunity came we have the result beyond shadow of question the mouse is in the kitten  it is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a we think we may assume we expect it under careful watering and fertilizing and tending to grow up into a strong and hardy and weatherdefying there isnt a shadow of a doubt at lastand it usually happens  we know what the baconians verdict would be there is not a rag of evidence that the kitten has had any training any education any experience qualifying it for the present occasion or is indeed equipped for any achievement above lifting such unclaimed milk as comes its way but there is abundant evidenceunassailable proof in factthat the other animal is equipped to the last detail with every qualification necessary for the event  without shadow of doubt the tomcat contains the mouse     chapter vi   when shakespeare died in 1616 great literary productions attributed to him as author had been before the london world and in high favor for twentyfour years  yet his death was not an event  it made no stir it attracted no attention  apparently his eminent literary contemporaries did not realize that a celebrated poet had passed from their midst perhaps they knew a playactor of minor rank had disappeared but did not regard him as the author of his works  we are justified in assuming this  his death was not even an event in the little town of stratford  does this mean that in stratford he was not regarded as a celebrity of any kind  we are privileged to assumeno we are indeed obliged to assumethat such was the case  he had spent the first twentytwo or twentythree years of his life there and of course knew everybody and was known by everybody of that day in the town including the dogs and the cats and the horses  he had spent the last five or six years of his life there diligently trading in every big and little thing that had money in it so we are compelled to assume that many of the folk there in those said latter days knew him personally and the rest by sight and hearsay  but not as a celebrity  apparently not  for everybody soon forgot to remember any contact with him or any incident connected with him  the dozens of townspeople still alive who had known of him or known about him in the first twentythree years of his life were in the same unremembering condition if they knew of any incident connected with that period of his life they didnt tell about it  would they if they had been asked  it is most likely  were they asked  it is pretty apparent that they were not  why werent they  it is a very plausible guess that nobody there or elsewhere was interested to know  for seven years after shakespeares death nobody seems to have been interested in him  then the quarto was published and ben jonson awoke out of his long indifference and sang a song of praise and put it in the front of the book  then silence fell again  for sixty years  then inquiries into shakespeares stratford life began to be made of stratfordians  of stratfordians who had known shakespeare or had seen him  no  then of stratfordians who had seen people who had known or seen people who had seen shakespeare  no  apparently the inquiries were only made of stratfordians who were not stratfordians of shakespeares day but later comers and what they had learned had come to them from persons who had not seen shakespeare and what they had learned was not claimed as fact but only as legenddim and fading and indefinite legend legend of the calfslaughtering rank and not worth remembering either as history or fiction  has it ever happened beforeor sincethat a celebrated person who had spent exactly half of a fairly long life in the village where he was born and reared was able to slip out of this world and leave that village voiceless and gossipless behind himutterly voiceless utterly gossipless  and permanently so  i dont believe it has happened in any case except shakespeares  and couldnt and wouldnt have happened in his case if he had been regarded as a celebrity at the time of his death  when i examine my own casebut let us do that and see if it will not be recognizable as exhibiting a condition of things quite likely to result most likely to result indeed substantially sure to result in the case of a celebrated person a benefactor of the human race  like me  my parents brought me to the village of hannibal missouri on the banks of the mississippi when i was two and a half years old  i entered school at five years of age and drifted from one school to another in the village during nine and a half years  then my father died leaving his family in exceedingly straitened circumstances wherefore my bookeducation came to a standstill forever and i became a printers apprentice on board and clothes and when the clothes failed i got a hymnbook in place of them  this for summer wear probably  i lived in hannibal fifteen and a half years altogether then ran away according to the custom of persons who are intending to become celebrated  i never lived there afterward  four years later i became a cub on a mississippi steamboat in the st louis and new orleans trade and after a year and a half of hard study and hard work the u s inspectors rigorously examined me through a couple of long sittings and decided that i knew every inch of the mississippithirteen hundred milesin the dark and in the dayas well as a baby knows the way to its mothers paps day or night  so they licensed me as a pilotknighted me so to speakand i rose up clothed with authority a responsible servant of the united states government  now then  shakespeare died younghe was only fiftytwo  he had lived in his native village twentysix years or about that  he died celebrated if you believe everything you read in the books  yet when he died nobody there or elsewhere took any notice of it and for sixty years afterward no townsman remembered to say anything about him or about his life in stratford  when the inquirer came at last he got but one factno legendand got that one at second hand from a person who had only heard it as a rumor and didnt claim copyright in it as a production of his own  he couldnt very well for its date antedated his own birthdate  but necessarily a number of persons were still alive in stratford who in the days of their youth had seen shakespeare nearly every day in the last five years of his life and they would have been able to tell that inquirer some firsthand things about him if he had in those last days been a celebrity and therefore a person of interest to the villagers  why did not the inquirer hunt them up and interview them wasnt it worth while  wasnt the matter of sufficient consequence  had the inquirer an engagement to see a dogfight and couldnt spare the time  it all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity there or elsewhere and no considerable repute as actor and manager  now then i am away along in lifemy seventythird year being already well behind meyet sixteen of my hannibal schoolmates are still alive today and can telland do tellinquirers dozens and dozens of incidents of their young lives and mine together things that happened to us in the morning of life in the blossom of our youth in the good days the dear days the days when we went gipsying a long time ago  most of them creditable to me too  one child to whom i paid court when she was five years old and i eight still lives in hannibal and she visited me last summer traversing the necessary ten or twelve hundred miles of railroad without damage to her patience or to her oldyoung vigor another little lassie to whom i paid attention in hannibal when she was nine years old and i the same is still alivein londonand hale and hearty just as i am  and on the few surviving steamboatsthose lingering ghosts and remembrancers of great fleets that plied the big river in the beginning of my watercareerwhich is exactly as long ago as the whole invoice of the lifeyears of shakespeare numberthere are still findable two or three riverpilots who saw me do creditable things in those ancient days and several whiteheaded engineers and several roustabouts and mates and several deckhands who used to heave the lead for me and send up on the still night air the sixfeetscant that made me shudder and the marktwain that took the shudder away and presently the darling by the deepfour that lifted me to heaven for joy 1  they know about me and can tell  and so do printers from st louis to new york and so do newspaper reporters from nevada to san francisco  and so do the police  if shakespeare had really been celebrated like me stratford could have told things about him and if my experience goes for anything theyd have done it     chapter vii   if i had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to decide whether shakespeare wrote shakespeare or not i believe i would place before the debaters only the one question was shakespeare ever a practicing lawyer and leave everything else out  it is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not merely myriadminded but also myriadaccomplished that he not only knew some thousands of things about human life in all its shades and grades and about the hundred arts and trades and crafts and professions which men busy themselves in but that he could talk about the men and their grades and trades accurately making no mistakes  maybe it is so but have the experts spoken or is it only tom dick and harry  does the exhibit stand upon wide and loose and eloquent generalizingwhich is not evidence and not proofor upon details particulars statistics illustrations demonstrations  experts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely as to only one of shakespeares multifarious craftequipments so far as my recollections of shakespearebacon talk abide with mehis lawequipment i do not remember that wellington or napoleon ever examined shakespeares battles and sieges and strategies and then decided and established for good and all that they were militarily flawless i do not remember that any nelson or drake or cook ever examined his seamanship and said it showed profound and accurate familiarity with that art i dont remember that any king or prince or duke has ever testified that shakespeare was letterperfect in his handling of royal courtmanners and the talk and manners of aristocracies i dont remember that any illustrious latinist or grecian or frenchman or spaniard or italian has proclaimed him a pastmaster in those languages i dont rememberwell i dont remember that there is testimonygreat testimonyimposing testimonyunanswerable and unattackable testimony as to any of shakespeares hundred specialties except onethe law  other things change with time and the student cannot trace back with certainty the changes that various trades and their processes and technicalities have undergone in the long stretch of a century or two and find out what their processes and technicalities were in those early days but with the law it is different it is milestoned and documented all the way back and the master of that wonderful trade that complex and intricate trade that awecompelling trade has competent ways of knowing whether shakespearelaw is good law or not and whether his lawcourt procedure is correct or not and whether his legal shoptalk is the shoptalk of a veteran practitioner or only a machinemade counterfeit of it gathered from books and from occasional loiterings in westminster  richard h dana served two years before the mast and had every experience that falls to the lot of the sailor before the mast of our day  his sailortalk flows from his pen with the sure touch and the ease and confidence of a person who has lived what he is talking about not gathered it from books and random listenings  hear him      having hove short cast off the gaskets and made the bunt of each     sail fast by the jigger with a man on each yard at the word the     whole canvas of the ship was loosed and with the greatest rapidity     possible everything was sheeted home and hoisted up the anchor     tripped and catheaded and the ship under headway  again      the royal yards were all crossed at once and royals and skysails     set and as we had the wind free the booms were run out and all     were aloft active as cats laying out on the yards and booms     reeving the studdingsail gear and sail after sail the captain piled     upon her until she was covered with canvas her sails looking like a     great white cloud resting upon a black speck  once more  a race in the pacific      our antagonist was in her best trim  being clear of the point the     breeze became stiff and the royalmasts bent under our sails but we     would not take them in until we saw three boys spring into the     rigging of the california then they were all furled at once but     with orders to our boys to stay aloft at the topgallant mastheads     and loose them again at the word  it was my duty to furl the     foreroyal and while standing by to loose it again i had a fine     view of the scene  from where i stood the two vessels seemed     nothing but spars and sails while their narrow decks far below     slanting over by the force of the wind aloft appeared hardly capable     of supporting the great fabrics raised upon them  the california     was to windward of us and had every advantage yet while the breeze     was stiff we held our own  as soon as it began to slacken she ranged     a little ahead and the order was given to loose the royals  in an     instant the gaskets were off and the bunt dropped  sheet home the     foreroyalweather sheets homelee sheets homehoist     away sir is bawled from aloft  overhaul your clewlines shouts     the mate  ayeaye sir all cleartaut leech belay  well the     lee brace haul taut to windward and the royals are set  what would the captain of any sailingvessel of our time say to that  he would say the man that wrote that didnt learn his trade out of a book he has been there  but would this same captain be competent to sit in judgment upon shakespeares seamanshipconsidering the changes in ships and shiptalk that have necessarily taken place unrecorded unremembered and lost to history in the last three hundred years  it is my conviction that shakespeares sailortalk would be choctaw to him for instancefrom the tempest      master  boatswain      boatswain  here master what cheer      master  good speak to the mariners fall tot yarely or we run     ourselves to ground bestir bestir

wi the main     course    lay her ahold ahold  set her two courses  off to     sea again lay her off  that will do for the present let us yare a little now for a change  if a man should write a book and in it make one of his characters say here devil empty the quoins into the standing galley and the imposing stone into the hellbox assemble the comps around the frisket and let them jeff for takes and be quick about it i should recognize a mistake or two in the phrasing and would know that the writer was only a printer theoretically not practically  i have been a quartz miner in the silver regionsa pretty hard life i know all the palaver of that business i know all about discovery claims and the subordinate claims i know all about lodes ledges outcroppings dips spurs angles shafts drifts inclines levels tunnels airshafts horses clay casings granite casings quartz mills and their batteries arastras and how to charge them with quicksilver and sulphate of copper and how to clean them up and how to reduce the resulting amalgam in the retorts and how to cast the bullion into pigs and finally i know how to screen tailings and also how to hunt for something less robust to do and find it  i know the argot of the quartzmining and milling industry familiarly and so whenever bret harte introduces that industry into a story the first time one of his miners opens his mouth i recognize from his phrasing that harte got the phrasing by listeninglike shakespearei mean the stratford onenot by experience  no one can talk the quartz dialect correctly without learning it with pick and shovel and drill and fuse  i have been a surfaceminergoldand i know all its mysteries and the dialect that belongs with them and whenever harte introduces that industry into a story i know by the phrasing of his characters that neither he nor they have ever served that trade  i have been a pocket minera sort of gold mining not findable in any but one little spot in the world so far as i know  i know how with horn and water to find the trail of a pocket and trace it step by step and stage by stage up the mountain to its source and find the compact little nest of yellow metal reposing in its secret home under the ground i know the language of that trade that capricious trade that fascinating buriedtreasure trade and can catch any writer who tries to use it without having learned it by the sweat of his brow and the labor of his hands  i know several other trades and the argot that goes with them and whenever a person tries to talk the talk peculiar to any of them without having learned it at its source i can trap him always before he gets far on his road  and so as i have already remarked if i were required to superintend a baconshakespeare controversy i would narrow the matter down to a single questionthe only one so far as the previous controversies have informed me concerning which illustrious experts of unimpeachable competency have testified was the author of shakespeares works a lawyera lawyer deeply read and of limitless experience  i would put aside the guesses and surmises and perhapses and mighthavebeens and couldhave beens and musthavebeens and weare justifiedinpresumings and the rest of those vague spectres and shadows and indefinitenesses and stand or fall win or lose by the verdict rendered by the jury upon that single question  if the verdict was yes i should feel quite convinced that the stratford shakespeare the actor manager and trader who died so obscure so forgotten so destitute of even village consequence that sixty years afterward no fellowcitizen and friend of his later days remembered to tell anything about him did not write the works  chapter xiii of the shakespeare problem restated bears the heading shakespeare as a lawyer and comprises some fifty pages of expert testimony with comments thereon and i will copy the first nine as being sufficient all by themselves as it seems to me to settle the question which i have conceived to be the masterkey to the shakespearebacon puzzle     chapter viiishakespeare as a lawyer 2   the plays and poems of shakespeare supply ample evidence that their author not only had a very extensive and accurate knowledge of law but that he was well acquainted with the manners and customs of members of the inns of court and with legal life generally  while novelists and dramatists are constantly making mistakes as to the laws of marriage of wills and inheritance to shakespeares law lavishly as he expounds it there can neither be demurrer nor bill of exceptions nor writ of error  such was the testimony borne by one of the most distinguished lawyers of the nineteenth century who was raised to the high office of lord chief justice in 1850 and subsequently became lord chancellor  its weight will doubtless be more appreciated by lawyers than by laymen for only lawyers know how impossible it is for those who have not served an apprenticeship to the law to avoid displaying their ignorance if they venture to employ legal terms and to discuss legal doctrines  there is nothing so dangerous wrote lord campbell as for one not of the craft to tamper with our freemasonry a layman is certain to betray himself by using some expression which a lawyer would never employ  mr sidney lee himself supplies us with an example of this  he writes p 164 on february 15 1609 shakespeare    obtained judgment from a jury against addenbroke for the payment of no 6 and no 1 5s 0d costs  now a lawyer would never have spoken of obtaining judgment from a jury for it is the function of a jury not to deliver judgment which is the prerogative of the court but to find a verdict on the facts  the error is indeed a venial one but it is just one of those little things which at once enable a lawyer to know if the writer is a layman or one of the craft  but when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal subjects he is naturally apt to make an exhibition of his incompetence  let a nonprofessional man however acute writes lord campbell again presume to talk law or to draw illustrations from legal science in discussing other subjects and he will speedily fall into laughable absurdity  and what does the same high authority say about shakespeare  he had a deep technical knowledge of the law and an easy familiarity with some of the most abstruse proceedings in english jurisprudence  and again whenever he indulges this propensity he uniformly lays down good law of henry iv part 2 he says if lord eldon could be supposed to have written the play i do not see how he could be chargeable with having forgotten any of his law while writing it  charles and mary cowden clarke speak of the marvelous intimacy which he displays with legal terms his frequent adoption of them in illustration and his curiously technical knowledge of their form and force  malone himself a lawyer wrote his knowledge of legal terms is not merely such as might be acquired by the casual observation of even his allcomprehending mind it has the appearance of technical skill  another lawyer and wellknown shakespearean richard grant white says no dramatist of the time not even beaumont who was the younger son of a judge of the common pleas and who after studying in the inns of court abandoned law for the drama used legal phrases with shakespeares readiness and exactness  and the significance of this fact is heightened by another that it is only to the language of the law that he exhibits this inclination  the phrases peculiar to other occupations serve him on rare occasions by way of description comparison or illustration generally when something in the scene suggests them but legal phrases flow from his pen as part of his vocabulary and parcel of his thought  take the word purchase for instance which in ordinary use means to acquire by giving value but applies in law to all legal modes of obtaining property except by inheritance or descent and in this peculiar sense the word occurs five times in shakespeares thirtyfour plays and only in one single instance in the fiftyfour plays of beaumont and fletcher  it has been suggested that it was in attendance upon the courts in london that he picked up his legal vocabulary  but this supposition not only fails to account for shakespeares peculiar freedom and exactness in the use of that phraseology it does not even place him in the way of learning those terms his use of which is most remarkable which are not such as he would have heard at ordinary proceedings at nisi prius but such as refer to the tenure or transfer of real property fine and recovery statutes merchant purchase indenture tenure double voucher fee simple fee farm remainder reversion forfeiture etc  this conveyancers jargon could not have been picked up by hanging round the courts of law in london two hundred and fifty years ago when suits as to the title of real property were comparatively rare  and beside shakespeare uses his law just as freely in his first plays written in his first london years as in those produced at a later period  just as exactly too for the correctness and propriety with which these terms are introduced have compelled the admiration of a chief justice and a lord chancellor  senator davis wrote we seem to have something more than a sciolists temerity of indulgence in the terms of an unfamiliar art  no legal solecisms will be found  the abstrusest elements of the common law are impressed into a disciplined service  over and over again where such knowledge is unexampled in writers unlearned in the law shakespeare appears in perfect possession of it  in the law of real property its rules of tenure and descents its entails its fines and recoveries their vouchers and double vouchers in the procedure of the courts the method of bringing writs and arrests the nature of actions the rules of pleading the law of escapes and of contempt of court in the principles of evidence both technical and philosophical in the distinction between the temporal and spiritual tribunals in the law of attainder and forfeiture in the requisites of a valid marriage in the presumption of legitimacy in the learning of the law of prerogative in the inalienable character of the crown this mastership appears with surprising authority  to all this testimony and there is much more which i have not cited may now be added that of a great lawyer of our own times viz sir james plaisted wilde qc created a baron of the exchequer in 1860 promoted to the post of judgeordinary and judge of the courts of probate and divorce in 1863 and better known to the world as lord penzance to which dignity he was raised in 1869  lord penzance as all lawyers know and as the late mr inderwick kc has testified was one of the first legal authorities of his day famous for his remarkable grasp of legal principles and endowed by nature with a remarkable facility for marshalling facts and for a clear expression of his views  lord penzance speaks of shakespeares perfect familiarity with not only the principles axioms and maxims but the technicalities of english law a knowledge so perfect and intimate that he was never incorrect and never at fault    the mode in which this knowledge was pressed into service on all occasions to express his meaning and illustrate his thoughts was quite unexampled  he seems to have had a special pleasure in his complete and ready mastership of it in all its branches  as manifested in the plays this legal knowledge and learning had therefore a special character which places it on a wholly different footing from the rest of the multifarious knowledge which is exhibited in page after page of the plays  at every turn and point at which the author required a metaphor simile or illustration his mind ever turned first to the law  he seems almost to have thought in legal phrases the commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of his pen in description or illustration  that he should have descanted in lawyer language when he had a forensic subject in hand such as shylocks bond was to be expected but the knowledge of law in shakespeare was exhibited in a far different manner it protruded itself on all occasions appropriate or inappropriate and mingled itself with strains of thought widely divergent from forensic subjects  again to acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles and an accurate and ready use of the technical terms and phrases not only of the conveyancers office but of the pleaders chambers and the courts at westminster nothing short of employment in some career involving constant contact with legal questions and general legal work would be requisite  but a continuous employment involves the element of time and time was just what the manager of two theatres had not at his disposal  in what portion of shakespeares ie shaksperes career would it be possible to point out that time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment in the chambers or offices of practising lawyers  stratfordians as is well known casting about for some possible explanation of shakespeares extraordinary knowledge of law have made the suggestion that shakespeare might conceivably have been a clerk in an attorneys office before he came to london  mr collier wrote to lord campbell to ask his opinion as to the probability of this being true his answer was as follows you require us to believe implicitly a fact of which if true positive and irrefragable evidence in his own handwriting might have been forthcoming to establish it  not having been actually enrolled as an attorney neither the records of the local court at stratford nor of the superior courts at westminster would present his name as being concerned in any suit as an attorney but it might reasonably have been expected that there would be deeds or wills witnessed by him still extant and after a very diligent search none such can be discovered  upon this lord penzance comments it cannot be doubted that lord campbell was right in this  no young man could have been at work in an attorneys office without being called upon continually to act as a witness and in many other ways leaving traces of his work and name there is not a single fact or incident in all that is known of shakespeare even by rumor or tradition which supports this notion of a clerkship  and after much argument and surmise which has been indulged in on this subject we may i think safely put the notion on one side for no less an authority than mr grant white says finally that the idea of his having been clerk to an attorney has been blown to pieces  it is altogether characteristic of mr churton collins that he nevertheless adopts this exploded myth  that shakespeare was in early life employed as a clerk in an attorneys office may be correct  at stratford there was by royal charter a court of record sitting every fortnight with six attorneys beside the town clerk belonging to it and it is certainly not straining probability to suppose that the young shakespeare may have had employment in one of them  there is it is true no tradition to this effect but such traditions as we have about shakespeares occupation between the time of leaving school and going to london are so loose and baseless that no confidence can be placed in them  it is to say the least more probable that he was in an attorneys office than that he was a butcher killing calves in a high style and making speeches over them  this is a charming specimen of stratfordian argument  there is as we have seen a very old tradition that shakespeare was a butchers apprentice  john dowdall who made a tour in warwickshire in 1693 testifies to it as coming from the old clerk who showed him over the church and it is unhesitatingly accepted as true by mr halliwellphillipps  vol i p 11 and see vol ii p 71 72  mr sidney lee sees nothing improbable in it and it is supported by aubrey who must have written his account some time before 1680 when his manuscript was completed  of the attorneys clerk hypothesis on the other hand there is not the faintest vestige of a tradition  it has been evolved out of the fertile imaginations of embarrassed stratfordians seeking for some explanation of the stratford rustics marvellous acquaintance with law and legal terms and legal life  but mr churton collins has not the least hesitation in throwing over the tradition which has the warrant of antiquity and setting up in its stead this ridiculous invention for which not only is there no shred of positive evidence but which as lord campbell and lord penzance point out is really put out of court by the negative evidence since no young man could have been at work in an attorneys office without being called upon continually to act as a witness and in many other ways leaving traces of his work and name  and as mr edwards further points out since the day when lord campbells book was published between forty and fifty years ago every old deed or will to say nothing of other legal papers dated during the period of william shakespeares youth has been scrutinized over half a dozen shires and not one signature of the young man has been found  moreover if shakespeare had served as clerk in an attorneys office it is clear that he must have so served for a considerable period in order to have gained if indeed it is credible that he could have so gained his remarkable knowledge of law  can we then for a moment believe that if this had been so tradition would have been absolutely silent on the matter  that dowdalls old clerk over eighty years of age should have never heard of it though he was sure enough about the butchers apprentice and that all the other ancient witnesses should be in similar ignorance  but such are the methods of stratfordian controversy  tradition is to be scouted when it is found inconvenient but cited as irrefragable truth when it suits the case  shakespeare of stratford was the author of the plays and poems but the author of the plays and poems could not have been a butchers apprentice  away therefore with tradition  but the author of the plays and poems must have had a very large and a very accurate knowledge of the law  therefore shakespeare of stratford must have been an attorneys clerk  the method is simplicity itself  by similar reasoning shakespeare has been made a country schoolmaster a soldier a physician a printer and a good many other things beside according to the inclination and the exigencies of the commentator  it would not be in the least surprising to find that he was studying latin as a schoolmaster and law in an attorneys office at the same time  however we must do mr collins the justice of saying that he has fully recognized what is indeed tolerably obvious that shakespeare must have had a sound legal training  it may of course be urged he writes that shakespeares knowledge of medicine and particularly that branch of it which related to morbid psychology is equally remarkable and that no one has ever contended that he was a physician  here mr collins is wrong that contention also has been put forward it may be urged that his acquaintance with the technicalities of other crafts and callings notably of marine and military affairs was also extraordinary and yet no one has suspected him of being a sailor or a soldier  wrong again why even messrs garnett and gosse suspect that he was a soldier this may be conceded but the concession hardly furnishes an analogy  to these and all other subjects he recurs occasionally and in season but with reminiscences of the law his memory as is abundantly clear was simply saturated  in season and out of season now in manifest now in recondite application he presses it into the service of expression and illustration  at least a third of his myriad metaphors are derived from it  it would indeed be difficult to find a single act in any of his dramas nay in some of them a single scene the diction and imagery of which is not colored by it  much of his law may have been acquired from three books easily accessible to him namely tottells precedents 1572 pultons statutes 1578 and fraunces lawiers logike 1588 works with which he certainly seems to have been familiar but much of it could only have come from one who had an intimate acquaintance with legal proceedings  we quite agree with mr castle that shakespeares legal knowledge is not what could have been picked up in an attorneys office but could only have been learned by an actual attendance at the courts at a pleaders chambers and on circuit or by associating intimately with members of the bench and bar  this is excellent  but what is mr collins explanation  perhaps the simplest solution of the problem is to accept the hypothesis that in early life he was in an attorneys office  that he there contracted a love for the law which never left him that as a young man in london he continued to study or dabble in it for his amusement to stroll in leisure hours into the courts and to frequent the society of lawyers on no other supposition is it possible to explain the attraction which the law evidently had for him and his minute and undeviating accuracy in a subject where no layman who has indulged in such copious and ostentatious display of legal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in keeping himself from tripping  a lame conclusion  no other supposition indeed  yes there is another and a very obvious supposition namely that shakespeare was himself a lawyer well versed in his trade versed in all the ways of the courts and living in close intimacy with judges and members of the inns of court  one is of course thankful that mr collins has appreciated the fact that shakespeare must have had a sound legal training but i may be forgiven if i do not attach quite so much importance to his pronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those of malone lord campbell judge holmes mr castle kc lord penzance mr grant white and other lawyers who have expressed their opinion on the matter of shakespeares legal acquirements  here it may perhaps be worth while to quote again from lord penzances book as to the suggestion that shakespeare had somehow or other managed to acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles and an accurate and ready use of the technical terms and phrases not only of the conveyancers office but of the pleaders chambers and the courts at westminster  this as lord penzance points out would require nothing short of employment in some career involving constant contact with legal questions and general legal work  but in what portion of shakespeares career would it be possible to point out that time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment in the chambers or offices of practising lawyers    it is beyond doubt that at an early period he was called upon to abandon his attendance at school and assist his father and was soon after at the age of sixteen bound apprentice to a trade  while under the obligation of this bond he could not have pursued any other employment  then he leaves stratford and comes to london  he has to provide himself with the means of a livelihood and this he did in some capacity at the theatre  no one doubts that  the holding of horses is scouted by many and perhaps with justice as being unlikely and certainly unproved but whatever the nature of his employment was at the theatre there is hardly room for the belief that it could have been other than continuous for his progress there was so rapid  ere long he had been taken into the company as an actor and was soon spoken of as a johannes factotum  his rapid accumulation of wealth speaks volumes for the constancy and activity of his services one fails to see when there could be a break in the current of his life at this period of it giving room or opportunity for legal or indeed any other employment  in 1589 says knight we have undeniable evidence that he had not only a casual engagement was not only a salaried servant as many players were but was a shareholder in the company of the queens players with other shareholders below him on the list  this 1589 would be within two years after his arrival in london which is placed by white and halliwellphillipps about the year 1587  the difficulty in supposing that starting with a state of ignorance in 1587 when he is supposed to have come to london he was induced to enter upon a course of most extended study and mental culture is almost insuperable  still it was physically possible provided always that he could have had access to the needful books  but this legal training seems to me to stand on a different footing  it is not only unaccountable and incredible but it is actually negatived by the known facts of his career  lord penzance then refers to the fact that by 1592 according to the best authority mr grant white several of the plays had been written  the comedy of errors in 1589 loves labours lost in 1589 two gentlemen of verona in 1589 or 1590 and so forth and then asks with this catalogue of dramatic work on hand    was it possible that he could have taken a leading part in the management and conduct of two theatres and if mr phillipps is to be relied upon taken his share in the performances of the provincial tours of his companyand at the same time devoted himself to the study of the law in all its branches so efficiently as to make himself complete master of its principles and practice and saturate his mind with all its most technical terms  i have cited this passage from lord penzances book because it lay before me and i had already quoted from it on the matter of shakespeares legal knowledge but other writers have still better set forth the insuperable difficulties as they seem to me which beset the idea that shakespeare might have found time in some unknown period of early life amid multifarious other occupations for the study of classics literature and law to say nothing of languages and a few other matters  lord penzance further asks his readers did you ever meet with or hear of an instance in which a young man in this country gave himself up to legal studies and engaged in legal employments which is the only way of becoming familiar with the technicalities of practice unless with the view of practicing in that profession  i do not believe that it would be easy or indeed possible to produce an instance in which the law has been seriously studied in all its branches except as a qualification for practice in the legal profession                                        this testimony is so strong so direct so authoritative and so uncheapened unwatered by guesses and surmises and maybesos and mighthavebeens and couldhavebeens and musthavebeens and the rest of that ton of plaster of paris out of which the biographers have built the colossal brontosaur which goes by the stratford actors name that it quite convinces me that the man who wrote shakespeares works knew all about law and lawyers  also that that man could not have been the stratford shakespeareand wasnt  who did write these works then  i wish i knew     chapter ix   did francis bacon write shakespeares works  nobody knows  we cannot say we know a thing when that thing has not been proved know is too strong a word to use when the evidence is not final and absolutely conclusive  we can infer if we want to like those slaves    no i will not write that word it is not kind it is not courteous the upholders of the stratfordshakespeare superstition call us the hardest names they can think of and they keep doing it all the time very well if they like to descend to that level let them do it but i will not so undignify myself as to follow them  i cannot call them harsh names the most i can do is to indicate them by terms reflecting my disapproval and this without malice without venom  to resume  what i was about to say was those thugs have built their entire superstition upon inferences not upon known and established facts  it is a weak method and poor and i am glad to be able to say our side never resorts to it while there is anything else to resort to  but when we must we must and we have now arrived at a place of that sort  since the stratford shakespeare couldnt have written the works we infer that somebody did  who was it then  this requires some more inferring  ordinarily when an unsigned poem sweeps across the continent like a tidal wave whose roar and boom and thunder are made up of admiration delight and applause a dozen obscure people rise up and claim the authorship why a dozen instead of only one or two  one reason is because theres a dozen that are recognizably competent to do that poem  do you remember beautiful snow  do you remember rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep  do you remember backward turn backward o time in thy flight make me a child again just for tonight  i remember them very well their authorship was claimed by most of the grownup people who were alive at the time and every claimant had one plausible argument in his favor at least to wit he could have done the authoring he was competent  have the works been claimed by a dozen  they havent  there was good reason  the world knows there was but one man on the planet at the time who was competentnot a dozen and not two  a long time ago the dwellers in a far country used now and then to find a procession of prodigious footprints stretching across the plainfootprints that were three miles apart each footprint a third of a mile long and a furlong deep and with forests and villages mashed to mush in it  was there any doubt as to who had made that mighty trail  were there a dozen claimants  were there two  nothe people knew who it was that had been along there there was only one hercules  there has been only one shakespeare  there couldnt be two certainly there couldnt be two at the same time  it takes ages to bring forth a shakespeare and some more ages to match him  this one was not matched before his time nor during his time and hasnt been matched since  the prospect of matching him in our time is not bright  the baconians claim that the stratford shakespeare was not qualified to write the works and that francis bacon was  they claim that bacon possessed the stupendous equipmentboth natural and acquiredfor the miracle and that no other englishman of his day possessed the like or indeed anything closely approaching it  macaulay in his essay has much to say about the splendor and horizonless magnitude of that equipment  also he has synopsized bacons history a thing which cannot be done for the stratford shakespeare for he hasnt any history to synopsize  bacons history is open to the world from his boyhood to his death in old agea history consisting of known facts displayed in minute and multitudinous detail facts not guesses and conjectures and mighthavebeens  whereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen and had a lord chancellor for his father and a mother who was distinguished both as a linguist and a theologian she corresponded in greek with bishop jewell and translated his apologia from the latin so correctly that neither he nor archbishop parker could suggest a single alteration  it is the atmosphere we are reared in that determines how our inclinations and aspirations shall tend  the atmosphere furnished by the parents to the son in this present case was an atmosphere saturated with learning with thinkings and ponderings upon deep subjects and with polite culture  it had its natural effect  shakespeare of stratford was reared in a house which had no use for books since its owners his parents were without education  this may have had an effect upon the son but we do not know because we have no history of him of an informing sort there were but few books anywhere in that day and only the welltodo and highly educated possessed them they being almost confined to the dead languages  all the valuable books then extant in all the vernacular dialects of europe would hardly have filled a single shelfimagine it  the few existing books were in the latin tongue mainly  a person who was ignorant of it was shut out from all acquaintancenot merely with cicero and virgil but with the most interesting memoirs state papers and pamphlets of his own timea literature necessary to the stratford lad for his fictitious reputations sake since the writer of his works would begin to use it wholesale and in a most masterly way before the lad was hardly more than out of his teens and into his twenties  at fifteen bacon was sent to the university and he spent three years there  thence he went to paris in the train of the english ambassador and there he mingled daily with the wise the cultured the great and the aristocracy of fashion during another three years  a total of six years spent at the sources of knowledge knowledge both of books and of men  the three spent at the university were coeval with the second and last three spent by the little stratford lad at stratford school supposedly and perhapsedly and maybe and by inferencewith nothing to infer from  the second three of the baconian six were presumably spent by the stratford lad as apprentice to a butcher  that is the thugs presume iton no evidence of any kind  which is their way when they want a historical fact  fact and presumption are for business purposes all the same to them  they know the difference but they also know how to blink it  they know too that while in historybuilding a fact is better than a presumption it doesnt take a presumption long to bloom into a fact when they have the handling of it  they know by old experience that when they get hold of a presumptiontadpole he is not going to stay tadpole in their historytank no they know how to develop him into the giant fourlegged bullfrog of fact and make him sit up on his hams and puff out his chin and look important and insolent and cometostay and assert his genuine simonpure authenticity with a thundering bellow that will convince everybody because it is so loud  the thug is aware that loudness convinces sixty persons where reasoning convinces but one  i wouldnt be a thug not even ifbut never mind about that it has nothing to do with the argument and it is not noble in spirit besides  if i am better than a thug is the merit mine  no it is his  then to him be the praise  that is the right spirit  they presume the lad severed his presumed connection with the stratford school to become apprentice to a butcher  they also presume that the butcher was his father  they dont know  there is no written record of it nor any other actual evidence  if it would have helped their case any they would have apprenticed him to thirty butchers to fifty butchers to a wilderness of butchersall by their patented method presumption  if it will help their case they will do it yet and if it will further help it they will presume that all those butchers were his father  and the week after they will say it  why it is just like being the past tense of the compound reflexive adverbial incandescent hypodermic irregular accusative noun of multitude which is father to the expression which the grammarians call verb  it is like a whole ancestry with only one posterity  to resume  next the young bacon took up the study of law and mastered that abstruse science  from that day to the end of his life he was daily in close contact with lawyers and judges not as a casual onlooker in intervals between holding horses in front of a theatre but as a practicing lawyera great and successful one a renowned one a launcelot of the bar the most formidable lance in the high brotherhood of the legal table round he lived in the laws atmosphere thenceforth all his years and by sheer ability forced his way up its difficult steeps to its supremest summit the lord chancellorship leaving behind him no fellow craftsman qualified to challenge his divine right to that majestic place  when we read the praises bestowed by lord penzance and the other illustrious experts upon the legal condition and legal aptnesses brilliances profundities and felicities so prodigally displayed in the plays and try to fit them to the historyless stratford stagemanager they sound wild strange incredible ludicrous but when we put them in the mouth of bacon they do not sound strange they seem in their natural and rightful place they seem at home there  please turn back and read them again  attributed to shakespeare of stratford they are meaningless they are inebriate extravaganciesintemperate admirations of the dark side of the moon so to speak attributed to bacon they are admirations of the golden glories of the moons front side the moon at the fulland not intemperate not overwrought but sane and right and justified  at every turn and point at which the author required a metaphor simile or illustration his mind ever turned first to the law he seems almost to have thought in legal phrases the commonest legal phrases the commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of his pen  that could happen to no one but a person whose trade was the law it could not happen to a dabbler in it  veteran mariners fill their conversation with sailorphrases and draw all their similes from the ship and the sea and the storm but no mere passenger ever does it be he of stratford or elsewhere or could do it with anything resembling accuracy if he were hardy enough to try  please read again what lord campbell and the other great authorities have said about bacon when they thought they were saying it about shakespeare of stratford     chapter xthe rest of the equipment   the author of the plays was equipped beyond every other man of his time with wisdom erudition imagination capaciousness of mind grace and majesty of expression  every one has said it no one doubts it  also he had humor humor in rich abundance and always wanting to break out we have no evidence of any kind that shakespeare of stratford possessed any of these gifts or any of these acquirements  the only lines he ever wrote so far as we know are substantially barren of thembarren of all of them      good friend for iesus sake forbeare     to digg the dust encloased heare     blest be ye man yt spares thes stones     and curst be he yt moves my bones  ben jonson says of bacon as orator      his language where he could spare and pass by a jest was nobly     censorious  no man ever spoke more neatly more pressly more     weightily or suffered less emptiness less idleness in what he     uttered  no member of his speech but consisted of his its own     graces    the fear of every man that heard him was lest he should     make an end  from macaulay      he continued to distinguish himself in parliament particularly by     his exertions in favor of one excellent measure on which the kings     heart was setthe union of england and scotland  it was not     difficult for such an intellect to discover many irresistible     arguments in favor of such a scheme  he conducted the great case of     the post nati in the exchequer chamber and the decision of the     judgesa decision the legality of which may be questioned but the     beneficial effect of which must be acknowledgedwas in a great     measure attributed to his dexterous management  again      while actively engaged in the house of commons and in the courts of     law he still found leisure for letters and philosophy  the noble     treatise on the advancement of learning which at a later period     was expanded into the de augmentis appeared in 1605      the wisdom of the ancients a work which if it had proceeded from     any other writer would have been considered as a masterpiece of wit     and learning was printed in 1609      in the meantime the novum organum was slowly proceeding  several     distinguished men of learning had been permitted to see portions of     that extraordinary book and they spoke with the greatest admiration     of his genius      even sir thomas bodley after perusing the cogitata et visa one of     the most precious of those scattered leaves out of which the great     oracular volume was afterward made up acknowledged that in all     proposals and plots in that book bacon showed himself a master     workman and that it could not be gainsaid but all the treatise     over did abound with choice conceits of the present state of     learning and with worthy contemplations of the means to procure it      in 1612 a new edition of the essays appeared with additions     surpassing the original collection both in bulk and quality      nor did these pursuits distract bacons attention from a work the     most arduous the most glorious and the most useful that even his     mighty powers could have achieved the reducing and recompiling to     use his own phrase of the laws of england  to serve the exacting and laborious offices of attorney general and solicitor general would have satisfied the appetite of any other man for hard work but bacon had to add the vast literary industries just described to satisfy his  he was a born worker      the service which he rendered to letters during the last five years     of his life amid ten thousand distractions and vexations increase     the regret with which we think on the many years which he had wasted     to use the words of sir thomas bodley on such study as was not     worthy such a student      he commenced a digest of the laws of england a history of england     under the princes of the house of tudor a body of national history     a philosophical romance  he made extensive and valuable additions to     his essays  he published the inestimable treatise de argumentis     scientiarum  did these labors of hercules fill up his time to his contentment and quiet his appetite for work  not entirely      the trifles with which he amused himself in hours of pain and languor     bore the mark of his mind  the best jestbook in the world is that     which he dictated from memory without referring to any book on a     day on which illness had rendered him incapable of serious study  here are some scattered remarks from macaulay which throw light upon bacon and seem to indicateand maybe demonstratethat he was competent to write the plays and poems      with great minuteness of observation he had an amplitude of     comprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed to any other     human being      the essays contain abundant proofs that no nice feature of     character no peculiarity in the ordering of a house a garden or a     courtmasque could escape the notice of one whose mind was capable     of taking in the whole world of knowledge      his understanding resembled the tent which the fairy paribanou gave     to prince ahmed fold it and it seemed a toy for the hand of a lady     spread it and the armies of powerful sultans might repose beneath     its shade      the knowledge in which bacon excelled all men was a knowledge of the     mutual relations of all departments of knowledge      in a letter written when he was only thirtyone to his uncle lord     burleigh he said i have taken all knowledge to be my province      though bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic he     adorned her profusely with all the richest decorations of rhetoric      the practical faculty was powerful in bacon but not like his wit     so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason and to     tyrannize over the whole man  there are too many places in the plays where this happens  poor old dying john of gaunt volleying secondrate puns at his own name is a pathetic instance of it  we may assume that it is bacons fault but the stratford shakespeare has to bear the blame      no imagination was ever at once so strong and so thoroughly     subjugated  it stopped at the first check from good sense      in truth much of bacons life was passed in a visionary worldamid     things as strange as any that are described in the arabian tales        amid buildings more sumptuous than the palace of aladdin     fountains more wonderful than the golden water of parizade     conveyances more rapid than the hippogryph of ruggiero arms more     formidable than the lance of astolfo remedies more efficacious than     the balsam of fierabras  yet in his magnificent daydreams there was     nothing wildnothing but what sober reason sanctioned      bacons greatest performance is the first book of the novum organum        every part of it blazes with wit but with wit which is     employed only to illustrate and decorate truth  no book ever made so     great a revolution in the mode of thinking overthrew so many     prejudices introduced so many new opinions      but what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellect which     without effort takes in at once all the domains of scienceall the     past the present and the future all the errors of two thousand     years all the encouraging signs of the passing times all the bright     hopes of the coming age      he had a wonderful talent for packing thought close and rendering it     portable      his eloquence would alone have entitled him to a high rank in     literature  it is evident that he had each and every one of the mental gifts and each and every one of the acquirements that are so prodigally displayed in the plays and poems and in much higher and richer degree than any other man of his time or of any previous time  he was a genius without a mate a prodigy not matable  there was only one of him the planet could not produce two of him at one birth nor in one age  he could have written anything that is in the plays and poems  he could have written this      the cloudcapd towers the gorgeous palaces     the solemn temples the great globe itself     yea all which it inherit shall dissolve     and like an insubstantial pageant faded     leave not a rack behind  we are such stuff     as dreams are made on and our little life     is rounded with a sleep  also he could have written this but he refrained      good friend for iesus sake forbeare     to digg the dust encloased heare     blest be ye man yt spares thes stones     and curst be ye yt moves my bones  when a person reads the noble verses about the cloudcapd towers he ought not to follow it immediately with good friend for iesus sake forbeare because he will find the transition from great poetry to poor prose too violent for comfort  it will give him a shock  you never notice how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is until you bite into a layer of it in a pie     chapter xi   am i trying to convince anybody that shakespeare did not write shakespeares works  ah now what do you take me for  would i be so soft as that after having known the human race familiarly for nearly seventyfour years  it would grieve me to know that any one could think so injuriously of me so uncomplimentarily so unadmiringly of me nono i am aware that when even the brightest mind in our world has been trained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind it will never be possible for that mind in its maturity to examine sincerely dispassionately and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance which shall seem to cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition i doubt if i could do it myself  we always get at second hand our notions about systems of government and hightariff and lowtariff and prohibition and antiprohibition and the holiness of peace and the glories of war and codes of honor and codes of morals and approval of the duel and disapproval of it and our beliefs concerning the nature of cats and our ideas as to whether the murder of helpless wild animals is base or is heroic and our preferences in the matter of religious and political parties and our acceptance or rejection of the shakespeares and the arthur ortons and the mrs eddys  we get them all at secondhand we reason none of them out for ourselves  it is the way we are made  it is the way we are all made and we cant help it we cant change it  and whenever we have been furnished a fetish and have been taught to believe in it and love it and worship it and refrain from examining it there is no evidence howsoever clear and strong that can persuade us to withdraw from it our loyalty and our devotion  in morals conduct and beliefs we take the color of our environment and associations and it is a color that can safely be warranted to wash whenever we have been furnished with a tar baby ostensibly stuffed with jewels and warned that it will be dishonorable and irreverent to disembowel it and test the jewels we keep our sacrilegious hands off it we submit not reluctantly but rather gladly for we are privately afraid we should find upon examination that the jewels are of the sort that are manufactured at north adams mass  i havent any idea that shakespeare will have to vacate his pedestal this side of the year 2209  disbelief in him cannot come swiftly disbelief in a healthy and deeplyloved tar baby has never been known to disintegrate swiftly it is a very slow process  it took several thousand years to convince our fine raceincluding every splendid intellect in itthat there is no such thing as a witch it has taken several thousand years to convince that same fine raceincluding every splendid intellect in itthat there is no such person as satan it has taken several centuries to remove perdition from the protestant churchs program of postmortem entertainments it has taken a weary long time to persuade american presbyterians to give up infant damnation and try to bear it the best they can and it looks as if their scotch brethren will still be burning babies in the everlasting fires when shakespeare comes down from his perch  we are the reasoning race  we cant prove it by the above examples and we cant prove it by the miraculous histories built by those stratfordolaters out of a hatful of rags and a barrel of sawdust but there is a plenty of other things we can prove it by if i could think of them  we are the reasoning race and when we find a vague file of chipmunktracks stringing through the dust of stratford village we know by our reasoning powers that hercules has been along there  i feel that our fetish is safe for three centuries yet  the bust toothere in the stratford church  the precious bust the priceless bust the calm bust the serene bust the emotionless bust with the dandy moustache and the putty face unseamed of carethat face which has looked passionlessly down upon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years and will still look down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more with the deep deep deep subtle subtle subtle expression of a bladder     chapter xiiirreverence   one of the most trying defects which i find in thesethesewhat shall i call them for i will not apply injurious epithets to them the way they do to us such violations of courtesy being repugnant to my nature and my dignity  the furthest i can go in that direction is to call them by names of limited reverencenames merely descriptive never unkind never offensive never tainted by harsh feeling  if they would do like this they would feel better in their hearts  very well thento proceed one of the most trying defects which i find in these stratfordolaters these shakesperoids these thugs these bangalores these troglodytes these herumfrodites these blatherskites these buccaneers these bandoleers is their spirit of irreverence  it is detectable in every utterance of theirs when they are talking about us  i am thankful that in me there is nothing of that spirit  when a thing is sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward it  i cannot call to mind a single instance where i have ever been irreverent except toward the things which were sacred to other people  am i in the right  i think so  but i ask no one to take my unsupported word no look at the dictionary let the dictionary decide  here is the definition      irreverence  the quality or condition of irreverence toward god     and sacred things  what does the hindu say  he says it is correct  he says irreverence is lack of respect for vishnu and brahma and chrishna and his other gods and for his sacred cattle and for his temples and the things within them  he endorses the definition you see and there are 300000000 hindus or their equivalents back of him  the dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital g it could restrict irreverence to lack of reverence for our deity and our sacred things but that ingenious and rather sly idea miscarried for by the simple process of spelling his deities with capitals the hindu confiscates the definition and restricts it to his own sects thus making it clearly compulsory upon us to revere his gods and his sacred things and nobodys else  we cant say a word for he has our own dictionary at his back and its decision is final  this law reduced to its simplest terms is this 1  whatever is sacred to the christian must be held in reverence by everybody else 2 whatever is sacred to the hindu must be held in reverence by everybody else 3 therefore by consequence logically and indisputably whatever is sacred to me must be held in reverence by everybody else  now then what aggravates me is that these troglodytes and muscovites and bandoleers and buccaneers are also trying to crowd in and share the benefit of the law and compel everybody to revere their shakespeare and hold him sacred  we cant have that theres enough of us already  if you go on widening and spreading and inflating the privilege it will presently come to be conceded that each mans sacred things are the only ones and the rest of the human race will have to be humbly reverent toward them or suffer for it  that can surely happen and when it happens the word irreverence will be regarded as the most meaningless and foolish and selfconceited and insolent and impudent and dictatorial word in the language  and people will say whose business is it what gods i worship and what things hold sacred  who has the right to dictate to my conscience and where did he get that right  we cannot afford to let that calamity come upon us  we must save the word from this destruction  there is but one way to do it and that is to stop the spread of the privilege and strictly confine it to its present limits that is to all the christian sects to all the hindu sects and me  we do not need any more the stock is watered enough just as it is  it would be better if the privilege were limited to me alone  i think so because i am the only sect that knows how to employ it gently kindly charitably dispassionately  the other sects lack the quality of selfrestraint  the catholic church says the most irreverent things about matters which are sacred to the protestants and the protestant church retorts in kind about the confessional and other matters which catholics hold sacred then both of these irreverencers turn upon thomas paine and charge him with irreverence  this is all unfortunate because it makes it difficult for students equipped with only a low grade of mentality to find out what irreverence really is  it will surely be much better all around if the privilege of regulating the irreverent and keeping them in order shall eventually be withdrawn from all the sects but me  then there will be no more quarrelling no more bandying of disrespectful epithets no more heart burnings  there will then be nothing sacred involved in this baconshakespeare controversy except what is sacred to me  that will simplify the whole matter and trouble will cease  there will be irreverence no longer because i will not allow it  the first time those criminals charge me with irreverence for calling their stratford myth an arthurortonmarybakerthompsoneddylouistheseventeenthveiled prophetofkhorassan will be the last  taught by the methods found effective in extinguishing earlier offenders by the inquisition of holy memory i shall know how to quiet them     chapter xiii   isnt it odd when you think of it

you can find out the lifehistories of all those people too  you will then have listed 1500 celebrities and you can trace the authentic lifehistories of the whole of them  save onefar and away the most colossal prodigy of the entire accumulationshakespeare  about him you can find out nothing nothing of even the slightest importance  nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory  nothing that even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly commonplace persona manager an actor of inferior grade a small trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any consequence and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold in his grave  we can go to the records and find out the lifehistory of every renowned racehorse of modern timesbut not shakespeares  there are many reasons why and they have been furnished in cartloads of guess and conjecture by those troglodytes but there is one that is worth all the rest of the reasons put together and is abundantly sufficient all by itselfhe hadnt any history to record  there is no way of getting around that deadly fact and no sane way has yet been discovered of getting around its formidable significance  its quite plain significanceto any but those thugs i do not use the term unkindly is that shakespeare had no prominence while he lived and none until he had been dead two or three generations  the plays enjoyed high fame from the beginning and if he wrote them it seems a pity the world did not find it out  he ought to have explained that he was the author and not merely a nom de plume for another man to hide behind if he had been less intemperately solicitous about his bones and more solicitous about his works it would have been better for his good name and a kindness to us  the bones were not important  they will moulder away they will turn to dust but the works will endure until the last sun goes down                                                                 mark twain  ps  march 25  about two months ago i was illuminating this autobiography with some notions of mine concerning the baconshakespeare controversy and i then took occasion to air the opinion that the stratford shakespeare was a person of no public consequence or celebrity during his lifetime but was utterly obscure and unimportant  and not only in great london but also in the little village where he was born where he lived a quarter of a century and where he died and was buried i argued that if he had been a person of any note at all aged villagers would have had much to tell about him many and many a year after his death instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact connected with him  i believed and i still believe that if he had been famous his notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my native village out in missouri  it is a good argument a prodigiously strong one and a most formidable one for even the most gifted and ingenious and plausible stratfordolater to get around or explain away today a hannibal courierpost of recent date has reached me with an article in it which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated person cannot be forgotten in his village in the short space of sixty years  i will make an extract from it      hannibal as a city may have many sins to answer for but     ingratitude is not one of them or reverence for the great men she     has produced and as the years go by her greatest son mark twain or     s l clemens as a few of the unlettered call him grows in the     estimation and regard of the residents of the town he made famous and     the town that made him famous  his name is associated with every old     building that is torn down to make way for the modern structures     demanded by a rapidly growing city and with every hill or cave over     or through which he might by any possibility have roamed while the     many points of interest which he wove into his stories such as     holiday hill jacksons island or mark twain cave are now monuments     to his genius  hannibal is glad of any opportunity to do him honor     as he has honored her      so it has happened that the old timers who went to school with mark     or were with him on some of his usual escapades have been honored     with large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscent mood and     condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came     to be a very extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now     seen to have been indicative of what was to come  like aunt beckey     and mrs clemens they can now see that mark was hardly appreciated     when he lived here and that the things he did as a boy and was     whipped for doing were not all bad after all  so they have been in     no hesitancy about drawing out the bad things he did as well as the     good in their efforts to get a mark twain story all incidents     being viewed in the light of his present fame until the volume of     twainiana is already considerable and growing in proportion as the     old timers drop away and the stories are retold second and third     hand by their descendants  with some seventythree years young and     living in a villa instead of a house he is a fair target and let him     incorporate copyright or patent himself as he will there are some     of his works that will go swooping up hannibal chimneys as long as     graybeards gather about the fires and begin with ive heard father     tell or possibly once when i  the mrs clemens referred to is my motherwas my mother  and here is another extract from a hannibal paper  of date twenty days ago      miss becca blankenship died at the home of william dickason 408 rock     street at 230 oclock yesterday afternoon aged 72 years  the     deceased was a sister of huckleberry finn one of the famous     characters in mark twains tom sawyer  she had been a member of     the dickason familythe housekeeperfor nearly fortyfive years     and was a highly respected lady  for the past eight years she had     been an invalid but was as well cared for by mr dickason and his     family as if she had been a near relative  she was a member of the     park methodist church and a christian woman  i remember her well  i have a picture of her in my mind which was graven there clear and sharp and vivid sixtythree years ago  she was at that time nine years old and i was about eleven  i remember where she stood and how she looked and i can still see her bare feet her bare head her brown face and her short towlinen frock  she was crying  what it was about i have long ago forgotten  but it was the tears that preserved the picture for me no doubt  she was a good child i can say that for her  she knew me nearly seventy years ago  did she forget me in the course of time  i think not  if she had lived in stratford in shakespeares time would she have forgotten him  yes  for he was never famous during his lifetime he was utterly obscure in stratford and there wouldnt be any occasion to remember him after he had been dead a week  injun joe jimmy finn and general gaines were prominent and very intemperate neerdoweels in hannibal two generations ago  plenty of grayheads there remember them to this day and can tell you about them isnt it curious that two towndrunkards and one halfbreed loafer should leave behind them in a remote missourian village a fame a hundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in the matter of definite facts than shakespeare left behind him in the village where he had lived the half of his lifetime                                                                 mark twain     footnotes   1  four fathomstwentyfour feet  2  from chapter xiii
