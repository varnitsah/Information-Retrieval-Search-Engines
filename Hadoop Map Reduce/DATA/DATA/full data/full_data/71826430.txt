71826430	on the duty of civil disobedience   by henry david thoreau   1849 original title  resistance to civil government   i heartily accept the motto that government is best which governs least and i should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically  carried out it finally amounts to this which also i believethat government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have government is at best but an expedient but most governments are usually and all governments are sometimes inexpedient the objections which have been brought against a standing army and they are many and weighty and deserve to prevail may also at last be brought against a standing government the standing army is only an arm of the standing government the government itself which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it  witness the present mexican war the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool for in the outset the people would not have consented to this measure  this american governmentwhat is it but a tradition though a recent one endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity but each instant losing some of its integrity  it has not the vitality and force of a single living man for a single man can bend it to his will  it is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves  but it is not the less necessary for this for the people must have some complicated machinery or other and hear its din to satisfy that idea of government which they have governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed upon even impose on themselves for their own advantage it is excellent we must all allow  yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way  it does not keep the  country free  it does not settle the west  it does not educate  the character inherent in the american people has done all that has been accomplished and it would have done somewhat more if the government had not sometimes got in its way  for government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone and as has been said when it is most expedient the governed are most let alone by it  trade and commerce if they were not made of indiarubber would never manage to bounce over obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way and if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of their actions and not partly by their intentions they would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievious persons who put obstructions on the railroads  but to speak practically and as a citizen unlike those who call themselves nogovernment men i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect and that will be one step toward obtaining it  after all the practical reason why when the power is once in the hands of the people a majority are permitted and for a long period continue to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right nor because this seems fairest to the minority but because they are physically the strongest  but a government in which the majority rule in all cases can not be based on justice even as far as men understand it  can there not be a government in which the majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong but consciencein which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable  must the citizen ever for a moment or in the least degree resign his conscience to the legislator  why has every man a conscience then  i think that we should be men first and subjects afterward  it is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law so much as for the right  the only obligation which i have a right to assume is to do at any time what i think right  it is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience law never made men a whit more just and by means of their respect for it even the welldisposed are daily made the agents on injustice  a common and natural result of an undue respect for the law is that you may see a file of soldiers colonel captain corporal privates powdermonkeys and all marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars against their wills ay against their common sense and consciences which makes it very steep marching indeed and produces a palpitation of the heart they have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned they are all peaceably inclined now what are they  men at all  or small movable forts and magazines at the service of some unscrupulous man in power visit the navy yard and behold a marine such a man as an american government can make or such as it can make a man with its black artsa mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity a man laid out alive and standing and already as one may say buried under arms with funeral accompaniment though it may be      not a drum was heard not a funeral note      as his corse to the rampart we hurried      not a soldier discharged his farewell shot      oer the grave where our hero was buried  the mass of men serve the state thus not as men mainly but as machines with their bodies  they are the standing army and the militia jailers constables posse comitatus etc in most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgement or of the moral sense but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well such command no more respect than men of straw or a lump of dirt they have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens othersas most legislators politicians lawyers ministers and officeholdersserve the state chiefly with their heads and as they rarely make any moral distinctions they are as likely to serve the devil without intending it as god a very fewas heroes patriots martyrs reformers in the great sense and menserve the state with their consciences also and so necessarily resist it for the most part and they are commonly treated as enemies by it  a wise man will only be useful as a man and will not submit to be clay and stop a hole to keep the wind away but leave that office to his dust at least      i am too high born to be propertied      to be a second at control      or useful servingman and instrument      to any sovereign state throughout the world  he who gives himself entirely to his fellow men appears to them useless and selfish but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a benefactor and philanthropist  how does it become a man to behave toward the american government today  i answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it  i cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as my government which is the slaves government also  all men recognize the right of revolution that is the right to refuse allegiance to and to resist the government when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable  but almost all say that such is not the case now  but such was the case they think in the revolution of 75  if one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports it is most probable that i should not make an ado about it for i can do without them all machines have their friction and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the evil  at any rate it is a great evil to make a stir about it  but when the friction comes to have its machine and oppression and robbery are organized i say let us not have such a machine any longer in other words when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army and subjected to military law i think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize what makes this duty the more urgent is that fact that the country so overrun is not our own but ours is the invading army  paley a common authority with many on moral questions in his chapter on the duty of submission to civil government resolves all civil obligation into expediency and he proceeds to say that so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconvenience it is the will of god    that the established government be obeyedand no longer  this principle being admitted the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other of this he says every man shall judge for himself but paley appears never to have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply in which a people as well as an individual must do justice cost what it may  if i have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man i must restore it to him though i drown myself this according to paley would be inconvenient but he that would save his life in such a case shall lose it this people must cease to hold slaves and to make war on mexico though it cost them their existence as a people  in their practice nations agree with paley but does anyone think that massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis      a drab of stat      a clothosilver slut      to have her train borne up      and her soul trail in the dirt  practically speaking the opponents to a reform in massachusetts are not a hundred thousand politicians at the south but a hundred thousand merchants and farmers here who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in humanity and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to mexico cost what it may  i quarrel not with faroff foes but with those who near at home cooperate with and do the bidding of those far away and without whom the latter would be harmless  we are accustomed to say that the mass of men are unprepared but improvement is slow because the few are not as materially wiser or better than the many  it is not so important that many should be good as you as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere for that will leaven the whole lump there are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them who esteeming themselves children of washington and franklin sit down with their hands in their pockets and say that they know not what to do and do nothing who even postpone the question of freedom to the question of free trade and quietly read the pricescurrent along with the latest advices from mexico after dinner and it may be fall asleep over them both  what is the pricecurrent of an honest man and patriot today  they hesitate and they regret and sometimes they petition but they do nothing in earnest and with effect  they will wait well disposed for other to remedy the evil that they may no longer have it to regret  at most they give up only a cheap vote and a feeble countenance and godspeed to the right as it goes by them  there are nine hundred and ninetynine patrons of virtue to one virtuous man  but it is easier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it  all voting is a sort of gaming like checkers or backgammon with a slight moral tinge to it a playing with right and wrong with moral questions and betting naturally accompanies it  the character of the voters is not staked i cast my vote perchance as i think right but i am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail  i am willing to leave it to the majority  its obligation therefore never exceeds that of expediency  even voting for the right is doing nothing for it  it is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail a wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority there is but little virtue in the action of masses of men when the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery it will be because they are indifferent to slavery or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by their vote  they will then be the only slaves  only his vote can hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his own freedom by his vote  i hear of a convention to be held at baltimore or elsewhere for the selection of a candidate for the presidency made up chiefly of editors and men who are politicians by profession but i think what is it to any independent intelligent and respectable man what decision they may come to  shall we not have the advantage of this wisdom and honesty nevertheless  can we not count upon some independent votes  are there not many individuals in the country who do not attend conventions  but no  i find that the respectable man so called has immediately drifted from his position and despairs of his country when his country has more reasons to despair of him  he forthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only available one thus proving that he is himself available for any purposes of the demagogue  his vote is of no more worth than that of any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native who may have been bought  o for a man who is a man and as my neighbor says has a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through our statistics are at fault the population has been returned too large  how many men are there to a square thousand miles in the country hardly one  does not america offer any inducement for men to settle here  the american has dwindled into an odd fellowone who may be known by the development of his organ of gregariousness and a manifest lack of intellect and cheerful selfreliance whose first and chief concern on coming into the world is to see that the almshouses are in good repair and before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb to collect a fund to the support of the widows and orphans that may be who in short ventures to live only by the aid of the mutual insurance company which has promised to bury him decently  it is not a mans duty as a matter of course to devote himself to the eradication of any even to most enormous wrong he may still properly have other concerns to engage him but it is his duty at least to wash his hands of it and if he gives it no thought longer not to give it practically his support  if i devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations i must first see at least that i do not pursue them sitting upon another mans shoulders  i must get off him first that he may pursue his contemplations too  see what gross inconsistency is tolerated i have heard some of my townsmen say i should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves or to march to mexicosee if i would go and yet these very men have each directly by their allegiance and so indirectly at least by their money furnished a substitute  the soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war is applauded by those whose own act and authority he disregards and sets at naught as if the state were penitent to that degree that it hired one to scourge it while it sinned but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment thus under the name of order and civil government we are all made at last to pay homage to and support our own meanness after the first blush of sin comes its indifference and from immoral it becomes as it were unmoral and not quite unnecessary to that life which we have made  the broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested virtue to sustain it  the slight reproach to which the virtue of patriotism is commonly liable the noble are most likely to incur  those who while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform  some are petitioning the state to dissolve the union to disregard the requisitions of the president  why do they not dissolve it themselvesthe union between themselves and the stateand refuse to pay their quota into its treasury  do not they stand in the same relation to the state that the state does to the union  and have not the same reasons prevented the state from resisting the union which have prevented them from resisting the state  how can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely and enjoy it  is there any enjoyment in it if his opinion is that he is aggrieved  if you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor you do not rest satisfied with knowing you are cheated or with saying that you are cheated or even with petitioning him to pay you your due but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount and see to it that you are never cheated again action from principle the perception and the performance of right changes things and relations it is essentially revolutionary and does not consist wholly with anything which was  it not only divided states and churches it divides families ay it divides the individual separating the diabolical in him from the divine  unjust laws exist  shall we be content to obey them or shall we endeavor to amend them and obey them until we have succeeded or shall we transgress them at once  men generally under such a government as this think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them  they think that if they should resist the remedy would be worse than the evil  but it is the fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than the evil it makes it worse  why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform  why does it not cherish its wise minority why does it cry and resist before it is hurt  why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults and do better  than it would have them  why does it always crucify christ and excommunicate copernicus and luther and pronounce washington and franklin rebels  one would think that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the only offense never contemplated by its government else why has it not assigned its definite its suitable and proportionate penalty  if a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine shillings for the state he is put in prison for a period unlimited by any law that i know and determined only by the discretion of those who put him there but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings from the state he is soon permitted to go at large again  if the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government let it go let it go  perchance it will wear smoothcertainly the machine will wear out if the injustice has a spring or a pulley or a rope or a crank exclusively for itself then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another then i say break the law  let your life be a counterfriction to stop the machine  what i have to do is to see at any rate that i do not lend myself to the wrong which i condemn  as for adopting the ways of the state has provided for remedying the evil i know not of such ways  they take too much time and a mans life will be gone  i have other affairs to attend to  i came into this world not chiefly to make this a good place to live in but to live in it be it good or bad  a man has not everything to do but something and because he cannot do everything it is not necessary that he should be doing something wrong it is not my business to be petitioning the governor or the legislature any more than it is theirs to petition me and if they should not hear my petition what should i do then but in this case the state has provided no way  its very constitution is the evil  this may seem to be harsh and stubborn and unconcilliatory but it is to treat with the utmost kindness and consideration the only spirit that can appreciate or deserves it  so is all change for the better like birth and death which convulse the body  i do not hesitate to say that those who call themselves abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support both in person and property from the government of massachusetts and not wait till they constitute a majority of one before they suffer the right to prevail through them  i think that it is enough if they have god on their side without waiting for that other one moreover any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already  i meet this american government or its representative the state government directly and face to face once a yearno morein the person of its taxgatherer this is the only mode in which a man situated as i am necessarily meets it and it then says distinctly recognize me and the simplest the most effectual and in the present posture of affairs the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it is to deny it then  my civil neighbor the taxgatherer is the very man i have to deal withfor it is after all with men and not with parchment that i quarreland he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government  how shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government or as a man until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me his neighbor for whom he has respect as a neighbor and welldisposed man or as a maniac and disturber of the peace and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action  i know this well that if one thousand if one hundred if ten men whom i could nameif ten honest men onlyay if one honest man in this state of massachusetts ceasing to hold slaves were actually to withdraw from this copartnership and be locked up in the county jail therefor it would be the abolition of slavery in america  for it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be  what is once well done is done forever  but we love better to talk about it  that we say is our mission  reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service but not one man  if my esteemed neighbor the states ambassador who will devote his days to the settlement of the question of human rights in the council chamber instead of being threatened with the prisons of carolina were to sit down the prisoner of massachusetts that state which is so anxious to foist the sin of slavery upon her sisterthough at present she can discover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrel with herthe legislature would not wholly waive the subject of the following winter  under a government which imprisons unjustly the true place for a just man is also a prison  the proper place today the only place which massachusetts has provided for her freer and less despondent spirits is in her prisons to be put out and locked out of the state by her own act as they have already put themselves out by their principles it is there that the fugitive slave and the mexican prisoner on parole and the indian come to plead the wrongs of his race should find them on that separate but more free and honorable ground where the state places those who are not with her but against herthe only house in a slave state in which a free man can abide with honor  if any think that their influence would be lost there and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the state that they would not be as an enemy within its walls they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has experienced a little in his own person  cast your whole vote not a strip of paper merely but your whole influence a minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority it is not even a minority then but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight  if the alternative is to keep all just men in prison or give up war and slavery the state will not hesitate which to choose  if a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year that would not be a violent and bloody measure as it would be to pay them and enable the state to commit violence and shed innocent blood  this is in fact the definition of a peaceable revolution if any such is possible  if the taxgatherer or any other public officer asks me as one has done but what shall i do my answer is if you really wish to do anything resign your office  when the subject has refused allegiance and the officer has resigned from office then the revolution is accomplished  but even suppose blood should flow is there not a sort of blood shed when the conscience is wounded  through this wound a mans real manhood and immortality flow out and he bleeds to an everlasting death  i see this blood flowing now  i have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender rather than the seizure of his goodsthough both will serve the same purposebecause they who assert the purest right and consequently are most dangerous to a corrupt state commonly have not spent much time in accumulating property to such the state renders comparatively small service and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant particularly if they are obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands if there were one who lived wholly without the use of money the state itself would hesitate to demand it of him but the rich mannot to make any invidious comparisonis always sold to the institution which makes him rich  absolutely speaking the more money the less virtue for money comes between a man and his objects and obtains them for him it was certainly no great virtue to obtain it  it puts to rest many questions which he would otherwise be taxed to answer while the only new question which it puts is the hard but superfluous one how to spend it  thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet the opportunities of living are diminished in proportion as that are called the means are increased  the best thing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which he entertained when he was poor  christ answered the herodians according to their condition  show me the tributemoney said heand one took a penny out of his pocketif you use money which has the image of caesar on it and which he has made current and valuable that is if you are men of the state and gladly enjoy the advantages of caesars government then pay him back some of his own when he demands it  render therefore to caesar that which is caesars and to god those things which are godsleaving them no wiser than before as to which was which for they did not wish to know  when i converse with the freest of my neighbors i perceive that whatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of the question and their regard for the public tranquillity the long and the short of the matter is that they cannot spare the protection of the existing government and they dread the consequences to their property and families of disobedience to it  for my own part i should not like to think that i ever rely on the protection of the state  but if i deny the authority of the state when it presents its tax bill it will soon take and waste all my property and so harass me and my children without end this is hard  this makes it impossible for a man to live honestly and at the same time comfortably in outward respects  it will not be worth the while to accumulate property that would be sure to go again  you must hire or squat somewhere and raise but a small crop and eat that soon  you must live within yourself and depend upon yourself always tucked up and ready for a start and not have many affairs  a man may grow rich in turkey even if he will be in all respects a good subject of the turkish government  confucius said  if a state is governed by the principles of reason poverty and misery are subjects of shame if a state is not governed by the principles of reason riches and honors are subjects of shame  no  until i want the protection of massachusetts to be extended to me in some distant southern port where my liberty is endangered or until i am bent solely on building up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise i can afford to refuse allegiance to massachusetts and her right to my property and life  it costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the state than it would to obey i should feel as if i were worth less in that case  some years ago the state met me in behalf of the church and commanded me to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose preaching my father attended but never i myself  pay it said or be locked up in the jail  i declined to pay  but unfortunately another man saw fit to pay it  i did not see why the schoolmaster should be taxed to support the priest and not the priest the schoolmaster for i was not the states schoolmaster but i supported myself by voluntary subscription  i did not see why the lyceum should not present its tax bill and have the state to back its demand as well as the church however at the request of the selectmen i condescended to make some such statement as this in writing  know all men by these presents that i henry thoreau do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which i have not joined this i gave to the town clerk and he has it  the state having thus learned that i did not wish to be regarded as a member of that church has never made a like demand on me since though it said that it must adhere to its original presumption that time  if i had known how to name them i should then have signed off in detail from all the societies which i never signed on to but i did not know where to find such a complete list  i have paid no poll tax for six years  i was put into a jail once on this account for one night and as i stood considering the walls of solid stone two or three feet thick the door of wood and iron a foot thick and the iron grating which strained the light i could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if i were mere flesh and blood and bones to be locked up  i wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way  i saw that if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to be as free as i was  i did not for a moment feel confined and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar  i felt as if i alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax  they plainly did not know how to treat me but behaved like persons who are underbred  in every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall  i could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations which followed them out again without let or hindrance and they were really all that was dangerous as they could not reach me they had resolved to punish my body just as boys if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite will abuse his dog  i saw that the state was halfwitted that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons and that it did not know its friends from its foes and i lost all my remaining respect for it and pitied it  thus the state never intentionally confronts a mans sense intellectual or moral but only his body his senses it is not armed with superior wit or honesty but with superior physical strength  i was not born to be forced i will breathe after my own fashion  let us see who is the strongest  what force has a multitude  they only can force me who obey a higher law than i  they force me to become like themselves  i do not hear of men being forced to live this way or that by masses of men  what sort of life were that to live  when i meet a government which says to me your money or your life why should i be in haste to give it my money  it may be in a great strait and not know what to do  i cannot help that  it must help itself do as i do it is not worth the while to snivel about it  i am not responsible for the successful working of the machinery of society  i am not the son of the engineer  i perceive that when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side the one does not remain inert to make way for the other but both obey their own laws and spring and grow and flourish as best they can till one perchance overshadows and destroys the other  if a plant cannot live according to nature it dies and so a man  the night in prison was novel and interesting enough the prisoners in their shirtsleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the doorway when i entered  but the jailer said come boys it is time to lock up and so they dispersed and i heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments  my roommate was introduced to me by the jailer as a firstrate fellow and clever man  when the door was locked he showed me where to hang my hat and how he managed matters there  the rooms were whitewashed once a month and this one at least was the whitest most simply furnished and probably neatest apartment in town  he naturally wanted to know where i came from and what brought me there and when i had told him i asked him in my turn how he came there presuming him to be an honest man of course and as the world goes i believe he was  why said he they accuse me of burning a barn but i never did it  as near as i could discover he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk and smoked his pipe there and so a barn was burnt  he had the reputation of being a clever man had been there some three months waiting for his trial to come on and would have to wait as much longer but he was quite domesticated and contented since he got his board for nothing and thought that he was well treated  he occupied one window and i the other and i saw that if one stayed there long his principal business would be to look out the window  i had soon read all the tracts that were left there and examined where former prisoners had broken out and where a grate had been sawed off and heard the history of the various occupants of that room for i found that even there there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail  probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed which are afterward printed in a circular form but not published  i was shown quite a long list of young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape who avenged themselves by singing them  i pumped my fellowprisoner as dry as i could for fear i should never see him again but at length he showed me which was my bed and left me to blow out the lamp  it was like travelling into a far country such as i had never expected to behold to lie there for one night it seemed to me that i never had heard the town clock strike before nor the evening sounds of the village for we slept with the windows open which were inside the grating  it was to see my native village in the light of the middle ages and our concord was turned into a rhine stream and visions of knights and castles passed before me  they were the voices of old burghers that i heard in the streets  i was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the adjacent village inna wholly new and rare experience to me  it was a closer view of my native town  i was fairly inside of it  i never had seen its institutions before  this is one of its peculiar institutions for it is a shire town  i began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about  in the morning our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door in small oblongsquare tin pans made to fit and holding a pint of chocolate with brown bread and an iron spoon  when they called for the vessels again i was green enough to return what bread i had left but my comrade seized it and said that i should lay that up for lunch or dinner  soon after he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field whither he went every day and would not be back till noon so he bade me good day saying that he doubted if he should see me again  when i came out of prisonfor some one interfered and paid that taxi did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common such as he observed who went in a youth and emerged a grayheaded man and yet a change had come to my eyes come over the scenethe town and state and country greater than any that mere time could effect i saw yet more distinctly the state in which i lived  i saw to what extent the people among whom i lived could be trusted as good neighbors and friends that their friendship was for summer weather only that they did not greatly propose to do right that they were a distinct race from me by their prejudices and superstitions as the chinamen and malays are that in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks not even to their property that after all they were not so noble but they treated the thief as he had treated them and hoped by a certain outward observance and a few prayers and by walking in a particular straight though useless path from time to time to save their souls this may be to judge my neighbors harshly for i believe that many of them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in their village  it was formerly the custom in our village when a poor debtor came out of jail for his acquaintances to salute him looking through their fingers which were crossed to represent the jail window how do ye do my neighbors did not thus salute me but first looked at me and then at one another as if i had returned from a long journey  i was put into jail as i was going to the shoemakers to get a shoe which was mended  when i was let out the next morning i proceeded to finish my errand and having put on my mended shoe joined a huckleberry party who were impatient to put themselves under my conduct and in half an hourfor the horse was soon tackledwas in the midst of a huckleberry field on one of our highest hills two miles off and then the state was nowhere to be seen  this is the whole history of my prisons  i have never declined paying the highway tax because i am as desirous of being a good neighbor as i am of being a bad subject and as for supporting schools i am doing my part to educate my fellow countrymen now  it is for no particular item in the tax bill that i refuse to pay it  i simply wish to refuse allegiance to the state to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually  i do not care to trace the course of my dollar if i could till it buys a man or a  musket to shoot one withthe dollar is innocentbut i am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance  in fact i quietly declare war with the state after my fashion though i will still make use and get what advantages of her i can as is usual in such cases  if others pay the tax which is demanded of me from a sympathy with the state they do but what they have already done in their own case or rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the state requires  if they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed to save his property or prevent his going to jail it is because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere with the public good  this then is my position at present  but one cannot be too much on his guard in such a case lest his actions be biased by obstinacy or an undue regard for the opinions of men let him see that he does only what belongs to himself and to the hour  i think sometimes why this people mean well they are only ignorant they would do better if they knew how  why give your neighbors this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to  but i think again this is no reason why i should do as they do or permit others to suffer much greater pain of a different kind  again i sometimes say to myself when many millions of men without heat without ill will without personal feelings of any kind demand of you a few shillings only without the possibility such is their constitution of retracting or altering their present demand and without the possibility on your side of appeal to any other millions why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force  you do not resist cold and hunger the winds and the waves thus obstinately you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities  you do not put your head into the fire  but just in proportion as i regard this as not wholly a brute force but partly a human force and consider that i have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men and not of mere brute or inanimate things i see that appeal is possible first and instantaneously from them to the maker of them and secondly from them to themselves  but if i put my head deliberately into the fire there is no appeal to fire or to the maker of fire and i have only myself to blame if i could convince myself that i have any right to be satisfied with men as they are and to treat them accordingly and not according in some respects to my requisitions and expectations of what they and i ought to be then like a good mussulman and fatalist i should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are and say it is the will of god  and above all there is this difference between resisting this and a purely brute or natural force that i can resist this with some effect but i cannot expect like orpheus to change the nature of the rocks and trees and beasts  i do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation  i do not wish to split hairs to make fine distinctions or set myself up as better than my neighbors  i seek rather i may say even an excuse for conforming to the laws of the land i am but too ready to conform to them  indeed i have reason to suspect myself on this head and each year as the taxgatherer comes round i find myself disposed to review the acts and position of the general and state governments and the spirit of the people to discover a pretext for conformity      we must affect our country as our parents      and if at any time we alienate      our love or industry from doing it honor      we must respect effects and teach the soul      matter of conscience and religion      and not desire of rule or benefit  i believe that the state will soon be able to take all my work of this sort out of my hands and then i shall be no better patriot than my fellowcountrymen  seen from a lower point of view the constitution with all its faults is very good the law and the courts are very respectable even this state and this american government are in many respects very admirable and rare things to be thankful for such as a great many have described them seen from a higher still and the highest who shall say what they are or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all  however the government does not concern me much and i shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it  it is not many moments that i live under a government even in this world if a man is thoughtfree fancyfree imaginationfree that which is not never for a long time appearing to be to him unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him  i know that most men think differently from myself but those whose lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects content me as little as any statesmen and legislators standing so completely within the institution never distinctly and nakedly behold it they speak of moving society but have no restingplace without it  they may be men of a certain experience and discrimination and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful systems for which we sincerely thank them but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits  they are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency  webster never goes behind government and so cannot speak with authority about it his words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existing government but for thinkers and those who legislate for all time he never once glances at the subject  i know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would soon reveal the limits of his minds range and hospitality  yet compared with the cheap professions of most reformers and the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general his are almost the only sensible and valuable words and we thank heaven for him  comparatively he is always strong original and above all practical  still his quality is not wisdom but prudence  the lawyers truth is not truth but consistency or a consistent expediency truth is always in harmony with herself and is not concerned chiefly to reveal the justice that may consist with wrongdoing  he well deserves to be called as he has been called the defender of the constitution  there are really no blows to be given him but defensive ones  he is not a leader but a follower  his leaders are the men of 87  i have never made an effort he says and never propose to make an effort i have never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance an effort to disturb the arrangement as originally made by which various states came into the union  still thinking of the sanction which the constitution gives to slavery he says because it was part of the original compactlet it stand notwithstanding his special acuteness and ability he is unable to take a fact out of its merely political relations and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the intellectwhat for instance it behooves a man to do here in american today with regard to slaverybut ventures or is driven to make some such desperate answer to the following while professing to speak absolutely and as a private manfrom which what new and singular of social duties might be inferred  the manner says he in which the governments of the states where slavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration under the responsibility to their constituents to the general laws of propriety humanity and justice and to god  associations formed elsewhere springing from a feeling of humanity or any other cause have nothing whatever to do with it  they have never received any encouragement from me and they never will  these extracts have been inserted since the lecture was read hdt  they who know of no purer sources of truth who have traced up its stream no higher stand and wisely stand by the bible and the constitution and drink at it there with reverence and humanity but they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool gird up their loins once more and continue their pilgrimage toward its fountainhead  no man with a genius for legislation has appeared in america they are rare in the history of the world  there are orators politicians and eloquent men by the thousand but the speaker has not yet opened his mouth to speak who is capable of settling the muchvexed questions of the day we love eloquence for its own sake and not for any truth which it may utter or any heroism it may inspire  our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of free trade and of freedom of union and of rectitude to a nation  they have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance commerce and manufactures and agriculture  if we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in congress for our guidance uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people america would not long retain her rank among the nations  for eighteen hundred years though perchance i have no right to say it the new testament has been written yet where is the legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which it sheds on the science of legislation  the authority of government even such as i am willing to submit tofor i will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than i and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so wellis still an impure one  to be strictly just it must have the sanction and consent of the governed  it can have no pure right over my person and property but what i concede to it  the progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy from a limited monarchy to a democracy is a progress toward a true respect for the individual  even the chinese philosopher was wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire  is a democracy such as we know it the last improvement possible in government  is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man  there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its own power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly  i please myself with imagining a state at last which can afford to be just to all men and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor which even would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof from it not meddling with it nor embraced by it who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors and fellow men  a state which bore this kind of fruit and suffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened would prepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious state which i have also imagined but not yet anywhere seen
