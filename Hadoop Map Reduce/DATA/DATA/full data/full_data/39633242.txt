39633242	caesar and cleopatra   by george bernard shaw      act i  an october night on the syrian border of egypt towards the end of the xxxiii dynasty in the year 706 by roman computation afterwards reckoned by christian computation as 48 bc a great radiance of silver fire the dawn of a moonlit night is rising in the east the stars and the cloudless sky are our own contemporaries nineteen and a half centuries younger than we know them but you would not guess that from their appearance below them are two notable drawbacks of civilization a palace and soldiers the palace an old low syrian building of whitened mud is not so ugly as buckingham palace and the officers in the courtyard are more highly civilized than modern english officers for example they do not dig up the corpses of their dead enemies and mutilate them as we dug up cromwell and the mahdi they are in two groups one intent on the gambling of their captain belzanor a warrior of fifty who with his spear on the ground beside his knee is stooping to throw dice with a slylooking young persian recruit the other gathered about a guardsman who has just finished telling a naughty story still current in english barracks at which they are laughing uproariously they are about a dozen in number all highly aristocratic young egyptian guardsmen handsomely equipped with weapons and armor very unenglish in point of not being ashamed of and uncomfortable in their professional dress on the contrary rather ostentatiously and arrogantly warlike as valuing themselves on their military caste  belzanor is a typical veteran tough and wilful prompt capable and crafty where brute force will serve helpless and boyish when it will not an effective sergeant an incompetent general a deplorable dictator would if influentially connected be employed in the two last capacities by a modern european state on the strength of his success in the first is rather to be pitied just now in view of the fact that julius caesar is invading his country not knowing this is intent on his game with the persian whom as a foreigner he considers quite capable of cheating him  his subalterns are mostly handsome young fellows whose interest in the game and the story symbolizes with tolerable completeness the main interests in life of which they are conscious their spears are leaning against the walls or lying on the ground ready to their hands the corner of the courtyard forms a triangle of which one side is the front of the palace with a doorway the other a wall with a gateway the storytellers are on the palace side the gamblers on the gateway side close to the gateway against the wall is a stone block high enough to enable a nubian sentinel standing on it to look over the wall the yard is lighted by a torch stuck in the wall as the laughter from the group round the storyteller dies away the kneeling persian winning the throw snatches up the stake from the ground  belzanor by apis persian thy gods are good to thee  the persian try yet again o captain double or quits  belzanor no more i am not in the vein  the sentinel poising his javelin as he peers over the wall stand who goes there  they all start listening a strange voice replies from without  voice the bearer of evil tidings  belzanor calling to the sentry pass him  the sentinel grounding his javelin draw near o bearer of evil tidings  belzanor pocketing the dice and picking up his spear let us receive this man with honor he bears evil tidings  the guardsmen seize their spears and gather about the gate leaving a way through for the new comer  persian rising from his knee are evil tidings then honorable  belzanor o barbarous persian hear my instruction in egypt the bearer of good tidings is sacrificed to the gods as a thank offering but no god will accept the blood of the messenger of evil when we have good tidings we are careful to send them in the mouth of the cheapest slave we can find evil tidings are borne by young noblemen who desire to bring themselves into notice they join the rest at the gate  the sentinel pass o young captain and bow the head in the house of the queen  voice go anoint thy javelin with fat of swine o blackamoor for before morning the romans will make thee eat it to the very butt  the owner of the voice a fairhaired dandy dressed in a different fashion to that affected by the guardsmen but no less extravagantly comes through the gateway laughing he is somewhat battlestained and his left forearm bandaged comes through a torn sleeve in his right hand he carries a roman sword in its sheath he swaggers down the courtyard the persian on his right belzanor on his left and the guardsmen crowding down behind him  belzanor who art thou that laughest in the house of cleopatra the queen and in the teeth of belzanor the captain of her guard  the new comer i am bel affris descended from the gods  belzanor ceremoniously hail cousin  all except the persian hail cousin  persian all the queens guards are descended from the gods o stranger save myself i am persian and descended from many kings  bel affris to the guardsmen hail cousins to the persian condescendingly hail mortal  belzanor you have been in battle bel affris and you are a soldier among soldiers you will not let the queens women have the first of your tidings  bel affris i have no tidings except that we shall have our throats cut presently women soldiers and all  persian to belzanor i told you so  the sentinel who has been listening woe alas  bel affris calling to him peace peace poor ethiop destiny is with the gods who painted thee black to belzanor what has this mortal indicating the persian told you  belzanor he says that the roman julius caesar who has landed on our shores with a handful of followers will make himself master of egypt he is afraid of the roman soldiers the guardsmen laugh with boisterous scorn peasants brought up to scare crows and follow the plough sons of smiths and millers and tanners and we nobles consecrated to arms descended from the gods  persian belzanor the gods are not always good to their poor relations  belzanor hotly to the persian man to man are we worse than the slaves of caesar  bel affris stepping between them listen cousin man to man we egyptians are as gods above the romans  the guardsmen exultingly aha  bel affris but this caesar does not pit man against man he throws a legion at you where you are weakest as he throws a stone from a catapult and that legion is as a man with one head a thousand arms and no religion i have fought against them and i know  belzanor derisively were you frightened cousin  the guardsmen roar with laughter their eyes sparkling at the wit of their captain  bel affris no cousin but i was beaten they were frightened perhaps but they scattered us like chaff  the guardsmen much damped utter a growl of contemptuous disgust  belzanor could you not die  bel affris no that was too easy to be worthy of a descendant of the gods besides there was no time all was over in a moment the attack came just where we least expected it  belzanor that shows that the romans are cowards  bel affris they care nothing about cowardice these romans they fight to win the pride and honor of war are nothing to them  persian tell us the tale of the battle what befell  the guardsmen gathering eagerly round bel afris ay the tale of the battle  bel affris know then that i am a novice in the guard of the temple of ra in memphis serving neither cleopatra nor her brother ptolemy but only the high gods we went a journey to inquire of ptolemy why he had driven cleopatra into syria and how we of egypt should deal with the roman pompey newly come to our shores after his defeat by caesar at pharsalia what think ye did we learn even that caesar is coming also in hot pursuit of his foe and that ptolemy has slain pompey whose severed head he holds in readiness to present to the conqueror sensation among the guardsmen nay more we found that caesar is already come for we had not made half a days journey on our way back when we came upon a city rabble flying from his legions whose landing they had gone out to withstand  belzanor and ye the temple guard did you not withstand these legions  bel affris what man could that we did but there came the sound of a trumpet whose voice was as the cursing of a black mountain then saw we a moving wall of shields coming towards us you know how the heart burns when you charge a fortified wall but how if the fortified wall were to charge you  the persian exulting in having told them so did i not say it  bel affris when the wall came nigh it changed into a line of mencommon fellows enough with helmets leather tunics and breastplates every man of them flung his javelin the one that came my way drove through my shield as through a papyruslo there he points to the bandage on his left arm and would have gone through my neck had i not stooped they were charging at the double then and were upon us with short swords almost as soon as their javelins when a man is close to you with such a sword you can do nothing with our weapons they are all too long  the persian what did you do  bel affris doubled my fist and smote my roman on the sharpness of his jaw he was but mortal after all he lay down in a stupor and i took his sword and laid it on drawing the sword lo a roman sword with roman blood on it  the guardsmen approvingly good they take the sword and hand it round examining it curiously  the persian and your men  bel affris fled scattered like sheep  belzanor furiously the cowardly slaves leaving the descendants of the gods to be butchered  bel affris with acid coolness the descendants of the gods did not stay to be butchered cousin the battle was not to the strong but the race was to the swift the romans who have no chariots sent a cloud of horsemen in pursuit and slew multitudes then our high priests captain rallied a dozen descendants of the gods and exhorted us to die fighting i said to myself surely it is safer to stand than to lose my breath and be stabbed in the back so i joined our captain and stood then the romans treated us with respect for no man attacks a lion when the field is full of sheep except for the pride and honor of war of which these romans know nothing so we escaped with our lives and i am come to warn you that you must open your gates to caesar for his advance guard is scarce an hour behind me and not an egyptian warrior is left standing between you and his legions  the sentinel woe alas he throws down his javelin and flies into the palace  belzanor nail him to the door quick the guardsmen rush for him with their spears but he is too quick for them now this news will run through the palace like fire through stubble  bel affris what shall we do to save the women from the romans  belzanor why not kill them  persian because we should have to pay blood money for some of them better let the romans kill them it is cheaper  belzanor awestruck at his brain power o subtle one o serpent  bel affris but your queen  belzanor true we must carry off cleopatra  bel affris will ye not await her command  belzanor command a girl of sixteen not we at memphis ye deem her a queen here we know better i will take her on the crupper of my horse when we soldiers have carried her out of caesars reach then the priests and the nurses and the rest of them can pretend she is a queen again and put their commands into her mouth  persian listen to me belzanor  belzanor speak o subtle beyond thy years  the persian cleopatras brother ptolemy is at war with her let us sell her to him  the guardsmen o subtle one o serpent  belzanor we dare not we are descended from the gods but cleopatra is descended from the river nile and the lands of our fathers will grow no grain if the nile rises not to water them without our fathers gifts we should live the lives of dogs  persian it is true the queens guard cannot live on its pay but hear me further o ye kinsmen of osiris  the guardsmen speak o subtle one hear the serpent begotten  persian have i heretofore spoken truly to you of caesar when you thought i mocked you  guardsmen truly truly  belzanor reluctantly admitting it so bel affris says  persian hear more of him then this caesar is a great lover of women he makes them his friends and counselors  belzanor faugh this rule of women will be the ruin of egypt  the persian let it rather be the ruin of rome caesar grows old now he is past fifty and full of labors and battles he is too old for the young women and the old women are too wise to worship him  bel affris take heed persian caesar is by this time almost within earshot  persian cleopatra is not yet a woman neither is she wise but she already troubles mens wisdom  belzanor ay that is because she is descended from the river nile and a black kitten of the sacred white cat what then  persian why sell her secretly to ptolemy and then offer ourselves to caesar as volunteers to fight for the overthrow of her brother and the rescue of our queen the great granddaughter of the nile  the guardsmen o serpent  persian he will listen to us if we come with her picture in our mouths he will conquer and kill her brother and reign in egypt with cleopatra for his queen and we shall be her guard  guardsmen o subtlest of all the serpents o admiration o wisdom  bel affris he will also have arrived before you have done talking o word spinner  belzanor that is true an affrighted uproar in the palace interrupts him quick the flight has begun guard the door they rush to the door and form a cordon before it with their spears a mob of womenservants and nurses surges out those in front recoil from the spears screaming to those behind to keep back belzanors voice dominates the disturbance as he shouts back there in again unprofitable cattle  the guardsmen back unprofitable cattle  belzanor send us out ftatateeta the queens chief nurse  the women calling into the palace ftatateeta ftatateeta come come speak to belzanor  a woman oh keep back you are thrusting me on the spearheads  a huge grim woman her face covered with a network of tiny wrinkles and her eyes old large and wise sinewy handed very tall very strong with the mouth of a bloodhound and the jaws of a bulldog appears on the threshold she is dressed like a person of consequence in the palace and confronts the guardsmen insolently  ftatateeta make way for the queens chief nurse  belzanor with solemn arrogance ftatateeta i am belzanor the captain of the queens guard descended from the gods  ftatateeta retorting his arrogance with interest belzanor i am ftatateeta the queens chief nurse and your divine ancestors were proud to be painted on the wall in the pyramids of the kings whom my fathers served  the women laugh triumphantly  belzanor with grim humor ftatateeta daughter of a longtongued swiveleyed chameleon the romans are at hand a cry of terror from the women they would fly but for the spears not even the descendants of the gods can resist them for they have each man seven arms each carrying seven spears the blood in their veins is boiling quicksilver and their wives become mothers in three hours and are slain and eaten the next day  a shudder of horror from the women ftatateeta despising them and scorning the soldiers pushes her way through the crowd and confronts the spear points undismayed  ftatateeta then fly and save yourselves o cowardly sons of the cheap clay gods that are sold to fish porters and leave us to shift for ourselves  belzanor not until you have first done our bidding o terror of manhood bring out cleopatra the queen to us and then go whither you will  ftatateeta with a derisive laugh now i know why the gods have taken her out of our hands the guardsmen start and look at one another know thou foolish soldier that the queen has been missing since an hour past sun down  belzanor furiously hag you have hidden her to sell to caesar or her brother he grasps her by the left wrist and drags her helped by a few of the guard to the middle of the courtyard where as they fling her on her knees he draws a murderous looking knife where is she where is she orhe threatens to cut her throat  ftatateeta savagely touch me dog and the nile will not rise on your fields for seven times seven years of famine  belzanor frightened but desperate i will sacrifice i will pay or stay to the persian you o subtle one your fathers lands lie far from the nile slay her  persian threatening her with his knife persia has but one god yet he loves the blood of old women where is cleopatra  ftatateeta persian as osiris lives i do not know i chide her for bringing evil days upon us by talking to the sacred cats of the priests and carrying them in her arms i told her she would be left alone here when the romans came as a punishment for her disobedience and now she is gonerun awayhidden i speak the truth i call osiris to witness  the women protesting officiously she speaks the truth belzanor  belzanor you have frightened the child she is hiding searchquickinto the palacesearch every corner  the guards led by belzanor shoulder their way into the palace through the flying crowd of women who escape through the courtyard gate  ftatateeta screaming sacrilege men in the queens chambers sa her voice dies away as the persian puts his knife to her throat  bel affris laying a hand on ftatateetas left shoulder forbear her yet a moment persian to ftatateeta very significantly mother your gods are asleep or away hunting and the sword is at your throat bring us to where the queen is hid and you shall live  ftatateeta contemptuously who shall stay the sword in the hand of a fool if the high gods put it there listen to me ye young men without understanding cleopatra fears me but she fears the romans more there is but one power greater in her eyes than the wrath of the queens nurse and the cruelty of caesar and that is the power of the sphinx that sits in the desert watching the way to the sea what she would have it know she tells into the ears of the sacred cats and on her birthday she sacrifices to it and decks it with poppies go ye therefore into the desert and seek cleopatra in the shadow of the sphinx and on your heads see to it that no harm comes to her  bel affris to the persian may we believe this o subtle one  persian which way come the romans  bel affris over the desert from the sea by this very sphinx  persian to ftatateeta o mother of guile o aspics tongue you have made up this tale so that we two may go into the desert and perish on the spears of the romans lifting his knife taste death  ftatateeta not from thee baby she snatches his ankle from under him and flies stooping along the palace wall vanishing in the darkness within its precinct bel affris roars with laughter as the persian tumbles the guardsmen rush out of the palace with belzanor and a mob of fugitives mostly carrying bundles  persian have you found cleopatra  belzanor she is gone we have searched every corner  the nubian sentinel appearing at the door of the palace woe alas fly fly  belzanor what is the matter now  the nubian sentinel the sacred white cat has been stolen woe woe general panic they all fly with cries of consternation the torch is thrown down and extinguished in the rush darkness the noise of the fugitives dies away dead silence suspense then the blackness and stillness breaks softly into silver mist and strange airs as the windswept harp of memnon plays at the dawning of the moon it rises full over the desert and a vast horizon comes into relief broken by a huge shape which soon reveals itself in the spreading radiance as a sphinx pedestalled on the sands the light still clears until the upraised eyes of the image are distinguished looking straight forward and upward in infinite fearless vigil and a mass of color between its great paws defines itself as a heap of red poppies on which a girl lies motionless her silken vest heaving gently and regularly with the breathing of a dreamless sleeper and her braided hair glittering in a shaft of moonlight like a birds wing  suddenly there comes from afar a vaguely fearful sound it might be the bellow of a minotaur softened by great distance and memnons music stops silence then a few faint highringing trumpet notes then silence again then a man comes from the south with stealing steps ravished by the mystery of the night all wonder and halts lost in contemplation opposite the left flank of the sphinx whose bosom with its burden is hidden from him by its massive shoulder  the man hail sphinx salutation from julius caesar i have wandered in many lands seeking the lost regions from which my birth into this world exiled me and the company of creatures such as i myself i have found flocks and pastures men and cities but no other caesar no air native to me no man kindred to me none who can do my days deed and think my nights thought in the little world yonder sphinx my place is as high as yours in this great desert only i wander and you sit still i conquer and you endure i work and wonder you watch and wait i look up and am dazzled look down and am darkened look round and am puzzled whilst your eyes never turn from looking outout of the worldto the lost regionthe home from which we have strayed sphinx you and i strangers to the race of men are no strangers to one another have i not been conscious of you and of this place since i was born rome is a madmans dream this is my reality these starry lamps of yours i have seen from afar in gaul in britain in spain in thessaly signalling great secrets to some eternal sentinel below whose post i never could find and here at last is their sentinelan image of the constant and immortal part of my life silent full of thoughts alone in the silver desert sphinx sphinx i have climbed mountains at night to hear in the distance the stealthy footfall of the winds that chase your sands in forbidden playour invisible children o sphinx laughing in whispers my way hither was the way of destiny for i am he of whose genius you are the symbol part brute part woman and part godnothing of man in me at all have i read your riddle sphinx  the girl who has wakened and peeped cautiously from her nest to see who is speaking old gentleman  caesar starting violently and clutching his sword immortal gods  the girl old gentleman dont run away  caesar stupefied old gentleman dont run away this to julius caesar  the girl urgently old gentleman  caesar sphinx you presume on your centuries i am younger than you though your voice is but a girls voice as yet  the girl climb up here quickly or the romans will come and eat you  caesar running forward past the sphinxs shoulder and seeing her a child at its breast a divine child  the girl come up quickly you must get up at its side and creep round  caesar amazed who are you  the girl cleopatra queen of egypt  caesar queen of the gypsies you mean  cleopatra you must not be disrespectful to me or the sphinx will let the romans eat you come up it is quite cosy here  caesar to himself what a dream what a magnificent dream only let me not wake and i will conquer ten continents to pay for dreaming it out to the end he climbs to the sphinxs flank and presently reappears to her on the pedestal stepping round its right shoulder  cleopatra take care thats right now sit down you may have its other paw she seats herself comfortably on its left paw it is very powerful and will protect us but shivering and with plaintive loneliness it would not take any notice of me or keep me company i am glad you have come i was very lonely did you happen to see a white cat anywhere  caesar sitting slowly down on the right paw in extreme wonderment have you lost one  cleopatra yes the sacred white cat is it not dreadful i brought him here to sacrifice him to the sphinx but when we got a little way from the city a black cat called him and he jumped out of my arms and ran away to it do you think that the black cat can have been my greatgreatgreatgrandmother  caesar staring at her your greatgreatgreatgrandmother well why not nothing would surprise me on this night of nights  cleopatra i think it must have been my greatgrandmothers greatgrandmother was a black kitten of the sacred white cat and the river nile made her his seventh wife that is why my hair is so wavy and i always want to be let do as i like no matter whether it is the will of the gods or not that is because my blood is made with nile water  caesar what are you doing here at this time of night do you live here  cleopatra of course not i am the queen and i shall live in the palace at alexandria when i have killed my brother who drove me out of it when i am old enough i shall do just what i like i shall be able to poison the slaves and see them wriggle and pretend to ftatateeta that she is going to be put into the fiery furnace  caesar hm meanwhile why are you not at home and in bed  cleopatra because the romans are coming to eat us all you are not at home and in bed either  caesar with conviction yes i am i live in a tent and i am now in that tent fast asleep and dreaming do you suppose that i believe you are real you impossible little dream witch  cleopatra giggling and leaning trustfully towards him you are a funny old gentleman i like you  caesar ah that spoils the dream why dont you dream that i am young  cleopatra i wish you were only i think i should be more afraid of you i like men especially young men with round strong arms but i am afraid of them you are old and rather thin and stringy but you have a nice voice and i like to have somebody to talk to though i think you are a little mad it is the moon that makes you talk to yourself in that silly way  caesar what you heard that did you i was saying my prayers to the great sphinx  cleopatra but this isnt the great sphinx  caesar much disappointed looking up at the statue what  cleopatra this is only a dear little kitten of the sphinx why the great sphinx is so big that it has a temple between its paws this is my pet sphinx tell me do you think the romans have any sorcerers who could take us away from the sphinx by magic  caesar why are you afraid of the romans  cleopatra very seriously oh they would eat us if they caught us they are barbarians their chief is called julius caesar his father was a tiger and his mother a burning mountain and his nose is like an elephants trunk caesar involuntarily rubs his nose they all have long noses and ivory tusks and little tails and seven arms with a hundred arrows in each and they live on human flesh  caesar would you like me to show you a real roman  cleopatra terrified no you are frightening me  caesar no matter this is only a dream  cleopatra excitedly it is not a dream it is not a dream see see she plucks a pin from her hair and jabs it repeatedly into his arm  caesar ffffstop wrathfully how dare you  cleopatra abashed you said you were dreaming whimpering i only wanted to show you  caesar gently come come dont cry a queen mustnt cry he rubs his arm wondering at the reality of the smart am i awake he strikes his hand against the sphinx to test its solidity it feels so real that he begins to be alarmed and says perplexedly yes iquite panicstricken no impossible madness madness desperately back to campto camp he rises to spring down from the pedestal  cleopatra flinging her arms in terror round him no you shant leave me no no no dont go im afraidafraid of the romans  caesar as the conviction that he is really awake forces itself on him cleopatra can you see my face well  cleopatra yes it is so white in the moonlight  caesar are you sure it is the moonlight that makes me look whiter than an egyptian grimly do you notice that i have a rather long nose  cleopatra recoiling paralyzed by a terrible suspicion oh  caesar it is a roman nose cleopatra  cleopatra ah with a piercing scream she springs up darts round the left shoulder of the sphinx scrambles down to the sand and falls on her knees in frantic supplication shrieking bite him in two sphinx bite him in two i meant to sacrifice the white cati did indeedi caesar who has slipped down from the pedestal touches her on the shoulder ah she buries her head in her arms  caesar cleopatra shall i teach you a way to prevent caesar from eating you  cleopatra clinging to him piteously oh do do do i will steal ftatateetas jewels and give them to you i will make the river nile water your lands twice a year  caesar peace peace my child your gods are afraid of the romans you see the sphinx dare not bite me nor prevent me carrying you off to julius caesar  cleopatra in pleading murmurings you wont you wont you said you wouldnt  caesar caesar never eats women  cleopatra springing up full of hope what  caesar impressively but he eats girls she relapses and cats now you are a silly little girl and you are descended from the black kitten you are both a girl and a cat  cleopatra trembling and will he eat me  caesar yes unless you make him believe that you are a woman  cleopatra oh you must get a sorcerer to make a woman of me are you a sorcerer  caesar perhaps but it will take a long time and this very night you must stand face to face with caesar in the palace of your fathers  cleopatra no no i darent  caesar whatever dread may be in your soulhowever terrible caesar may be to youyou must confront him as a brave woman and a great queen and you must feel no fear if your hand shakes if your voice quavers thennight and death she moans but if he thinks you worthy to rule he will set you on the throne by his side and make you the real ruler of egypt  cleopatra despairingly no he will find me out he will find me out  caesar rather mournfully he is easily deceived by women their eyes dazzle him and he sees them not as they are but as he wishes them to appear to him  cleopatra hopefully then we will cheat him i will put on ftatateetas headdress and he will think me quite an old woman  caesar if you do that he will eat you at one mouthful  cleopatra but i will give him a cake with my magic opal and seven hairs of the white cat baked in it and  caesar abruptly pah you are a little fool he will eat your cake and you too he turns contemptuously from her  cleopatra running after him and clinging to him oh please please i will do whatever you tell me i will be good i will be your slave again the terrible bellowing note sounds across the desert now closer at hand it is the bucina the roman war trumpet  caesar hark  cleopatra trembling what was that  caesar caesars voice  cleopatra pulling at his hand let us run away come oh come  caesar you are safe with me until you stand on your throne to receive caesar now lead me thither  cleopatra only too glad to get away i will i will again the bucina oh come come come the gods are angry do you feel the earth shaking  caesar it is the tread of caesars legions  cleopatra drawing him away this way quickly and let us look for the white cat as we go it is he that has turned you into a roman  caesar incorrigible oh incorrigible away he follows her the bucina sounding louder as they steal across the desert the moonlight wanes the horizon again shows black against the sky broken only by the fantastic silhouette of the sphinx the sky itself vanishes in darkness from which there is no relief until the gleam of a distant torch falls on great egyptian pillars supporting the roof of a majestic corridor at the further end of this corridor a nubian slave appears carrying the torch caesar still led by cleopatra follows him they come down the corridor caesar peering keenly about at the strange architecture and at the pillar shadows between which as the passing torch makes them hurry noiselessly backwards figures of men with wings and hawks heads and vast black marble cats seem to flit in and out of ambush further along the wall turns a corner and makes a spacious transept in which caesar sees on his right a throne and behind the throne a door on each side of the throne is a slender pillar with a lamp on it  caesar what place is this  cleopatra this is where i sit on the throne when i am allowed to wear my crown and robes the slave holds his torch to show the throne  caesar order the slave to light the lamps  cleopatra shyly do you think i may  caesar of course you are the queen she hesitates go on  cleopatra timidly to the slave light all the lamps  ftatateeta suddenly coming from behind the throne stop the slave stops she turns sternly to cleopatra who quails like a naughty child who is this you have with you and how dare you order the lamps to be lighted without my permission cleopatra is dumb with apprehension  caesar who is she  cleopatra ftatateeta  ftatateeta arrogantly chief nurse to  caesar cutting her short i speak to the queen be silent to cleopatra is this how your servants know their places send her away and you to the slave do as the queen has bidden the slave lights the lamps meanwhile cleopatra stands hesitating afraid of ftatateeta you are the queen send her away  cleopatra cajoling ftatateeta dear you must go awayjust for a little  caesar you are not commanding her to go away you are begging her you are no queen you will be eaten farewell he turns to go  cleopatra clutching him no no no dont leave me  caesar a roman does not stay with queens who are afraid of their slaves  cleopatra i am not afraid indeed i am not afraid  ftatateeta we shall see who is afraid here menacingly cleopatra  caesar on your knees woman am i also a child that you dare trifle with me he points to the floor at cleopatras feet ftatateeta half cowed half savage hesitates caesar calls to the nubian slave the nubian comes to him can you cut off a head the nubian nods and grins ecstatically showing all his teeth caesar takes his sword by the scabbard ready to offer the hilt to the nubian and turns again to ftatateeta repeating his gesture have you remembered yourself mistress  ftatateeta crushed kneels before cleopatra who can hardly believe her eyes  ftatateeta hoarsely o queen forget not thy servant in the days of thy greatness  cleopatra blazing with excitement go begone go away ftatateeta rises with stooped head and moves backwards towards the door cleopatra watches her submission eagerly almost clapping her hands which are trembling suddenly she cries give me something to beat her with she snatches a snakeskin from the throne and dashes after ftatateeta whirling it like a scourge in the air caesar makes a bound and manages to catch her and hold her while ftatateeta escapes  caesar you scratch kitten do you  cleopatra breaking from him i will beat somebody i will beat him she attacks the slave there there there the slave flies for his life up the corridor and vanishes she throws the snakeskin away and jumps on the step of the throne with her arms waving crying i am a real queen at lasta real real queen cleopatra the queen caesar shakes his head dubiously the advantage of the change seeming open to question from the point of view of the general welfare of egypt she turns and looks at him exultantly then she jumps down from the step runs to him and flings her arms round him rapturously crying oh i love you for making me a queen  caesar but queens love only kings  cleopatra i will make all the men i love kings i will make you a king i will have many young kings with round strong arms and when i am tired of them i will whip them to death but you shall always be my king my nice kind wise proud old king  caesar oh my wrinkles my wrinkles and my childs heart you will be the most dangerous of all caesars conguests  cleopatra appalled caesar i forgot caesar anxiously you will tell him that i am a queen will you not a real queen listen stealthily coaxing him let us run away and hide until caesar is gone  caesar if you fear caesar you are no true queen and though you were to hide beneath a pyramid he would go straight to it and lift it with one hand and then he chops his teeth together  cleopatra trembling oh  caesar be afraid if you dare the note of the bucina resounds again in the distance she moans with fear caesar exalts in it exclaiming aha caesar approaches the throne of cleopatra come take your place he takes her hand and leads her to the throne she is too downcast to speak ho there teetatota how do you call your slaves  cleopatra spiritlessly as she sinks on the throne and cowers there shaking clap your hands  he claps his hands ftatateeta returns  caesar bring the queens robes and her crown and her women and prepare her  cleopatra eagerlyrecovering herself a little yes the crown ftatateeta i shall wear the crown  ftatateeta for whom must the queen put on her state  caesar for a citizen of rome a king of kings totateeta  cleopatra stamping at her how dare you ask questions go and do as you are told ftatateeta goes out with a grim smile cleopatra goes on eagerly to caesar caesar will know that i am a queen when he sees my crown and robes will he not  caesar no how shall he know that you are not a slave dressed up in the queens ornaments  cleopatra you must tell him  caesar he will not ask me he will know cleopatra by her pride her courage her majesty and her beauty she looks very doubtful are you trembling  cleopatra shivering with dread no iiin a very sickly voice no  ftatateeta and three women come in with the regalia  ftatateeta of all the queens women these three alone are left the rest are fled they begin to deck cleopatra who submits pale and motionless  caesar good good three are enough poor caesar generally has to dress himself  ftatateeta contemptuously the queen of egypt is not a roman barbarian to cleopatra be brave my nursling hold up your head before this stranger  caesar admiring cleopatra and placing the crown on her head is it sweet or bitter to be a queen cleopatra  cleopatra bitter  caesar cast out fear and you will conquer caesar tota are the romans at hand  ftatateeta they are at hand and the guard has fled  the women wailing subduedly woe to us  the nubian comes running down the hall  nubian the romans are in the courtyard he bolts through the door with a shriek the women fly after him ftatateetas jaw expresses savage resolution she does not budge cleopatra can hardly restrain herself from following them caesar grips her wrist and looks steadfastly at her she stands like a martyr  caesar the queen must face caesar alone answer so be it  cleopatra white so be it  caesar releasing her good  a tramp and tumult of armed men is heard cleopatras terror increases the bucina sounds close at hand followed by a formidable clangor of trumpets this is too much for cleopatra she utters a cry and darts towards the door ftatateeta stops her ruthlessly  ftatateeta you are my nursling you have said so be it and if you die for it you must make the queens word good she hands cleopatra to caesar who takes her back almost beside herself with apprehension to the throne  caesar now if you quail he seats himself on the throne  she stands on the step all but unconscious waiting for death the roman soldiers troop in tumultuously through the corridor headed by their ensign with his eagle and their bucinator a burly fellow with his instrument coiled round his body its brazen bell shaped like the head of a howling wolf when they reach the transept they stare in amazement at the throne dress into ordered rank opposite it draw their swords and lift them in the air with a shout of hail caesar cleopatra turns and stares wildly at caesar grasps the situation and with a great sob of relief falls into his arms     act ii  alexandria a hall on the first floor of the palace ending in a loggia approached by two steps through the arches of the loggia the mediterranean can be seen bright in the morning sun the clean lofty walls painted with a procession of the egyptian theocracy presented in profile as flat ornament and the absence of mirrors sham perspectives stuffy upholstery and textiles make the place handsome wholesome simple and cool or as a rich english manufacturer would express it poor bare ridiculous and unhomely for tottenham court road civilization is to this egyptian civilization as glass bead and tattoo civilization is to tottenham court road  the young king ptolemy dionysus aged ten is at the top of the steps on his way in through the loggia led by his guardian pothinus who has him by the hand the court is assembled to receive him it is made up of men and women some of the women being officials of various complexions and races mostly egyptian some of them comparatively fair from lower egypt some much darker from upper egypt with a few greeks and jews prominent in a group on ptolemys right hand is theodotus ptolemys tutor another group on ptolemys left is headed by achillas the general of ptolemys troops theodotus is a little old man whose features are as cramped and wizened as his limbs except his tall straight forehead which occupies more space than all the rest of his face he maintains an air of magpie keenness and profundity listening to what the others say with the sarcastic vigilance of a philosopher listening to the exercises of his disciples achillas is a tall handsome man of thirtyfive with a fine black beard curled like the coat of a poodle apparently not a clever man but distinguished and dignified pothinus is a vigorous man of fifty a eunuch passionate energetic and quick witted but of common mind and character impatient and unable to control his temper he has fine tawny hair like fur ptolemy the king looks much older than an english boy of ten but he has the childish air the habit of being in leading strings the mixture of impotence and petulance the appearance of being excessively washed combed and dressed by other hands which is exhibited by courtbred princes of all ages  all receive the king with reverences he comes down the steps to a chair of state which stands a little to his right the only seat in the hall taking his place before it he looks nervously for instructions to pothinus who places himself at his left hand  pothinus the king of egypt has a word to speak  theodotus in a squeak which he makes impressive by sheer selfopinionativeness peace for the kings word  ptolemy without any vocal inflexions he is evidently repeating a lesson take notice of this all of you i am the firstborn son of auletes the flute blower who was your king my sister berenice drove him from his throne and reigned in his stead butbut he hesitates  pothinus stealthily promptingbut the gods would not suffer  ptolemy yesthe gods would not suffernot suffer he stops then crestfallen i forget what the gods would not suffer  theodotus let pothinus the kings guardian speak for the king  pothinus suppressing his impatience with difficulty the king wished to say that the gods would not suffer the impiety of his sister to go unpunished  ptolemy hastily yes i remember the rest of it he resumes his monotone therefore the gods sent a stranger one mark antony a roman captain of horsemen across the sands of the desert and he set my father again upon the throne and my father took berenice my sister and struck her head off and now that my father is dead yet another of his daughters my sister cleopatra would snatch the kingdom from me and reign in my place but the gods would not suffer pothinus coughs admonitorilythe godsthe gods would not suffer  pothinus promptingwill not maintain  ptolemy oh yeswill not maintain such iniquity they will give her head to the axe even as her sisters but with the help of the witch ftatateeta she hath cast a spell on the roman julius caesar to make him uphold her false pretence to rule in egypt take notice then that i will not sufferthat i will not sufferpettishly to pothinuswhat is it that i will not suffer  pothinus suddenly exploding with all the force and emphasis of political passion the king will not suffer a foreigner to take from him the throne of our egypt a shout of applause tell the king achillas how many soldiers and horsemen follow the roman  theodotus let the kings general speak  achillas but two roman legions o king three thousand soldiers and scarce a thousand horsemen  the court breaks into derisive laughter and a great chattering begins amid which rufio a roman officer appears in the loggia he is a burly blackbearded man of middle age very blunt prompt and rough with small clear eyes and plump nose and cheeks which however like the rest of his flesh are in ironhard condition  rufio from the steps peace ho the laughter and chatter cease abruptly caesar approaches  theodotus with much presence of mind the king permits the roman commander to enter  caesar plainly dressed but wearing an oak wreath to conceal his baldness enters from the loggia attended by britannus his secretary a briton about forty tall solemn and already slightly bald with a heavy drooping hazelcolored moustache trained so as to lose its ends in a pair of trim whiskers he is carefully dressed in blue with portfolio inkhorn and reed pen at his girdle his serious air and sense of the importance of the business in hand is in marked contrast to the kindly interest of caesar who looks at the scene which is new to him with the frank curiosity of a child and then turns to the kings chair britannus and rufio posting themselves near the steps at the other side  caesar looking at pothinus and ptolemy which is the king the man or the boy  pothinus i am pothinus the guardian of my lord the king  caesar patting ptolemy kindly on the shoulder so you are the king dull work at your age eh to pothinus your servant pothinus he turns away unconcernedly and comes slowly along the middle of the hall looking from side to side at the courtiers until he reaches achillas and this gentleman  theodotus achillas the kings general  caesar to achillas very friendly a general eh i am a general myself but i began too old too old health and many victories achillas  achillas as the gods will caesar  caesar turning to theodotus and you sir are  theodotus theodotus the kings tutor  caesar you teach men how to be kings theodotus that is very clever of you looking at the gods on the walls as he turns away from theodotus and goes up again to pothinus and this place  pothinus the council chamber of the chancellors of the kings treasury caesar  caesar ah that reminds me i want some money  pothinus the kings treasury is poor caesar  caesar yes i notice that there is but one chair in it  rufio shouting gruffly bring a chair there some of you for caesar  ptolemy rising shyly to offer his chair caesar  caesar kindly no no my boy that is your chair of state sit down  he makes ptolemy sit down again meanwhile rufio looking about him sees in the nearest corner an image of the god ra represented as a seated man with the head of a hawk before the image is a bronze tripod about as large as a threelegged stool with a stick of incense burning on it rufio with roman resourcefulness and indifference to foreign superstitions promptly seizes the tripod shakes off the incense blows away the ash and dumps it down behind caesar nearly in the middle of the hall  rufio sit on that caesar  a shiver runs through the court followed by a hissing whisper of sacrilege  caesar seating himself now pothinus to business i am badly in want of money  britannus disapproving of these informal expressions my master would say that there is a lawful debt due to rome by egypt contracted by the kings deceased father to the triumvirate and that it is caesars duty to his country to require immediate payment  caesar blandly ah i forgot i have not made my companions known here pothinus this is britannus my secretary he is an islander from the western end of the world a days voyage from gaul britannus bows stiffly this gentleman is rufio my comrade in arms rufio nods pothinus i want 1600 talents  the courtiers appalled murmur loudly and theodotus and achillas appeal mutely to one another against so monstrous a demand  pothinus aghast forty million sesterces impossible there is not so much money in the kings treasury  caesar encouragingly only sixteen hundred talents pothinus why count it in sesterces a sestertius is only worth a loaf of bread  pothinus and a talent is worth a racehorse i say it is impossible we have been at strife here because the kings sister cleopatra falsely claims his throne the kings taxes have not been collected for a whole year  caesar yes they have pothinus my officers have been collecting them all the morning renewed whisper and sensation not without some stifled laughter among the courtiers  rufio bluntly you must pay pothinus why waste words you are getting off cheaply enough  pothinus bitterly is it possible that caesar the conqueror of the world has time to occupy himself with such a trifle as our taxes  caesar my friend taxes are the chief business of a conqueror of the world  pothinus then take warning caesar this day the treasures of the temples and the gold of the kings treasury will be sent to the mint to be melted down for our ransom in the sight of the people they shall see us sitting under bare walls and drinking from wooden cups and their wrath be on your head caesar if you force us to this sacrilege  caesar do not fear pothinus the people know how well wine tastes in wooden cups in return for your bounty i will settle this dispute about the throne for you if you will what say you  pothinus if i say no will that hinder you  rufio defiantly no  caesar you say the matter has been at issue for a year pothinus may i have ten minutes at it  pothinus you will do your pleasure doubtless  caesar good but first let us have cleopatra here  theodotus she is not in alexandria she is fled into syria  caesar i think not to rufio call totateeta  rufio calling ho there teetatota  ftatateeta enters the loggia and stands arrogantly at the top of the steps  ftatateeta who pronounces the name of ftatateeta the queens chief nurse  caesar nobody can pronounce it tota except yourself where is your mistress  cleopatra who is hiding behind ftafateeta peeps out at them laughing caesar rises  caesar will the queen favor us with her presence for a moment  cleopatra pushing ftatateeta aside and standing haughtily on the brink of the steps am i to behave like a queen  caesar yes  cleopatra immediately comes down to the chair of state seizes ptolemy and drags him out of his seat then takes his place in the chair ftatateeta seats herself on the step of the loggia and sits there watching the scene with sybilline intensity  ptolemy mortified and struggling with his tears caesar this is how she treats me always if i am a king why is she allowed to take everything from me  cleopatra you are not to be king you little crybaby you are to be eaten by the romans  caesar touched by ptolemys distress come here my boy and stand by me  ptolemy goes over to caesar who resuming his seat on the tripod takes the boys hand to encourage him cleopatra furiously jealous rises and glares at them  cleopatra with flaming cheeks take your throne i dont want it she flings away from the chair and approaches ptolemy who shrinks from her go this instant and sit down in your place  caesar go ptolemy always take a throne when it is offered to you  rufio i hope you will have the good sense to follow your own advice when we return to rome caesar  ptolemy slowly goes back to the throne giving cleopatra a wide berth in evident fear of her hands she takes his place beside caesar  caesar pothinus  cleopatra interrupting him are you not going to speak to me  caesar be quiet open your mouth again before i give you leave and you shall be eaten  cleopatra i am not afraid a queen must not be afraid eat my husband there if you like he is afraid  caesar starting your husband what do you mean  cleopatra pointing to ptolemy that little thing  the two romans and the briton stare at one another in amazement  theodotus caesar you are a stranger here and not conversant with our laws the kings and queens of egypt may not marry except with their own royal blood ptolemy and cleopatra are born king and consort just as they are born brother and sister  britannus shocked caesar this is not proper  theodotus outraged how  caesar recovering his selfpossession pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature  britannus on the contrary caesar it is these egyptians who are barbarians and you do wrong to encourage them i say it is a scandal  caesar scandal or not my friend it opens the gate of peace he rises and addresses pothinus seriously pothiuus hear what i propose  rufio hear caesar there  caesar ptolemy and cleopatra shall reign jointly in egypt  achillas what of the kings younger brother and cleopatras younger sister  rufio explaining there is another little ptolemy caesar so they tell me  caesar well the little ptolemy can marry the other sister and we will make them both a present of cyprus  pothinus impatiently cyprus is of no use to anybody  caesar no matter you shall have it for the sake of peace  britannus unconsciously anticipating a later statesman peace with honor pothinus  pothinus mutinously caesar be honest the money you demand is the price of our freedom take it and leave us to settle our own affairs  the bolder courtiers encouraged by pothinuss tone and caesars quietness yes yes egypt for the egyptians  the conference now becomes an altercation the egyptians becoming more and more heated caesar remains unruffled but rufio grows fiercer and doggeder and britannus haughtily indignant  rufio contemptuously egypt for the egyptians do you forget that there is a roman army of occupation here left by aulus gabinius when he set up your toy king for you  achillas suddenly asserting himself and now under my command i am the roman general here caesar  caesar tickled by the humor of the situation and also the egyptian general eh  pothinus triumphantly that is so caesar  caesar to achillas so you can make war on the egyptians in the name of rome and on the romanson me if necessaryin the name of egypt  achillas that is so caesar  caesar and which side are you on at present if i may presume to ask general  achillas on the side of the right and of the gods  caesar hm how many men have you  achillas that will appear when i take the field  rufio truculently are your men romans if not it matters not how many there are provided you are no stronger than 500 to ten  pothinus it is useless to try to bluff us rufio caesar has been defeated before and may be defeated again a few weeks ago caesar was flying for his life before pompey a few months hence he may be flying for his life before cato and juba of numidia the african king  achillas following up pothinuss speech menacingly what can you do with 4000 men  theodotus following up achillass speech with a raucous squeak and without money away with you  all the courtiers shouting fiercely and crowding towards caesar away with you egypt for the egyptians begone  rufio bites his beard too angry to speak caesar sits on comfortably as if he were at breakfast and the cat were clamoring for a piece of finnanhaddie  cleopatra why do you let them talk to you like that caesar are you afraid  caesar why my dear what they say is quite true  cleopatra but if you go away i shall not be queen  caesar i shall not go away until you are queen  pothinus achillas if you are not a fool you will take that girl whilst she is under your hand  rufio daring them why not take caesar as well achillas  pothinus retorting the defiance with interest well said rufio why not  rufio try achillas calling guard there  the loggia immediately fills with caesars soldiers who stand sword in hand at the top of the steps waiting the word to charge from their centurion who carries a cudgel for a moment the egyptians face them proudly then they retire sullenly to their former places  britannus you are caesars prisoners all of you  caesar benevolently oh no no no by no means caesars guests gentlemen  cleopatra wont you cut their heads off  caesar what cut off your brothers head  cleopatra why not he would cut off mine if he got the chance wouldnt you ptolemy  ptolemy pale and obstinate i would i will too when i grow up  cleopatra is rent by a struggle between her newlyacquired dignity as a queen and a strong impulse to put out her tongue at him she takes no part in the scene which follows but watches it with curiosity and wonder fidgeting with the restlessness of a child and sitting down on caesars tripod when he rises  pothinus caesar if you attempt to detain us  rufio he will succeed egyptian make up your mind to that we hold the palace the beach and the eastern harbor the road to rome is open and you shall travel it if caesar chooses  caesar courteously i could do no less pothinus to secure the retreat of my own soldiers i am accountable for every life among them but you are free to go so are all here and in the palace  rufio aghast at this clemency what renegades and all  caesar softening the expression roman army of occupation and all rufio  pothinus desperately then i make a last appeal to caesars justice i shall call a witness to prove that but for us the roman army of occupation led by the greatest soldier in the world would now have caesar at its mercy calling through the loggia ho there lucius septimius caesar starts deeply moved if my voice can reach you come forth and testify before caesar  caesar shrinking no no  theodotus yes i say let the military tribune bear witness  lucius septimius a clean shaven trim athlete of about 40 with symmetrical features resolute mouth and handsome thin roman nose in the dress of a roman officer comes in through the loggia and confronts caesar who hides his face with his robe for a moment then mastering himself drops it and confronts the tribune with dignity  pothinus bear witness lucius septimius caesar came hither in pursuit of his foe did we shelter his foe  lucius as pompeys foot touched the egyptian shore his head fell by the stroke of my sword  theodotus with viperish relish under the eyes of his wife and child remember that caesar they saw it from the ship he had just left we have given you a full and sweet measure of vengeance  caesar with horror vengeance  pothinus our first gift to you as your galley came into the roadstead was the head of your rival for the empire of the world bear witness lucius septimius is it not so  lucius it is so with this hand that slew pompey i placed his head at the feet of caesar  caesar murderer so would you have slain caesar had pompey been victorious at pharsalia  lucius woe to the vanquished caesar when i served pompey i slew as good men as he only because he conquered them his turn came at last  theodotus flatteringly the deed was not yours caesar but oursnay mine for it was done by my counsel thanks to us you keep your reputation for clemency and have your vengeance too  caesar vengeance vengeance oh if i could stoop to vengeance what would i not exact from you as the price of this murdered mans blood they shrink back appalled and disconcerted was he not my soninlaw my ancient friend for 20 years the master of great rome for 30 years the compeller of victory did not i as a roman share his glory was the fate that forced us to fight for the mastery of the world of our making am i julius caesar or am i a wolf that you fling to me the grey head of the old soldier the laurelled conqueror the mighty roman treacherously struck down by this callous ruffian and then claim my gratitude for it to lucius septimius begone you fill me with horror  lucius cold and undaunted pshaw you have seen severed heads before caesar and severed right hands too i think some thousands of them in gaul after you vanquished vercingetorix did you spare him with all your clemency was that vengeance  caesar no by the gods would that it had been vengeance at least is human no i say those severed right hands and the brave vercingetorix basely strangled in a vault beneath the capitol were with shuddering satire a wise severity a necessary protection to the commonwealth a duty of statesmanshipfollies and fictions ten times bloodier than honest vengeance what a fool was i then to think that mens lives should be at the mercy of such fools humbly lucius septimius pardon me why should the slayer of vercingetorix rebuke the slayer of pompey you are free to go with the rest or stay if you will i will find a place for you in my service  lucius the odds are against you caesar i go he turns to go out through the loggia  rufio full of wrath at seeing his prey escaping that means that he is a republican  lucius turning defiantly on the loggia steps and what are you  rufio a caesarian like all caesars soldiers  caesar courteously lucius believe me caesar is no caesarian were rome a true republic then were caesar the first of republicans but you have made your choice farewell  lucius farewell come achillas whilst there is yet time  caesar seeing that rufios temper threatens to get the worse of him puts his hand on his shoulder and brings him down the hall out of harms way britannus accompanying them and posting himself on caesars right hand this movement brings the three in a little group to the place occupied by achillas who moves haughtily away and joins theodotus on the other side lucius septimius goes out through the soldiers in the loggia pothinus theodotus and achillas follow him with the courtiers very mistrustful of the soldiers who close up in their rear and go out after them keeping them moving without much ceremony the king is left in his chair piteous obstinate with twitching face and fingers during these movements rufio maintains an energetic grumbling as follows  rufio as lucius departs do you suppose he would let us go if he had our heads in his hands  caesar i have no right to suppose that his ways are any baser than mine  rufio psha  caesar rufio if i take lucius septimius for my model and become exactly like him ceasing to be caesar will you serve me still  britannus caesar this is not good sense your duty to rome demands that her enemies should be prevented from doing further mischief caesar whose delight in the moral eyetobusiness of his british secretary is inexhaustible smiles intelligently  rufio it is no use talking to him britannus you may save your breath to cool your porridge but mark this caesar clemency is very well for you but what is it for your soldiers who have to fight tomorrow the men you spared yesterday you may give what orders you please but i tell you that your next victory will be a massacre thanks to your clemency i for one will take no prisoners i will kill my enemies in the field and then you can preach as much clemency as you please i shall never have to fight them again and now with your leave i will see these gentry off the premises he turns to go  caesar turning also and seeing ptolemy what have they left the boy alone oh shame shame  rufio taking ptolemys hand and making him rise come your majesty  ptolemy to caesar drawing away his hand from rufio is he turning me out of my palace  rufio grimly you are welcome to stay if you wish  caesar kindly go my boy i will not harm you but you will be safer away among your friends here you are in the lions mouth  ptolemy turning to go it is not the lion i fear but looking at rufio the jackal he goes out through the loggia  caesar laughing approvingly brave boy  cleopatra jealous of caesars approbation calling after ptolemy little silly you think that very clever  caesar britannus attend the king give him in charge to that pothinus fellow britannus goes out after ptolemy  rufio pointing to cleopatra and this piece of goods what is to be done with her however i suppose i may leave that to you he goes out through the loggia  cleopatra flushing suddenly and turning on caesar did you mean me to go with the rest  caesar a little preoccupied goes with a sigh to ptolemys chair whilst she waits for his answer with red cheeks and clenched fists you are free to do just as you please cleopatra  cleopatra then you do not care whether i stay or not  caesar smiling of course i had rather you stayed  cleopatra much much rather  caesar nodding much much rather  cleopatra then i consent to stay because i am asked but i do not want to mind  caesar that is quite understood calling totateeta  ftatateeta still seated turns her eyes on him with a sinister expression but does not move  cleopatra with a splutter of laughter her name is not totateeta it is ftatateeta calling ftatateeta ftatateeta instantly rises and comes to cleopatra  caesar stumbling over the name ftatafeeta will forgive the erring tongue of a roman tota the queen will hold her state here in alexandria engage women to attend upon her and do all that is needful  ftatateeta am i then the mistress of the queens household  cleopatra sharply no i am the mistress of the queens household go and do as you are told or i will have you thrown into the nile this very afternoon to poison the poor crocodiles  caesar shocked oh no no  cleopatra oh yes yes you are very sentimental caesar but you are clever and if you do as i tell you you will soon learn to govern  caesar quite dumbfounded by this impertinence turns in his chair and stares at her  ftatateeta smiling grimly and showing a splendid set of teeth goes leaving them alone together  caesar cleopatra i really think i must eat you after all  cleopatra kneeling beside him and looking at him with eager interest half real half affected to show how intelligent she is you must not talk to me now as if i were a child  caesar you have been growing up since the sphinx introduced us the other night and you think you know more than i do already  clfopatra taken down and anxious to justify herself no that would be very silly of me of course i know that but suddenly are you angry with me  caesar no  cleopatra only half believing him then why are you so thoughtful  caesar rising i have work to do cleopatra  cleopatra drawing back work offended you are tired of talking to me and that is your excuse to get away from me  caesar sitting down again to appease her well well another minute but thenwork  clfopatra work what nonsense you must remember that you are a king now i have made you one kings dont work   caesar oh who told you that little kitten eh  cleopatra my father was king of egypt and he never worked but he was a great king and cut off my sisters head because she rebelled against him and took the throne from him  caesar well and how did he get his throne back again  cleopatra eagerly her eyes lighting up i will tell you a beautiful young man with strong round arms came over the desert with many horsemen and slew my sisters husband and gave my father back his throne wistfully i was only twelve then oh i wish he would come again now that i am a queen i would make him my husband  caesar it might be managed perhaps for it was i who sent that beautiful young man to help your father  cleopatra enraptured you know him  caesar nodding i do  cleopatra has he come with you caesar shakes his head she is cruelly disappointed oh i wish he had i wish he had if only i were a little older so that he might not think me a mere kitten as you do but perhaps that is because you are old he is many many years younger than you is he not  caesar as if swallowing a pill he is somewhat younger  cleopatra would he be my husband do you think if i asked him  caesar very likely  cleopatra but i should not like to ask him could you not persuade him to ask mewithout knowing that i wanted him to  caesar touched by her innocence of the beautiful young mans character my poor child  cleopatra why do you say that as if you were sorry for me does he love anyone else  caesar i am afraid so  cleopatra tearfully then i shall not be his first love  caesar not quite the first he is greatly admired by women  cleopatra i wish i could be the first but if he loves me i will make him kill all the rest tell me is he still beautiful do his strong round arms shine in the sun like marble  caesar he is in excellent conditionconsidering how much he eats and drinks  cleopatra oh you must not say common earthly things about him for i love him he is a god  caesar he is a great captain of horsemen and swifter of foot than any other roman  cleopatra what is his real name  caesar puzzled his real name  cleopatra yes i always call him horus because horus is the most beautiful of our gods but i want to know his real name  caesar his name is mark antony  cleopatra musically mark antony mark antony mark antony what a beautiful name she throws her arms round caesars neck oh how i love you for sending him to help my father did you love my father very much  caesar no my child but your father as you say never worked i always work so when he lost his crown he had to promise me 16000 talents to get it back for him  cleopatra did he ever pay you  caesar not in full  cleopatra he was quite right it was too dear the whole world is not worth 16000 talents  caesar that is perhaps true cleopatra those egyptians who work paid as much of it as he could drag from them the rest is still due but as i most likely shall not get it i must go back to my work so you must run away for a little and send my secretary to me  cleopatra coaxing no i want to stay and hear you talk about mark antony  caesar but if i do not get to work pothinus and the rest of them will cut us off from the harbor and then the way from rome will be blocked  cleopatra no matter i dont want you to go back to rome  caesar but you want mark antony to come from it  cleopatra springing up oh yes yes yes i forgot go quickly and work caesar and keep the way over the sea open for my mark antony she runs out through the loggia kissing her hand to mark antony across the sea  caesar going briskly up the middle of the hall to the loggia steps ho britannus he is startled by the entry of a wounded roman soldier who confronts him from the upper step what now  soldier pointing to his bandaged head this caesar and two of my comrades killed in the market place  caesar quiet but attending ay why  soldier there is an army come to alexandria calling itself the roman army  caesar the roman army of occupation ay  soldier commanded by one achillas  caesar well  soldier the citizens rose against us when the army entered the gates i was with two others in the market place when the news came they set upon us i cut my way out and here i am  caesar good i am glad to see you alive rufio enters the loggia hastily passing behind the soldier to look out through one of the arches at the quay beneath rufio we are besieged  rufio what already  caesar now or tomorrow what does it matter we shall be besieged  britannus runs in  britannus caesar  caesar anticipating him yes i know rufio and britannus come down the hall from the loggia at opposite sides past caesar who waits for a moment near the step to say to the soldier comrade give the word to turn out on the beach and stand by the boats get your wound attended to go the soldier hurries out caesar comes down the hall between rufio and britannus rufio we have some ships in the west harbor burn them  rufio staring burn them

pothinus appears in the loggia and comes down the hall very haughtily to caesars left hand  caesar well pothinus  pothinus i have brought you our ultimatum caesar  caesar ultimatum the door was open you should have gone out through it before you declared war you are my prisoner now he goes to the chair and loosens his toga  pothinus scornfully i your prisoner do you know that you are in alexandria and that king ptolemy with an army outnumbering your little troop a hundred to one is in possession of alexandria  caesar unconcernedly taking off his toga and throwing it on the chair well my friend get out if you can and tell your friends not to kill any more romans in the market place otherwise my soldiers who do not share my celebrated clemency will probably kill you britannus pass the word to the guard and fetch my armor britannus runs out rufio returns well  rufio pointing from the loggia to a cloud of smoke drifting over the harbor see there pothinus runs eagerly up the steps to look out  caesar what ablaze already impossible  rufio yes five good ships and a barge laden with oil grappled to each but it is not my doing the egyptians have saved me the trouble they have captured the west harbor  caesar anxiously and the east harbor the lighthouse rufio  rufio with a sudden splutter of raging ill usage coming down to caesar and scolding him can i embark a legion in five minutes the first cohort is already on the beach we can do no more if you want faster work come and do it yourself  caesar soothing him good good patience rufio patience  rufio patience who is impatient here you or i would i be here if i could not oversee them from that balcony  caesar forgive me rufio and anxiously hurry them as much as  he is interrupted by an outcry as of an old man in the extremity of misfortune it draws near rapidly and theodotus rushes in tearing his hair and squeaking the most lamentable exclamations rufio steps back to stare at him amazed at his frantic condition pothinus turns to listen  theodotus on the steps with uplifted arms horror unspeakable woe alas help  rufio what now  caesar frowning who is slain  theodotus slain oh worse than the death of ten thousand men loss irreparable to mankind  rufio what has happened man  theodotus rushing down the hall between them the fire has spread from your ships the first of the seven wonders of the world perishes the library of alexandria is in flames  rufio psha quite relieved he goes up to the loggia and watches the preparations of the troops on the beach  caesar is that all  theodotus unable to believe his senses all caesar will you go down to posterity as a barbarous soldier too ignorant to know the value of books  caesar theodotus i am an author myself and i tell you it is better that the egyptians should live their lives than dream them away with the help of books  theodotus kneeling with genuine literary emotion the passion of the pedant caesar once in ten generations of men the world gains an immortal book  caesar inflexible if it did not flatter mankind the common executioner would burn it  theodotus without history death would lay you beside your meanest soldier  caesar death will do that in any case i ask no better grave  theodotus what is burning there is the memory of mankind  caesar a shameful memory let it burn  theodotus wildly will you destroy the past  caesar ay and build the future with its ruins theodotus in despair strikes himself on the temples with his fists but harken theodotus teacher of kings you who valued pompeys head no more than a shepherd values an onion and who now kneel to me with tears in your old eyes to plead for a few sheepskins scrawled with errors i cannot spare you a man or a bucket of water just now but you shall pass freely out of the palace now away with you to achillas and borrow his legions to put out the fire he hurries him to the steps  pothinus significantly you understand theodotus i remain a prisoner  theodotus a prisoner  caesar will you stay to talk whilst the memory of mankind is burning calling through the loggia ho there pass theodotus out to theodotus away with you  theodotus to pothinus i must go to save the library he hurries out  caesar follow him to the gate pothinus bid him urge your people to kill no more of my soldiers for your sake  pothinus my life will cost you dear if you take it caesar he goes out after theodotus  rufio absorbed in watching the embarkation does not notice the departure of the two egyptians  rufio shouting from the loggia to the beach all ready there  a centurion from below all ready we wait for caesar  caesar tell them caesar is comingthe rogues calling britannicus this magniloquent version of his secretarys name is one of caesars jokes in later years it would have meant quite seriously and officially conqueror of britain  rufio calling down push off all except the longboat stand by it to embark caesars guard there he leaves the balcony and comes down into the hall where are those egyptians is this more clemency have you let them go  caesar chuckling i have let theodotus go to save the library we must respect literature rufio  rufio raging folly on follys head i believe if you could bring back all the dead of spain gaul and thessaly to life you would do it that we might have the trouble of fighting them over again  caesar might not the gods destroy the world if their only thought were to be at peace next year rufio out of all patience turns away in anger caesar suddenly grips his sleeve and adds slyly in his ear besides my friend every egyptian we imprison means imprisoning two roman soldiers to guard him eh  rufio agh i might have known there was some foxs trick behind your fine talking he gets away from caesar with an illhumored shrug and goes to the balcony for another look at the preparations finally goes out  caesar is britannus asleep i sent him for my armor an hour ago calling britannicus thou british islander britannicus  cleopatra runs in through the loggia with caesars helmet and sword snatched from britannus who follows her with a cuirass and greaves they come down to caesar she to his left hand britannus to his right  cleopatra i am going to dress you caesar sit down he obeys these roman helmets are so becoming she takes off his wreath oh she bursts out laughing at him  caesar what are you laughing at  cleopatra youre bald beginning with a big b and ending with a splutter  caesar almost annoyed cleopatra he rises for the convenience of britannus who puts the cuirass on him  cleopatra so that is why you wear the wreathto hide it  britannus peace egyptian they are the bays of the conqueror he buckles the cuirass  cleopatra peace thou islander to caesar you should rub your head with strong spirits of sugar caesar that will make it grow  caesar with a wry face cleopatra do you like to be reminded that you are very young  cleopatra pouting no  caesar sitting down again and setting out his leg for britannus who kneels to put on his greaves neither do i like to be reminded that i ammiddle aged let me give you ten of my superfluous years that will make you 26 and leave me onlyno matter is it a bargain  cleopatra agreed 26 mind she puts the helmet on him oh how nice you look only about 50 in it  britannus looking up severely at cleopatra you must not speak in this manner to caesar  cleopatra is it true that when caesar caught you on that island you were painted all over blue  britannus blue is the color worn by all britons of good standing in war we stain our bodies blue so that though our enemies may strip us of our clothes and our lives they cannot strip us of our respectability he rises  cleopatra with caesars sword let me hang this on now you look splendid have they made any statues of you in rome  caesar yes many statues  cleopatra you must send for one and give it to me  rufio coming back into the loggia more impatient than ever now caesar have you done talking the moment your foot is aboard there will be no holding our men back the boats will race one another for the lighthouse  caesar drawing his sword and trying the edge is this well set today britannicus at pharsalia it was as blunt as a barrelhoop  britannus it will split one of the egyptians hairs today caesar i have set it myself  cleopatra suddenly throwing her arms in terror round caesar oh you are not really going into battle to be killed  caesar no cleopatra no man goes to battle to be killed  cleopatra but they do get killed my sisters husband was killed in battle you must not go let him go pointing to rufio they all laugh at her oh please please dont go what will happen to me if you never come back  caesar gravely are you afraid  cleopatra shrinking no  caesar with quiet authority go to the balcony and you shall see us take the pharos you must learn to look on battles go she goes downcast and looks out from the balcony that is well now rufio march  cleopatra suddenly clapping her hands oh you will not be able to go  caesar why what now  cleopatra they are drying up the harbor with bucketsa multitude of soldiersover there pointing out across the sea to her leftthey are dipping up the water  rufio hastening to look it is true the egyptian army crawling over the edge of the west harbor like locusts with sudden anger he strides down to caesar this is your accursed clemency caesar theodotus has brought them  caesar delighted at his own cleverness i meant him to rufio they have come to put out the fire the library will keep them busy whilst we seize the lighthouse eh he rushes out buoyantly through the loggia followed by britannus  rufio disgustedly more foxing agh he rushes off a shout from the soldiers announces the appearance of caesar below  centurion below all aboard give way there another shout  cleopatra waving her scarf through the loggia arch goodbye goodbye dear caesar come back safe goodbye     act iii  the edge of the quay in front of the palace looking out west over the east harbor of alexandria to pharos island just off the end of which and connected with it by a narrow mole is the famous lighthouse a gigantic square tower of white marble diminishing in size storey by storey to the top on which stands a cresset beacon the island is joined to the main land by the heptastadium a great mole or causeway five miles long bounding the harbor on the south  in the middle of the quay a roman sentinel stands on guard pilum in hand looking out to the lighthouse with strained attention his left hand shading his eyes the pilum is a stout wooden shaft 41 feet long with an iron spit about three feet long fixed in it the sentinel is so absorbed that he does not notice the approach from the north end of the quay of four egyptian market porters carrying rolls of carpet preceded by ftatateeta and apollodorus the sicilian apollodorus is a dashing young man of about 24 handsome and debonair dressed with deliberate astheticism in the most delicate purples and dove greys with ornaments of bronze oxydized silver and stones of jade and agate his sword designed as carefully as a medieval cross has a blued blade showing through an openwork scabbard of purple leather and filagree the porters conducted by ftatateeta pass along the quay behind the sentinel to the steps of the palace where they put down their bales and squat on the ground apollodorus does not pass along with them he halts amused by the preoccupation of the sentinel  apollodorus calling to the sentinel who goes there eh  sentinel starting violently and turning with his pilum at the charge revealing himself as a small wiry sandyhaired conscientious young man with an elderly face whats this stand who are you  apollodorus i am apollodorus the sicilian why man what are you dreaming of since i came through the lines beyond the theatre there i have brought my caravan past three sentinels all so busy staring at the lighthouse that not one of them challenged me is this roman discipline  sentinel we are not here to watch the land but the water caesar has just landed on the pharos looking at ftatateeta what have you here who is this piece of egyptian crockery  ftatateeta apollodorus rebuke this roman dog and bid him bridle his tongue in the presence of ftatateeta the mistress of the queens household  apollodorus my friend this is a great lady who stands high with caesar  sentinel not at all impressed pointing to the carpets and what is all this truck  apollodorus carpets for the furnishing of the queens apartments in the palace i have picked them from the best carpets in the world and the queen shall choose the best of my choosing  sentinel so you are the carpet merchant  apollodorus hurt my friend i am a patrician  sentinel a patrician a patrician keeping a shop instead of following arms  apollodorus i do not keep a shop mine is a temple of the arts i am a worshipper of beauty my calling is to choose beautiful things for beautiful queens my motto is art for arts sake  sentinel that is not the password  apollodorus it is a universal password  sentinel i know nothing about universal passwords either give me the password for the day or get back to your shop  ftatateeta roused by his hostile tone steals towards the edge of the quay with the step of a panther and gets behind him  apollodorus how if i do neither  sentinel then i will drive this pilum through you  apollodorus at your service my friend he draws his sword and springs to his guard with unruffled grace  ftatateeta suddenly seizing the sentinels arms from behind thrust your knife into the dogs throat apollodorus the chivalrous apollodorus laughingly shakes his head breaks ground away from the sentinel towards the palace and lowers his point  sentinel struggling vainly curse on you let me go help ho  ftatateeta lifting him from the ground stab the little roman reptile spit him on your sword  a couple of roman soldiers with a centurion come running along the edge of the quay from the north end they rescue their comrade and throw off ftatateeta who is sent reeling away on the left hand of the sentinel  centurion an unattractive man of fifty short in his speech and manners with a vine wood cudgel in his hand how now what is all this  ftatateeta to apollodorus why did you not stab him there was time  apollodorus centurion i am here by order of the queen to  centurion interrupting him the queen yes yes to the sentinel pass him in pass all these bazaar people in to the queen with their goods but mind you pass no one out that you have not passed innot even the queen herself  sentinel this old woman is dangerous she is as strong as three men she wanted the merchant to stab me  apollodorus centurion i am not a merchant i am a patrician and a votary of art  centurion is the woman your wife  apollodorus horrified no no correcting himself politely not that the lady is not a striking figure in her own way but emphatically she is not my wife  ftatateeta to the centurion roman i am ftatateeta the mistress of the queens household  centurion keep your hands off our men mistress or i will have you pitched into the harbor though you were as strong as ten men to his men to your posts march he returns with his men the way they came  ftatateeta looking malignantly after him we shall see whom isis loves best her servant ftatateeta or a dog of a roman  sentinel to apollodorus with a wave of his pilum towards the palace pass in there and keep your distance turning to ftatateeta come within a yard of me you old crocodile and i will give you this the pilum in your jaws  cleopatra calling from the palace ftatateeta ftatateeta  ftatateeta looking up scandalized go from the window go from the window there are men here  cleopatra i am coming down  ftatateeta distracted no no what are you dreaming of o ye gods ye gods apollodorus bid your men pick up your bales and in with me quickly  apollodorus obey the mistress of the queens household  ftatateeta impatiently as the porters stoop to lift the bales quick quick she will be out upon us cleopatra comes from the palace and runs across the quay to ftatateeta oh that ever i was born  cleopatra eagerly ftatateeta i have thought of something i want a boatat once  ftatateeta a boat no no you cannot apollodorus speak to the queen  apollodorus gallantly beautiful queen i am apollodorus the sicilian your servant from the bazaar i have brought you the three most beautiful persian carpets in the world to choose from  cleopatra i have no time for carpets today get me a boat  ftatateeta what whim is this you cannot go on the water except in the royal barge  apollodorus royalty ftatateeta lies not in the barge but in the queen to cleopatra the touch of your majestys foot on the gunwale of the meanest boat in the harbor will make it royal he turns to the harbor and calls seaward ho there boatman pull in to the steps  cleopatra apollodorus you are my perfect knight and i will always buy my carpets through you apollodorus bows joyously an oar appears above the quay and the boatman a bulletheaded vivacious grinning fellow burnt almost black by the sun comes up a flight of steps from the water on the sentinels right oar in hand and waits at the top can you row apollodorus  apollodorus my oars shall be your majestys wings whither shall i row my queen to the lighthouse come she makes for the steps  sentinel opposing her with his pilum at the charge stand you cannot pass  cleopatra flushing angrily how dare you do you know that i am the queen  sentinel i have my orders you cannot pass  cleopatra i will make caesar have you killed if you do not obey me  sentinel he will do worse to me if i disobey my officer stand back  cleopatra ftatateeta strangle him  sentinel alarmedlooking apprehensively at ftatateeta and brandishing his pilum keep off there  cleopatra running to apollodorus apollodorus make your slaves help us  apollodorus i shall not need their help lady he draws his sword now soldier choose which weapon you will defend yourself with shall it be sword against pilum or sword against sword  sentinel roman against sicilian curse you take that he hurls his pilum at apollodorus who drops expertly on one knee the pilum passes whizzing over his head and falls harmless apollodorus with a cry of triumph springs up and attacks the sentinel who draws his sword and defends himself crying ho there guard help  cleopatra half frightened half delighted takes refuge near the palace where the porters are squatting among the bales the boatman alarmed hurries down the steps out of harms way but stops with his head just visible above the edge of the quay to watch the fight the sentinel is handicapped by his fear of an attack in the rear from ftatateeta his swordsmanship which is of a rough and ready sort is heavily taxed as he has occasionally to strike at her to keep her off between a blow and a guard with apollodorus the centurion returns with several soldiers apollodorus springs back towards cleopatra as this reinforcement confronts him  centurion coming to the sentinels right hand what is this what now  sentinel panting i could do well enough for myself if it werent for the old woman keep her off me that is all the help i need  centurion make your report soldier what has happened  ftatateeta centurion he would have slain the queen  sentinel bluntly i would sooner than let her pass she wanted to take boat and goso she saidto the lighthouse i stopped her as i was ordered to and she set this fellow on me he goes to pick up his pilum and returns to his place with it  centurion turning to cleopatra cleopatra i am loath to offend you but without caesars express order we dare not let you pass beyond the roman lines  apollodorus well centurion and has not the lighthouse been within the roman lines since caesar landed there  cleopatra yes yes answer that if you can  centurion to apollodorus as for you apollodorus you may thank the gods that you are not nailed to the palace door with a pilum for your meddling  apollodorus urbanely my military friend i was not born to be slain by so ugly a weapon when i fall it will be holding up his sword by this white queen of arms the only weapon fit for an artist and now that you are convinced that we do not want to go beyond the lines let me finish killing your sentinel and depart with the queen  centurion as the sentinel makes an angry demonstration peace there cleopatra i must abide by my orders and not by the subtleties of this sicilian you must withdraw into the palace and examine your carpets there  cleopatra pouting i will not i am the queen caesar does not speak to me as you do have caesars centurions changed manners with his scullions  centurion sulkily i do my duty that is enough for me  apollodorus majesty when a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of he always declares that it is his duty  centurion angry apollodorus  apollodorus interrupting him with defiant elegance i will make amends for that insult with my sword at fitting time and place who says artist says duelist to cleopatra hear my counsel star of the east until word comes to these soldiers from caesar himself you are a prisoner let me go to him with a message from you and a present and before the sun has stooped half way to the arms of the sea i will bring you back caesars order of release  centurion sneering at him and you will sell the queen the present no doubt  apollodorus centurion the queen shall have from me without payment as the unforced tribute of sicilian taste to egyptian beauty the richest of these carpets for her present to caesar  cleopatra exultantly to the centurion now you see what an ignorant common creature you are  centurion curtly well a fool and his wares are soon parted he turns to his men two more men to this post here and see that no one leaves the palace but this man and his merchandize if he draws his sword again inside the lines kill him to your posts march  he goes out leaving two auxiliary sentinels with the other  apollodorus with polite goodfellowship my friends will you not enter the palace and bury our quarrel in a bowl of wine he takes out his purse jingling the coins in it the queen has presents for you all  sentinel very sulky you heard our orders get about your business  first auxiliary yes you ought to know better off with you  second auxiliary looking longingly at the pursethis sentinel is a hooknosed man unlike his comrade who is squab faced do not tantalize a poor man  apollodorus to cleopatra pearl of queens the centurion is at hand and the roman soldier is incorruptible when his officer is looking i must carry your word to caesar  cleopatra who has been meditating among the carpets are these carpets very heavy  apollodorus it matters not how heavy there are plenty of porters  cleopatra how do they put the carpets into boats do they throw them down  apollodorus not into small boats majesty it would sink them  cleopatra not into that mans boat for instance pointing to the boatman  apollodorus no too small  cleopatra but you can take a carpet to caesar in it if i send one  apollodorus assuredly  cleopatra and you will have it carried gently down the steps and take great care of it  apollodorus depend on me  cleopatra great great care  apollodorus more than of my own body  cleopatra you will promise me not to let the porters drop it or throw it about  apollodorus place the most delicate glass goblet in the palace in the heart of the roll queen and if it be broken my head shall pay for it  cleopatra good come ftatateeta ftatateeta comes to her apollodorus offers to squire them into the palace no apollodorus you must not come i will choose a carpet for myself you must wait here she runs into the palace  apollodorus to the porters follow this lady indicating ftatateeta and obey her  the porters rise and take up their bales  ftatateeta addressing the porters as if they were vermin this way and take your shoes off before you put your feet on those stairs  she goes in followed by the porters with the carpets meanwhile apollodorus goes to the edge of the quay and looks out over the harbor the sentinels keep their eyes on him malignantly  apollodorus addressing the sentinel my friend  sentinel rudely silence there  first auxiliary shut your muzzle you  second auxiliary in a half whisper glancing apprehensively towards the north end of the quay cant you wait a bit  apollodorus patience worthy threeheaded donkey they mutter ferociously but he is not at all intimidated listen were you set here to watch me or to watch the egyptians  sentinel we know our duty  apollodorus then why dont you do it theres something going on over there pointing southwestward to the mole  sentinel sulkily i do not need to be told what to do by the like of you  apollodorus blockhead he begins shouting ho there centurion hoiho  sentinel curse your meddling shouting hoiho alarm alarm  first and second auxiliaries alarm alarm hoiho  the centurion comes running in with his guard  centurion what now has the old woman attacked you again seeing apollodorus are you here still  apollodorus pointing as before see there the egyptians are moving they are going to recapture the pharos they will attack by sea and land by land along the great mole by sea from the west harbor stir yourselves my military friends the hunt is up a clangor of trumpets from several points along the quay aha i told you so  centurion quickly the two extra men pass the alarm to the south posts one man keep guard here the rest with mequick  the two auxiliary sentinels run off to the south the centurion and his guard run of northward and immediately afterwards the bucina sounds the four porters come from the palace carrying a carpet followed by ftatateeta  sentinel handling his pilum apprehensively you again the porters stop  ftatateeta peace roman fellow you are now singlehanded apollodorus this carpet is cleopatras present to caesar it has rolled up in it ten precious goblets of the thinnest iberian crystal and a hundred eggs of the sacred blue pigeon on your honor let not one of them be broken  apollodorus on my head be it to the porters into the boat with them carefully  the porters carry the carpet to the steps  first porter looking down at the boat beware what you do sir those eggs of which the lady speaks must weigh more than a pound apiece this boat is too small for such a load  boatman excitedly rushing up the steps oh thou injurious porter oh thou unnatural son of a shecamel to apollodorus my boat sir hath often carried five men shall it not carry your lordship and a bale of pigeons eggs to the porter thou mangey dromedary the gods shall punish thee for this envious wickedness  first porter stolidly i cannot quit this bale now to beat thee but another day i will lie in wait for thee  appolodorus going between them peace there if the boat were but a single plank i would get to caesar on it  ftatateeta anxiously in the name of the gods apollodorus run no risks with that bale  apollodorus fear not thou venerable grotesque i guess its great worth to the porters down with it i say and gently or ye shall eat nothing but stick for ten days  the boatman goes down the steps followed by the porters with the bale ftatateeta and apollodorus watching from the edge  apollodorus gently my sons my childrenwith sudden alarm gently ye dogs lay it level in the sternsotis well  ftatateeta screaming down at one of the porters do not step on it do not step on it oh thou brute beast  first porter ascending be not excited mistress all is well  ftatateeta panting all well oh thou hast given my heart a turn she clutches her side gasping  the four porters have now come up and are waiting at the stairhead to be paid  apollodorus here ye hungry ones he gives money to the first porter who holds it in his hand to show to the others they crowd greedily to see how much it is quite prepared after the eastern fashion to protest to heaven against their patrons stinginess but his liberality overpowers them  first porter o bounteous prince  second porter o lord of the bazaar  third porter o favored of the gods  fourth porter o father to all the porters of the market  sentinel enviously threatening them fiercely with his pilum hence dogs off out of this they fly before him northward along the quay  apollodorus farewell ftatateeta i shall be at the lighthouse before the egyptians he descends the steps  ftatateeta the gods speed thee and protect my nursling  the sentry returns from chasing the porters and looks down at the boat standing near the stairhead lest ftatateeta should attempt to escape  apollodorus from beneath as the boat moves off farewell valiant pilum pitcher  sentinel farewell shopkeeper  apollodorus ha ha pull thou brave boatman pull so hooooo he begins to sing in barcarolle measure to the rhythm of the oars  my heart my heart spread out thy wings shake off thy heavy load of love  give me the oars o son of a snail  sentinel threatening ftatateeta now mistress back to your henhouse in with you  ftatateeta falling on her knees and stretching her hands over the waters gods of the seas bear her safely to the shore  sentinel bear who safely what do you mean  ftatateeta looking darkly at him gods of egypt and of vengeance let this roman fool be beaten like a dog by his captain for suffering her to be taken over the waters  sentinel accursed one is she then in the boat he calls over the sea hoiho there boatman hoiho  apollodorus singing in the distance my heart my heart be whole and free love is thine only enemy  meanwhile rufio the mornings fighting done sits munching dates on a faggot of brushwood outside the door of the lighthouse which towers gigantic to the clouds on his left his helmet full of dates is between his knees and a leathern bottle of wine is by his side behind him the great stone pedestal of the lighthouse is shut in from the open sea by a low stone parapet with a couple of steps in the middle to the broad coping a huge chain with a hook hangs down from the lighthouse crane above his head faggots like the one he sits on lie beneath it ready to be drawn up to feed the beacon  caesar is standing on the step at the parapet looking out anxiously evidently ill at ease britannus comes out of the lighthouse door  rufio well my british islander have you been up to the top  britannus i have i reckon it at 200 feet high  rufio anybody up there  britannus one elderly tyrian to work the crane and his son a well conducted youth of 14  rufio looking at the chain what an old man and a boy work that twenty men you mean  britannus two only i assure you they have counterweights and a machine with boiling water in it which i do not understand it is not of british design they use it to haul up barrels of oil and faggots to burn in the brazier on the roof  rufio but  britannus excuse me i came down because there are messengers coming along the mole to us from the island i must see what their business is he hurries out past the lighthouse  caesar coming away from the parapet shivering and out of sorts rufio this has been a mad expedition we shall be beaten i wish i knew how our men are getting on with that barricade across the great mole  rufio angrily must i leave my food and go starving to bring you a report  caesar soothing him nervously no rufio no eat my son eat he takes another turn rufio chewing dates meanwhile the egyptians cannot be such fools as not to storm the barricade and swoop down on us here before it is finished it is the first time i have ever run an avoidable risk i should not have come to egypt  rufio an hour ago you were all for victory  caesar apologetically yes i was a foolrash rufioboyish  rufio boyish not a bit of it here offering him a handful of dates  caesar what are these for  rufio to eat thats whats the matter with you when a man comes to your age he runs down before his midday meal eat and drink and then have another look at our chances  caesar taking the dates my age he shakes his head and bites a date yes rufio i am an old manworn out nowtrue quite true he gives way to melancholy contemplation and eats another date achillas is still in his prime ptolemy is a boy he eats another date and plucks up a little well every dog has his day and i have had mine i cannot complain with sudden cheerfulness these dates are not bad rufio britannus returns greatly excited with a leathern bag caesar is himself again in a moment what now  britannus triumphantly our brave rhodian mariners have captured a treasure there he throws the bag down at caesars feet our enemies are delivered into our hands  caesar in that bag  britannus wait till you hear caesar this bag contains all the letters which have passed between pompeys party and the army of occupation here  caesar well  britannus impatient of caesars slowness to grasp the situation well we shall now know who your foes are the name of every man who has plotted against you since you crossed the rubicon may be in these papers for all we know  caesar put them in the fire  britannus put themhe gasps  caesar in the fire would you have me waste the next three years of my life in proscribing and condemning men who will be my friends when i have proved that my friendship is worth more than pompeys wasthan catos is o incorrigible british islander am i a bull dog to seek quarrels merely to show how stubborn my jaws are  britannus but your honorthe honor of rome  caesar i do not make human sacrifices to my honor as your druids do since you will not burn these at least i can drown them he picks up the bag and throws it over the parapet into the sea  britannus caesar this is mere eccentricity are traitors to be allowed to go free for the sake of a paradox  rufio rising caesar when the islander has finished preaching call me again i am going to have a look at the boiling water machine he goes into the lighthouse  britannus with genuine feeling o caesar my great master if i could but persuade you to regard life seriously as men do in my country  caesar do they truly do so britannus  britannus have you not been there have you not seen them what briton speaks as you do in your moments of levity what briton neglects to attend the services at the sacred grove what briton wears clothes of many colors as you do instead of plain blue as all solid

the lighthouse door whats the matter now  apollodorus hail great caesar i am apollodorus the sicilian an artist  britannus an artist why have they admitted this vagabond  caesar peace man apollodorus is a famous patrician amateur  britannus disconcerted i crave the gentlemans pardon to caesar i understood him to say that he was a professional somewhat out of countenance he allows apollodorus to approach caesar changing places with him rufio after looking apollodorus up and down with marked disparagement goes to the other side of the platform  caesar you are welcome apollodorus what is your business  apollodorus first to deliver to you a present from the queen of queens  caesar who is that  apollodorus cleopatra of egypt  caesar taking him into his confidence in his most winning manner apollodorus this is no time for playing with presents pray you go back to the queen and tell her that if all goes well i shall return to the palace this evening  apollodorus caesar i cannot return as i approached the lighthouse some fool threw a great leathern bag into the sea it broke the nose of my boat and i had hardly time to get myself and my charge to the shore before the poor little cockleshell sank  caesar i am sorry apollodorus the fool shall be rebuked well well what have you brought me the queen will be hurt if i do not look at it  rufio have we time to waste on this trumpery

cook drink our wine from the goblets and the carpet will make a bed for caesar  apollodorus the crane caesar i have sworn to tender this bale of carpet as i tender my own life  caesar cheerfully then let them swing you up at the same time and if the chain breaks you and the pigeons eggs will perish together he goes to the chairs and looks up along it examining it curiously  apollodorus to britannus is caesar serious  britannus his manner is frivolous because he is an italian but he means what he says  apollodorus serious or not he spoke well give me a squad of soldiers to work the crane  britannus leave the crane to me go and await the descent of the chain  apollodorus good you will presently see me there turning to them all and pointing with an eloquent gesture to the sky above the parapet rising like the sun with my treasure  he goes back the way he came britannus goes into the lighthouse  rufio illhumoredly are you really going to wait here for this foolery caesar  caesar backing away from the crane as it gives signs of working why not  rufio the egyptians will let you know why not if they have the sense to make a rush from the shore end of the mole before our barricade is finished and here we are waiting like children to see a carpet full of pigeons eggs  the chain rattles and is drawn up high enough to clear the parapet it then swings round out of sight behind the lighthouse  caesar fear not my son rufio when the first egyptian takes his first step along the mole the alarm will sound and we two will reach the barricade from our end before the egyptians reach it from their endwe two rufio i the old man and you his biggest boy and the old man will be there first so peace and give me some more dates  apollodorus from the causeway below soho haul away sohoooo the chain is drawn up and comes round again from behind the lighthouse apollodorus is swinging in the air with his bale of carpet at the end of it he breaks into song as he soars above the parapet  aloft aloft behold the blue that never shone in womans eyes  easy there stop her he ceases to rise further round the chain comes forward above the platform  rufio calling up lower away there the chain and its load begin to descend  apollodorus calling up gentlyslowlymind the eggs  rufio calling up easy thereslowlyslowly  apollodorus and the bale are deposited safely on the flags in the middle of the platform rufio and caesar help apollodorus to cast off the chain from the bale  rufio haul up  the chain rises clear of their heads with a rattle britannus comes from the lighthouse and helps them to uncord the carpet  apollodorus when the cords are loose stand off my friends let caesar see he throws the carpet open  rufio nothing but a heap of shawls where are the pigeons eggs  apollodorus approach caesar and search for them among the shawls  rufio drawing his sword ha treachery keep back caesar i saw the shawl move there is something alive there  britannus drawing his sword it is a serpent  apollodorus dares caesar thrust his hand into the sack where the serpent moves  rufio turning on him treacherous dog  caesar peace put up your swords apollodorus your serpent seems to breathe very regularly he thrusts his hand under the shawls and draws out a bare arm this is a pretty little snake  rufio drawing out the other arm let us have the rest of you  they pull cleopatra up by the wrists into a sitting position britannus scandalized sheathes his sword with a drive of protest  cleopatra gasping oh im smothered oh caesar a man stood on me in the boat and a great sack of something fell upon me out of the sky and then the boat sank and then i was swung up into the air and bumped down  caesar petting her as she rises and takes refuge on his breast well never mind here you are safe and sound at last  rufio ay and now that she is here what are we to do with her  britannus she cannot stay here caesar without the companionship of some matron  cleopatra jealously to caesar who is obviously perplexed arent you glad to see me  caesar yes yes i am very glad but rufio is very angry and britannus is shocked  cleopatra contemptuously you can have their heads cut off can you not  caesar they would not be so useful with their heads cut off as they are now my sea bird  rufio to cleopatra we shall have to go away presently and cut some of your egyptians heads off how will you like being left here with the chance of being captured by that little brother of yours if we are beaten  cleopatra but you mustnt leave me alone caesar you will not leave me alone will you  rufio what not when the trumpet sounds and all our lives depend on caesars being at the barricade before the egyptians reach it eh  cleopatra let them lose their lives they are only soldiers  caesar gravely cleopatra when that trumpet sounds we must take every man his life in his hand and throw it in the face of death and of my soldiers who have trusted me there is not one whose hand i shall not hold more sacred than your head cleopatra is overwhelmed her eyes fill with tears apollodorus you must take her back to the palace  apollodorus am i a dolphin caesar to cross the seas with young ladies on my back my boat is sunk all yours are either at the barricade or have returned to the city i will hail one if i can that is all i can do he goes back to the causeway  cleopatra struggling with her tears it does not matter i will not go back nobody cares for me  caesar cleopatra  cleopatra you want me to be killed  caesar still more gravely my poor child your life matters little here to anyone but yourself she gives way altogether at this casting herself down on the faggots weeping suddenly a great tumult is heard in the distance bucinas and trumpets sounding through a storm of shouting britannus rushes to the parapet and looks along the mole caesar and rufio turn to one another with quick intelligence  caesar come rufio  cleopatra scrambling to her knees and clinging to him no no do not leave me caesar he snatches his skirt from her clutch oh  britannus from the parapet caesar we are cut off the egyptians have landed from the west harbor between us and the barricade  rufio running to see curses it is true we are caught like rats in a trap  caesar ruthfully rufio rufio my men at the barricade are between the sea party and the shore party i have murdered them  rufio coming back from the parapet to caesars right hand ay that comes of fooling with this girl here  apollodorus coming up quickly from the causeway look over the parapet caesar  caesar we have looked my friend we must defend ourselves here  apollodorus i have thrown the ladder into the sea they cannot get in without it  rufio ay and we cannot get out have you thought of that  apollodorus not get out why not you have ships in the east harbor  britannus hopefully at the parapet the rhodian galleys are standing in towards us already caesar quickly joins britannus at the parapet  rufio to apollodorus impatiently and by what road are we to walk to the galleys pray  apollodorus with gay defiant rhetoric by the road that leads everywherethe diamond path of the sun and moon have you never seen the childs shadow play of the broken bridge ducks and geese with ease get overeh he throws away his cloak and cap and binds his sword on his back  rufio what are you talking about  apollodorus i will show you calling to britannus how far off is the nearest galley  britannus fifty fathom  caesar no no they are further off than they seem in this clear air to your british eyes nearly quarter of a mile apollodorus  apollodorus good defend yourselves here until i send you a boat from that galley  rufio have you wings perhaps  apollodorus water wings soldier behold  he runs up the steps between caesar and britannus to the coping of the parapet springs into the air and plunges head foremost into the sea  caesar like a schoolboywildly excited bravo bravo throwing off his cloak by jupiter i will do that too  rufio seizing him you are mad you shall not  caesar why not can i not swim as well as he  rufio frantic can an old fool dive and swim like a young one he is twentyfive and you are fifty  caesar breaking loose from rufio old  britannus shocked rufio you forget yourself  caesar i will race you to the galley for a weeks pay father rufio  cleopatra but me me me what is to become of me  caesar i will carry you on my back to the galley like a dolphin rufio when you see me rise to the surface throw her in i will answer for her and then in with you after her both of you  cleopatra no no no i shall be drowned  britannus caesar i am a man and a briton not a fish i must have a boat i cannot swim  cleopatra neither can i  caesar to britannus stay here then alone until i recapture the lighthouse i will not forget you now rufio  rufio you have made up your mind to this folly  caesar the egyptians have made it up for me what else is there to do and mind where you jump i do not want to get your fourteen stone in the small of my back as i come up he runs up the steps and stands on the coping  britannus anxiously one last word caesar do not let yourself be seen in the fashionable part of alexandria until you have changed your clothes  caesar calling over the sea ho apollodorus he points skyward and quotes the barcarolle  the white upon the blue above  apollodorus swimming in the distance  is purple on the green below  caesar exultantly aha he plunges into the sea  cleopatra running excitedly to the steps oh let me see he will be drowned rufio seizes her ahahahah he pitches her screaming into the sea rufio and britannus roar with laughter  rufio looking down after her he has got her to britannus hold the fort briton caesar will not forget you he springs off  britannus running to the steps to watch them as they swim all safe rufio  rufio swimming all safe  caesar swimming further of take refuge up there by the beacon and pile the fuel on the trap door britannus  britannus calling in reply i will first do so and then commend myself to my countrys gods a sound of cheering from the sea britannus gives full vent to his excitement the boat has reached him hip hip hip hurrah     act iv  cleopatras sousing in the east harbor of alexandria was in october 48 b c in march 47 she is passing the afternoon in her boudoir in the palace among a bevy of her ladies listening to a slave girl who is playing the harp in the middle of the room the harpists master an old musician with a lined face prominent brows white beard moustache and eyebrows twisted and horned at the ends and a consciously keen and pretentious expression is squatting on the floor close to her on her right watching her performance ftatateeta is in attendance near the door in front of a group of female slaves except the harp player all are seated cleopatra in a chair opposite the door on the other side of the room the rest on the ground cleopatras ladies are all young the most conspicuous being charmian and iras her favorites charmian is a hatchet faced terra cotta colored little goblin swift in her movements and neatly finished at the hands and feet iras is a plump goodnatured creature rather fatuous with a profusion of red hair and a tendency to giggle on the slightest provocation  cleopatra can i  ftatateeta insolently to the player peace thou the queen speaks the player stops  cleopatra to the old musician i want to learn to play the harp with my own hands caesar loves music can you teach me  musician assuredly i and no one else can teach the queen have i not discovered the lost method of the ancient egyptians who could make a pyramid tremble by touching a bass string all the other teachers are quacks i have exposed them repeatedly  cleopatra good you shall teach me how long will it take  musician not very long only four years your majesty must first become proficient in the philosophy of pythagoras  cleopatra has she indicating the slave become proficient in the philosophy of pythagoras  musician oh she is but a slave she learns as a dog learns  cleopatra well then i will learn as a dog learns for she plays better than you you shall give me a lesson every day for a fortnight the musician hastily scrambles to his feet and bows profoundly after that whenever i strike a false note you shall be flogged and if i strike so many that there is not time to flog you you shall be thrown into the nile to feed the crocodiles give the girl a piece of gold and send them away  musician much taken aback but true art will not be thus forced  ftatateeta pushing him out what is this answering the queen forsooth out with you  he is pushed out by ftatateeta the girl following with her harp amid the laughter of the ladies and slaves  cleopatra now can any of you amuse me have you any stories or any news  iras ftatateeta  cleopatra oh ftatateeta ftatateeta always ftatateeta some new tale to set me against her  iras no this time ftatateeta has been virtuous all the ladies laughnot the slaves pothinus has been trying to bribe her to let him speak with you  cleopatra wrathfully ha you all sell audiences with me as if i saw whom you please and not whom i please i should like to know how much of her gold piece that harp girl will have to give up before she leaves the palace  iras we can easily find out that for you  the ladies laugh  cleopatra frowning you laugh but take care take care i will find out some day how to make myself served as caesar is served  charmian old hooknose they laugh again  cleopatra revolted silence charmian do not you be a silly little egyptian fool do you know why i allow you all to chatter impertinently just as you please instead of treating you as ftatateeta would treat you if she were queen  charmian because you try to imitate caesar in everything and he lets everybody say what they please to him  cleopatra no but because i asked him one day why he did so and he said let your women talk and you will learn something from them what have i to learn from them i said what they are said he and oh you should have seen his eye as he said it you would have curled up you shallow things they laugh she turns fiercely on iras at whom are you laughingat me or at caesar  iras at caesar  cleopatra if you were not a fool you would laugh at me and if you were not a coward you would not be afraid to tell me so ftatateeta returns ftatateeta they tell me that pothinus has offered you a bribe to admit him to my presence  ftatateeta protesting now by my fathers gods  cleopatra cutting her short despotically have i not told you not to deny things you would spend the day calling your fathers gods to witness to your virtues if i let you go take the bribe and bring in pothinus ftatateeta is about to reply dont answer me go  ftatateeta goes out and cleopatra rises and begins to prowl to and fro between her chair and the door meditating all rise and stand  iras as she reluctantly rises heigho i wish caesar were back in rome  cleopatra threateningly it will be a bad day for you all when he goes oh if i were not ashamed to let him see that i am as cruel at heart as my father i would make you repent that speech why do you wish him away  charmian he makes you so terribly prosy and serious and learned and philosophical it is worse than being religious at our ages the ladies laugh  cleopatra cease that endless cackling will you hold your tongues  charmian with mock resignation well well we must try to live up to caesar  they laugh again cleopatra rages silently as she continues to prowl to and fro ftatateeta comes back with pothinus who halts on the threshold  ftatateeta at the door pothinus craves the ear of the  cleopatra there there that will do let him come in  she resumes her seat all sit down except pothinus who advances to the middle of the room ftatateeta takes her former place well pothinus what is the latest news from your rebel friends  pothinus haughtily i am no friend of rebellion and a prisoner does not receive news  cleopatra you are no more a prisoner than i amthan caesar is these six months we have been besieged in this palace by my subjects you are allowed to walk on the beach among the soldiers can i go further myself or can caesar  pothinus you are but a child cleopatra and do not understand these matters  the ladies laugh cleopatra looks inscrutably at him  charmian i see you do not know the latest news pothinus  pothinus what is that  charmian that cleopatra is no longer a child shall i tell you how to grow much older and much much wiser in one day  pothinus i should prefer to grow wiser without growing older  charmian well go up to the top of the lighthouse and get somebody to take you by the hair and throw you into the sea the ladies laugh  cleopatra she is right pothinus you will come to the shore with much conceit washed out of you the ladies laugh cleopatra rises impatiently begone all of you i will speak with pothinus alone drive them out ftatateeta they run out laughing ftatateeta shuts the door on them what are you waiting for  ftatateeta it is not meet that the queen remain alone with  cleopatra interrupting her ftatateeta must i sacrifice you to your fathers gods to teach you that i am queen of egypt and not you  ftatateeta indignantly you are like the rest of them you want to be what these romans call a new woman she goes out banging the door  cleopatra sitting down again now pothinus why did you bribe ftatateeta to bring you hither  pothinus studying her gravely cleopatra what they tell me is true you are changed  cleopatra do you speak with caesar every day for six months and you will be changed  pothinus it is the common talk that you are infatuated with this old man  cleopatra infatuated what does that mean made foolish is it not oh no i wish i were  pothinus you wish you were made foolish how so  cleopatra when i was foolish i did what i liked except when ftatateeta beat me and even then i cheated her and did it by stealth now that caesar has made me wise it is no use my liking or disliking i do what must be done and have no time to attend to myself that is not happiness but it is greatness if caesar were gone i think i could govern the egyptians for what caesar is to me i am to the fools around me  pothinus looking hard at her cleopatra this may be the vanity of youth  cleopatra no no it is not that i am so clever but that the others are so stupid  pothinus musingly truly that is the great secret  cleopatra well now tell me what you came to say  pothinus embarrassed i nothing  cleopatra nothing  pothinus at leastto beg for my liberty that is all  cleopatra for that you would have knelt to caesar no pothinus you came with some plan that depended on cleopatra being a little nursery kitten now that cleopatra is a queen the plan is upset  pothinus bowing his head submissively it is so  cleopatra exultant aha  pothinus raising his eyes keenly to hers is cleopatra then indeed a queen and no longer caesars prisoner and slave  cleopatra pothinus we are all caesars slavesall we in this land of egyptwhether we will or no and she who is wise enough to know this will reign when caesar departs  pothinus you harp on caesars departure  cleopatra what if i do  pothinus does he not love you  cleopatra love me pothinus caesar loves no one who are those we love only those whom we do not hate all people are strangers and enemies to us except those we love but it is not so with caesar he has no hatred in him he makes friends with everyone as he does with dogs and children his kindness to me is a wonder neither mother father nor nurse have ever taken so much care for me or thrown open their thoughts to me so freely  pothinus well is not this love  cleopatra what when he will do as much for the first girl he meets on his way back to rome ask his slave britannus he has been just as good to him nay ask his very horse his kindness is not for anything in me it is in his own nature  pothinus but how can you be sure that he does not love you as men love women  cleopatra because i cannot make him jealous i have tried  pothinus hm perhaps i should have asked then do you love him  cleopatra can one love a god besides i love another roman one whom i saw long before caesarno god but a manone who can love and hateone whom i can hurt and who would hurt me  pothinus does caesar know this  cleopatra yes  pothinus and he is not angry  cleopatra he promises to send him to egypt to please me  pothinus i do not understand this man  cleopatra with superb contempt you understand caesar how could you proudly i doby instinct  pothinus deferentially after a moments thought your majesty caused me to be admitted today what message has the queen for me  cleopatra this you think that by making my brother king you will rule in egypt because you are his guardian and he is a little silly  pothinub the queen is pleased to say so  cleopatra the queen is pleased to say this also that caesar will eat up you and achillas and my brother as a cat eats up mice and that he will put on this land of egypt as a shepherd puts on his garment and when he has done that he will return to rome and leave cleopatra here as his viceroy  pothinus breaking out wrathfully that he will never do we have a thousand men to his ten and we will drive him and his beggarly legions into the sea  cleopatra with scorn getting up to go you rant like any common fellow go then and marshal your thousands and make haste for mithridates of pergamos is at hand with reinforcements for caesar caesar has held you at bay with two legions we shall see what he will do with twenty  pothinus cleopatra  cleopatra enough enough caesar has spoiled me for talking to weak things like you she goes out pothinus with a gesture of rage is following when ftatateeta enters and stops him  pothinus let me go forth from this hateful place  ftatateeta what angers you  pothinus the curse of all the gods of egypt be upon her she has sold her country to the roman that she may buy it back from him with her kisses  ftatateeta fool did she not tell you that she would have caesar gone  pothinus you listened  ftatateeta i took care that some honest woman should be at hand whilst you were with her  pothinus now by the gods  ftatateeta enough of your gods caesars gods are all powerful here it is no use you coming to cleopatra you are only an egyptian she will not listen to any of her own race she treats us all as children  pothinus may she perish for it  ftatateeta balefully may your tongue wither for that wish go send for lucius septimius the slayer of pompey he is a roman may be she will listen to him begone  pothinus darkly i know to whom i must go now  ftatateeta suspiciously to whom then  pothinus to a greater roman than lucius and mark this mistress you thought before caesar came that egypt should presently be ruled by you and your crew in the name of cleopatra i set myself against it  ftatateeta interrupting himwrangling ay that it might be ruled by you and your crew in the name of ptolemy  pothinus better me or even you than a woman with a roman heart and that is what cleopatra is now become whilst i live she shall never rule so guide yourself accordingly he goes out  it is by this time drawing on to dinner time the table is laid on the roof of the palace and thither rufio is now climbing ushered by a majestic palace official wand of office in hand and followed by a slave carrying an inlaid stool after many stairs they emerge at last into a massive colonnade on the roof light curtains are drawn between the columns on the north and east to soften the westering sun the official leads rufio to one of these shaded sections a cord for pulling the curtains apart hangs down between the pillars  the official bowing the roman commander will await caesar here  the slave sets down the stool near the southernmost column and slips out through the curtains  rufio sitting down a little blown pouf that was a climb how high have we come  the official we are on the palace roof o beloved of victory  rufio good the beloved of victory has no more stairs to get up  a second official enters from the opposite end walking backwards  the second official caesar approaches  caesar fresh from the bath clad in a new tunic of purple silk comes in beaming and festive followed by two slaves carrying a light couch which is hardly more than an elaborately designed bench they place it near the northmost of the two curtained columns when this is done they slip out through the curtains and the two officials formally bowing follow them rufio rises to receive caesar  caesar coming over to him why rufio surveying his dress with an air of admiring astonishment a new baldrick a new golden pommel to your sword and you have had your hair cut but not your beard impossible he sniffs at rufios beard yes perfumed by jupiter olympus  rufio growling well is it to please myself  caesar affectionately no my son rufio but to please meto celebrate my birthday  rufio contemptuously your birthday you always have a birthday when there is a pretty girl to be flattered or an ambassador to be conciliated we had seven of them in ten months last year  caesar contritely it is true rufio i shall never break myself of these petty deceits  rufio who is to dine with usbesides cleopatra  caesar apollodorus the sicilian  rufio that popinjay  caesar come the popinjay is an amusing dogtells a story sings a song and saves us the trouble of flattering the queen what does she care for old politicians and campfed bears like us no apollodorus is good company rufio good company  rufio well he can swim a bit and fence a bit he might be worse if he only knew how to hold his tongue  caesar the gods forbid he should ever learn oh this military life this tedious brutal life of action that is the worst of us romans we are mere doers and drudgers a swarm of bees turned into men give me a good talkerone with wit and imagination enough to live without continually doing something  rufio ay a nice time he would have of it with you when dinner was over have you noticed that i am before my time  caesar aha i thought that meant something what is it  rufio can we be overheard here  caesar our privacy invites eavesdropping i can remedy that he claps his hands twice the curtains are drawn revealing the roof garden with a banqueting table set across in the middle for four persons one at each end and two side by side the side next caesar and rufio is blocked with golden wine vessels and basins a gorgeous majordomo is superintending the laying of the table by a staff of slaves the colonnade goes round the garden at both sides to the further end where a gap in it like a great gateway leaves the view open to the sky beyond the western edge of the roof except in the middle where a life size image of ra seated on a huge plinth towers up with hawk head and crown of asp and disk his altar which stands at his feet is a single white stone now everybody can see us nobody will think of listening to us he sits down on the bench left by the two slaves  rufio sitting down on his stool pothinus wants to speak to you i advise you to see him there is some plotting going on here among the women  caesar who is pothinus  rufio the fellow with hair like squirrels furthe little kings bear leader whom you kept prisoner  caesar annoyed and has he not escaped  rufio no  caesar rising imperiously why not you have been guarding this man instead of watching the enemy have i not told you always to let prisoners escape unless there are special orders to the contrary are there not enough mouths to be fed without him  rufio yes and if you would have a little sense and let me cut his throat you would save his rations anyhow he wont escape three sentries have told him they would put a pilum through him if they saw him again what more can they do he prefers to stay and spy on us so would i if i had to do with generals subject to fits of clemency  caesar resuming his seat argued down hm and so he wants to see me  rufio ay i have brought him with me he is waiting there jerking his thumb over his shoulder under guard  caesar and you want me to see him  rufio obstinately i dont want anything i daresay you will do what you like dont put it on to me  caesar with an air of doing it expressly to indulge rufio well well let us have him  rufio calling ho there guard release your man and send him up beckoning come along  pothinus enters and stops mistrustfully between the two looking from one to the other  caesar graciously ah pothinus you are welcome and what is the news this afternoon  pothinus caesar i come to warn you of a danger and to make you an offer  caesar never mind the danger make the offer  rufio never mind the offer whats the danger  pothinus caesar you think that cleopatra is devoted to you  caesar gravely my friend i already know what i think come to your offer  pothinus i will deal plainly i know not by what strange gods you have been enabled to defend a palace and a few yards of beach against a city and an army since we cut you off from lake mareotis and you dug wells in the salt sea sand and brought up buckets of fresh water from them we have known that your gods are irresistible and that you are a worker of miracles i no longer threaten you  rufio sarcastically very handsome of you indeed  pothinus so be it you are the master our gods sent the north west winds to keep you in our hands but you have been too strong for them  caesar gently urging him to come to the point yes yes my friend but what then  rufio spit it out man what have you to say  pothinus i have to say that you have a traitress in your camp cleopatra  the majordomo at the table announcing the queen caesar and rufio rise  rufio aside to pothinus you should have spat it out sooner you fool now it is too late  cleopatra in gorgeous raiment enters in state through the gap in the colonnade and comes down past the image of ra and past the table to caesar her retinue headed by ftatateeta joins the staff at the table caesar gives cleopatra his seat which she takes  cleopatra quickly seeing pothinus what is he doing here  caesar seating himself beside her in the most amiable of tempers just going to tell me something about you you shall hear it proceed pothinus  pothinus disconcerted caesar he stammers  caesar well out with it  pothinus what i have to say is for your ear not for the queens  cleopatra with subdued ferocity there are means of making you speak take care  pothinus defiantly caesar does not employ those means  caesar my friend when a man has anything to tell in this world the difficulty is not to make him tell it but to prevent him from telling it too often let me celebrate my birthday by setting you free farewell well not meet again  cleopatra angrily caesar this mercy is foolish  pothinus to caesar will you not give me a private audience your life may depend on it caesar rises loftily  rufio aside to pothinus ass now we shall have some heroics  caesar oratorically pothinus  rufio interrupting him caesar the dinner will spoil if you begin preaching your favourite sermon about life and death  cleopatra priggishly peace rufio i desire to hear caesar  rufio bluntly your majesty has heard it before you repeated it to apollodorus last week and he thought it was all your own caesars dignity collapses much tickled he sits down again and looks roguishly at cleopatra who is furious rufio calls as before ho there guard pass the prisoner out he is released to pothinus now off with you you have lost your chance  pothinus his temper overcoming his prudence i will speak  caesar to cleopatra you see torture would not have wrung a word from him  pothinus caesar you have taught cleopatra the arts by which the romans govern the world  caesar alas they cannot even govern themselves what then  pothinus what then are you so besotted with her beauty that you do not see that she is impatient to reign in egypt alone and that her heart is set on your departure  cleopatra rising liar  caesar shocked what protestations contradictions  cleopatra ashamed but trembling with suppressed rage no i do not deign to contradict let him talk she sits down again  pothinus from her own lips i have heard it you are to be her catspaw you are to tear the crown from her brothers head and set it on her own delivering us all into her handdelivering yourself also and then caesar can return to rome or depart through the gate of death which is nearer and surer  caesar calmly well my friend and is not this very natural  pothinus astonished natural then you do not resent treachery  caesar resent o thou foolish egyptian what have i to do with resentment do i resent the wind when it chills me or the night when it makes me stumble in the darkness shall i resent youth when it turns from age and ambition when it turns from servitude to tell me such a story as this is but to tell me that the sun will rise tomorrow  cleopatra unable to contain herself but it is falsefalse i swear it  caesar it is true though you swore it a thousand times and believed all you swore she is convulsed with emotion to screen her he rises and takes pothinus to rufio saying come rufio let us see pothinus past the guard i have a word to say to him aside to them we must give the queen a moment to recover herself aloud come he takes pothinus and rufio out with him conversing with them meanwhile tell your friends pothinus that they must not think i am opposed to a reasonable settlement of the countrys affairs they pass out of hearing  cleopatra in a stifled whisper ftatateeta ftatateeta  ftatateeta hurrying to her from the table and petting her peace child be comforted  cleopatra interrupting her can they hear us  ftatateeta no dear heart no  cleopatra listen to me if he leaves the palace alive never see my face again  ftatateeta he poth  cleopatra striking her on the mouth strike his life out as i strike his name from your lips dash him down from the wall break him on the stones kill kill kill him  ftatateeta showing all her teeth the dog shall perish  cleopatra fail in this and you go out from before me forever  ftatateeta resolutely so be it you shall not see my face until his eyes are darkened  caesar comes back with apollodorus exquisitely dressed and rufio  cleopatra to ftatateeta come soonsoon ftatateeta turns her meaning eyes for a moment on her mistress then goes grimly away past ra and out cleopatra runs like a gazelle to caesar so you have come back to me caesar caressingly i thought you were angry welcome apollodorus she gives him her hand to kiss with her other arm about caesar  apollodorus cleopatra grows more womanly beautiful from week to week  cleopatra truth apollodorus  apollodorus far far short of the truth friend rufio threw a pearl into the sea caesar fished up a diamond  caesar caesar fished up a touch of rheumatism my friend come to dinner to dinner they move towards the table  cleopatra skipping like a young fawn yes to dinner i have ordered such a dinner for you caesar  caesar ay what are we to have  cleopatra peacocks brains  caesar as if his mouth watered peacocks brains apollodorus  apollodorus not for me i prefer nightingales tongues he goes to one of the two covers set side by side  cleopatra roast boar rufio  rufio gluttonously good he goes to the seat next apollodorus on his left  caesar looking at his seat which is at the end of the table to ras left hand what has become of my leathern cushion  cleopatra at the opposite end i have got new ones for you  the majordomo these cushions caesar are of maltese gauze stuffed with rose leaves  caesar rose leaves am i a caterpillar he throws the cushions away and seats himself on the leather mattress underneath  cleopatra what a shame my new cushions  the majordomo at caesars elbow what shall we serve to whet caesars appetite  caesar what have you got  the majordomo sea hedgehogs black and white sea acorns sea nettles beccaficoes purple shellfish  caesar any oysters  the majordomo assuredly  caesar british oysters  the majordomo assenting british oysters caesar  caesar oysters then the majordomo signs to a slave at each order and the slave goes out to execute it i have been in britainthat western land of romancethe last piece of earth on the edge of the ocean that surrounds the world i went there in search of its famous pearls the british pearl was a fable but in searching for it i found the british oyster  apollodorus all posterity will bless you for it to the majordomo sea hedgehogs for me  rufio is there nothing solid to begin with  the majordomo fieldfares with asparagus  cleopatra interrupting fattened fowls have some fattened fowls rufio  rufio ay that will do  cleopatra greedily fieldfares for me  the majordomo caesar will deign to choose his wine sicilian lesbian chian  rufio contemptuously all greek  apollodorus who would drink roman wine when he could get greek try the lesbian caesar  caesar bring me my barley water  rufio with intense disgust ugh bring me my falernian the falernian is presently brought to him  cleopatra pouting it is waste of time giving you dinners caesar my scullions would not condescend to your diet  caesar relenting well well let us try the lesbian the majordomo fills caesars goblet then cleopatras and apollodoruss but when i return to rome i will make laws against these extravagances i will even get the laws carried out  cleopatra coaxingly never mind today you are to be like other people idle luxurious and kind she stretches her hand to him along the table  caesar well for once i will sacrifice my comfort kissing her hand there he takes a draught of wine now are you satisfied  cleopatra and you no longer believe that i long for your departure for rome  caesar i no longer believe anything my brains are asleep besides who knows whether i shall return to rome  rufio alarmed how eh what  caesar what has rome to show me that i have not seen already one year of rome is like another except that i grow older whilst the crowd in the appian way is always the same age  apollodorus it is no better here in egypt the old men when they are tired of life say we have seen everything except the source of the nile  caesar his imagination catching fire and why not see that cleopatra will you come with me and track the flood to its cradle in the heart of the regions of mystery shall we leave rome behind usrome that has achieved greatness only to learn how greatness destroys nations of men who are not great shall i make you a new kingdom and build you a holy city there in the great unknown  cleopatra rapturously yes yes you shall  rufio ay now he will conquer africa with two legions before we come to the roast boar  apollodorus come no scoffing this is a noble scheme in it caesar is no longer merely the conquering soldier but the creative poetartist let us name the holy city and consecrate it with lesbian wineand cleopatra shall name it herself  cleopatra it shall be called caesars gift to his beloved  apollodorus no no something vaster than thatsomething universal like the starry firmament  caesar prosaically why not simply the cradle of the nile  cleopatra no the nile is my ancestor and he is a god oh i have thought of something the nile shall name it himself let us call upon him to the majordomo send for him the three men stare at one another but the majordomo goes out as if he had received the most matteroffact order and to the retinue away with you all  the retinue withdraws making obeisance  a priest enters carrying a miniature sphinx with a tiny tripod before it a morsel of incense is smoking in the tripod the priest comes to the table and places the image in the middle of it the light begins to change to the magenta purple of the egyptian sunset as if the god had brought a strange colored shadow with him the three men are determined not to be impressed but they feel curious in spite of themselves  caesar what hocuspocus is this  cleopatra you shall see and it is not hocuspocus to do it properly we should kill something to please him but perhaps he will answer caesar without that if we spill some wine to him  apollodorus turning his head to look up over his shoulder at ra why not appeal to our hawkheaded friend here  cleopatra nervously sh he will hear you and be angry  rufio phlegmatically the source of the nile is out of his district i expect  cleopatra no i will have my city named by nobody but my dear little sphinx because it was in its arms that caesar found me asleep she languishes at caesar then turns curtly to the priest go i am a priestess and have power to take your charge from you the priest makes a reverence and goes out now let us call on the nile all together perhaps he will rap on the table  caesar what table rapping are such superstitions still believed in this year 707 of the republic  cleopatra it is no superstition our priests learn lots of things from the tables is it not so apollodorus  apollodorus yes i profess myself a converted man when cleopatra is priestess apollodorus is devotee propose the conjuration  cleopatra you must say with me send us thy voice father nile  all four holding their glasses together before the idol send us thy voice father nile  the death cry of a man in mortal terror and agony answers them appalled the men set down their glasses and listen silence the purple deepens in the sky caesar glancing at cleopatra catches her pouring out her wine before the god with gleaming eyes and mute assurances of gratitude and worship apollodorus springs up and runs to the edge of the roof to peer down and listen  caesar looking piercingly at cleopatra what was that  cleopatra petulantly nothing they are beating some slave  caesar nothing  rufio a man with a knife in him ill swear  caesar rising a murder  apollodorus at the back waving his hand for silence ssh silence did you hear that  caesar another cry  apollodorus returning to the table no a thud something fell on the beach i think  rufio grimly as he rises something with bones in it eh  caesar shuddering hush hush rufio he leaves the table and returns to the colonnade rufio following at his left elbow and apollodorus at the other side  cleopatra still in her place at the table will you leave me caesar apollodorus are you going  apollodorus faith dearest queen my appetite is gone  caesar go down to the courtyard apollodorus and find out what has happened  apollodorus nods and goes out making for the staircase by which rufio ascended  cleopatra your soldiers have killed somebody perhaps what does it matter  the murmur of a crowd rises from the beach below caesar and rufio look at one another  caesar this must be seen to he is about to follow apollodorus when rufio stops him with a hand on his arm as ftatateeta comes back by the far end of the roof with dragging steps a drowsy satiety in her eyes and in the corners of the bloodhound lips for a moment caesar suspects that she is drunk with wine not so rufio he knows well the red vintage that has inebriated her  rufio in a low tone there is some mischief between those two  ftatateeta the queen looks again on the face of her servant  cleopatra looks at her for a moment with an exultant reflection of her murderous expression then she flings her arms round her kisses her repeatedly and savagely and tears off her jewels and heaps them on her the two men turn from the spectacle to look at one another ftatateeta drags herself sleepily to the altar kneels before ra and remains there in prayer caesar goes to cleopatra leaving rufio in the colonnade  caesar with searching earnestness cleopatra what has happened  cleopatra in mortal dread of him but with her utmost cajolery nothing dearest caesar with sickly sweetness her voice almost failing nothing i am innocent she approaches him affectionately dear caesar are you angry with me why do you look at me so i have been here with you all the time how can i know what has happened  caesar reflectively that is true  cleopatra greatly relieved trying to caress him of course it is true he does not respond to the caress you know it is true rufio  the murmur without suddenly swells to a roar and subsides  rufio i shall know presently he makes for the altar in the burly trot that serves him for a stride and touches ftatateeta on the shoulder now mistress i shall want you he orders her with a gesture to go before him  ftatateeta rising and glowering at him my place is with the queen  cleopatra she has done no harm rufio  caesar to rufio let her stay  rufio sitting down on the altar very well then my place is here too and you can see what is the matter for yourself the city is in a pretty uproar it seems  caesar with grave displeasure rufio there is a time for obedience  rufio and there is a time for obstinacy he folds his arms doggedly  caesar to cleopatra send her away  cleopatra whining in her eagerness to propitiate him yes i will i will do whatever you ask me caesar always because i love you ftatateeta go away  ftatateeta the queens word is my will i shall be at hand for the queens call she goes out past ra as she came  rufio following her remember caesar your bodyguard also is within call he follows her out  cleopatra presuming upon caesars submission to rufio leaves the table and sits down on the bench in the colonnade  cleopatra why do you allow rufio to treat you so you should teach him his place  caesar teach him to be my enemy and to hide his thoughts from me as you are now hiding yours  cleopatra her fears returning why do you say that caesar indeed indeed i am not hiding anything you are wrong to treat me like this she stifles a sob i am only a child and you turn into stone because you think some one has been killed i cannot bear it she purposely breaks down and weeps he looks at her with profound sadness and complete coldness she looks up to see what effect she is producing seeing that he is unmoved she sits up pretending to struggle with her emotion and to put it bravely away but there i know you hate tears you shall not be troubled with them i know you are not angry but only sad only i am so silly i cannot help being hurt when you speak coldly of course you are quite right it is dreadful to think of anyone being killed or even hurt and i hope nothing really serious has her voice dies away under his contemptuous penetration  caesar what has frightened you into this what have you done a trumpet sounds on the beach below aha that sounds like the answer  cleopatra sinking back trembling on the bench and covering her face with her hands i have not betrayed you caesar i swear it  caesar i know that i have not trusted you he turns from her and is about to go out when apollodorus and britannus drag in lucius septimius to him rufio follows caesar shudders again pompeys murderer  rufio the town has gone mad i think they are for tearing the palace down and driving us into the sea straight away we laid hold of this renegade in clearing them out of the courtyard  caesar release him they let go his arms what has offended the citizens lucius septimius  lucius what did you expect caesar pothinus was a favorite of theirs  caesar what has happened to pothinus i set him free here not half an hour ago did they not pass him out  lucius ay through the gallery arch sixty feet above ground with three inches of steel in his ribs he is as dead as pompey we are quits now as to killingyou and i  caesar shocked assassinatedour prisoner our guest he turns reproachfully on rufio rufio  rufio emphaticallyanticipating the question whoever did it was a wise man and a friend of yours cleopatra is qreatly emboldened but none of us had a hand in it so it is no use to frown at me caesar turns and looks at cleopatra  cleopatra violentlyrising he was slain by order of the queen of egypt i am not julius caesar the dreamer who allows every slave to insult him rufio has said i did well now the others shall judge me too she turns to the others this pothinus sought to make me conspire with him to betray caesar to achillas and ptolemy i refused and he cursed me and came privily to caesar to accuse me of his own treachery i caught him in the act and he insulted meme the queen to my face caesar would not revenge me he spoke him fair and set him free was i right to avenge myself speak lucius  lucius i do not gainsay it but you will get little thanks from caesar for it  cleopatra speak apollodorus was i wrong  apollodorus i have only one word of blame most beautiful you should have called upon me your knight and in fair duel i should have slain the slanderer  cleopatra passionately i will be judged by your very slave caesar britannus speak was i wrong  britannus were treachery falsehood and disloyalty left unpunished society must become like an arena full of wild beasts tearing one another to pieces caesar is in the wrong  caesar with quiet bitterness and so the verdict is against me it seems  cleopatra vehemently listen to me caesar if one man in all alexandria can be found to say that i did wrong i swear to have myself crucified on the door of the palace by my own slaves  caesar if one man in all the world can be found now or forever to know that you did wrong that man will have either to conquer the world as i have or be crucified by it the uproar in the streets again reaches them do you hear these knockers at your gate are also believers in vengeance and in stabbing you have slain their leader it is right that they shall slay you if you doubt it ask your four counselors here and then in the name of that right he emphasizes the word with great scorn shall i not slay them for murdering their queen and be slain in my turn by their countrymen as the invader of their fatherland can rome do less then than slay these slayers too to show the world how rome avenges her sons and her honor and so to the end of history murder shall breed murder always in the name of right and honor and peace until the gods are tired of blood and create a race that can understand fierce uproar cleopatra becomes white with terror hearken you who must not be insulted go near enough to catch their words you will find them bitterer than the tongue of pothinus loftily wrapping himself up in an impenetrable dignity let the queen of egypt now give her orders for vengeance and take her measures for defense for she has renounced caesar he turns to go  cleopatra terrified running to him and falling on her knees you will not desert me caesar you will defend the palace  caesar you have taken the powers of life and death upon you i am only a dreamer  cleopatra but they will kill me  caesar and why not  cleopatra in pity  caesar pity what has it come to this so suddenly that nothing can save you now but pity did it save pothinus  she rises wringing her hands and goes back to the bench in despair apollodorus shows his sympathy with her by quietly posting himself behind the bench the sky has by this time become the most vivid purple and soon begins to change to a glowing pale orange against which the colonnade and the great image show darklier and darklier  rufio caesar enough of preaching the enemy is at the gate  caesar turning on him and giving way to his wrath ay and what has held him baffled at the gate all these months was it my folly as you deem it or your wisdom in this egyptian red sea of blood whose hand has held all your heads above the waves turning on cleopatra and yet when caesar says to such an one friend go free you clinging for your little life to my sword dare steal out and stab him in the back and you soldiers and gentlemen and honest servants as you forget that you are applaud this assassination and say caesar is in the wrong by the gods i am tempted to open my hand and let you all sink into the flood  cleopatra with a ray of cunning hope but caesar if you do you will perish yourself  caesars eyes blaze  rufio greatly alarmed now by great jove you filthy little egyptian rat that is the very word to make him walk out alone into the city and leave us here to be cut to pieces desperately to caesar will you desert us because we are a parcel of fools i mean no harm by killing i do it as a dog kills a cat by instinct we are all dogs at your heels but we have served you faithfully  caesar relenting alas rufio my son my son as dogs we are like to perish now in the streets  apollodorus at his post behind cleopatras seat caesar what you say has an olympian ring in it it must be right for it is fine art but i am still on the side of cleopatra if we must die she shall not want the devotion of a mans heart nor the strength of a mans arm  cleopatra sobbing but i dont want to die  caesar sadly oh ignoble ignoble  lucius coming forward between caesar and cleopatra hearken to me caesar it may be ignoble but i also mean to live as long as i can  caesar well my friend you are likely to outlive caesar is it any magic of mine think you that has kept your army and this whole city at bay for so long yesterday what quarrel had they with me that they should risk their lives against me but today we have flung them down their hero murdered and now every man of them is set upon clearing out this nest of assassinsfor such we are and no more take courage then and sharpen your sword pompeys head has fallen and caesars head is ripe  apollodorus does caesar despair  caesar with infinite pride he who has never hoped can never despair caesar in good or bad fortune looks his fate in the face  lucius look it in the face then and it will smile as it always has on caesar  caesar with involuntary haughtiness do you presume to encourage me  lucius i offer you my services i will change sides if you will have me  caesar suddenly coming down to earth again and looking sharply at him divining that there is something behind the offer what at this point  lucius firmly at this point  rufio do you suppose caesar is mad to trust you  lucius i do not ask him to trust me until he is victorious i ask for my life and for a command in caesars army and since caesar is a fair dealer i will pay in advance  caesar pay how  lucius with a piece of good news for you  caesar divines the news in a flash  rufio what news  caesar with an elate and buoyant energy which makes cleopatra sit up and stare what news what news did you say my son rufio the relief has arrived what other news remains for us is it not so lucius septimius mithridates of pergamos is on the march  lucius he has taken pelusium  caesar delighted lucius septimius you are henceforth my officer rufio the egyptians must have sent every soldier from the city to prevent mithridates crossing the nile there is nothing in the streets now but mobmob  lucius it is so mithridates is marching by the great road to memphis to cross above the delta achillas will fight him there  caesar all audacity achillas shall fight caesar there see rufio he runs to the table snatches a napkin and draws a plan on it with his finger dipped in wine whilst rufio and lucius septimius crowd about him to watch all looking closely for the light is now almost gone here is the palace pointing to his plan here is the theatre you to rufio take twenty men and pretend to go by that street pointing it out and whilst they are stoning you out go the cohorts by this and this my streets are right are they lucius  lucius ay that is the fig market  caesar too much excited to listen to him i saw them the day we arrived good he throws the napkin on the table and comes down again into the colonnade away britannus tell petronius that within an hour half our forces must take ship for the western lake see to my horse and armor britannus runs out with the rest i shall march round the lake and up the nile to meet mithridates away lucius and give the word  lucius hurries out after britannus  rufio come this is something like business  caesar buoyantly is it not my only son he claps his hands the slaves hurry in to the table no more of this mawkish reveling away with all this stuff shut it out of my sight and be off with you the slaves begin to remove the table and the curtains are drawn shutting in the colonnade you understand about the streets rufio  rufio ay i think i do i will get through them at all events  the bucina sounds busily in the courtyard beneath  caesar come then we must talk to the troops and hearten them you down to the beach i to the courtyard he makes for the staircase  cleopatra rising from her seat where she has been quite neglected all this time and stretching out her hands timidly to him caesar  caesar turning eh  cleopatra have you forgotten me  caesar indulgently i am busy now my child busy when i return your affairs shall be settled farewell and be good and patient  he goes preoccupied and quite indifferent she stands with clenched fists in speechless rage and humiliation  rufio that game is played and lost cleopatra the woman always gets the worst of it  cleopatra haughtily go follow your master  rufio in her ear with rough familiarity a word first tell your executioner that if pothinus had been properly killedin the throathe would not have called out your man bungled his work  cleopatra enigmatically how do you know it was a man  rufio startled and puzzled it was not you you were with us when it happened she turns her back scornfully on him he shakes his head and draws the curtains to go out it is now a magnificent moonlit night the table has been removed ftatateeta is seen in the light of the moon and stars again in prayer before the white altarstone of ra rufio starts closes the curtains again softly and says in a low voice to cleopatra was it she with her own hand  cleopatra threateningly whoever it was let my enemies beware of her look to it rufio you who dare make the queen of egypt a fool before caesar  rufio looking grimly at her i will look to it cleopatra he nods in confirmation of the promise and slips out through the curtains loosening his sword in its sheath as he goes  roman soldiers in the courtyard below hail caesar hail hail  cleopatra listens the bucina sounds again followed by several trumpets  cleopatra wringing her hands and calling ftatateeta ftatateeta it is dark and i am alone come to me silence ftatateeta louder ftatateeta silence in a panic she snatches the cord and pulls the curtains apart  ftatateeta is lying dead on the altar of ra with her throat cut her blood deluges the white stone     act v  high noon festival and military pageant on the esplanade before the palace in the east harbor caesars galley so gorgeously decorated that it seems to be rigged with flowers is alongside the quay close to the steps apollodorus descended when he embarked with the carpet a roman guard is posted there in charge of a gangway whence a red floorcloth is laid down the middle of the esplanade turning off to the north opposite the central gate in the palace front which shuts in the esplanade on the south side the broad steps of the gate crowded with cleopatras ladies all in their gayest attire are like a flower garden the facade is lined by her guard officered by the same gallants to whom bel affris announced the coming of caesar six months before in the old palace on the syrian border the north side is lined by roman soldiers with the townsfolk on tiptoe behind them peering over their heads at the cleared esplanade in which the officers stroll about chatting among these are belzanor and the persian also the centurion vinewood cudgel in hand battle worn thickbooted and much outshone both socially and decoratively by the egyptian officers  apollodorus makes his way through the townsfolk and calls to the officers from behind the roman line  apollodorus hullo may i pass  centurion pass apollodorus the sicilian there the soldiers let him through  belzanor is caesar at hand  apollodorus not yet he is still in the market place i could not stand any more of the roaring of the soldiers after half an hour of the enthusiasm of an army one feels the need of a little sea air  persian tell us the news hath he slain the priests  apollodorus not he they met him in the market place with ashes on their heads and their gods in their hands they placed the gods at his feet the only one that was worth looking at was apis a miracle of gold and ivory work by my advice he offered the chief priest two talents for it  belzanor appalled apis the allknowing for two talents what said the chief priest  apollodorus he invoked the mercy of apis and asked for five  belzanor there will be famine and tempest in the land for this  persian pooh why did not apis cause caesar to be vanquished by achillas any fresh news from the war apollodorus  apollodorus the little king ptolemy was drowned  belzanor drowned how  apollodorus with the rest of them caesar attacked them from three sides at once and swept them into the nile ptolemys barge sank  belzanor a marvelous man this caesar will he come soon think you  apollodorus he was settling the jewish question when i left  a flourish of trumpets from the north and commotion among the townsfolk announces the approach of caesar  persian he has made short work of them here he comes he hurries to his post in front of the egyptian lines  belzanor following him ho there caesar comes  the soldiers stand at attention and dress their lines apollodorus goes to the egyptian line  centurion hurrying to the gangway guard attention there caesar comes  caesar arrives in state with rufio britannus following the soldiers receive him with enthusiastic shouting  rufio at his left hand you have not yet appointed a roman governor for this province  caesar looking whimsically at him but speaking with perfect gravity what say you to mithridates of pergamos my reliever and rescuer the great son of eupator  rufio why that you will want him elsewhere do you forget that you have some three or four armies to conquer on your way home  caesar indeed well what say you to yourself  rufio incredulously i i a governor what are you dreaming of do you not know that i am only the son of a freedman  caesar affectionately has not caesar called you his son calling to the whole assembly peace awhile there and hear me  the roman soldiers hear caesar  caesar hear the service quality rank and name of the roman governor by service caesars shield by quality caesars friend by rank a roman soldier the roman soldiers give a triumphant shout by name rufio they shout again  rufio kissing caesars hand ay i am caesars shield but of what use shall i be when i am no longer on caesars arm well no matter he becomes husky and turns away to recover himself  caesar where is that british islander of mine  britannus coming forward on caesars right hand here caesar  caesar who bade you pray thrust yourself into the battle of the delta uttering the barbarous cries of your native land and affirming yourself a match for any four of the egyptians to whom you applied unseemly epithets  britannus caesar i ask you to excuse the language that escaped me in the heat of the moment  caesar and how did you who cannot swim cross the canal with us when we stormed the camp  britannus caesar i clung to the tail of your horse  caesar these are not the deeds of a slave britannicus but of a free man  britannus caesar i was born free  caesar but they call you caesars slave  britannus only as caesars slave have i found real freedom  caesar moved well said ungrateful that i am i was about to set you free but now i will not part from you for a million talents he claps him friendly on the shoulder britannus gratified but a trifle shamefaced takes his hand and kisses it sheepishly  belzanor to the persian this roman knows how to make men serve him  persian ay men too humble to become dangerous rivals to him  belzanor o subtle one o cynic  caesar seeing apollodorus in the egyptian corner and calling to him apollodorus i leave the art of egypt in your charge remember rome loves art and will encourage it ungrudgingly  apollodorus i understand caesar rome will produce no art itself but it will buy up and take away whatever the other nations produce  caesar what rome produces no art is peace not an art is war not an art is government not an art is civilization not an art all these we give you in exchange for a few ornaments you will have the best of the bargain turning to rufio and now what else have i to do before i embark trying to recollect there is something i cannot remember what can it be well well it must remain undone we must not waste this favorable wind farewell rufio  rufio caesar i am loath to let you go to rome without your shield there are too many daggers there  caesar it matters not i shall finish my lifes work on my way back and then i shall have lived long enough besides i have always disliked the idea of dying i had rather be killed farewell  rufio with a sigh raising his hands and giving caesar up as incorrigible farewell they shake hands  caesar waving his hand to apollodorus farewell apollodorus and my friends all of you aboard  the gangway is run out from the quay to the ship as caesar moves towards it cleopatra cold and tragic cunningly dressed in black without ornaments or decoration of any kind and thus making a striking figure among the brilliantly dressed bevy of ladies as she passes through it comes from the palace and stands on the steps caesar does not see her until she speaks  cleopatra has cleopatra no part in this leave taking  caesar enlightened ah i knew there was something to rufio how could you let me forget her rufio hastening to her had i gone without seeing you i should never have forgiven myself he takes her hands and brings her into the middle of the esplanade she submits stonily is this mourning for me  cleopatra no  caesar remorsefully ah that was thoughtless of me it is for your brother  cleopatra no  caesar for whom then  cleopatra ask the roman governor whom you have left us  caesar rufio  cleopatra yes rufio she points at him with deadly scorn he who is to rule here in caesars name in caesars way according to caesars boasted laws of life  caesar dubiously he is to rule as he can cleopatra he has taken the work upon him and will do it in his own way  cleopatra not in your way then  caesar puzzled what do you mean by my way  cleopatra without punishment without revenge without judgment  caesar approvingly ay that is the right way the great way the only possible way in the end to rufio believe it rufio if you can  rufio why i believe it caesar you have convinced me of it long ago but look you you are sailing for numidia today now tell me if you meet a hungry lion you will not punish it for wanting to eat you  caesar wondering what he is driving at no  rufio nor revenge upon it the blood of those it has already eaten  caesar no  rufio nor judge it for its guiltiness  caesar no  rufio what then will you do to save your life from it  caesar promptly kill it man without malice just as it would kill me what does this parable of the lion mean  rufio why cleopatra had a tigress that killed men at bidding i thought she might bid it kill you some day well had i not been caesars pupil what pious things might i not have done to that tigress i might have punished it i might have revenged pothinus on it  caesar interjects pothinus  rufio continuing i might have judged it but i put all these follies behind me and without malice only cut its throat and that is why cleopatra comes to you in mourning  cleopatra vehemently he has shed the blood of my servant ftatateeta on your head be it as upon his caesar if you hold him free of it  caesar energetically on my head be it then for it was well done rufio had you set yourself in the seat of the judge and with hateful ceremonies and appeals to the gods handed that woman over to some hired executioner to be slain before the people in the name of justice never again would i have touched your hand without a shudder but this was natural slaying i feel no horror at it  rufio satisfied nods at cleopatra mutely inviting her to mark that  cleopatra pettish and childish in her impotence no not when a roman slays an egyptian all the world will now see how unjust and corrupt caesar is  caesar taking her handy coaxingly come do not be angry with me i am sorry for that poor totateeta she laughs in spite of herself aha you are laughing does that mean reconciliation  cleopatra angry with herself for laughing no no no but it is so ridiculous to hear you call her totateeta  caesar what as much a child as ever cleopatra have i not made a woman of you after all  cleopatra oh it is you who are a great baby you make me seem silly because you will not behave seriously but you have treated me badly and i do not forgive you  caesar bid me farewell  cleopatra i will not  caesar coaxing i will send you a beautiful present from rome  cleopatra proudly beauty from rome to egypt indeed what can rome give me that egypt cannot give me  apollodorus that is true caesar if the present is to be really beautiful i shall have to buy it for you in alexandria  caesar you are forgetting the treasures for which rome is most famous my friend you cannot buy them in alexandria  apollodorus what are they caesar  caesar her sons come cleopatra forgive me and bid me farewell and i will send you a man roman from head to heel and roman of the noblest not old and ripe for the knife not lean in the arms and cold in the heart not hiding a bald head under his conquerors laurels not stooped with the weight of the world on his shoulders but brisk and fresh strong and young hoping in the morning fighting in the day and reveling in the evening will you take such an one in exchange for caesar  cleopatra palpitating his name his name  caesar shall it be mark antony she throws herself in his arms  rufio you are a bad hand at a bargain mistress if you will swap caesar for antony  caesar so now you are satisfied  cleopatra you will not forget  caesar i will not forget farewell i do not think we shall meet again farewell he kisses her on the forehead she is much affected and begins to sniff he embarks  the roman soldiers as he sets his foot on the gangway hail caesar and farewell  he reaches the ship and returns rufios wave of the hand  apollodorus to cleopatra no tears dearest queen they stab your servant to the heart he will return some day  cleopatra i hope not but i cant help crying all the same she waves her handkerchief to caesar and the ship begins to move  the roman soldiers drawing their swords and raising them in the air hail caesar     notes to caesar and cleopatra  cleopatras cure for baldness  for the sake of conciseness in a hurried situation i have made cleopatra recommend rum this i am afraid is an anachronism the only real one in the play to balance it i give a couple of the remedies she actually believed in they are quoted by galen from cleopatras book on cosmetic  for bald patches powder red sulphuret of arsenic and take it up with oak gum as much as it will bear put on a rag and apply having soaped the place well first i have mixed the above with a foam of nitre and it worked well  several other receipts follow ending with the following is the best of all acting for fallen hairs when applied with oil or pomatum acts also for falling off of eyelashes or for people getting bald all over it is wonderful of domestic mice burnt one part of vine rag burnt one part of horses teeth burnt one part of bears grease one of deers marrow one of reed bark one to be pounded when dry and mixed with plenty of honey til it gets the consistency of honey then the bears grease and marrow to be mixed when melted the medicine to be put in a brass flask and the bald part rubbed til it sprouts  concerning these ingredients my fellowdramatist gilbert murray who as a professor of greek has applied to classical antiquity the methods of high scholarship my own method is pure divination writes to me as follows some of this i dont understand and possibly galen did not as he quotes your heroines own language foam of nitre is i think something like soapsuds reed bark is an odd expression it might mean the outside membrane of a reed i do not know what it ought to be called in the burnt mice receipt i take that you first mixed the solid powders with honey and then added the grease i expect cleopatra preferred it because in most of the others you have to lacerate the skin prick it or rub it till it bleeds i do not know what vine rag is i translate literally  apparent anachronisms  the only way to write a play which shall convey to the general public an impression of antiquity is to make the characters speak blank verse and abstain from reference to steam telegraphy or any of the material conditions of their existence the more ignorant men are the more convinced are they that their little parish and their little chapel is an apex which civilization and philosophy have painfully struggled up the pyramid of time from a desert of savagery savagery they think became barbarism barbarism became ancient civilization ancient civilization became pauline christianity pauline christianity became roman catholicism roman catholicism became the dark ages and the dark ages were finally enlightened by the protestant instincts of the english race the whole process is summed up as progress with a capital p and any elderly gentleman of progressive temperament will testify that the improvement since he was a boy is enormous  now if we count the generations of progressive elderly gentlemen since say plato and add together the successive enormous improvements to which each of them has testified it will strike us at once as an unaccountable fact that the world instead of having been improved in 67 generations out all recognition presents on the whole a rather less dignified appearance in ibsens enemy of the people than in platos republic and in truth the period of time covered by history is far too short to allow of any perceptible progress in the popular sense of evolution of the human species the notion that there has been any such progress since caesars time less than 20 centuries is too absurd for discussion all the savagery barbarism dark ages and the rest of it of which we have any record as existing in the past exists at the present moment a british carpenter or stonemason may point out that he gets twice as much money for his labor as his father did in the same trade and that his suburban house with its bath its cottage piano its drawingroom suite and its album of photographs would have shamed the plainness of his grandmothers but the descendants of feudal barons living in squalid lodgings on a salary of fifteen shillings a week instead of in castles on princely revenues do not congratulate the world on the change such changes in fact are not to the point it has been known as far back as our records go that man running wild in the woods is different to man kennelled in a city slum that a dog seems to understand a shepherd better than a hewer of wood and drawer of water can understand an astronomer and that breeding gentle nurture and luxurious food and shelter will produce a kind of man with whom the common laborer is socially incompatible the same thing is true of horses and dogs now there is clearly room for great changes in the world by increasing the percentage of individuals who are carefully bred and gently nurtured even to finally making the most of every man and woman born but that possibility existed in the days of the hittites as much as it does today it does not give the slightest real support to the common assumption that the civilized contemporaries of the hittites were unlike their civilized descendants today  this would appear the truest commonplace if it were not that the ordinary citizens ignorance of the past combines with his idealization of the present to mislead and flatter him our latest book on the new railway across asia describes the dulness of the siberian farmer and the vulgar pursepride of the siberian man of business without the least consciousness that the sting of contemptuous instances given might have been saved by writing simply farmers and provincial plutocrats in siberia are exactly what they are in england the latest professor descanting on the civilization of the western empire in the fifth century feels bound to assume in the teeth of his own researches that the christian was one sort of animal and the pagan another it might as well be assumed as indeed it generally is assumed by implication that a murder committed with a poisoned arrow is different to a murder committed with a mauser rifle all such notions are illusions go back to the first syllable of recorded time and there you will find your christian and your pagan your yokel and your poet helot and hero don quixote and sancho tamino and papageno newton and bushman unable to count eleven all alive and contemporaneous and all convinced that they are heirs of all the ages and the privileged recipients of the truth all others damnable heresies just as you have them today flourishing in countries each of which is the bravest and best that ever sprang at heavens command from out of the azure main  again there is the illusion of increased command over nature meaning that cotton is cheap and that ten miles of country road on a bicycle have replaced four on foot but even if mans increased command over nature included any increased command over himself the only sort of command relevant to his evolution into a higher being the fact remains that it is only by running away from the increased command over nature to country places where nature is still in primitive command over man that he can recover from the effects of the smoke the stench the foul air the overcrowding the racket the ugliness the dirt which the cheap cotton costs us if manufacturing activity means progress the town must be more advanced than the country and the field laborers and village artizans of today must be much less changed from the servants of job than the proletariat of modern london from the proletariat of caesars rome yet the cockney proletarian is so inferior to the village laborer that it is only by steady recruiting from the country that london is kept alive this does not seem as if the change since jobs time were progress in the popular sense quite the reverse the common stock of discoveries in physics has accumulated a little that is all  one more illustration is the englishman prepared to admit that the american is his superior as a human being i ask this question because the scarcity of labor in america relatively to the demand for it has led to a development of machinery there and a consequent increase of command over nature which makes many of our english methods appear almost medieval to the uptodate chicagoan this means that the american has an advantage over the englishman of exactly the same nature that the englishman has over the contemporaries of cicero is the englishman prepared to draw the same conclusion in both cases i think not the american of course will draw it cheerfully but i must then ask him whether since a modern negro has a greater command over nature than washington had we are also to accept the conclusion involved in his former one that humanity has progressed from washington to the fin de siecle negro  finally i would point out that if life is crowned by its success and devotion in industrial organization and ingenuity we had better worship the ant and the bee as moralists urge us to do in our childhood and humble ourselves before the arrogance of the birds of aristophanes  my reason then for ignoring the popular conception of progress in caesar and cleopatra is that there is no reason to suppose that any progress has taken place since their time but even if i shared the popular delusion i do not see that i could have made any essential difference in the play i can only imitate humanity as i know it nobody knows whether shakespeare thought that ancient athenian joiners weavers or bellows menders were any different from elizabethan ones but it is quite certain that one could not have made them so unless indeed he had played the literary man and made quince say not is all our company here but bottom was not that socrates that passed us at the piraeus with glaucon and polemarchus on his way to the house of kephalus and so on  cleopatra  cleopatra was only sixteen when caesar went to egypt but in egypt sixteen is a riper age than it is in england the childishness i have ascribed to her as far as it is childishness of character and not lack of experience is not a matter of years it may be observed in our own climate at the present day in many women of fifty it is a mistake to suppose that the difference between wisdom and folly has anything to do with the difference between physical age and physical youth some women are younger at seventy than most women at seventeen  it must be borne in mind too that cleopatra was a queen and was therefore not the typical greekcultured educated egyptian lady of her time to represent her by any such type would be as absurd as to represent george iv by a type founded on the attainments of sir isaac newton it is true that an ordinarily well educated alexandrian girl of her time would no more have believed bogey stories about the romans than the daughter of a modern oxford professor would believe them about the germans though by the way it is possible to talk great nonsense at oxford about foreigners when we are at war with them but i do not feel bound to believe that cleopatra was well educated her father the illustrious flute blower was not at all a parent of the oxford professor type and cleopatra was a chip of the old block  britannus  i find among those who have read this play in manuscript a strong conviction that an ancient briton could not possibly have been like a modern one i see no reason to adopt this curious view it is true that the roman and norman conquests must have for a time disturbed the normal british type produced by the climate but britannus born before these events represents the unadulterated briton who fought caesar and impressed roman observers much as we should expect the ancestors of mr podsnap to impress the cultivated italians of their time  i am told that it is not scientific to treat national character as a product of climate this only shows the wide difference between common knowledge and the intellectual game called science we have men of exactly the same stock and speaking the same language growing in great britain in ireland and in america the result is three of the most distinctly marked nationalities under the sun racial characteristics are quite another matter the difference between a jew and a gentile has nothing to do with the difference between an englishman and a german the characteristics of britannus are local characteristics not race characteristics in an ancient briton they would i take it be exaggerated since modern britain disforested drained urbanified and consequently cosmopolized is presumably less characteristically british than caesars britain  and again i ask does anyone who in the light of a competent knowledge of his own age has studied history from contemporary documents believe that 67 generations of promiscuous marriage have made any appreciable difference in the human fauna of these isles certainly i do not  julius caesar  as to caesar himself i have purposely avoided the usual anachronism of going to caesars books and concluding that the style is the man that is only true of authors who have the specific literary genius and have practised long enough to attain complete selfexpression in letters it is not true even on these conditions in an age when literature is conceived as a game of style and not as a vehicle of selfexpression by the author now caesar was an amateur stylist writing books of travel and campaign histories in a style so impersonal that the authenticity of the later volumes is disputed they reveal some of his qualities just as the voyage of a naturalist round the world reveals some of darwins without expressing his private personality an englishman reading them would say that caesar was a man of great common sense and good taste meaning thereby a man without originality or moral courage  in exhibiting caesar as a much more various person than the historian of the gallic wars i hope i have not succumbed unconsciously to the dramatic illusion to which all great men owe part of their reputation and some the whole of it i admit that reputations gained in war are specially questionable able civilians taking up the profession of arms like caesar and cromwell in middle age have snatched all its laurels from opponent commanders bred to it apparently because capable persons engaged in military pursuits are so scarce that the existence of two of them at the same time in the same hemisphere is extremely rare the capacity of any conqueror is therefore more likely than not to be an illusion produced by the incapacity of his adversary at all events caesar might have won his battles without being wiser than charles xii or nelson or joan of arc who were like most modern selfmade millionaires halfwitted geniuses enjoying the worship accorded by all races to certain forms of insanity but caesars victories were only advertisements for an eminence that would never have become popular without them caesar is greater off the battle field than on it nelson off his quarterdeck was so quaintly out of the question that when his head was injured at the battle of the nile and his conduct became for some years openly scandalous the difference was not important enough to be noticed it may however be said that peace hath her illusory reputations no less than war and it is certainly true that in civil life mere capacity for workthe power of killing a dozen secretaries under you so to speak as a lifeordeath courier kills horsesenables men with common ideas and superstitions to distance all competitors in the strife of political ambition it was this power of work that astonished cicero as the most prodigious of caesars gifts as it astonished later observers in napoleon before it wore him out how if caesar were nothing but a nelson and a gladstone combined a prodigy of vitality without any special quality of mind nay with ideas that were worn out before he was born as nelsons and gladstones were i have considered that possibility too and rejected it i cannot cite all the stories about caesar which seem to me to show that he was genuinely original but let me at least point out that i have been careful to attribute nothing but originality to him originality gives a man an air of frankness generosity and magnanimity by enabling him to estimate the value of truth money or success in any particular instance quite independently of convention and moral generalization he therefore will not in the ordinary treasury bench fashion tell a lie which everybody knows to be a lie and consequently expects him as a matter of good taste to tell his lies are not found out they pass for candors he understands the paradox of money and gives it away when he can get most for it in other words when its value is least which is just when a common man tries hardest to get it he knows that the real moment of success is not the moment apparent to the crowd hence in order to produce an impression of complete disinterestedness and magnanimity he has only to act with entire selfishness and this is perhaps the only sense in which a man can be said to be naturally great it is in this sense that i have represented caesar as great having virtue he has no need of goodness he is neither forgiving frank nor generous because a man who is too great to resent has nothing to forgive a man who says things that other people are afraid to say need be no more frank than bismarck was and there is no generosity in giving things you do not want to people of whom you intend to make use this distinction between virtue and goodness is not understood in england hence the poverty of our drama in heroes our stage attempts at them are mere goodygoodies goodness in its popular british sense of selfdenial implies that man is vicious by nature and that supreme goodness is supreme martyrdom not sharing that pious opinion i have not given countenance to it in any of my plays in this i follow the precedent of the ancient myths which represent the hero as vanquishing his enemies not in fair fight but with enchanted sword superequine horse and magical invulnerability the possession of which from the vulgar moralistic point of view robs his exploits of any merit whatever  as to caesars sense of humor there is no more reason to assume that he lacked it than to assume that he was deaf or blind it is said that on the occasion of his assassination by a conspiracy of moralists it is always your moralist who makes assassination a duty on the scaffold or off it he defended himself until the good brutes struck him when he exclaimed what you too brutes and disdained further fight if this be true he must have been an incorrigible comedian but even if we waive this story or accept the traditional sentimental interpretation of it there is still abundant evidence of his lightheartedness and adventurousness indeed it is clear from his whole history that what has been called his ambition was an instinct for exploration he had much more of columbus and franklin in him than of henry v  however nobody need deny caesar a share at least of the qualities i have attributed to him all men much more julius caesars possess all qualities in some degree the really interesting question is whether i am right in assuming that the way to produce an impression of greatness is by exhibiting a man not as mortifying his nature by doing his duty in the manner which our system of putting little men into great positions not having enough great men in our influential families to go round forces us to inculcate but by simply doing what he naturally wants to do for this raises the question whether our world has not been wrong in its moral theory for the last 2500 years or so it must be a constant puzzle to many of us that the christian era so excellent in its intentions should have been practically such a very discreditable episode in the history of the race i doubt if this is altogether due to the vulgar and sanguinary sensationalism of our religious legends with their substitution of gross physical torments and public executions for the passion of humanity islam substituting voluptuousness for torment a merely superficial difference it is true has done no better it may have been the failure of christianity to emancipate itself from expiatory theories of moral responsibility guilt innocence reward punishment and the rest of it that baffled its intention of changing the world but these are bound up in all philosophies of creation as opposed to cosmism they may therefore be regarded as the price we pay for popular religion
