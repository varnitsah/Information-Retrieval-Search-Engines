73309315	the dead alive  by wilkie collins    chapter i   the sick man  heart all right said the doctor lungs all right no organic disease that i can discover philip lefrank dont alarm yourself you are not going to die yet the disease you are suffering from isoverwork the remedy in your case isrest  so the doctor spoke in my chambers in the temple london having been sent for to see me about half an hour after i had alarmed my clerk by fainting at my desk i have no wish to intrude myself needlessly on the readers attention but it may be necessary to add in the way of explanation that i am a junior barrister in good practice i come from the channel island of jersey the french spelling of my name lefranc was anglicized generations sincein the days when the letter k was still used in england at the end of words which now terminate in c we hold our heads high nevertheless as a jersey family it is to this day a trial to my father to hear his son described as a member of the english bar  rest i repeated when my medical adviser had done my good friend are you aware that it is termtime the courts are sitting look at the briefs waiting for me on that table rest means ruin in my case  and work added the doctor quietly means death  i started he was not trying to frighten me he was plainly in earnest  it is merely a question of time he went on you have a fine constitution you are a young man but you cannot deliberately overwork your brain and derange your nervous system much longer go away at once if you are a good sailor take a seavoyage the ocean air is the best of all air to build you up again no i dont want to write a prescription i decline to physic you i have no more to say  with these words my medical friend left the room i was obstinate i went into court the same day  the senior counsel in the case on which i was engaged applied to me for some information which it was my duty to give him to my horror and amazement i was perfectly unable to collect my ideas facts and dates all mingled together confusedly in my mind i was led out of court thoroughly terrified about myself the next day my briefs went back to the attorneys and i followed my doctors advice by taking my passage for america in the first steamer that sailed for new york  i had chosen the voyage to america in preference to any other trip by sea with a special object in view a relative of my mothers had emigrated to the united states many years since and had thriven there as a farmer he had given me a general invitation to visit him if i ever crossed the atlantic the long period of inaction under the name of rest to which the doctors decision had condemned me could hardly be more pleasantly occupied as i thought than by paying a visit to my relation and seeing what i could of america in that way after a brief sojourn at new york i started by railway for the residence of my hostmr isaac meadowcroft of morwick farm  there are some of the grandest natural prospects on the face of creation in america there is also to be found in certain states of the union by way of wholesome contrast scenery as flat as monotonous and as uninteresting to the traveler as any that the earth can show the part of the country in which m meadowcrofts farm was situated fell within this latter category i looked round me when i stepped out of the railwaycarriage on the platform at morwick station and i said to myself if to be cured means in my case to be dull i have accurately picked out the very place for the purpose  i look back at those words by the light of later events and i pronounce them as you will soon pronounce them to be the words of an essentially rash man whose hasty judgment never stopped to consider what surprises time and chance together might have in store for him  mr meadowcrofts eldest son ambrose was waiting at the station to drive me to the farm  there was no forewarning in the appearance of ambrose meadowcroft of the strange and terrible events that were to follow my arrival at morwick a healthy handsome young fellow one of thousands of other healthy handsome young fellows said how dye do mr lefrank glad to see you sir jump into the buggy the man will look after your portmanteau with equally conventional politeness i answered thank you how are you all at home so we started on the way to the farm  our conversation on the drive began with the subjects of agriculture and breeding i displayed my total ignorance of crops and cattle before we had traveled ten yards on our journey ambrose meadowcroft cast about for another topic and failed to find it upon this i cast about on my side and asked at a venture if i had chosen a convenient time for my visit the young farmers stolid brown face instantly brightened i had evidently hit haphazard on an interesting subject  you couldnt have chosen a better time he said our house has never been so cheerful as it is now  have you any visitors staying with you  its not exactly a visitor its a new member of the family who has come to live with us  a new member of the family may i ask who it is  ambrose meadowcroft considered before he replied touched his horse with the whip looked at me with a certain sheepish hesitation and suddenly burst out with the truth in the plainest possible words  its just the nicest girl sir you ever saw in your life  ay ay a friend of your sisters i suppose  a friend bless your heart its our little american cousin naomi colebrook  i vaguely remembered that a younger sister of mr meadowcrofts had married an american merchant in the remote past and had died many years since leaving an only child i was now further informed that the father also was dead in his last moments he had committed his helpless daughter to the compassionate care of his wifes relations at morwick  he was always a speculating man ambrose went on tried one thing after another and failed in all died sir leaving barely enough to bury him my father was a little doubtful before she came here how his american niece would turn out we are english you know and though we do live in the united states we stick fast to our english ways and habits we dont much like american women in general i can tell you but when naomi made her appearance she conquered us all such a girl took her place as one of the family directly learned to make herself useful in the dairy in a weeks time i tell you thisshe hasnt been with us quite two months yet and we wonder already how we ever got on without her  once started on the subject of naomi colebrook ambrose held to that one topic and talked on it without intermission it required no great gift of penetration to discover the impression which the american cousin had produced in this case the young fellows enthusiasm communicated itself in a certain tepid degree to me i really felt a mild flutter of anticipation at the prospect of seeing naomi when we drew up toward the close of evening at the gates of morwick farm    chapter ii   the new faces  immediately on my arrival i was presented to mr meadowcroft the father  the old man had become a confirmed invalid confined by chronic rheumatism to his chair he received me kindly and a little wearily as well his only unmarried daughter he had long since been left a widower was in the room in attendance on her father she was a melancholy middleaged woman without visible attractions of any sortone of those persons who appear to accept the obligation of living under protest as a burden which they would never have consented to bear if they had only been consulted first we three had a dreary little interview in a parlor of bare walls and then i was permitted to go upstairs and unpack my portmanteau in my own room  supper will be at nine oclock sir said miss meadowcroft  she pronounced those words as if supper was a form of domestic offense habitually committed by the men and endured by the women i followed the groom up to my room not overwell pleased with my first experience of the farm  no naomi and no romance thus far  my room was cleanoppressively clean i quite longed to see a little dust somewhere my library was limited to the bible and the prayerbook my view from the window showed me a dead flat in a partial state of cultivation fading sadly from view in the waning light above the head of my spruce white bed hung a scroll bearing a damnatory quotation from scripture in emblazoned letters of red and black the dismal presence of miss meadowcroft had passed over my bedroom and had blighted it my spirits sank as i looked round me suppertime was still an event in the future i lighted the candles and took from my portmanteau what i firmly believe to have been the first french novel ever produced at morwick farm it was one of the masterly and charming stories of dumas the elder in five minutes i was in a new world and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest french company the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality i looked at my watch nine oclock  ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supperroom  mr meadowcrofts invalid chair had been wheeled to the head of the table on his righthand side sat his sad and silent daughter she signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father silas meadowcroft came in at the same moment and was presented to me by his brother there was a strong family likeness between them ambrose being the taller and the handsomer man of the two but there was no marked character in either face i set them down as men with undeveloped qualities waiting the good and evil qualities alike for time and circumstances to bring them to their full growth  the door opened again while i was still studying the two brothers without i honestly confess being very favorably impressed by either of them a new member of the family circle who instantly attracted my attention entered the room  he was short spare and wiry singularly pale for a person whose life was passed in the country the face was in other respects besides this a striking face to see as to the lower part it was covered with a thick black beard and mustache at a time when shaving was the rule and beards the rare exception in america as to the upper part of the face it was irradiated by a pair of wild glittering brown eyes the expression of which suggested to me that there was something not quite right with the mans mental balance a perfectly sane person in all his sayings and doings so far as i could see there was still something in those wild brown eyes which suggested to me that under exceptionally trying circumstances he might surprise his oldest friends by acting in some exceptionally violent or foolish way a little crackedthat in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supperroom  mr meadowcroft the elder having not spoken one word thus far himself introduced the newcomer to me with a sideglance at his sons which had something like defiance in ita glance which as i was sorry to notice was returned with the defiance on their side by the two young men  philip lefrank this is my overlooker mr jago said the old man formally presenting us john jago this is my young relative by marriage mr lefrank he is not well he has come over the ocean for rest and change of scene mr jago is an american philip i hope you have no prejudice against americans make acquaintance with mr jago sit together he cast another dark look at his sons and the sons again returned it they pointedly drew back from john jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table it was plain that the man with the beard stood high in the fathers favor and that he was cordially disliked for that or for some other reason by the sons  the door opened once more a young lady quietly joined the party at the suppertable  was the young lady naomi colebrook i looked at ambrose and saw the answer in his face naomi colebrook at last  a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well set on her shoulders bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight little figuretoo slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english ears our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten the right impressions i liked naomi colebrook at first sight liked her pleasant smile liked her hearty shake of the hand when we were presented to each other if i get on well with nobody else in this house i thought to myself i shall certainly get on well with you  for once in a way i proved a true prophet in the atmosphere of smoldering enmities at morwick farm the pretty american girl and i remained firm and true friends from first to last ambrose made room for naomi to sit between his brother and himself she changed color for a moment and looked at him with a pretty reluctant tenderness as she took her chair i strongly suspected the young farmer of squeezing her hand privately under cover of the tablecloth  the supper was not a merry one the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between naomi and me  for some incomprehensible reason john jago seemed to be ill at ease in the presence of his young countrywoman he looked up at naomi doubtingly from his plate and looked down again slowly with a frown when i addressed him he answered constrainedly even when he spoke to mr meadowcroft he was still on his guardon his guard against the two young men as i fancied by the direction which his eyes took on these occasions when we began our meal i had noticed for the first time that silas meadowcrofts left hand was strapped up with surgical plaster and i now further observed that john jagos wandering brown eyes furtively looking at everybody round the table in turn looked with a curious cynical scrutiny at the young mans injured hand  by way of making my first evening at the farm all the more embarrassing to me as a stranger i discovered before long that the father and sons were talking indirectly at each other through mr jago and through me when old mr meadowcroft spoke disparagingly to his overlooker of some past mistake made in the cultivation of the arable land of the farm old mr meadowcrofts eyes pointed the application of his hostile criticism straight in the direction of his two sons when the two sons seized a stray remark of mine about animals in general and applied it satirically to the mismanagement of sheep and oxen in particular they looked at john jago while they talked to me on occasions of this sortand they happened frequentlynaomi struck in resolutely at the right moment and turned the talk to some harmless topic every time she took a prominent part in this way in keeping the peace melancholy miss meadowcroft looked slowly round at her in stern and silent disparagement of her interference a more dreary and more disunited family party i never sat at the table with envy hatred malice and uncharitableness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by a sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in naomi and my other interest in the little lovelooks which i now and then surprised passing between her and ambrose i should never have sat through that supper i should certainly have taken refuge in my french novel and my own room  at last the unendurably long meal served with ostentatious profusion was at an end miss meadowcroft rose with her ghostly solemnity and granted me my dismissal in these words  we are early people at the farm mr lefrank i wish you goodnight  she laid her bony hands on the back of mr meadowcrofts invalidchair cut him short in his farewell salutation to me and wheeled him out to his bed as if she were wheeling him out to his grave  do you go to your room immediately sir if not may i offer you a cigarprovided the young gentlemen will permit it  so picking his words with painful deliberation and pointing his reference to the young gentlemen with one sardonic sidelook at them mr john jago performed the duties of hospitality on his side i excused myself from accepting the cigar with studied politeness the man of the glittering brown eyes wished me a good nights rest and left the room  ambrose and silas both approached me hospitably with their open cigarcases in their hands  you were quite right to say no ambrose began never smoke with john jago his cigars will poison you  and never believe a word john jago says to you added silas he is the greatest liar in america let the other be whom he may  naomi shook her forefinger reproachfully at them as if the two sturdy young farmers had been two children  what will mr lefrank think she said if you talk in that way of a person whom your father respects and trusts go and smoke i am ashamed of both of you  silas slunk away without a word of protest ambrose stood his ground evidently bent on making his peace with naomi before he left her  seeing that i was in the way i walked aside toward a glass door at the lower end of the room the door opened on the trim little farmgarden bathed at that moment in lovely moonlight i stepped out to enjoy the scene and found my way to a seat under an elmtree the grand repose of nature had never looked so unutterably solemn and beautiful as it now appeared after what i had seen and heard inside the house i understood or thought i understood the sad despair of humanity which led men into monasteries in the old times the misanthropical side of my nature where is the sick man who is not conscious of that side of him was fast getting the upper hand of me when i felt a light touch laid on my shoulder and found myself reconciled to my species once more by naomi colebrook    chapter iii   the moonlight meeting  i want to speak to you naomi began you dont think ill of me for following you out here we are not accustomed to stand much on ceremony in america  you are quite right in america pray sit down  she seated herself by my side looking at me frankly and fearlessly by the light of the moon  you are related to the family here she resumed and i am related too i guess i may say to you what i couldnt say to a stranger i am right glad you have come here mr lefrank and for a reason sir which you dont suspect  thank you for the compliment you pay me miss colebrook whatever the reason may be  she took no notice of my reply she steadily pursued her own train of thought  i guess you may do some good sir in this wretched house the girl went on with her eyes still earnestly fixed on my face there is no love no trust no peace at morwick farm they want somebody here except ambrose dont think ill of ambrose he is only thoughtless i say the rest of them want somebody here to make them ashamed of their hard hearts and their horrid false envious ways you are a gentleman you know more than they know they cant help themselves they must look up to you try mr lefrank when you have the opportunitypray try sir to make peace among them you heard what went on at suppertime and you were disgusted with it oh yes you were i saw you frown to yourself and i know what that means in you englishmen  there was no choice but to speak ones mind plainly to naomi i acknowledged the impression which had been produced on me at suppertime just as plainly as i have acknowledged it in these pages naomi nodded her head in undisguised approval of my candor  that will do thats speaking out she said butoh my you put it a deal too mildly sir when you say the men dont seem to be on friendly terms together here they hate each other thats the word mr lefrankhate bitter bitter bitter hate she clinched her little fists she shook them vehemently by way of adding emphasis to her last words and then she suddenly remembered ambrose except ambrose she added opening her hand again and laying it very earnestly on my arm dont go and misjudge ambrose sir there is no harm in poor ambrose  the girls innocent frankness was really irresistible  should i be altogether wrong i asked if i guessed that you were a little partial to ambrose  an englishwoman would have felt or would at least have assumed some little hesitation at replying to my question naomi did not hesitate for an instant  you are quite right sir she said with the most perfect composure if things go well i mean to marry ambrose  if things go well i repeated what does that mean money  she shook her head  it means a fear that i have in my own mind she answereda fear mr lefrank of matters taking a bad turn among the men herethe wicked hardhearted unfeeling men i dont mean ambrose sir i mean his brother silas and john jago did you notice silass hand john jago did that sir with a knife  by accident i asked  on purpose she answered in return for a blow  this plain revelation of the state of things at morwick farm rather staggered meblows and knives under the rich and respectable rooftree of old mr meadowcroftblows and knives not among the laborers but among the masters my first impression was like your first impression no doubt i could hardly believe it  are you sure of what you say i inquired  i have it from ambrose ambrose would never deceive me ambrose knows all about it  my curiosity was powerfully excited to what sort of household had i rashly voyaged across the ocean in search of rest and quiet  may i know all about it too i said  well i will try and tell you what ambrose told me but you must promise me one thing first sir promise you wont go away and leave us when you know the whole truth shake hands on it mr lefrank come shake hands on it  there was no resisting her fearless frankness i shook hands on it naomi entered on her narrative the moment i had given her my pledge without wasting a word by way of preface  when you are shown over the farm here she began you will see that it is really two farms in one on this side of it as we look from under this tree they raise crops on the other sideon much the larger half of the land mindthey raise cattle when mr meadowcroft got too old and too sick to look after his farm himself the boys i mean ambrose and silas divided the work between them ambrose looked after the crops and silas after the cattle things didnt go well somehow under their management i cant tell you why i am only sure ambrose was not in fault the old man got more and more dissatisfied especially about his beasts his pride is in his beasts without saying a word to the boys he looked about privately i think he was wrong in that sir dont youhe looked about privately for help and in an evil hour he heard of john jago do you like john jago mr lefrank  so far no i dont like him  just my sentiments sir but i dont know its likely we may be wrong theres nothing against john jago except that he is so odd in his ways they do say he wears all that nasty hair on his face i hate hair on a mans face on account of a vow he made when he lost his wife dont you think mr lefrank a man must be a little mad who shows his grief at losing his wife by vowing that he will never shave himself again well thats what they do say john jago vowed perhaps its a lie people are such liars here anyway its truth the boys themselves confess that when john came to the farm he came with a firstrate character the old father here isnt easy to please and he pleased the old father yes thats so mr meadowcroft dont like my countrymen in general hes like his sonsenglish bitter english to the marrow of his bones somehow in spite of that john jago got round him maybe because john does certainly know his business oh yes cattle and crops john knows his business since hes been overlooker things have prospered as they didnt prosper in the time of the boys ambrose owned as much to me himself still sir its hard to be set aside for a stranger isnt it john gives the orders now the boys do their work but they have no voice in it when john and the old man put their heads together over the business of the farm i have been long in telling you of it sir but now you know how the envy and the hatred grew among the men before my time since i have been here things seem to get worse and worse theres hardly a day goes by that hard words dont pass between the boys and john or the boys and their father the old man has an aggravating way mr lefranka nasty way as we do call itof taking john jagos part do speak to him about it when you get the chance the main blame of the quarrel between silas and john the other day lies at his door as i think i dont want to excuse silas either it was brutal of himthough he is ambroses brotherto strike john who is the smaller and weaker man of the two but it was worse than brutal in john sir to out with his knife and try to stab silas oh he did it if silas had not caught the knife in his hand his hands awfully cut i can tell you i dressed it myself it might have ended for anything i know in murder  she stopped as the word passed her lips looked back over her shoulder and started violently  i looked where my companion was looking the dark figure of a man was standing watching us in the shadow of the elmtree i rose directly to approach him naomi recovered her selfpossession and checked me before i could interfere  who are you she asked turning sharply toward the stranger what do you want there  the man stepped out from the shadow into the moonlight and stood revealed to us as john jago  i hope i am not intruding he said looking hard at me  what do you want naomi repeated  i dont wish to disturb you or to disturb this gentleman he proceeded when you are quite at leisure miss naomi you would be doing me a favor if you would permit me to say a few words to you in private  he spoke with the most scrupulous politeness trying and trying vainly to conceal some strong agitation which was in possession of him his wild brown eyeswilder than ever in the moonlightrested entreatingly with a strange underlying expression of despair on naomis face his hands clasped lightly in front of him trembled incessantly little as i liked the man he did really impress me as a pitiable object at that moment  do you mean that you want to speak to me tonight naomi asked in undisguised surprise  yes miss if you please at your leisure and at mr lefranks  naomi hesitated  wont it keep till tomorrow she said  i shall be away on farm business tomorrow miss for the whole day please to give me a few minutes this evening he advanced a step toward her his voice faltered and dropped timidly to a whisper i really have something to say to you miss naomi it would be a kindness on your parta very very great kindnessif you will let me say it before i rest tonight  i rose again to resign my place to him once more naomi checked me  no she said dont stir she addressed john jago very reluctantly if you are so much in earnest about it mr john i suppose it must be i cant guess what you can possibly have to say to me which cannot be said before a third person however it wouldnt be civil i suppose to say no in my place you know its my business to wind up the hallclock at ten every night if you choose to come and help me the chances are that we shall have the hall to ourselves will that do  not in the hall miss if you will excuse me  not in the hall  and not in the house either if i may make so bold  what do you mean she turned impatiently and appealed to me do you understand him  john jago signed to me imploringly to let him answer for himself  bear with me miss naomi he said i think i can make you understand me there are eyes on the watch and ears on the watch in the house and there are some footstepsi wont say whoseso soft that no person can hear them  the last allusion evidently made itself understood naomi stopped him before he could say more  well where is it to be she asked resignedly will the garden do mr john  thank you kindly miss the garden will do he pointed to a gravelwalk beyond us bathed in the full flood of the moonlight there he said where we can see all round us and be sure that nobody is listening at ten oclock he paused and addressed himself to me i beg to apologize sir for intruding myself on your conversation please to excuse me  his eyes rested with a last anxious pleading look on naomis face he bowed to us and melted away into the shadow of the tree the distant sound of a door closed softly came to us through the stillness of the night john jago had reentered the house  now that he was out of hearing naomi spoke to me very earnestly  dont suppose sir i have any secrets with him she said i know no more than you do what he wants with me i have half a mind not to keep the appointment when ten oclock comes what would you do in my place  having made the appointment i answered it seems to be due to yourself to keep it if you feel the slightest alarm i will wait in another part of the garden so that i can hear if you call me  she received my proposal with a saucy toss of the head and a smile of pity for my ignorance  you are a stranger mr lefrank or you would never talk to me in that way in america we dont do the men the honor of letting them alarm us in america the women take care of themselves he has got my promise to meet him as you say and i must keep my promise only think she added speaking more to herself than to me of john jago finding out miss meadowcrofts nasty sly underhand ways in the house most men would never have noticed her  i was completely taken by surprise sad and severe miss meadowcroft a listener and a spy what next at morwick farm  was that hint at the watchful eyes and ears and the soft footsteps really an allusion to mr meadowcrofts daughter i asked  of course it was ah she has imposed on you as she imposes on everybody else the false wretch she is secretly at the bottom of half the bad feeling among the men i am certain of itshe keeps mr meadowcrofts mind bitter toward the boys old as she is mr lefrank and ugly as she is she wouldnt object if she could only make him ask her to be john jagos second wife no sir and she wouldnt break her heart if the boys were not left a stick or a stone on the farm when the father dies i have watched her and i know it ah i could tell you such things but theres no time nowits close on ten oclock we must say goodnight i am right glad i have spoken to you sir i say again at parting what i have said already use your influence pray use your influence to soften them and to make them ashamed of themselves in this wicked house we will have more talk about what you can do tomorrow when you are shown over the farm say goodby now hark there is ten striking and look here is john jago stealing out again in the shadow of the tree goodnight friend lefrank and pleasant dreams  with one hand she took mine and pressed it cordially with the other she pushed me away without ceremony in the direction of the house a charming girlan irresistible girl i was nearly as bad as the boys i declare i almost hated john jago too as we crossed each other in the shadow of the tree  arrived at the glass door i stopped and looked back at the gravelwalk  they had met i saw the two shadowy figures slowly pacing backward and forward in the moonlight the woman a little in advance of the man what was he saying to her why was he so anxious that not a word of it should be heard our presentiments are sometimes in certain rare cases the faithful prophecy of the future a vague distrust of that moonlight meeting stealthily took a hold on my mind will mischief come of it i asked myself as i closed the door and entered the house  mischief did come of it you shall hear how    chapter iv   the beechen stick  persons of sensitive nervous temperament sleeping for the first time in a strange house and in a bed that is new to them must make up their minds to pass a wakeful night my first night at morwick farm was no exception to this rule the little sleep i had was broken and disturbed by dreams toward six oclock in the morning my bed became unendurable to me the sun was shining in brightly at the window i determined to try the reviving influence of a stroll in the fresh morning air  just as i got out of bed i heard footsteps and voices under my window  the footsteps stopped and the voices became recognizable i had passed the night with my window open i was able without exciting notice from below to look out  the persons beneath me were silas meadowcroft john jago and three strangers whose dress and appearance indicated plainly enough that they were laborers on the farm silas was swinging a stout beechen stick in his hand and was speaking to jago coarsely and insolently enough of his moonlight meeting with naomi on the previous night  next time you go courting a young lady in secret said silas make sure that the moon goes down first or wait for a cloudy sky you were seen in the garden master jago and you may as well tell us the truth for once in a way did you find her open to persuasion sir did she say yes  john jago kept his temper  if you must have your joke mr silas he said quietly and firmly be pleased to joke on some other subject you are quite wrong sir in what you suppose to have passed between the young lady and me  silas turned about and addressed himself ironically to the three laborers  you hear him boys he cant tell the truth try him as you may he wasnt making love to naomi in the garden last nightoh dear no he has had one wife already and he knows better than to take the yoke on his shoulders for the second time  greatly to my surprise john jago met this clumsy jesting with a formal and serious reply  you are quite right sir he said i have no intention of marrying for the second time what i was saying to miss naomi doesnt matter to you it was not at all what you choose to suppose it was something of quite another kind with which you have no concern be pleased to understand once for all mr silas that not so much as the thought of making love to the young lady has ever entered my head i respect her i admire her good qualities but if she was the only woman left in the world and if i was a much younger man than i am i should never think of asking her to be my wife he burst out suddenly into a harsh uneasy laugh no no not my style mr silasnot my style  something in those words or in his manner of speaking them appeared to exasperate silas he dropped his clumsy irony and addressed himself directly to john jago in a tone of savage contempt  not your style he repeated upon my soul thats a cool way of putting it for a man in your place what do you mean by calling her not your style you impudent beggar naomi colebrook is meat for your master  john jagos temper began to give way at last he approached defiantly a step or two nearer to silas meadowcroft  who is my master he asked  ambrose will show you if you go to him answered the other naomi is his sweetheart not mine keep out of his way if you want to keep a whole skin on your bones  john jago cast one of his sardonic sidelooks at the farmers wounded left hand dont forget your own skin mr silas when you threaten mine i have set my mark on you once sir let me by on my business or i may mark you for a second time  silas lifted his beechen stick the laborers roused to some rude sense of the serious turn which the quarrel was taking got between the two men and parted them i had been hurriedly dressing myself while the altercation was proceeding and i now ran downstairs to try what my influence could do toward keeping the peace at morwick farm  the war of angry words was still going on when i joined the men outside  be off with you on your business you cowardly hound i heard silas say be off with you to the town and take care you dont meet ambrose on the way  take you care you dont feel my knife again before i go cried the other man  silas made a desperate effort to break away from the laborers who were holding him  last time you only felt my fist he shouted next time you shall feel this  he lifted the stick as he spoke i stepped up and snatched it out of his hand  mr silas i said i am an invalid and i am going out for a walk your stick will be useful to me i beg leave to borrow it  the laborers burst out laughing silas fixed his eyes on me with a stare of angry surprise john jago immediately recovering his selfpossession took off his hat and made me a deferential bow  i had no idea mr lefrank that we were disturbing you he said i am very much ashamed of myself sir i beg to apologize  i accept your apology mr jago i answered on the understanding that you as the older man will set the example of forbearance if your temper is tried on any future occasion as it has been tried today and i have further to request i added addressing myself to silas that you will do me a favor as your fathers guest the next time your good spirits lead you into making jokes at mr jagos expense dont carry them quite so far i am sure you meant no harm mr silas will you gratify me by saying so yourself i want to see you and mr jago shake hands  john jago instantly held out his hand with an assumption of good feeling which was a little overacted to my thinking silas meadowcroft made no advance of the same friendly sort on his side  let him go about his business said silas i wont waste any more words on him mr lefrank to please you but saving your presence im dd if i take his hand  further persuasion was plainly useless addressed to such a man as this silas gave me no further opportunity of remonstrating with him even if i had been inclined to do so he turned about in sulky silence and retracing his steps along the path disappeared round the corner of the house the laborers withdrew next in different directions to begin the days work john jago and i were alone  i left it to the man of the wild brown eyes to speak first  in half an hours time sir he said i shall be going on business to narrabee our markettown here can i take any letters to the post for you or is there anything else that i can do in the town  i thanked him and declined both proposals he made me another deferential bow and withdrew into the house i mechanically followed the path in the direction which silas had taken before me  turning the corner of the house and walking on for a little way i found myself at the entrance to the stables and face to face with silas meadowcroft once more he had his elbows on the gate of the yard swinging it slowly backward and forward and turning and twisting a straw between his teeth when he saw me approaching him he advanced a step from the gate and made an effort to excuse himself with a very ill grace  no offense mister ask me what you will besides and ill do it for you but dont ask me to shake hands with john jago i hate him too badly for that if i touched him with one hand sir i tell you this i should throttle him with the other  thats your feeling toward the man mr silas is it  thats my feeling mr lefrank and im not ashamed of it either  is there any such place as a church in your neighborhood mr silas  of course there is  and do you ever go to it  of course i do  at long intervals mr silas  every sunday sir without fail  some third person behind me burst out laughing some third person had been listening to our talk i turned round and discovered ambrose meadowcroft  i understand the drift of your catechism sir though my brother doesnt he said dont be hard on silas sir he isnt the only christian who leaves his christianity in the pew when he goes out of church you will never make us friends with john jago try as you may why what have you got there mr lefrank may i die if it isnt my stick i have been looking for it everywhere  the thick beechen stick had been feeling uncomfortably heavy in my invalid hand for some time past there was no sort of need for my keeping it any longer john jago was going away to narrabee and silas meadowcrofts savage temper was subdued to a sulky repose i handed the stick back to ambrose he laughed as he took it from me  you cant think how strange it feels mr lefrank to be out without ones stick he said a man gets used to his stick sir doesnt he are you ready for your breakfast  not just yet i thought of taking a little walk first  all right sir i wish i could go with you but i have got my work to do this morning and silas has his work too if you go back by the way you came you will find yourself in the garden if you want to go further the wicketgate at the end will lead you into the lane  through sheer thoughtlessness i did a very foolish thing i turned back as i was told and left the brothers together at the gate of the stableyard    chapter v   the news from narrabee  arrived at the garden a thought struck me the cheerful speech and easy manner of ambrose plainly indicated that he was ignorant thus far of the quarrel which had taken place under my window silas might confess to having taken his brothers stick and might mention whose head he had threatened with it it was not only useless but undesirable that ambrose should know of the quarrel i retraced my steps to the stableyard nobody was at the gate i called alternately to silas and to ambrose nobody answered the brothers had gone away to their work  returning to the garden i heard a pleasant voice wishing me goodmorning i looked round naomi colebrook was standing at one of the lower windows of the farm she had her working apron on and she was industriously brightening the knives for the breakfasttable on an oldfashioned board a sleek black cat balanced himself on her shoulder watching the flashing motion of the knife as she passed it rapidly to and fro on the leathercovered surface of the board  come here she said i want to speak to you  i noticed as i approached that her pretty face was clouded and anxious she pushed the cat irritably off her shoulder she welcomed me with only the faint reflection of her bright customary smile  i have seen john jago she said he has been hinting at something which he says happened under your bedroom window this morning when i begged him to explain himself he only answered ask mr lefrank i must be off to narrabee what does it mean tell me right away sir im out of temper and i cant wait  except that i made the best instead of the worst of it i told her what had happened under my window as plainly as i have told it here she put down the knife that she was cleaning and folded her hands before her thinking  i wish i had never given john jago that meeting she said when a man asks anything of a woman the woman i find mostly repents it if she says yes  she made that quaint reflection with a very troubled brow the moonlight meeting had left some unwelcome remembrances in her mind i saw that as plainly as i saw naomi herself  what had john jago said to her i put the question with all needful delicacy making my apologies beforehand  i should like to tell you she began with a strong emphasis on the last word  there she stopped she turned pale then suddenly flushed again to the deepest red she took up the knife once more and went on cleaning it as industriously as ever  i mustnt tell you she resumed with her head down over the knife i have promised not to tell anybody thats the truth forget all about it sir as soon as you can hush heres the spy who saw us last night on the walk and who told silas  dreary miss meadowcroft opened the kitchen door she carried an ostentatiously large prayerbook and she looked at naomi as only a jealous woman of middle age can look at a younger and prettier woman than herself  prayers miss colebrook she said in her sourest manner she paused and noticed me standing under the window prayers mr lefrank she added with a look of devout pity directed exclusively to my address  we will follow you directly miss meadowcroft said naomi  i have no desire to intrude on your secrets miss colebrook  with that acrid answer our priestess took herself and her prayerbook out of the kitchen i joined naomi entering the room by the garden door she met me eagerly i am not quite easy about something she said did you tell me that you left ambrose and silas together  yes  suppose silas tells ambrose of what happened this morning  the same idea as i have already mentioned had occurred to my mind i did my best to reassure naomi  mr jago is out of the way i replied you and i can easily put things right in his absence  she took my arm  come in to prayers she said ambrose will be there and i shall find an opportunity of speaking to him  neither ambrose nor silas was in the breakfastroom when we entered it after waiting vainly for ten minutes mr meadowcroft told his daughter to read the prayers miss meadowcroft read thereupon in the tone of an injured woman taking the throne of mercy by storm and insisting on her rights breakfast followed and still the brothers were absent miss meadowcroft looked at her father and said from bad to worse sir what did i tell you naomi instantly applied the antidote the boys are no doubt detained over their work uncle she turned to me you want to see the farm mr lefrank come and help me to find the boys  for more than an hour we visited one part of the farm after another without discovering the missing men we found them at last near the outskirts of a small wood sitting talking together on the trunk of a felled tree  silas rose as we approached and walked away without a word of greeting or apology into the wood as he got on his feet i noticed that his brother whispered something in his ear and i heard him answer all right  ambrose does that mean you have something to keep a secret from us asked naomi approaching her lover with a smile is silas ordered to hold his tongue  ambrose kicked sulkily at the loose stones lying about him i noticed with a certain surprise that his favorite stick was not in his hand and was not lying near him  business he said in answer to naomi not very graciouslybusiness between silas and me thats what it means if you must know  naomi went on womanlike with her questioning heedless of the reception which they might meet with from an irritated man  why were you both away at prayers and breakfasttime she asked next  we had too much to do ambrose gruffly replied and we were too far from the house  very odd said naomi this has never happened before since i have been at the farm  well live and learn it has happened now  the tone in which he spoke would have warned any man to let him alone but warnings which speak by implication only are thrown away on women the woman having still something in her mind to say said it  have you seen anything of john jago this morning  the smoldering illtemper of ambrose burst suddenlywhy it was impossible to guessinto a flame how many more questions am i to answer he broke out violently are you the parson putting me through my catechism i have seen nothing of john jago and i have got my work to go on with will that do for you  he turned with an oath and followed his brother into the wood naomis bright eyes looked up at me flashing with indignation  what does he mean mr lefrank by speaking to me in that way rude brute how dare he do it she paused her voice look and manner suddenly changed this has never happened before sir has anything gone wrong i declare i shouldnt know ambrose again he is so changed say how does it strike you  i still made the best of a bad case  something has upset his temper i said the merest trifle miss colebrook upsets a mans temper sometimes i speak as a man and i know it give him time and he will make his excuses and all will be well again  my presentation of the case entirely failed to reassure my pretty companion we went back to the house dinnertime came and the brothers appeared their father spoke to them of their absence from morning prayers with needless severity as i thought they resented the reproof with needless indignation on their side and left the room a sour smile of satisfaction showed itself on miss meadowcrofts thin lips she looked at her father then raised her eyes sadly to the ceiling and said we can only pray for them sir  naomi disappeared after dinner when i saw her again she had some news for me  i have been with ambrose she said and he has begged my pardon we have made it up mr lefrank stillstill  stillwhat miss naomi  he is not like himself sir he denies it but i cant help thinking he is hiding something from me  the day wore on the evening came i returned to my french novel but not even dumas himself could keep my attention to the story what else i was thinking of i cannot say why i was out of spirits i am unable to explain i wished myself back in england i took a blind unreasoning hatred to morwick farm  nine oclock struck and we all assembled again at supper with the exception of john jago he was expected back to supper and we waited for him a quarter of an hour by mr meadowcrofts own directions john jago never appeared  the night wore on and still the absent man failed to return miss meadowcroft volunteered to sit up for him naomi eyed her a little maliciously i must own as the two women parted for the night i withdrew to my room and again i was unable to sleep when sunrise came i went out as before to breathe the morning air  on the staircase i met miss meadowcroft ascending to her own room not a curl of her stiff gray hair was disarranged nothing about the impenetrable woman betrayed that she had been watching through the night  has mr jago not returned i asked  miss meadowcroft slowly shook her head and frowned at me  we are in the hands of providence mr lefrank mr jago must have been detained for the night at narrabee  the daily routine of the meals resumed its unalterable course breakfasttime came and dinnertime came and no john jago darkened the doors of morwick farm mr meadowcroft and his daughter consulted together and determined to send in search of the missing man one of the more intelligent of the laborers was dispatched to narrabee to make inquiries  the man returned late in the evening bringing startling news to the farm he had visited all the inns and all the places of business resort in narrabee he had made endless inquiries in every direction with this resultno one had set eyes on john jago everybody declared that john jago had not entered the town  we all looked at each other excepting the two brothers who were seated together in a dark corner of the room the conclusion appeared to be inevitable john jago was a lost man    chapter vi   the limekiln  mr meadowcroft was the first to speak somebody must find john he said  without losing a moment added his daughter  ambrose suddenly stepped out of the dark corner of the room  i will inquire he said  silas followed him  i will go with you he added  mr meadowcroft interposed his authority  one of you will be enough for the present at least go you ambrose your brother may be wanted later if any accident has happened which god forbid we may have to inquire in more than one direction silas you will stay at the farm  the brothers withdrew together ambrose to prepare for his journey silas to saddle one of the horses for him naomi slipped out after them left in company with mr meadowcroft and his daughter both devoured by anxiety about the missing man and both trying to conceal it under an assumption of devout resignation to circumstances i need hardly add that i too retired as soon as it was politely possible for me to leave the room ascending the stairs on my way to my own quarters i discovered naomi half hidden by the recess formed by an oldfashioned windowseat on the first landing my bright little friend was in sore trouble her apron was over her face and she was crying bitterly ambrose had not taken his leave as tenderly as usual she was more firmly persuaded than ever that ambrose was hiding something from her we all waited anxiously for the next day the next day made the mystery deeper than ever  the horse which had taken ambrose to narrabee was ridden back to the farm by a groom from the hotel he delivered a written message from ambrose which startled us further inquiries had positively proved that the missing man had never been near narrabee the only attainable tidings of his whereabouts were tidings derived from vague report it was said that a man like john jago had been seen the previous day in a railway car traveling on the line to new york acting on this imperfect information ambrose had decided on verifying the truth of the report by extending his inquiries to new york  this extraordinary proceeding forced the suspicion on me that something had really gone wrong i kept my doubts to myself but i was prepared from that moment to see the disappearance of john jago followed by very grave results  the same day the results declared themselves  time enough had now elapsed for report to spread through the district the news of what had happened at the farm already aware of the bad feeling existing between the men the neighbors had been now informed no doubt by the laborers present of the deplorable scene that had taken place under my bedroom window public opinion declares itself in america without the slightest reserve or the slightest care for consequences public opinion declared on this occasion that the lost man was the victim of foul play and held one or both of the brothers meadowcroft responsible for his disappearance later in the day the reasonableness of this serious view of the case was confirmed in the popular mind by a startling discovery it was announced that a methodist preacher lately settled at morwick and greatly respected throughout the district had dreamed of john jago in the character of a murdered man whose bones were hidden at morwick farm before night the cry was general for a verification of the preachers dream not only in the immediate district but in the town of narrabee itself the public voice insisted on the necessity of a search for the mortal remains of john jago at morwick farm  in the terrible turn which matters had now taken mr meadowcroft the elder displayed a spirit and an energy for which i was not prepared  my sons have their faults he said serious faults and nobody knows it better than i do my sons have behaved badly and ungratefully toward john jago i dont deny that either but ambrose and silas are not murderers make your search i ask for it no i insist on it after what has been said in justice to my family and my name  the neighbors took him at his word the morwick section of the american nation organized itself on the spot the sovereign people met in committee made speeches elected competent persons to represent the public interests and began the search the next day the whole proceeding ridiculously informal from a legal point of view was carried on by these extraordinary people with as stern and strict a sense of duty as if it had been sanctioned by the highest tribunal in the land  naomi met the calamity that had fallen on the household as resolutely as her uncle himself the girls courage rose with the call which was made on it her one anxiety was for ambrose  he ought to be here she said to me the wretches in this neighborhood are wicked enough to say that his absence is a confession of his guilt  she was right in the present temper of the popular mind the absence of ambrose was a suspicious circumstance in itself  we might telegraph to new york i suggested if you only knew where a message would be likely to find him  i know the hotel which the meadowcrofts use at new york she replied i was sent there after my fathers death to wait till miss meadowcroft could take me to morwick  we decided on telegraphing to the hotel i was writing the message and naomi was looking over my shoulder when we were startled by a strange voice speaking close behind us  oh thats his address is it said the voice we wanted his address rather badly  the speaker was a stranger to me naomi recognized him as one of the neighbors  what do you want his address for she asked sharply  i guess weve found the mortal remains of john jago miss the man replied we have got silas already and we want ambrose too on suspicion of murder  its a lie cried naomi furiouslya wicked lie  the man turned to me  take her into the next room mister he said and let her see for herself  we went together into the next room  in one corner sitting by her father and holding his hand we saw stern and stony miss meadowcroft weeping silently opposite to them crouched on the windowseat his eyes wandering his hands hanging helpless we next discovered silas meadowcroft plainly selfbetrayed as a panicstricken man a few of the persons who had been engaged in the search were seated near watching him the mass of the strangers present stood congregated round a table in the middle of the room they drew aside as i approached with naomi and allowed us to have a clear view of certain objects placed on the table  the center object of the collection was a little heap of charred bones round this were ranged a knife two metal buttons and a stick partially burned the knife was recognized by the laborers as the weapon john jago habitually carried about with himthe weapon with which he had wounded silas meadowcrofts hand the buttons naomi herself declared to have a peculiar pattern on them which had formerly attracted her attention to john jagos coat as for the stick burned as it was i had no difficulty in identifying the quaintlycarved knob at the top it was the heavy beechen stick which i had snatched out of silass hand and which i had restored to ambrose on his claiming it as his own in reply to my inquiries i was informed that the bones the knife the buttons and the stick had all been found together in a limekiln then in use on the farm  is it serious naomi whispered to me as we drew back from the table  it would have been sheer cruelty to deceive her now  yes i whispered back it is serious  the search committee conducted its proceedings with the strictest regularity the proper applications were made forthwith to a justice of the peace and the justice issued his warrant that night silas was committed to prison and an officer was dispatched to arrest ambrose in new york  for my part i did the little i could to make myself useful with the silent sanction of mr meadowcroft and his daughter i went to narrabee and secured the best legal assistance for the defense which the town could place at my disposal this done there was no choice but to wait for news of ambrose and for the examination before the magistrate which was to follow i shall pass over the misery in the house during the interval of expectation no useful purpose could be served by describing it now let me only say that naomis conduct strengthened me in the conviction that she possessed a noble nature i was unconscious of the state of my own feelings at the time but i am now disposed to think that this was the epoch at which i began to envy ambrose the wife whom he had won  the telegraph brought us our first news of ambrose he had been arrested at the hotel and he was on his way to morwick the next day he arrived and followed his brother to prison the two were confined in separate cells and were forbidden all communication with each other  two days later the preliminary examination took place ambrose and silas meadowcroft were charged before the magistrate with the willful murder of john jago i was cited to appear as one of the witnesses and at naomis own request i took the poor girl into court and sat by her during the proceedings my host also was present in his invalidchair with his daughter by his side  such was the result of my voyage across the ocean in search of rest and quiet and thus did time and chance fulfill my first hasty foreboding of the dull life i was to lead at morwick farm    chapter vii   the materials in the defense  on our way to the chairs allotted to us in the magistrates court we passed the platform on which the prisoners were standing together  silas took no notice of us ambrose made a friendly sign of recognition and then rested his hand on the bar in front of him as she passed beneath him naomi was just tall enough to reach his hand on tiptoe she took it i know you are innocent she whispered and gave him one look of loving encouragement as she followed me to her place ambrose never lost his selfcontrol i may have been wrong but i thought this a bad sign  the case as stated for the prosecution told strongly against the suspected men  ambrose and silas meadowcroft were charged with the murder of john jago by means of the stick or by use of some other weapon and with the deliberate destruction of the body by throwing it into the quicklime in proof of this latter assertion the knife which the deceased habitually carried about him and the metal buttons which were known to belong to his coat were produced it was argued that these indestructible substances and some fragments of the larger bones had alone escaped the action of the burning lime having produced medical witnesses to support this theory by declaring the bones to be human and having thus circumstantially asserted the discovery of the remains in the kiln the prosecution next proceeded to prove that the missing man had been murdered by the two brothers and had been by them thrown into the quicklime as a means of concealing their guilt  witness after witness deposed to the inveterate enmity against the deceased displayed by ambrose and silas the threatening language they habitually used toward him their violent quarrels with him which had become a public scandal throughout the neighborhood and which had ended on one occasion at least in a blow the disgraceful scene which had taken place under my window and the restoration to ambrose on the morning of the fatal quarrel of the very stick which had been found among the remains of the dead manthese facts and events and a host of minor circumstances besides sworn to by witnesses whose credit was unimpeachable pointed with terrible directness to the conclusion at which the prosecution had arrived  i looked at the brothers as the weight of the evidence pressed more and more heavily against them to outward view at least ambrose still maintained his selfpossession it was far otherwise with silas abject terror showed itself in his ghastly face in his great knotty hands clinging convulsively to the bar at which he stood in his staring eyes fixed in vacant horror on each witness who appeared public feeling judged him on the spot there he stood selfbetrayed already in the popular opinion as a guilty man  the one point gained in crossexamination by the defense related to the charred bones  pressed on this point a majority of the medical witnesses admitted that their examination had been a hurried one and that it was just possible that the bones might yet prove to be the remains of an animal and not of a man the presiding magistrate decided upon this that a second examination should be made and that the member of the medical experts should be increased  here the preliminary proceedings ended the prisoners were remanded for three days  the prostration of silas at the close of the inquiry was so complete that it was found necessary to have two men to support him on his leaving the court ambrose leaned over the bar to speak to naomi before he followed the jailer out wait he whispered confidently till they hear what i have to say naomi kissed her hand to him affectionately and turned to me with the bright tears in her eyes  why dont they hear what he has to say at once she asked anybody can see that ambrose is innocent its a crying shame sir to send him back to prison dont you think so yourself  if i had confessed what i really thought i should have said that ambrose had proved nothing to my mind except that he possessed rare powers of selfcontrol it was impossible to acknowledge this to my little friend i diverted her mind from the question of her lovers innocence by proposing that we should get the necessary order and visit him in his prison on the next day naomi dried her tears and gave me a little grateful squeeze of the hand  oh my what a good fellow you are cried the outspoken american girl when your time comes to be married sir i guess the woman wont repent saying yes to you  mr meadowcroft preserved unbroken silence as we walked back to the farm on either side of his invalidchair his last reserves of resolution seemed to have given way under the overwhelming strain laid on them by the proceedings in court his daughter in stern indulgence to naomi mercifully permitted her opinion to glimmer on us only through the medium of quotation from scripture texts if the texts meant anything they meant that she had foreseen all that had happened and that the one sad aspect of the case to her mind was the death of john jago unprepared to meet his end  i obtained the order of admission to the prison the next morning  we found ambrose still confident of the favorable result for his brother and for himself of the inquiry before the magistrate he seemed to be almost as eager to tell as naomi was to hear the true story of what had happened at the limekiln the authorities of the prisonpresent of course at the interviewwarned him to remember that what he said might be taken down in writing and produced against him in court  take it down gentlemen and welcome ambrose replied i have nothing to fear i am only telling the truth  with that he turned to naomi and began his narrative as nearly as i can remember in these words  i may as well make a clean breast of it at starting my girl after mr lefrank left us that morning i asked silas how he came by my stick in telling me how silas also told me of the words that had passed between him and john jago under mr lefranks window i was angry and jealous and i own it freely naomi i thought the worst that could be thought about you and john  here naomi stopped him without ceremony  was that what made you speak to me as you spoke when we found you at the wood she asked  yes  and was that what made you leave me when you went away to narrabee without giving me a kiss at parting  it was  beg my pardon for it before you say a word more  i beg your pardon  say you are ashamed of yourself  i am ashamed of myself ambrose answered penitently  now you may go on said naomi now im satisfied  ambrose went on  we were on our way to the clearing at the other side of the wood while silas was talking to me and as ill luck would have it we took the path that led by the limekiln turning the corner we met john jago on his way to narrabee i was too angry i tell you to let him pass quietly i gave him a bit of my mind his blood was up too i suppose and he spoke out on his side as freely as i did i own i threatened him with the stick but ill swear to it i meant him no harm you knowafter dressing silass handthat john jago is ready with his knife he comes from out west where they are always ready with one weapon or another handy in their pockets its likely enough he didnt mean to harm me either but how could i be sure of that when he stepped up to me and showed his weapon i dropped the stick and closed with him with one hand i wrenched the knife away from him and with the other i caught him by the collar of his rotten old coat and gave him a shaking that made his bones rattle in his skin a big piece of the cloth came away in my hand i shied it into the quicklime close by us and i pitched the knife after the cloth and if silas hadnt stopped me i think its likely i might have shied john jago himself into the lime next as it was silas kept hold of me silas shouted out to him be off with you and dont come back again if you dont want to be burned in the kiln he stood looking at us for a minute fetching his breath and holding his torn coat round him then he spoke with a deadlyquiet voice and a deadlyquiet look many a true word mr silas he says is spoken in jest i shall not come back again he turned about and left us we stood staring at each other like a couple of fools you dont think he means it i says bosh says silas hes too sweet on naomi not to come back whats the matter now naomi  i had noticed it too she started and turned pale when ambrose repeated to her what silas had said to him  nothing is the matter naomi answered your brother has no right to take liberties with my name go on did silas say any more while he was about it  yes he looked into the kiln and he says what made you throw away the knife ambrosehow does a man know why he does anything i says when he does it in a passionits a ripping good knife says silas in your place i should have kept it i picked up the stick off the ground who says ive lost it yet i answered him and with that i got up on the side of the kiln and began sounding for the knife to bring it you know by means of the stick within easy reach of a shovel or some such thing give us your hand i says to silas let me stretch out a bit and ill have it in no time instead of finding the knife i came nigh to falling myself into the burning lime the vapor overpowered me i suppose all i know is i turned giddy and dropped the stick in the kiln i should have followed the stick to a dead certainty but for silas pulling me back by the hand let it be says silas if i hadnt had hold of you john jagos knife would have been the death of you after all he led me away by the arm and we went on together on the road to the wood we stopped where you found us and sat down on the felled tree we had a little more talk about john jago it ended in our agreeing to wait and see what happened and to keep our own counsel in the meantime you and mr lefrank came upon us naomi while we were still talking and you guessed right when you guessed that we had a secret from you you know the secret now  there he stopped i put a question to himthe first that i had asked yet  had you or your brother any fear at that time of the charge which has since been brought against you i said  no such thought entered our heads sir ambrose answered how could we foresee that the neighbors would search the kiln and say what they have said of us all we feared was that the old man might hear of the quarrel and be bitterer against us than ever i was the more anxious of the two to keep things secret because i had naomi to consider as well as the old man put yourself in my place and you will own sir that the prospect at home was not a pleasant one for me if john jago really kept away from the farm and if it came out that it was all my doing  this was certainly an explanation of his conduct but it was not satisfactory to my mind  as you believe then i went on john jago has carried out his threat of not returning to the farm according to you he is now alive and in hiding somewhere  certainly said ambrose  certainly repeated naomi  do you believe the report that he was seen traveling on the railway to new york  i believe it firmly sir and what is more i believe i was on his track i was only too anxious to find him and i say i could have found him if they would have let me stay in new york  i looked at naomi  i believe it too she said john jago is keeping away  do you suppose he is afraid of ambrose and silas  she hesitated  he may be afraid of them she replied with a strong emphasis on the word may  but you dont think it likely  she hesitated again i pressed her again  do you think there is any other motive for his absence  her eyes dropped to the floor she answered obstinately almost doggedly  i cant say  i addressed myself to ambrose  have you anything more to tell us i asked  no he said i have told you all i know about it  i rose to speak to the lawyer whose services i had retained he had helped us to get the order of admission and he had accompanied us to the prison seated apart he had kept silence throughout attentively watching the effect of ambrose meadowcrofts narrative on the officers of the prison and on me  is this the defense i inquired in a whisper  this is the defense mr lefrank what do you think between ourselves  between ourselves i think the magistrate will commit them for trial  on the charge of murder  yes on the charge of murder    chapter viii   the confession  my replies to the lawyer accurately expressed the conviction in my mind the narrative related by ambrose had all the appearance in my eyes of a fabricated story got up and clumsily got up to pervert the plain meaning of the circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution i reached this conclusion reluctantly and regretfully for naomis sake i said all i could say to shake the absolute confidence which she felt in the discharge of the prisoners at the next examination  the day of the adjourned inquiry arrived  naomi and i again attended the court together mr meadowcroft was unable on this occasion to leave the house his daughter was present walking to the court by herself and occupying a seat by herself  on his second appearance at the bar silas was more composed and more like his brother no new witnesses were called by the prosecution we began the battle over the medical evidence relating to the charred bones and to some extent we won the victory in other words we forced the doctors to acknowledge that they differed widely in their opinions three confessed that they were not certain two went still further and declared that the bones were the bones of an animal not of a man we made the most of this and then we entered upon the defense founded on ambrose meadowcrofts story  necessarily no witnesses could be called on our side whether this circumstance discouraged him or whether he privately shared my opinion of his clients statement i cannot say it is only certain that the lawyer spoke mechanically doing his best no doubt but doing it without genuine conviction or earnestness on his own part naomi cast an anxious glance at me as he sat down the girls hand as i took it turned cold in mine she saw plain signs of the failure of the defense in the look and manner of the counsel for the prosecution but she waited resolutely until the presiding magistrate announced his decision i had only too clearly foreseen what he would feel it to be his duty to do naomis head dropped on my shoulder as he said the terrible words which committed ambrose and silas meadowcroft to take their trial on the charge of murder  i led her out of the court into the air as i passed the bar i saw ambrose deadly pale looking after us as we left him the magistrates decision had evidently daunted him his brother silas had dropped in abject terror on the jailers chair the miserable wretch shook and shuddered dumbly like a cowed dog  miss meadowcroft returned with us to the farm preserving unbroken silence on the way back i could detect nothing in her bearing which suggested any compassionate feeling for the prisoners in her stern and secret nature on naomis withdrawal to her own room we were left together for a few minutes and then to my astonishment the outwardly merciless woman showed me that she too was one of eves daughters and could feel and suffer in her own hard way like the rest of us she suddenly stepped close up to me and laid her hand on my arm  you are a lawyer aint you she asked  yes  have you had any experience in your profession  ten years experience  do you think she stopped abruptly her hard face softened her eyes dropped to the ground never mind she said confusedly im upset by all this misery though i may not look like it dont notice me  she turned away i waited in the firm persuasion that the unspoken question in her mind would sooner or later force its way to utterance by her lips i was right she came back to me unwillingly like a woman acting under some influence which the utmost exertion of her will was powerless to resist  do you believe john jago is still a living man  she put the question vehemently desperately as if the words rushed out of her mouth in spite of her  i do not believe it i answered  remember what john jago has suffered at the hands of my brothers she persisted is it not in your experience that he should take a sudden resolution to leave the farm  i replied as plainly as before  it is not in my experience  she stood looking at me for a moment with a face of blank despair then bowed her gray head in silence and left me as she crossed the room to the door i saw her look upward and i heard her say to herself softly between her teeth vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord  it was the requiem of john jago pronounced by the woman who loved him  when i next saw her her mask was on once more miss meadowcroft was herself again miss meadowcroft could sit by impenetrably calm while the lawyers discussed the terrible position of her brothers with the scaffold in view as one of the possibilities of the case  left by myself i began to feel uneasy about naomi i went upstairs and knocking softly at her door made my inquiries from outside the clear young voice answered me sadly i am trying to bear it i wont distress you when we meet again i descended the stairs feeling my first suspicion of the true nature of my interest in the american girl why had her answer brought the tears into my eyes i went out walking alone to think undisturbedly why did the tones of her voice dwell on my ear all the way why did my hand still feel the last cold faint pressure of her fingers when i led her out of court  i took a sudden resolution to go back to england  when i returned to the farm it was evening the lamp was not yet lighted in the hall pausing to accustom my eyes to the obscurity indoors i heard the voice of the lawyer whom we had employed for the defense speaking to some one very earnestly  im not to blame said the voice she snatched the paper out of my hand before i was aware of her  do you want it back asked the voice of miss meadowcroft  no its only a copy if keeping it will help to quiet her let her keep it by all means good evening  saying these last words the lawyer approached me on his way out of the house i stopped him without ceremony i felt an ungovernable curiosity to know more  who snatched the paper out of your hand i asked bluntly  the lawyer started i had taken him by surprise the instinct of professional reticence made him pause before he answered me  in the brief interval of silence miss meadowcroft replied to my question from the other end of the hall  naomi colebrook snatched the paper out of his hand  what paper  a door opened softly behind me naomi herself appeared on the threshold naomi herself answered my question  i will tell you she whispered come in here  one candle only was burning in the room i looked at her by the dim light my resolution to return to england instantly became one of the lost ideas of my life  good god i exclaimed what has happened now  she handed me the paper which she had taken from the lawyers hand  the copy to which he had referred was a copy of the written confession of silas meadowcroft on his return to prison he accused his brother ambrose of the murder of john jago he declared on his oath that he had seen his brother ambrose commit the crime  in the popular phrase i could hardly believe my own eyes i read the last sentences of the confession for the second time  i heard their voices at the limekiln they were having words about cousin naomi i ran to the place to part them i was not in time i saw ambrose strike the deceased a terrible blow on the head with his ambroses heavy stick the deceased dropped without a cry i put my hand on his heart he was dead i was horribly frightened ambrose threatened to kill me next if i said a word to any living soul he took up the body and cast it into the quicklime and threw the stick in after it we went on together to the wood we sat down on a felled tree outside the wood ambrose made up the story that we were to tell if what he had done was found out he made me repeat it after him like a lesson we were still at it when cousin naomi and mr lefrank came up to us they know the rest this on my oath is a true confession i make it of my own freewill repenting me sincerely that i did not make it before  signed  silas meadowcroft   i laid down the paper and looked at naomi once more she spoke to me with a strange composure immovable determination was in her eye immovable determination was in her voice  silas has lied away his brothers life to save himself she said i see cowardly falsehood and cowardly cruelty in every line on that paper ambrose is innocent and the time has come to prove it  you forget i said that we have just failed to prove it  john jago is alive in hiding from us and from all who know him she went on help me friend lefrank to advertise for him in the newspapers  i drew back from her in speechless distress i own i believed that the new misery which had fallen on her had affected her brain  you dont believe it she said shut the door  i obeyed her she seated herself and pointed to a chair near her  sit down she proceeded i am going to do a wrong thing but there is no help for it i am going to break a sacred promise you remember that moonlight night when i met him on the garden walk  john jago  yes now listen i am going to tell you what passed between john jago and me    chapter ix   the advertisement  i waited in silence for the disclosure that was now to come naomi began by asking me a question  you remember when we went to see ambrose in the prison she said  perfectly  ambrose told us of something which his villain of a brother said of john jago and me do you remember what it was  i remembered perfectly silas had said john jago is too sweet on naomi not to come back  thats so naomi remarked when i had repeated the words i couldnt help starting when i heard what silas had said and i thought you noticed me  i did notice you  did you wonder what it meant  yes  ill tell you it meant this what silas meadowcroft said to his brother of john jago was what i myself was thinking of john jago at that very moment it startled me to find my own thought in a mans mind spoken for me by a man i am the person sir who has driven john jago away from morwick farm and i am the person who can and will bring him back again  there was something in her manner more than in her words which let the light in suddenly on my mind  you have told me the secret i said john jago is in love with you  mad about me she rejoined dropping her voice to a whisper stark staring madthats the only word for him after we had taken a few turns on the gravelwalk he suddenly broke out like a man beside himself he fell down on his knees he kissed my gown he kissed my feet he sobbed and cried for love of me im not badly off for courage sir considering im a woman no man that i can call to mind ever really scared me before but i own john jago frightened me oh my he did frighten me my heart was in my mouth and my knees shook under me i begged and prayed of him to get up and go away no there he knelt and held by the skirt of my gown the words poured out from him likewell like nothing i can think of but water from a pump his happiness and his life and his hopes in earth and heaven and lord only knows what besides all depended he said on a word from me i plucked up spirit enough at that to remind him that i was promised to ambrose i think you ought to be ashamed of yourself i said to own that youre wicked enough to love me when you know i am promised to another man when i spoke to him he took a new turn he began abusing ambrose that straightened me up i snatched my gown out of his hand and i gave him my whole mind i hate you i said even if i wasnt promised to ambrose i wouldnt marry youno not if there wasnt another man left in the world to ask me i hate you mr jago i hate you he saw i was in earnest at last he got up from my feet and he settled down quiet again all on a sudden you have said enough that was how he answered me you have broken my life i have no hopes and no prospects now i had a pride in the farm miss and a pride in my work i bore with your brutish cousins hatred of me i was faithful to mr meadowcrofts interests all for your sake naomi colebrookall for your sake i have done with it now i have done with my life at the farm you will never be troubled with me again i am going away as the dumb creatures go when they are sick to hide myself in a corner and die do me one last favor dont make me the laughingstock of the whole neighborhood i cant bear that it maddens me only to think of it give me your promise never to tell any living soul what i have said to you tonightyour sacred promise to the man whose life you have broken i did as he bade me i gave him my sacred promise with the tears in my eyes yes that is so after telling him i hated him and i did hate him i cried over his misery i did mercy what fools women are what is the horrid perversity sir which makes us always ready to pity the men he held out his hand to me and he said goodby forever and i pitied him i said ill shake hands with you if you will give me your promise in exchange for mine i beg of you not to leave the farm what will my uncle do if you go away stay here and be friends with me and forget and forgive mr john he gave me his promise he can refuse me nothing and he gave it again when i saw him again the next morning yes ill do him justice though i do hate him i believe he honestly meant to keep his word as long as my eye was on him it was only when he was left to himself that the devil tempted him to break his promise and leave the farm i was brought up to believe in the devil mr lefrank and i find it explains many things it explains john jago only let me find out where he has gone and ill engage he shall come back and clear ambrose of the suspicion which his vile brother has cast on him here is the pen all ready for you advertise for him friend lefrank and do it right away for my sake  i let her run on without attempting to dispute her conclusions until she could say no more when she put the pen into my hand i began the composition of the advertisement as obediently as if i too believed that john jago was a living man  in the case of any one else i should have openly acknowledged that my own convictions remained unshaken if no quarrel had taken place at the limekiln i should have been quite ready as i viewed the case to believe that john jagos disappearance was referable to the terrible disappointment which naomi had inflicted on him the same morbid dread of ridicule which had led him to assert that he cared nothing for naomi when he and silas had quarreled under my bedroom window might also have impelled him to withdraw himself secretly and suddenly from the scene of his discomfiture but to ask me to believe after what had happened at the limekiln that he was still living was to ask me to take ambrose meadowcrofts statement for granted as a true statement of facts  i had refused to do this from the first and i still persisted in taking that course if i had been called upon to decide the balance of probability between the narrative related by ambrose in his defense and the narrative related by silas in his confession i must have owned no matter how unwillingly that the confession was to my mind the least incredible story of the two  could i say this to naomi i would have written fifty advertisements inquiring for john jago rather than say it and you would have done the same if you had been as fond of her as i was i drew out the advertisement for insertion in the morwick mercury in these terms   murderprinters of newspapers throughout the united states are desired to publish that ambrose meadowcroft and silas meadowcroft of morwick farm morwick county are committed for trial on the charge of murdering john jago now missing from the farm and from the neighborhood any person who can give information of the existence of said jago may save the lives of two wronglyaccused men by making immediate communication jago is about five feet four inches high he is spare and wiry his complexion is extremely pale his eyes are dark and very bright and restless the lower part of his face is concealed by a thick black beard and mustache the whole appearance of the man is wild and flighty   i added the date and the address that evening a servant was sent on horseback to narrabee to procure the insertion of the advertisement in the next issue of the newspaper  when we parted that night naomi looked almost like her brighter and happier self now that the advertisement was on its way to the printingoffice she was more than sanguine she was certain of the result  you dont know how you have comforted me she said in her frank warmhearted way when we parted for the night all the newspapers will copy it and we shall hear of john jago before the week is out she turned to go and came back again to me i will never forgive silas for writing that confession she whispered in my ear if he ever lives under the same roof with ambrose again iwell i believe i wouldnt marry ambrose if he did there  she left me through the wakeful hours of the night my mind dwelt on her last words that she should contemplate under any circumstances even the bare possibility of not marrying ambrose was i am ashamed to say a direct encouragement to certain hopes which i had already begun to form in secret the next days mail brought me a letter on business my clerk wrote to inquire if there was any chance of my returning to england in time to appear in court at the opening of next law term i answered without hesitation it is still impossible for me to fix the date of my return naomi was in the room while i was writing how would she have answered i wonder if i had told her the truth and said you are responsible for this letter    chapter x   the sheriff and the governor  the question of time was now a serious question at morwick farm in six weeks the court for the trial of criminal cases was to be opened at narrabee  during this interval no new event of any importance occurred  many idle letters reached us relating to the advertisement for john jago but no positive information was received not the slightest trace of the lost man turned up not the shadow of a doubt was cast on the assertion of the prosecution that his body had been destroyed in the kiln silas meadowcroft held firmly to the horrible confession that he had made his brother ambrose with equal resolution asserted his innocence and reiterated the statement which he had already advanced at regular periods i accompanied naomi to visit him in the prison as the day appointed for the opening of the court approached he seemed to falter a little in his resolution his manner became restless and he grew irritably suspicious about the merest trifles this change did not necessarily imply the consciousness of guilt it might merely have indicated natural nervous agitation as the time for the trial drew near naomi noticed the alteration in her lover it greatly increased her anxiety though it never shook her confidence in ambrose except at mealtimes i was left during the period of which i am now writing almost constantly alone with the charming american girl miss meadowcroft searched the newspapers for tidings of the living john jago in the privacy of her own room mr meadowcroft would see nobody but his daughter and his doctor and occasionally one or two old friends i have since had reason to believe that naomi in these days of our intimate association discovered the true nature of the feeling with which she had inspired me but she kept her secret her manner toward me steadily remained the manner of a sister she never overstepped by a hairbreadth the safe limits of the character that she had assumed  the sittings of the court began after hearing the evidence and examining the confession of silas meadowcroft the grand jury found a true bill against both the prisoners the day appointed for their trial was the first day in the new week  i had carefully prepared naomis mind for the decision of the grand jury she bore the new blow bravely  if you are not tired of it she said come with me to the prison tomorrow ambrose will need a little comfort by that time she paused and looked at the days letters lying on the table still not a word about john jago she said and all the papers have copied the advertisement i felt so sure we should hear of him long before this  do you still feel sure that he is living i ventured to ask  i am as certain of it as ever she replied firmly he is somewhere in hiding perhaps he is in disguise suppose we know no more of him than we know now when the trial begins suppose the jury she stopped shuddering deathshameful death on the scaffoldmight be the terrible result of the consultation of the jury we have waited for news to come to us long enough naomi resumed we must find the tracks of john jago for ourselves there is a week yet before the trial begins who will help me to make inquiries will you be the man friend lefrank  it is needless to add though i knew nothing would come of it that i consented to be the man  we arranged to apply that day for the order of admission to the prison and having seen ambrose to devote ourselves immediately to the contemplated search how that search was to be conducted was more than i could tell and more than naomi could tell we were to begin by applying to the police to help us to find john jago and we were then to be guided by circumstances was there ever a more hopeless programme than this  circumstances declared themselves against us at starting i applied as usual for the order of admission to the prison and the order was for the first time refused no reason being assigned by the persons in authority for taking this course inquire as i might the only answer given was not today  at naomis suggestion we went to the prison to seek the explanation which was refused to us at the office the jailer on duty at the outer gate was one of naomis many admirers he solved the mystery cautiously in a whisper the sheriff and the governor of the prison were then speaking privately with ambrose meadowcroft in his cell they had expressly directed that no persons should be admitted to see the prisoner that day but themselves  what did it mean we returned wondering to the farm there naomi speaking by chance to one of the female servants made certain discoveries  early that morning the sheriff had been brought to morwick by an old friend of the meadowcrofts a long interview had been held between mr meadowcroft and his daughter and the official personage introduced by the friend leaving the farm the sheriff had gone straight to the prison and had proceeded with the governor to visit ambrose in his cell was some potent influence being brought privately to bear on ambrose appearances certainly suggested that inquiry supposing the influence to have been really exerted the next question followed what was the object in view we could only wait and see  our patience was not severely tried the event of the next day enlightened us in a very unexpected manner before noon the neighbors brought startling news from the prison to the farm  ambrose meadowcroft had confessed himself to be the murderer of john jago he had signed the confession in the presence of the sheriff and the governor on that very day  i saw the document it is needless to reproduce it here in substance ambrose confessed what silas had confessed claiming however to have only struck jago under intolerable provocation so as to reduce the nature of his offense against the law from murder to manslaughter was the confession really the true statement of what had taken place or had the sheriff and the governor acting in the interests of the family name persuaded ambrose to try this desperate means of escaping the ignominy of death on the scaffold the sheriff and the governor preserved impenetrable silence until the pressure put on them judicially at the trial obliged them to speak  who was to tell naomi of this last and saddest of all the calamities which had fallen on her knowing how i loved her in secret i felt an invincible reluctance to be the person who revealed ambrose meadowcrofts degradation to his betrothed wife had any other member of the family told her what had happened the lawyer was able to answer me miss meadowcroft had told her  i was shocked when i heard it miss meadowcroft was the last person in the house to spare the poor girl miss meadowcroft would make the hard tidings doubly terrible to bear in the telling i tried to find naomi without success she had been always accessible at other times was she hiding herself from me now the idea occurred to me as i was descending the stairs after vainly knocking at the door of her room i was determined to see her i waited a few minutes and then ascended the stairs again suddenly on the landing i met her just leaving her room  she tried to run back i caught her by the arm and detained her with her free hand she held her handkerchief over her face so as to hide it from me  you once told me i had comforted you i said to her gently wont you let me comfort you now  she still struggled to get away and still kept her head turned from me  dont you see that i am ashamed to look you in the face she said in low broken tones let me go  i still persisted in trying to soothe her i drew her to the windowseat i said i would wait until she was able to speak to me  she dropped on the seat and wrung her hands on her lap her downcast eyes still obstinately avoided meeting mine  oh she said to herself what madness possessed me is it possible that i ever disgraced myself by loving ambrose meadowcroft she shuddered as the idea found its way to expression on her lips the tears rolled slowly over her cheeks dont despise me mr lefrank she said faintly  i tried honestly tried to put the confession before her in its least unfavorable light  his resolution has given way i said he has done this despairing of proving his innocence in terror of the scaffold  she rose with an angry stamp of her foot she turned her face on me with the deepred flush of shame in it and the big tears glistening in her eyes  no more of him she said sternly if he is not a murderer what else is he a liar and a coward in which of his characters does he disgrace me most i have done with him forever i will never speak to him again she pushed me furiously away from her advanced a few steps toward her own door stopped and came back to me the generous nature of the girl spoke in her next words i am not ungrateful to you friend lefrank a woman in my place is only a woman and when she is shamed as i am she feels it very bitterly give me your hand god bless you  she put my hand to her lips before i was aware of her and kissed it and ran back into her room  i sat down on the place which she had occupied she had looked at me for one moment when she kissed my hand i forgot ambrose and his confession i forgot the coming trial i forgot my professional duties and my english friends there i sat in a fools elysium of my own making with absolutely nothing in my mind but the picture of naomis face at the moment when she had last looked at me  i have already mentioned that i was in love with her i merely add this to satisfy you that i tell the truth    chapter xi   the pebble and the window  miss meadowcroft and i were the only representatives of the family at the farm who attended the trial we went separately to narrabee excepting the ordinary greetings at morning and night miss meadowcroft had not said one word to me since the time when i had told her that i did not believe john jago to be a living man  i have purposely abstained from encumbering my narrative with legal details i now propose to state the nature of the defense in the briefest outline only  we insisted on making both the prisoners plead not guilty this done we took an objection to the legality of the proceedings at starting we appealed to the old english law that there should be no conviction for murder until the body of the murdered person was found or proof of its destruction obtained beyond a doubt we denied that sufficient proof had been obtained in the case now before the court  the judges consulted and decided that the trial should go on  we took our next objection when the confessions were produced in evidence we declared that they had been extorted by terror or by undue influence and we pointed out certain minor particulars in which the two confessions failed to corroborate each other for the rest our defense on this occasion was as to essentials what our defense had been at the inquiry before the magistrate once more the judges consulted and once more they overruled our objection the confessions were admitted in evidence on their side the prosecution produced one new witness in support of their case it is needless to waste time in recapitulating his evidence he contradicted himself gravely on crossexamination we showed plainly and after investigation proved that he was not to be believed on his oath  the chiefjustice summed up  he charged in relation to the confessions that no weight should be attached to a confession incited by hope or fear and he left it to the jury to determine whether the confessions in this case had been so influenced in the course of the trial it had been shown for the defense that the sheriff and the governor of the prison had told ambrose with his fathers knowledge and sanction that the case was clearly against him that the only chance of sparing his family the disgrace of his death by public execution lay in making a confession and that they would do their best if he did confess to have his sentence commuted to imprisonment for life as for silas he was proved to have been beside himself with terror when he made his abominable charge against his brother we had vainly trusted to the evidence on these two points to induce the court to reject the confessions and we were destined to be once more disappointed in anticipating that the same evidence would influence the verdict of the jury on the side of mercy after an absence of an hour they returned into court with a verdict of guilty against both the prisoners  being asked in due form if they had anything to say in mitigation of their sentence ambrose and silas solemnly declared their innocence and publicly acknowledged that their respective confessions had been wrung from them by the hope of escaping the hangmans hands this statement was not noticed by the bench the prisoners were both sentenced to death  on my return to the farm i did not see naomi miss meadowcroft informed her of the result of the trial half an hour later one of the womenservants handed to me an envelope bearing my name on it in naomis handwriting  the envelope inclosed a letter and with it a slip of paper on which naomi had hurriedly written these words for gods sake read the letter i send to you and do something about it immediately  i looked at the letter it assumed to be written by a gentleman in new york only the day before he had by the merest accident seen the advertisement for john jago cut out of a newspaper and pasted into a book of curiosities kept by a friend upon this he wrote to morwick farm to say that he had seen a man exactly answering to the description of john jago but bearing another name working as a clerk in a merchants office in jersey city having time to spare before the mail went out he had returned to the office to take another look at the man before he posted his letter to his surprise he was informed that the clerk had not appeared at his desk that day his employer had sent to his lodgings and had been informed that he had suddenly packed up his handbag after reading the newspaper at breakfast had paid his rent honestly and had gone away nobody knew where  it was late in the evening when i read these lines i had time for reflection before it would be necessary for me to act  assuming the letter to be genuine and adopting naomis explanation of the motive which had led john jago to absent himself secretly from the farm i reached the conclusion that the search for him might be usefully limited to narrabee and to the surrounding neighborhood  the newspaper at his breakfast had no doubt given him his first information of the finding of the grand jury and of the trial to follow it was in my experience of human nature that he should venture back to narrabee under these circumstances and under the influence of his infatuation for naomi more than this it was again in my experience i am sorry to say that he should attempt to make the critical position of ambrose a means of extorting naomis consent to listen favorably to his suit cruel indifference to the injury and the suffering which his sudden absence might inflict on others was plainly implied in his secret withdrawal from the farm the same cruel indifference pushed to a further extreme might well lead him to press his proposals privately on naomi and to fix her acceptance of them as the price to be paid for saving her cousins life  to these conclusions i arrived after much thinking i had determined on naomis account to clear the matter up but it is only candid to add that my doubts of john jagos existence remained unshaken by the letter i believed it to be nothing more nor less than a heartless and stupid hoax   the striking of the hallclock roused me from my meditations i counted the strokesmidnight  i rose to go up to my room everybody else in the farm had retired to bed as usual more than an hour since the stillness in the house was breathless i walked softly by instinct as i crossed the room to look out at the night a lovely moonlight met my view it was like the moonlight on the fatal evening when naomi had met john jago on the garden walk  my bedroom candle was on the sidetable i had just lighted it i was just leaving the room when the door suddenly opened and naomi herself stood before me  recovering the first shook of her sudden appearance i saw instantly in her eager eyes in her deadlypale cheeks that something serious had happened a large cloak was thrown over her a white handkerchief was tied over her head her hair was in disorder she had evidently just risen in fear and in haste from her bed  what is it i asked advancing to meet her  she clung trembling with agitation to my arm  john jago she whispered  you will think my obstinacy invincible i could hardly believe it even then  where i asked  in the backyard she replied under my bedroom window  the emergency was far too serious to allow of any consideration for the small proprieties of everyday life  let me see him i said  i am here to fetch you she answered in her frank and fearless way come upstairs with me  her room was on the first floor of the house and was the only bedroom which looked out on the backyard on our way up the stairs she told me what had happened  i was in bed she said but not asleep when i heard a pebble strike against the windowpane i waited wondering what it meant another pebble was thrown against the glass so far i was surprised but not frightened i got up and ran to the window to look out there was john jago looking up at me in the moonlight  did he see you  yes he said come down and speak to me i have something serious to say to you  did you answer him  as soon as i could catch my breath i said wait a little and ran downstairs to you what shall i do  let me see him and i will tell you  we entered her room keeping cautiously behind the windowcurtain i looked out  there he was his beard and mustache were shaved off his hair was close cut but there was no disguising his wild brown eyes or the peculiar movement of his spare wiry figure as he walked slowly to and fro in the moonlight waiting for naomi for the moment my own agitation almost overpowered me i had so firmly disbelieved that john jago was a living man  what shall i do naomi repeated  is the door of the dairy open i asked  no but the door of the toolhouse round the corner is not locked  very good show yourself at the window and say to him i am coming directly  the brave girl obeyed me without a moments hesitation  there had been no doubt about his eyes and his gait there was no doubt now about his voice as he answered softly from belowall right  keep him talking to you where he is now i said to naomi until i have time to get round by the other way to the toolhouse then pretend to be fearful of discovery at the dairy and bring him round the corner so that i can hear him behind the door  we left the house together and separated silently naomi followed my instructions with a womans quick intelligence where stratagems are concerned i had hardly been a minute in the toolhouse before i heard him speaking to naomi on the other side of the door  the first words which i caught distinctly related to his motive for secretly leaving the farm mortified pridedoubly mortified by naomis contemptuous refusal and by the personal indignity offered to him by ambrosewas at the bottom of his conduct in absenting himself from morwick he owned that he had seen the advertisement and that it had actually encouraged him to keep in hiding  after being laughed at and insulted and denied i was glad said the miserable wretch to see that some of you had serious reason to wish me back again it rests with you miss naomi to keep me here and to persuade me to save ambrose by showing myself and owning to my name  what do you mean i heard naomi ask sternly  he lowered his voice but i could still hear him  promise you will marry me he said and i will go before the magistrate tomorrow and show him that i am a living man  suppose i refuse  in that case you will lose me again and none of you will find me till ambrose is hanged  are you villain enough john jago to mean what you say asked the girl raising her voice  if you attempt to give the alarm he answered as true as gods above us you will feel my hand on your throat its my turn now miss and i am not to be trifled with will you have me for your husbandyes or no  no she answered loudly and firmly  i burst open the door and seized him as he lifted his hand on her he had not suffered from the nervous derangement which had weakened me and he was the stronger man of the two naomi saved my life she struck up his pistol as he pulled it out of his pocket with his free hand and presented it at my head the bullet was fired into the air i tripped up his heels at the same moment the report of the pistol had alarmed the house we two together kept him on the ground until help arrived    chapter xii   the end of it  john jago was brought before the magistrate and john jago was identified the next day  the lives of ambrose and silas were of course no longer in peril so far as human justice was concerned but there were legal delays to be encountered and legal formalities to be observed before the brothers could be released from prison in the characters of innocent men  during the interval which thus elapsed certain events happened which may be briefly mentioned here before i close my narrative  mr meadowcroft the elder broken by the suffering which he had gone through died suddenly of a rheumatic affection of the heart a codicil attached to his will abundantly justified what naomi had told me of miss meadowcrofts influence over her father and of the end she had in view in exercising it a life income only was left to mr meadowcrofts sons the freehold of the farm was bequeathed to his daughter with the testators recommendation added that she should marry his best and dearest friend mr john jago  armed with the power of the will the heiress of morwick sent an insolent message to naomi requesting her no longer to consider herself one of the inmates at the farm miss meadowcroft it should be here added positively refused to believe that john jago had ever asked naomi to be his wife or had ever threatened her as i had heard him threaten her if she refused she accused me as she accused naomi of trying meanly to injure john jago in her estimation out of hatred toward that muchinjured man and she sent to me as she had sent to naomi a formal notice to leave the house  we two banished ones met the same day in the hall with our travelingbags in our hands  we are turned out together friend lefrank said naomi with her quaintlycomical smile you will go back to england i guess and i must make my own living in my own country women can get employment in the states if they have a friend to speak for them where shall i find somebody who can give me a place  i saw my way to saying the right word at the right moment  i have got a place to offer you i replied  she suspected nothing so far  thats lucky sir was all she said is it in a
