novels a scottish romanticist of 1830 the confessions of saint augustine smollett nathaniel hawthorne the paradise of poets paris and helen enchanted cigarettes stories and storytelling the supernatural in fiction an old scottish psychical researcher the boy     preface   of the essays in this volume adventures among books and rabs friend appeared in scribners magazine and recollections of robert louis stevenson to the best of the authors memory in the north american review  the essay on smollett was in the anglosaxon which has ceased to appear and the shorter papers such as the confessions of saint augustine in a periodical styled wit and wisdom for the poems of william morris the author has to thank the editor of longmans magazine for the boy and mrs radcliffes novels the proprietors of the cornhill magazine for enchanted cigarettes and possibly for the supernatural in fiction the proprietors of the idler  the portrait after sir william richmond ra was done about the time when most of the essays were writtenand that was not yesterday     chapter i adventures among books   i   in an age of reminiscences is there room for the confessions of a veteran who remembers a great deal about books and very little about people  i have often wondered that a biographia literaria has so seldom been attempteda biography or autobiography of a man in his relations with other minds  coleridge to be sure gave this name to a work of his but he wandered from his apparent purpose into a world of alien disquisitions  the following pages are frankly bookish and to the bookish only do they appeal  the habit of reading has been praised as a virtue and has been denounced as a vice  in no case if we except the perpetual study of newspapers which cannot fairly be called reading is the vice or the virtue common  it is more innocent than opiumeating though like opiumeating it unlocks to us artificial paradises  i try to say what i have found in books what distractions from the world what teaching not much and what consolations  in beginning an autobiographia literaria an account of how and in what order books have appealed to a mind which books have ever above all things delighted the author must pray to be pardoned for the sin of egotism  there is no other mind naturally of which the author knows so much as of his own  on na que soi as the poor girl says in one of m paul bourgets novels  in literature as in love one can only speak for himself  this author did not like fulke greville retire into the convent of literature from the strife of the world rather he was born to be from the first a dweller in the cloister of a library  among the poems which i remember best out of early boyhood is lucy ashtons song in the bride of lammermoor     look not thou on beautys charming    sit thou still when kings are arming    taste not when the winecup glistens    speak not when the people listens    stop thine ear against the singer    from the red gold keep thy finger    vacant heart and hand and eye    easy live and quiet die  the rhymes unlearned clung to my memory they would sing themselves to me on the way to school or cricketfield and about the age of ten probably without quite understanding them i had chosen them for a kind of motto in life a tune to murmur along the fallentis semita vitae this seems a queer idea for a small boy but it must be confessed  it takes all sorts to make a world some are soldiers from the cradle some merchants some orators nothing but a love of books was the gift given to me by the fairies  it was probably derived from forebears on both sides of my family one a great reader the other a considerable collector of books which remained with us and were all tried persevered with or abandoned in turn by a student who has not blanched before the epigoniad  about the age of four i learned to read by a simple process  i had heard the elegy of cock robin till i knew it by rote and i picked out the letters and words which compose that classic till i could read it for myself  earlier than that robinson crusoe had been read aloud to me in an abbreviated form no doubt  i remember the pictures of robinson finding the footstep in the sand and a dance of cannibals and the parrot  but somehow i have never read robinson since it is a pleasure to come  the first books which vividly impressed me were naturally fairy tales and chapbooks about robert bruce william wallace and rob roy  at that time these little tracts could be bought for a penny apiece  i can still see bruce in full armour and wallace in a kilt discoursing across a burn and rob roy slipping from the soldiers horse into the stream  they did not then awaken a precocious patriotism a boy of five is more at home in fairyland than in his own country  the sudden appearance of the white cat as a queen after her head was cut off the fiendish malice of the yellow dwarf the strange cake of crocodile eggs and millet seed which the mother of the princess frutilla made for the fairy of the desertthese things all fresh and astonishing but certainly to be credited are my first memories of romance  one story of a white serpent with a woodcut of that mysterious reptile i neglected to secure probably for want of a penny and i have regretted it ever since one never sees those chap books now  the white serpent in spite of all research remains introuvable  it was a lost chance and fortune does not forgive  nobody ever interfered with these or indeed with any other studies of ours at that time as long as they were not prosecuted on sundays  the fightingest parts of the bible and the apocrypha and stories like that of the witch of endor were sabbatical literature read in a huge old illustrated bible  how i advanced from the fairy tales to shakespeare what stages there were on the wayfor there must have been stagesis a thing that memory cannot recover  a nursery legend tells that i was wont to arrange six open books on six chairs and go from one to the others perusing them by turns  no doubt this was what people call desultory reading but i did not hear the criticism till later and then too often for my comfort  memory holds a picture more vivid than most of a small boy reading the midsummer nights dream by firelight in a room where candles were lit and some one touched the piano and a young man and a girl were playing chess  the shakespeare was a volume of kenny meadows edition there are fairies in it and the fairies seemed to come out of shakespeares dream into the music and the firelight  at that moment i think that i was happy it seemed an enchanted glimpse of eternity in paradise nothing resembling it remains with me out of all the years  we went from the border to the south of england when the number of my years was six and in england we found another paradise a circulating library with brown greasy illprinted odd volumes of shakespeare and of the arabian nights  how their stained pages come before the eyes againthe pleasure and the puzzle of them  what did the lady in the genis glass box want with the merchants what meant all these conversations between the fat knight and ford in the merry wives  it was delightful but in parts it was difficult  fragments of the tempest and of other plays remain stranded in my memory from these readings ferdinand and miranda at chess cleopatra cuffing the messenger the asp in the basket of figs the friar and the apothecary troilus on the ilian walls a vision of cassandra in white muslin with her hair down  people forbid children to read this or that  i am sure they need not and that even in our infancy the magician shakespeare brings us nothing worse than a world of beautiful visions half realised  in the egyptian wizards little pool of ink only the pure can see the visions and in shakespeares magic mirror children see only what is pure  among other books of that time i only recall a kind of sunday novel naomi or the last days of jerusalem who indeed could forget the batteringrams and the man who cried on the battlements woe woe to myself and to jerusalem  i seem to hear him again when boys break the hum of london with yells of the latest disaster  we left england in a year went back to scotland and awoke as it were to know the glories of our birth  we lived in scotts country within four miles of abbotsford and so far we had heard nothing of it  i remember going with one of the maids into the cottage of a kinsman of hers a carpenter a delightful place where there was sawdust where our first fishingrods were fashioned  rummaging among the books of course i found some cheap periodical with verses in it  the lines began     the baron of smaylhome rose with day       he spurred his courser on    without stop or stay down the rocky way       that leads to brotherstone  a rustic teatable was spread for us with scones and honey not to be neglected  but they were neglected till we had learned how     the sable score of fingers four       remains on that board impressed    and for evermore that lady wore       a covering on her wrist  we did not know nor ask the poets name  children probably say very little about what is in their minds but that unhappy knight sir richard of coldinghame and the priest with his chamber in the east and the moody baron and the lady have dwelt in our mind ever since and hardly need to be revived by looking at the eve of st john  soon after that we were told about sir walter how great he was how good how like napoleon his evil destiny found him at last and he wore his heart away for honours sake  and we were given the lay and the lady of the lake  it was my father who first read tam o shanter to me for which i confess i did not care at that time preferring to take witches and bogies with great seriousness  it seemed as if burns were trifling with a noble subject  but it was in a summer sunset beside a window looking out on ettrick and the hill of the three brethrens cairn that i first read with the dearest of all friends how     the stag at eve had drunk his fill    where danced the moon on monans rill    and deep his midnight lair had made    in lone glenartneys hazel shade  then opened the gates of romance and with fitzjames we drove the chase till     few were the stragglers following far    that reached the lake of vennachar    and when the brig of turk was won    the foremost horseman rode alone  from that time for months there was usually a little volume of scott in ones pocket in company with the miscellaneous collection of a boys treasures  scott certainly took his fairy folk seriously and the mauth dog was rather a disagreeable companion to a small boy in wakeful hours 1  after this kind of introduction to sir walter after learning ones first lessons in history from the tales of a grandfather nobody one hopes can criticise him in cold blood or after the manner of mr leslie stephen who is not sentimental  scott is not an author like another but our earliest known friend in letters for of course we did not ask who shakespeare was nor inquire about the private history of madame daulnoy  scott peopled for us the rivers and burnsides with his reivers the fairy queen came out of eildon hill and haunted carterhaugh at newark tower we saw the embattled portal arch     whose ponderous grate and massy bar    had oft rolled back the tide of war  just as at foulshiels on yarrow we beheld the very roofless cottage whence mungo park went forth to trace the waters of the niger and at oakwood the tower of the wizard michael scott  probably the first novel i ever read was read at elgin and the story was jane eyre  this tale was a creepy one for a boy of nine and rochester was a mystery st john a bore  but the lonely little girl in her despair when something came into the room and her days of starvation at school and the terrible first mrs rochester were not to be forgotten they abide in ones recollection with a red indians ghost who carried a rusty ruined gun and whose acquaintance was made at the same time  i fancy i was rather an industrious little boy and that i had minded my lessons and satisfied my teachersi know i was reading pinnocks history of rome for pleasuretill the wicked day of destiny came and i felt a call and underwent a process which may be described as the opposite of conversion  the call came from dickens  pickwick was brought into the house  from that hour it was all over for five or six years with anything like industry and lessonbooks  i read pickwick in convulsions of mirth  i dropped pinnocks rome for good i neglected everything printed in latin in fact everything that one was understood to prepare for ones classes in the school whither i was now sent in edinburgh  for there living a rather lonely small boy in the house of an aged relation i found the waverley novels  the rest is transport  a conscientious tutor dragged me through the latin grammar and a constitutional dislike to being beaten on the hands with a leather strap urged me to acquire a certain amount of elementary erudition  but for a year i was a young hermit living with scott in the waverleys and the border minstrelsy with pope and prior and a translation of ariosto with lever and dickens david copperfield and charles omalley longfellow and mayne reid dumas and in brief with every kind of light literature that i could lay my hands upon  carlyle did not escape me i vividly remember the helpless rage with which i read of the flight to varennes  in his work on french novelists mr saintsbury speaks of a disagreeable little boy in a french romance who found scott assommant stunningly stupid  this was a very odious little boy it seems i have not read his adventures and he came as he deserved to a bad end  other and better boys i learn find scott slow extraordinary boys  perhaps ivanhoe was first favourite of yore you cannot beat front de boeuf the assault on his castle the tournament  no other tournament need apply  sir arthur conan doyle greatly daring has attempted to enter the lists but he is a mere ralph the hospitaller next i think in order of delight came quentin durward especially the hero of the scar whose name thackeray could not remember quentins uncle  then the black dwarf and dugald our dear rittmeister  i could not read rob roy then nor later nay not till i was forty  now di vernon is the lady for me the queen of fiction the peerless the brave the tender and true  the wisdom of the authorities decided that i was to read no more novels but as an observer remarked i dont see what is the use of preventing the boy from reading novels for hes just reading don juan instead this was so manifestly no improvement that the ban on novels was tacitly withdrawn or was permitted to become a dead letter  they were far more enjoyable than byron  the worst that came of this was the suggestion of a young friend whose life had been adventurousindeed he had served in the crimea with the bashi bazouksthat i should master the writings of edgar poe  i do not think that the black cat and the fall of the house of usher and the murders in the rue morgue are very good reading for a boy who is not peculiarly intrepid  many a bad hour they gave me haunting me especially with a fear of being prematurely buried and of waking up before breakfast to find myself in a coffin  of all the books i devoured in that year poe is the only author whom i wish i had reserved for later consideration and whom i cannot conscientiously recommend to children  i had already enjoyed a sip of thackeray reading at a venture in vanity fair about the battle of waterloo  it was not like levers accounts of battles but it was enchanting  however vanity fair was under a taboo  it is not easy to say why but mr thackeray himself informed a small boy whom he found reading vanity fair under the table that he had better read something else  what harm can the story do to a child  he reads about waterloo about fat jos about little george and the pony about little rawdon and the rathunt and is happy and unharmed  leaving my hermitage and going into the very different and very disagreeable world of a masters house i was lucky enough to find a charming library there  most of thackeray was on the shelves and thackeray became the chief enchanter  as henry kingsley says a boy reads him and thinks he knows all about life  i do not think that the mundane parts about lady kew and her wiles about ethel and the marquis of farintosh appealed to one or enlightened one  ethel was a mystery and not an interesting mystery though one used to copy doyles pictures of her with the straight nose the impossible eyes the impossible waist  it was not ethel who captivated us it was clives youth and art it was j j the painter it was jolly f b and his address to the maid about the lobster  a finer fish mary my dear i have never seen  does not this solve the vexed question whether lobsters are fish in the french sense  then the rose and the ring came out  it was worth while to be twelve years old when the christmas books were written by dickens and thackeray  i got hold of the rose and the ring i know and of the christmas carol when they were damp from the press  king valoroso and bulbo and angelica were even more delightful than scrooge and tiny tim and trotty veck  one remembers the fairy monarch more vividly and the wondrous array of eggcups from which he sipped brandyor was it right nantesstill going on sipping i am sorry to say even after valoroso was himself again  but of all thackerays books i suppose pendennis was the favourite the delightful marryat had entertained us with peter simple and obrien how good their flight through france is with mesty and mr midshipman easy with jacob faithful mr thackerays favourite and with snarleyyow but marryat never made us wish to run away to sea  that did not seem to be ones vocation  but the story of pen made one wish to run away to literature to the temple to streets where brown the famous reviewer might be seen walking with his wife and umbrella  the writing of poems up to pictures the beer with warrington in the mornings the suppers in the backkitchen these were the alluring things not society and lady rockminster and lord steyne  well one has run away to literature since but where is the matutinal beer  where is the back kitchen  where are warrington and foker and f b  i have never met them in this living world though brown the celebrated reviewer is familiar to me and also mr sydney scraper of the oxford and cambridge club  perhaps backkitchens exist perhaps there are cakes and ale in the life literary and f b may take his walks by the round pond  but one never encounters these rarities and bungay and bacon are no longer the innocent and ignorant rivals whom thackeray drew  they do not give those wonderful parties miss bunnion has become quite conventional percy popjoy has abandoned letters mr wenham does not toady mr wagg does not joke any more  the literary life is very like any other in london or is it that we do not see it aright not having the eyes of genius  well a life on the ocean wave too may not be so desirable as it seems in marryats novels so many a lad whom he tempted into the navy has discovered  the best part of the existence of a man of letters is his looking forward to it through the spectacles of titmarsh  one can never say how much one owes to a schoolmaster who was a friend of literature who kept a houseful of books and who was himself a graceful scholar and an author while he chose to write of poetic and humorous genius  such was the master who wrote the day dreams of a schoolmaster mr darcy wentworth thompson to whom in this place i am glad to confess my gratitude after all these many years  while we were deep in the history of pendennis we were also being dragged through the commentaries of caius julius caesar through the latin and greek grammars through xenophon and the eclogues of virgil and a depressing play of euripides the phoenissae  i can never say how much i detested these authors who taken in small doses are far indeed from being attractive  horace to a lazy boy appears in his odes to have nothing to say and to say it in the most frivolous and vexatious manner  then cowpers task or paradise lost as schoolbooks with notes seems arid enough to a schoolboy  i remember reading ahead in cowper instead of attending to the lesson and the classwork  his observations on public schools were not uninteresting but the whole english school work of those days was repugnant  ones english education was all got out of school  as to greek for years it seemed a mere vacuous terror one invented for ones self all the current arguments against compulsory greek  what was the use of it who ever spoke in it who could find any sense in it or any interest  a language with such cruel superfluities as a middle voice and a dual a language whose verbs were so fantastically irregular looked like a barbaric survival a mere plague and torment  so one thought till homer was opened before us  elsewhere i have tried to describe the vivid delight of first reading homer delight by the way which st augustine failed to appreciate  most boys not wholly immersed in dulness felt it i think to myself for one homer was the real beginning of study  one had tried him when one was very young in pope and had been baffled by pope and his artificial manner his fairs and swains  homer seemed better reading in the absurd crib which mr buckley wrote for bohns series  hector and ajax in that disguise were as great favourites as horatius on the bridge or the younger tarquin scott by the way must have made one a furious and consistent legitimist  in reading the lays of ancient rome my sympathies were with the expelled kings at least with him who fought so well at lake regillus     titus the youngest tarquin       too good for such a breed  where     valerius struck at titus       and lopped off half his crest    but titus stabbed valerius       a span deep in the breast  i find on the margin of my old copy in a schoolboys hand the words well done the jacobites  perhaps my politics have never gone much beyond this sentiment  but this is a digression from homer  the very sound of the hexameter that long inimitable roll of the most various music was enough to win the heart even if the words were not understood  but the words proved unexpectedly easy to understand full as they are of all nobility all tenderness all courage courtesy and romance  the morte darthur itself which about this time fell into our hands was not so dear as the odyssey though for a boy to read sir thomas malory is to ride at adventure in enchanted forests to enter haunted chapels where a light shines from the graal to find by lonely mountain meres the magic boat of sir galahad  after once being initiated into the mysteries of greece by homer the work at greek was no longer tedious  herodotus was a charming and humorous storyteller and as for thucydides his account of the sicilian expedition and its ending was one of the very rare things in literature which almost if not quite brought tears into ones eyes  few passages indeed have done that and they are curiously discrepant  the first book that ever made me cry of which feat i was horribly ashamed was uncle toms cabin with the death of eva topsys friend  then it was trying when colonel newcome said adsum and the end of socrates in the phaedo moved one more than seemed becomingthese and a passage in the history of skalagrim lambs tail and as i said the ruin of the athenians in the syracusan bay  i have read these chapters in an old french version derived through the italian from a latin translation of thucydides  even in this fardescended form the tale keeps its pathos the calm grave stamp of that tragic telling cannot be worn away by much handling by long time by the many changes of human speech  others too says nicias in that fatal speech when     all was done that men may do    and all was done in vain  having achieved what men may have borne what men must  this is the very burden of life and the last word of tragedy  for now all is vain courage wisdom piety the bravery of lamachus the goodness of nicias the brilliance of alcibiades all are expended all wasted nothing of that brave venture abides except torture defeat and death  no play not poem of individual fortunes is so moving as this ruin of a people no modern story can stir us with all its eloquence like the brief gravity of this ancient history  nor can we find at the last any wisdom more wise than that which bids us do what men may and bear what men must such are the lessons of the greek of the people who tried all things in the morning of the world and who still speak to us of what they tried in words which are the sum of human gaiety and gloom of grief and triumph hope and despair  the world since their day has but followed in the same round which only seems new has only made the same experiments and failed with the same failure but less gallantly and less gloriously  ones schoolboy adventures among books ended not long after winning the friendship of homer and thucydides of lucretius and catullus  ones application was far too desultory to make a serious and accurate scholar  i confess to having learned the classical languages as it were by accident for the sake of what is in them and with a provokingly imperfect accuracy  cricket and trout occupied far too much of my mind and my time christopher north and walton and thomas tod stoddart and the moor and the loch were my holiday reading and i do not regret it philologists and ireland scholars are not made so but you can in no way fashion a scholar out of a casual and inaccurate intelligence  the true scholar is one whom i envy almost as much as i respect him but there is a kind of mental shortsightedness where accents and verbal niceties are concerned which cannot be sharpened into true scholarship yet even for those afflicted in this way and with the malady of being idle careless little boys the ancient classics have a value for which there is no substitute  there is a charm in finding ourselvesour common humanity our puzzles our cares our joys in the writings of men severed from us by race religion speech and half the gulf of historical timewhich no other literary pleasure can equal  then there is to be added as the university preacher observed the pleasure of despising our fellowcreatures who do not know greek  doubtless in that there is great consolation  it would be interesting were it possible to know what proportion of people really care for poetry and how the love of poetry came to them and grew in them and where and when it stopped  modern poets whom one meets are apt to say that poetry is not read at all  byrons murray ceased to publish poetry in 1830 just when tennyson and browning were striking their preludes  probably mr murray was wise in his generation but it is also likely that many persons even now are attached to poetry though they certainly do not buy contemporary verse  how did the passion come to them  how long did it stay  when did the muse say good bye  to myself as i have remarked poetry came with sir walter scott for one read shakespeare as a child rather in a kind of dream of fairyland and enchanted isles than with any distinct consciousness that one was occupied with poetry  next to scott with me came longfellow who pleased one as more reflective and tenderly sentimental while the reflections were not so deep as to be puzzling  i remember how hiawatha came out when one was a boy and how delightful was the free forest life and minnehaha and paupukkeewis and nokomis  one did not then know that the same charm with a yet fresher dew upon it was to meet one later in the kalewala  but at that time one had no conscious pleasure in poetic style except in such ringing verse as scotts and campbells in his patriotic pieces  the pleasure and enchantment of style first appealed to me at about the age of fifteen when one read for the first time     so all day long the noise of battle rolled    among the mountains by the winter sea    until king arthurs table man by man    had fallen in lyonnesse about their lord  previously one had only heard of mr tennyson as a name  when a child i was told that a poet was coming to a house in the highlands where we chanced to be a poet named tennyson  is he a poet like sir walter scott i remember asking and was told no he was not like sir walter scott  hearing no more of him i was prowling among the books in an ancient house a rambling old place with a ghostroom where i found tupper and could not get on with proverbial philosophy  next i tried tennyson and instantly a new light of poetry dawned a new music was audible a new god came into my medley of a pantheon a god never to be dethroned  men scarcely know how beautiful fire is shelley says  i am convinced that we scarcely know how great a poet lord tennyson is use has made him too familiar  the same hand has raised the table round again that has written the sacred book of friendship that has lulled us with the magic of the lotus eaters and the melody of tithonus  he has made us move like his own prince        among a world of ghosts    and feel ourselves the shadows of a dream  he has enriched our world with conquests of romance he has recut and reset a thousand ancient gems of greece and rome he has roused our patriotism he has stirred our pity there is hardly a human passion but he has purged it and ennobled it including this of love  truly the laureate remains the most various the sweetest the most exquisite the most learned the most virgilian of all english poets and we may pity the lovers of poetry who died before tennyson came  here may end the desultory tale of a desultory bookish boyhood  it was not in nature that one should not begin to rhyme for ones self  but those exercises were seldom even written down they lived a little while in a memory which has lost them long ago  i do remember me that i tried some of my attempts on my dear mother who said much what dryden said to cousin swift you will never be a poet a decision in which i straightway acquiesced  for to rhyme is one thing to be a poet quite another  a good deal of mortification would be avoided if young men and maidens only kept this obvious fact well posed in front of their vanity and their ambition  in these bookish memories i have said nothing about religion and religious books for various reasons  but unlike other scots of the pen i got no harm from the shorter catechism of which i remember little and neither then nor now was or am able to understand a single sentence  some precocious metaphysicians comprehended and stood aghast at justification sanctification adoption and effectual calling  these apparently were necessary processes in the scottish spiritual life  but we were not told what they meant nor were we distressed by a sense that we had not passed through them  from most children one trusts calvinism ran like water off a ducks back unlucky were they who first absorbed and later were compelled to get rid of the shorter catechism  one good thing if no more these memories may accomplish  young men especially in america write to me and ask me to recommend a course of reading  distrust a course of reading  people who really care for books read all of them  there is no other course  let this be a reply  no other answer shall they get from me the inquiring young men    ii   people talk in novels about the delights of a first love  one may venture to doubt whether everybody exactly knows which was his or her first love of men or women but about our first loves in books there can be no mistake  they were and remain the dearest of all after boyhood the bloom is off the literary rye  the first parcel of these garrulities ended when the author left school at about the age of seventeen  ones literary equipment seems to have been then almost as complete as it ever will be ones tastes definitely formed ones favourites already chosen as long as we live we hope to read but we never can recapture the first fine careless rapture  besides one begins to write and that is fatal my own first essays were composed at schoolfor other boys  not long ago the gentleman who was then our english master wrote to me informing me he was my earliest public and that he had never credited my younger brother with the essays which that unscrupulous lad i speak of him but brotherly was accustomed to present for his consideration  on leaving school at seventeen i went to st leonards hall in the university of st andrews  that is the oldest of scotch universities and was founded by a papal bull  st leonards hall after having been a hospitium for pilgrims a home for old ladies about 1500 and a college in the university was now a kind of cross between a masters house at school and as before 1750 a college  we had more liberty than schoolboys less than english undergraduates  in the scotch universities the men live scattered in lodgings and only recently at st andrews have they begun to dine together in hall  we had a common roof common dinners wore scarlet gowns possessed football and cricket clubs and started of course a kind of weekly magazine  it was only a manuscript affair and was profusely illustrated  for the only time in my life i was now an editor under a subeditor who kept me up to my work and cut out my fine passages  the editors duty was to write most of the magazineto write essays reviews of books by the professors very severe novels short stories poems translations also to illustrate these and to fag his friends for copy and drawings  a deplorable flippancy seems as far as one remembers to have been the chief characteristic of the periodicalflippancy and an abundant use of the supernatural  these were the days of lord lyttons strange story which i continue to think a most satisfactory romance  inspired by lord lytton and aided by the university library i read cornelius agrippa trithemius petrus de abano michael scott and struggled with iamblichus and plotinus  these are really but disappointing writers  it soon became evident enough that the devil was not to be raised by their prescriptions that the philosophers stone was beyond the reach of the amateur  iamblichus is particularly obscure and tedious  to any young beginner i would recommend petrus de abano as the most adequate and gruesome of the school for real deevilry and pleesure while in the wilderness of plotinus there are many beautiful passages and lofty speculations  two winters in the northern university with the seamy side of school life left behind among the kindest of professorsmr sellar mr ferrier mr shairpin the society of the warden mr rhoades and of many dear old friends are the happiest time in my life  this was true literary leisure even if it was not too well employed and the religio loci should be a liberal education in itself  we had debating societiesi hope i am now forgiven for an attack on the character of sir william wallace latro quidam as the chronicler calls him a certain brigand  but i am for ever writing about st andrewswriting inaccurately too the scotch critics declare  farewell we cried dear city of youth and dream eternally dear and sacred  here we first made acquaintance with mr browning guided to his works by a parody which a lady wrote in our little magazine  mr browning was not a popular poet in 1861  his admirers were few a little people but they were not then in the later mood of reverence they did not awfully question the oracles as in after years  they read they admired they applauded on occasion they mocked goodhumouredly  the book by which mr browning was best known was the two green volumes of men and women in these i still think is the heart of his genius beating most strenuously and with an immortal vitality  perhaps this for its compass is the collection of poetry the most various and rich of modern english times almost of any english times  but just as mr fitzgerald cared little for what lord tennyson wrote after 1842 so i have never been able to feel quite the same enthusiasm for mr brownings work after men and women  he seems to have more influence though that influence is vague on persons who chiefly care for thought than on those who chiefly care for poetry  i have met a lady who had read the ring and the book often the lotus eaters not once  among such students are mr brownings disciples of the inner court i dwell but in the court of the gentiles  while we allall who attempt rhymehave more or less consciously imitated the manner of lord tennyson mr swinburne mr rossetti such imitations of mr browning are uncommonly scarce  he is lucky enough not to have had the seed of his flower stolen and sown everywhere till     once again the people    called it but a weed  the other new poet of these days was mr clough who has many undergraduate qualities  but his peculiar wistful scepticism in religion had then no influence on such of us as were still happily in the ages of faith  anything like doubt comes less of reading perhaps than of the sudden necessity which in almost every life puts belief on her trial and cries for an examination of the creeds hitherto held upon authority and by dint of use and wont  in a different way one can hardly care for mr matthew arnold as a boy till one has come under the influence of oxford  so mr browning was the only poet added to my pantheon at st andrews though macaulay then was admitted and appeared to be more the true model of a prose writer than he seems in the light of later reflection  probably we all have a period of admiring carlyle almost exclusively  college essays when the essayist cares for his work are generally based on one or the other  then they recede into the background  as for their thought we cannot for ever remain disciples we begin to see how much that looks like thought is really the expression of temperament and how individual a thing temperament is how each of us must construct his world for himself or be content to wait for an answer and a synthesis in that faroff divine event to which the whole creation moves  so for one in these high matters i must be content as a masterless man swearing by no philosopher unless he be the imperial stoic of the hardy heart marcus aurelius antoninus  perhaps nothing in education encourages this incredulity about masters of thought like the history of philosophy  the professor of moral philosophy mr ferrier was a famous metaphysician and scholar  his lectures on the history of greek philosophy were an admirable introduction to the subject afterwards pursued in the original authorities at oxford  mr ferrier was an exponent of other mens ideas so fair and persuasive that in each new school we thought we had discovered the secret  we were physicists with thales and that presocratic company of gallant gentlemen for whom sydney smith confessed his lack of admiration  we were now empedocleans now believers in heraclitus now in socrates now in plato now in aristotle in each lecture our professor set up a new master and gently disintegrated him in the next  amurath to amurath succeeds as mr t h green used to say at oxford  he himself became an amurath a sultan of thought even before his apotheosis as the guide of that bewildered clergyman mr robert elsmere  at oxford when one went there one found mr green already in the position of a leader of thought and of young men  he was a tutor of balliol and lectured on aristotle and of him eager youth said in the words of omar khayyam he knows he knows what was it that mr green knew  where was the secret  to a mind already sceptical about masters it seemed that the secret apart from the tutors noble simplicity and rare elevation of character was a knack of translating st john and aristotle alike into a terminology which we then believed to be hegelian  hegel we knew not in the original german but in lectures and in translations  reasoning from these inadequate premises it seemed to me that hegel had invented evolution before mr darwin that his system showed so to speak the spirit at work in evolution the something within the wheels  but this was only a personal impression made on a mind which knew darwin and physical speculations in general merely in the vague popular way  mr greens pupils could generally write in his own language more or less and could envisage things as we said then from his point of view  to do this was believed probably without cause to be useful in examinations  for one i could never take it much more seriously never believed that the absolute as the oxford spectator said had really been got into a corner  the absolute has too often been apparently cornered too often has escaped from that situation  somewhere in an old notebook i believe i have a portrait in pencil of mr green as he wrestled at lecture with aristotle with the notion with his chair and table  perhaps he was the last of that remarkable series of men who may have begun with wycliffe among whom newmans is a famous name that were successively accepted at oxford as knowing something esoteric as possessing a shrewd guess at the secret        none the less    i still came out no wiser than i went  all of these masters and teachers made their mark probably won their hold in the first place by dint of character not of some peculiar views of theology and philosophy  doubtless it was the same with socrates with buddha  to be like them not to believe with them is the thing needful  but the younger we are the less perhaps we see this clearly and we persuade ourselves that there is some mystery in these mens possession some piece of knowledge some method of thinking which will lead us to certainty and to peace  alas their secret is incommunicable and there is no more a philosophic than there is a royal road to the city  this may seem a digression from adventures among books into the book of human life  but while much of education is still orally communicated by lectures and conversations many thoughts which are to be found in books greek or german reach us through the hearing  there are many pupils who can best be taught in this way but for one if there be aught that is desirable in a book i then as now preferred if i could to go to the book for it  yet it is odd that one remembers so little of ones undergraduate readings apart from the constant study of the ancient classics which might not be escaped  of these the calm wisdom of aristotle in moral thought and in politics made perhaps the deepest impression  probably politicians are the last people who read aristotles politics  the work is indeed apt to disenchant one with political life  it is melancholy to see the little greek states running the regular roundmonarchy oligarchy tyranny democracy in all its degrees the ultimate democracy of plunder lawlessness license of women children and slaves and then tyranny again or subjection to some foreign power in politics too there is no secret of success of the happy life for all  there is no such road to the city either democratic or royal  this is the lesson which aristotles polities impresses on us this and the impossibility of imposing ideal constitutions on mankind  whateer is best administered is best  these are some of the impressions made at oxford by the studies of the schools the more or less inevitable curricoolum as the scotch gentleman pronounced the word  but at oxford for most men the regular work of the schools is only a small part of the literary education  people read in different degrees according to their private tastes  there are always a few men at least who love literary studies for their own sake regardless of lectures and of classes  in my own time i really believe you could know nothing which might not pay in the schools and prove serviceable in examinations  but a good deal depended on being able to use your knowledge by way of literary illustration  perhaps the cleverest of my own juniors since very well known in letters did not use his own special vein even when he had the chance in writing answers to questions in examinations  hence his academic success was much below his deserts  for my own part i remember my tutor saying dont write as if you were writing for a penny paper  alas it was a prediction cruel smart  but as yet no sin was dreamed  at my own college we had to write weekly essays alternately in english and latin  this might have been good literary training but i fear the essays were not taken very seriously  the chief object was to make the late learned dr scott bound on his chair by paradoxes  but nobody ever succeeded  he was experienced in trash  as for what may be called unacademic literature there were not many essays in that art  there have been very literary generations as when corydon and thyrsis lived in oxford as if it had been a great country house so corydon confessed probably many of the poems by mr matthew arnold and many of mr swinburnes early works were undergraduate poems  a later generation produced love in idleness a very pleasing volume  but the gods had not made us poetical  in those days i remember picking up in the union readingroom a pretty white quarto atalanta in calydon by a c swinburne  only once had i seen mr swinburnes name before signing a brief tale in once a week  atalanta was a revelation there was a new and original poet here a balliol man too  in my own mind atalanta remains the best the most beautiful the most musical of mr swinburnes many poems  he instantly became the easily parodied model of undergraduate versifiers  swinburnian prize poems even were attempted without success  as yet we had not seen mr matthew arnolds verses  i fell in love with them one long vacation and never fell out of love  he is not and cannot be the poet of the wide world but his charm is all the more powerful over those whom he attracts and subdues  he is the one oxford poet of oxford and his scholar gypsy is our lycidas  at this time he was professor of poetry but alas he lectured just at the hour when wickets were pitched on cowley marsh and i never was present at his discourses at his humorous prophecies of englands fate which are coming all too true so many weary lectures had to be attended could not be cut that we abstained from lectures of supererogation so to speak  for the rest there was no literary movement among contemporary undergraduates  they read for the schools and they rowed and played cricket  we had no poets except the stroke of the corpus boat mr bridges and he concealed his courtship of the muse  corpus is a small college but mr bridges pulled its boat to the proud place of second on the river  b n c was the head boat and even b n c did corpus bump  but the triumph was brief  b n c made changes in its crew got a new ship drank the foaming grape and bumped corpus back  i think they went head next year but not that year  thus mr bridges as kingsley advises was doing noble deeds not dreaming them at that moment  there existed a periodical entirely devoted to verse but nobody knew anybody who wrote in it  a comic journal was started i remember the pride with which when a freshman i received an invitation to join its councils as an artist  i was to do the caricatures of all things  now methought i shall meet the oxford wits of whom i have read  but the wits were unutterably disappointing and the whole thing died early and not lamented  only one piece of academic literature obtained and deserved success  this was the oxford spectator a most humorous little periodical in shape and size like addisons famous journal  the authors were mr reginald copleston now bishop of colombo mr humphry ward and mr nolan a great athlete who died early  there have been good periodicals since many amusing things occur in the echoes from the oxford magazine but the spectator was the flower of academic journals  when i look back to my own experience says the spectator i find one scene of all oxford most deeply engraved upon the mindful tablets of my soul  and yet not a scene but a fairy compound of smell and sound and sight and thought  the wonderful scent of the meadow air just above iffley on a hot may evening and the gay colours of twenty boats along the shore the poles all stretched out from the bank to set the boats clear and the sonorous cries of ten seconds more all down from the green barge to the lasher  and yet that unrivalled moment is only typical of all the term the various elements of beauty and pleasure are concentrated there  unfortunately life at oxford is not all beauty and pleasure  things go wrong somehow  life drops her happy mask  but this has nothing to do with books  about books however i have not many more confessions that i care to make  a mans old self is so far away that he can speak about it and its adventures almost as if he were speaking about another who is dead  after taking ones degree and beginning to write a little for publication the topic has a tendency to become much more personal  my last undergraduate literary discoveries were of france and the renaissance  accidentally finding out that i could read french i naturally betook myself to balzac  if you read him straight on without a dictionary you begin to learn a good many words  the literature of france has been much more popular in england lately but thirty years agone it was somewhat neglected  there does seem to be something in french poetry which fails to please the german paste in our composition  mr matthew arnold a disciple of saintebeuve never could appreciate french poetry  a poet critic has even remarked that the french language is nearly incapable of poetry  we cannot argue in such matters where all depends on the taste and the ear  our ancestors like the author of the faery queen translated and admired du bellay and ronsard to some critics of our own time this taste seems a modish affectation  for one i have ever found an original charm in the lyrics of the pleiad and have taken great delight in hugos amazing variety of music in the romance of alfred de musset in the beautiful cameos of gautier  what is poetical if not the song of roland the only true national epic since homer  what is frank natural verse if not that of the old pastourelles  where is there naivete of narrative and unconscious charm if not in aucassin et nicolette  in the long normally developed literature of france so variously rich we find the nearest analogy to the literature of greece though that of england contains greater masterpieces and her verse falls more winningly on the ear  france has no shakespeare and no milton we have no moliere and no song of roland  one star differs from another in glory but it is a fortunate moment when this planet of france swims into our ken  many of our generation saw it first through mr swinburnes telescope heard of it in his criticisms and are grateful to that watcher of the skies even if we do not share all his transports  there then arose at oxford out of old french and old oak and old china a school or movement it was aesthetic and an early purchaser of mr william morriss wall papers  it existed ten or twelve years before the public caught on as they say to these delights  but except one or two of the masters the school were only playing at aesthetics and laughing at their own performances  there was more fun than fashion in the cult which was later revived developed and gossiped about more than enough  to a writer now dead and then first met i am specially bound in gratitudethe late mr j f mlennan  mr mlennan had the most acute and ingenious of minds which i have encountered  his writings on early marriage and early religion were revelations which led on to others  the topic of folklore and the development of custom and myths is not generally attractive to be sure  only a few people seem interested in that spectacle so full of surprisesthe development of all human institutions from fairy tales to democracy  in beholding it we learn how we owe all things humanly speaking to the people and to genius  the natural people the folk has supplied us in its unconscious way with the stuff of all our poetry law ritual and genius has selected from the mass has turned customs into codes nursery tales into romance myth into science ballad into epic magic mummery into gorgeous ritual  the world has been educated but not as man would have trained and taught it he led us by a way we knew not led and is leading us we know not whither we follow in fear  the student of this lore can look back and see the long trodden way behind him the winding tracks through marsh and forest and over burning sands  he sees the caves the camps the villages the towns where the race has tarried for shorter times or longer strange places many of them and strangely haunted desolate dwellings and inhospitable  but the scarce visible tracks converge at last on the beaten ways the ways to that city whither mankind is wandering and which it may never win  we have a foreboding of a purpose which we know not a sense as of will working as we would not have worked to a hidden end  this is the lesson i think of what we call folklore or anthropology which to many seems trivial to many seems dull  it may become the most attractive and serious of the sciences certainly it is rich in strange curiosities like those mystic stones which were fingered and arrayed by the pupils in that allegory of novalis  i am not likely to regret the accident which brought me up on fairy tales and the inquisitiveness which led me to examine the other fragments of antiquity  but the poetry and the significance of them are apt to be hidden by the enormous crowd of details  only late we find the true meaning of what seems like a mass of fantastic savage eccentricities  i very well remember the moment when it occurred to me soon after taking my degree that the usual ideas about some of these matters were the reverse of the truth that the common theory had to be inverted  the notion was in the air it had already flashed on mannhardt probably but like the white knight in alice i claimed it for my own invention  these reminiscences and reflections have now been produced as far as 1872 or thereabouts and it is not my intention to pursue them further nor to speak of any living contemporaries who have not won their way to the classical  in writing of friends and teachers at oxford i have not ventured to express gratitude to those who still live still teach still are the wisest and kindest friends of the hurrying generations  it is a silence not of thanklessness but of respect and devotion  about otherscontemporaries or juniors by many yearswho have instructed consoled strengthened and amused us we must also be silent     chapter ii recollections of robert louis stevenson      tusitala     we spoke of a rest in a fairy hill of the north but he       far from the firths of the east and the racing tides of the west    sleeps in the sight and the sound of the infinite southern sea       weary and well content in his grave on the vaea crest     tusitala the lover of children the teller of tales       giver of counsel and dreams a wonder a worlds delight    looks oer the labour of men in the plain and the hill and the sails       pass and repass on the sea that he loved in the day and the night     winds of the west and the east in the rainy season blow       heavy with perfume and all his fragrant woods are wet    winds of the east and the west as they wander to and fro       bear him the love of the lands he loved and the long regret     once we were kindest he said when leagues of the limitless sea       flowed between us but now that no range of the refluent tides    sunders us each from each yet nearer we seem to be       when only the unbridged stream of the river of death divides  before attempting to give any reminiscences of mr stevenson it is right to observe that reminiscences of him can best be found in his own works  in his essay on childs play and in his childs garden of verse he gave to the world his vivid recollections of his imaginative infancy  in other essays he spoke of his boyhood his health his dreams his methods of work and study  the silverado squatters reveals part of his experience in america  the parisian scenes in the wrecker are inspired by his sojourn in french bohemia his journeys are recorded in travels with a donkey and an inland voyage while his south sea sketches which appeared in periodicals deal with his oceanic adventures  he was the most autobiographical of authors with an egoism nearly as complete and to us as delightful as the egoism of montaigne thus the proper sources of information about the author of kidnapped are in his delightful books  johns own john as dr holmes says may be very unlike his neighbours john but in the case of mr stevenson his louis was very similar to my louis i mean that as he presents his personality to the world in his writings even so did that personality appear to me in our intercourse the man i knew was always a boy     sing me a song of the lad that is gone  he wrote about prince charlie but in his own case the lad was never gone  like keats and shelley he was and he looked of the immortally young  he and i were at school together but i was an elderly boy of seventeen when he was lost in the crowd of gytes as the members of the lowest form are called  like all scotch people we had a vague family connection a greatuncle of his i fancy married an aunt of my own called for her beauty the flower of ettrick  so we had both heard but these things were before our day  a lady of my kindred remembers carrying stevenson about when he was a rather peevish baby and i have seen a beautiful photograph of him like one of raffaels children taken when his years were three or four  but i never had heard of his existence till in 1873 i think i was at mentone in the interests of my health  here i met mr sidney colvin now of the british museum and with mr colvin stevenson  he looked as in my eyes he always did look more like a lass than a lad with a rather long smooth oval face brown hair worn at greater length than is common large lucid eyes but whether blue or brown i cannot remember if brown certainly light brown  on appealing to the authority of a lady i learn that brown was the hue  his colour was a trifle hectic as is not unusual at mentone but he seemed under his big blue cloak to be of slender yet agile frame  he was like nobody else whom i ever met  there was a sort of uncommon celerity in changing expression in thought and speech  his cloak and tyrolese hat he would admit the innocent impeachment were decidedly dear to him  on the frontier of italy why should he not do as the italians do  it would have been well for me if i could have imitated the wearing of the cloak  i shall not deny that my first impression was not wholly favourable here i thought is one of your aesthetic young men though a very clever one  what the talk was about i do not remember probably of books  mr stevenson afterwards told me that i had spoken of monsieur paul de st victor as a fine writer but added that he was not a british sportsman  mr stevenson himself to my surprise was unable to walk beyond a very short distance and as it soon appeared he thought his thread of life was nearly spun  he had just written his essay ordered south the first of his published works for his pentland rising pamphlet was unknown a boys performance  on reading ordered south i saw at once that here was a new writer a writer indeed one who could do what none of us nous autres could rival or approach  i was instantly sealed of the tribe of louis an admirer a devotee a fanatic if you please  at least my taste has never altered  from this essay it is plain enough that the author as is so common in youth but with better reason than many have thought himself doomed  most of us have gone through that the millevoye phase but who else has shown such a wise and gay acceptance of the apparently inevitable  we parted i remember little of our converse except a shrewd and hearty piece of encouragement given me by my junior who already knew so much more of life than his senior will ever do  for he ran forth to embrace life like a lover his motto was never lucy ashtons     vacant heart and hand and eye    easy live and quiet die  mr stevenson came presently to visit me at oxford  i make no hand of reminiscences i remember nothing about what we did or said with one exception which is not going to be published  i heard of him writing essays in the portfolio and the cornhill those delightful views of life at twentyfive so brave so real so vivid so wise so exquisite which all should know  how we looked for r l s at the end of an article and how devout was our belief how happy our pride in the young one  about 1878 i think i was now a slave of the quill myself i received a brief note from mr stevenson introducing to me the person whom in his essay on his old college magazine he called glasgow brown  what his real name was whence he came whence the money came i never knew  g b was going to start a weekly tory paper  would i contribute  g b came to see me  mr stevenson has described him not as i would have described him like mr bill sikess dog i have the christian peculiarity of not liking dogs as are not of my breed  g bs paper london was to start next week  he had no writer of political leading articles  would i do a leader  but i was not in favour of lord lyttons afghan policy  how could i do a tory leader  well i did a neutraltinted thing with citations from aristophanes  i found presently some other scribes for g b  what a paper that was  i have heard that g b paid in handfuls of gold in handfuls of banknotes  nobody ever read london or advertised in it or heard of it  it was full of the most wonderfully clever verses in old french forms  they were it afterwards appeared by mr w e henley  mr stevenson himself astonished and delighted the public of london that is the contributors by his new arabian nights  nobody knew about them but ourselves a fortunate few  poor g b died and mr henley became the editor  i may not name the contributors the flower of the young lions elderly lions now there is a new race  but one lion a distinguished and learned lion said already that fiction not essay was mr stevensons field  well both fields were his and i cannot say whether i would be more sorry to lose virginibus puerisque and studies of men and books or treasure island and catriona  with the decease of g b pactolus dried up in its mysterious sources london struggled and disappeared  mr stevenson was in town now and again at the old saville club in saville row which had the tiniest and blackest of smokingrooms  here or somewhere he spoke to me of an idea of a tale a man who was two men i said william wilson by edgar poe and declared that it would never do  but his brownies in a vision of the night showed him a central scene and he wrote jekyll and hyde  my friend of these days and of all days mr charles longman sent me the manuscript  in a very commonplace london drawingroom at 1030 pm i began to read it arriving at the place where utterson the lawyer and the butler wait outside the doctors room i threw down the manuscript and fled in a hurry  i had no taste for solitude any more  the story won its great success partly by dint of the moral whatever that may be more by its terrible lucid visionary power  i remember mr stevenson telling me at this time that he was doing some regular crawlers for this purist had a boyish habit of slang and i think it was he who called julius caesar the howlingest cheese who ever lived  one of the crawlers was thrawn janet after wandering willies tale but certainly after it to my taste it seems the most wonderful story of the supernatural in our language  mr stevenson had an infinite pleasure in boisgobey montepin and of course gaboriau  there was nothing of the cultured person about him concerning a novel dear to culture he said that he would die by my side in the last ditch proclaiming it the worst fiction in the world  i make haste to add that i have only known two men of letters as free as mr stevenson not only from literary jealousy but from the writers natural if exaggerated distaste for work which though in his own line is very different in aim and method from his own  i do not remember another case in which he dispraised any book  i do remember his observations on a novel then and now very popular but not to his taste nor indeed by any means impeccable though stirring his censure and praise were both just  from his occasional fine efforts the author of this romance he said should have cleared away acres of brushwood of ineffectual matter  it was so no doubt as the writer spoken of would be ready to acknowledge  but he was an improviser of genius and mr stevenson was a conscious artist  of course we did by no means always agree in literary estimates no two people do  but when certain worksin his line in one waywere stupidly set up as rivals of his the person who was most irritated was not he but his equally magnanimous contemporary  there was no thought of rivalry or competition in either mind  the younger romancists who arose after mr stevenson went to samoa were his friends by correspondence from them who never saw his face i hear of his sympathy and encouragement  every writer knows the special temptations of his tribe they were temptations not even felt i do believe by mr stevenson  his heart was far too high his nature was in every way as generous as his hand was open  it is in thinking of these things that one feels afresh the greatness of the worlds loss for a good heart is much more than style writes one who knew him only by way of letters  it is a trivial reminiscence that we once plotted a boisgobesque story together  there was a prisoner in a muscovite dungeon  well extract information from him i said  how  with corkscrews  but the mere suggestion of such a process was terribly distasteful to him not that i really meant to go to these extreme lengths  we never of course could really have worked together and his maladies increasing he became more and more a wanderer living at bournemouth at davos in the grisons finally as all know in samoa  thus though we corresponded not unfrequently i never was of the inner circle of his friends  among men there were school or college companions or companions of paris or fontainebleau cousins like mr r a m stevenson or a stray senior like mr sidney colvin  from some of them or from mr stevenson himself i have heard tales of the wild prince and poins  that he and a friend travelled utterly without baggage buying a shirt where a shirt was needed is a fact and the incident is used in the wrecker  legend says that once he and a friend did possess a bag and also nobody ever knew why a large bottle of scent  but there was no room for the bottle in the bag so mr stevenson spilled the whole contents over the other mans head taking him unawares that nothing might be wasted  i think the tale of the endless staircase in the wrecker is founded on fact so are the stories of the atelier which i have heard mr stevenson narrate at the oxford and cambridge club  for a nocturnal adventure in the manner of the new arabian nights a learned critic already spoken of must be consulted  it is not my story in paris at a cafe i remember that mr stevenson heard a frenchman say the english were cowards  he got up and slapped the mans face  monsieur vous mavez frappe said the gaul  a ce quil parait said the scot and there it ended  he also told me that years ago he was present at a play i forget what play in paris where the moral hero exposes a woman with a history  he got up and went out saying to himself  what a play what a people  ah monsieur vous etes bien jeune said an old french gentleman  like a right scot mr stevenson was fond of our auld ally of france to whom our country and our exiled kings owed so much  i rather vaguely remember another anecdote  he missed his train from edinburgh to london and his sole portable property was a return ticket a meerschaum pipe and a volume of mr swinburnes poems  the last he found unmarketable the pipe i think he made merchandise of but somehow his provender for the days journey consisted in one bath bun which he could not finish  these trivial tales illustrate a period in his life and adventures which i only know by rumour  our own acquaintance was to a great degree literary and bookish  perhaps it began with a slight aversion but it seemed like madeira to be ripened and improved by his long sea voyage and the news of his death taught me at least the true nature of the affection which he was destined to win  indeed our acquaintance was like the friendship of a wild singing bird and of a punctual domesticated barndoor fowl laying its daily article for the breakfast table of the citizens  he often wrote to me from samoa sometimes with news of native manners and folklore  he sent me a devilbox the luck of some strange island which he bought at a great price  after parting with its luck or fetish a shell in a curious wooden box the island was unfortunate and was ravaged by measles  i occasionally sent out books needed for mr stevensons studies of which more will be said  but i must make it plain that in the body we met but rarely  his really intimate friends were mr colvin and mr baxter who managed the practical side of his literary business between them mr henley in partnership with whom he wrote several plays his cousin mr r a m stevenson and among other literati mr gosse mr austin dobson mr saintsbury mr walter pollock knew him well  the best portrait of mr stevenson that i know is by sir w b richmond ra and is in that gentlemans collection of contemporaries with the effigies of mr holman hunt mr william morris mr browning and others  it is unfinished owing to an illness which stopped the sittings and does not show the subject at his best physically speaking there is also a brilliant slight sketch almost a caricature by mr sargent  it represents mr stevenson walking about the room in conversation  the people i have named or some of them knew mr stevenson more intimately than i can boast of doing  unlike each other opposites in a dozen ways we always were united by the love of letters and of scotland our dear country  he was a patriot yet he spoke his mind quite freely about burns about that apparent want of heart in the poets amours which our countrymen do not care to hear mentioned  well perhaps for some reasons it had to be mentioned once and so no more of it  mr stevenson possessed more than any man i ever met the power of making other men fall in love with him  i mean that he excited a passionate admiration and affection so much so that i verily believe some men were jealous of other mens place in his liking  i once met a stranger who having become acquainted with him spoke of him with a touching fondness and pride his fancy reposing as it seemed in a fond contemplation of so much genius and charm  what was so taking in him and how is one to analyse that dazzling surface of pleasantry that changeful shining humour wit wisdom recklessness beneath which beat the most kind and tolerant of hearts  people were fond of him and people were proud of him his achievements as it were sensibly raised their pleasure in the world and to them became parts of themselves  they warmed their hands at that centre of light and heat  it is not every success which has these beneficent results  we see the successful sneered at decried insulted even when success is deserved  very little of all this hardly aught of all this i think came in mr stevensons way  after the beginning when the praises of his earliest admirers were irritating to dull scribes he found the critics fairly kind i believe and often enthusiastic  he was so much his own severest critic that he probably paid little heed to professional reviewers  in addition to his rathillet and other mss which he destroyed he once in the highlands long ago lost a portmanteau with a batch of his writings  alas that he should have lost or burned anything  kings chaff says our country proverb is better than other folks corn  i have remembered very little or very little that i can write and about our last meeting when he was so near death in appearance and so full of couragehow can i speak  his courage was a strong rock not to be taken or subdued  when unable to utter a single word his pencilled remarks to his attendants were pithy and extremely characteristic  this courage and spiritual vitality made one hope that he would if he desired it live as long as voltaire that reed among oaks  there were of course in so rare a combination of characteristics some which were not equally to the liking of all  he was highly original in costume but as his photographs are familiar the point does not need elucidation  life was a drama to him and he delighted like his own british admirals to do things with a certain air  he observed himself i used to think as he observed others and saw himself in every part he played  there was nothing of the cabotin in this selfconsciousness it was the unextinguished childish passion for playing at things which remained with him  i have a theory that all children possess genius and that it dies out in the generality of mortals abiding only with people whose genius the world is forced to recognise  mr stevenson illustrates and perhaps partly suggested this private philosophy of mine  i have said very little i have no skill in reminiscences no art to bring the living aspect of the man before those who never knew him  i faintly seem to see the eager face the light nervous figure the fingers busy with rolling cigarettes mr stevenson talking listening often rising from his seat standing walking to and fro always full of vivid intelligence wearing a mysterious smile  i remember one pleasant dark afternoon when he told me many tales of strange adventures narratives which he had heard about a murderous lonely inn somewhere in the states he was as good to hear as to read  i do not recollect much of that delight in discussion in controversy which he shows in his essay on conversation where he describes i believe mr henley as burley and mr symonds as opalstein  he had great pleasure in the talk of the late professor fleeming jenkin which was both various and copious  but in these noctes coenaeque deum i was never a partaker  in many topics such as angling golf cricket whereon i am willingly diffuse mr stevenson took no interest  he was very fond of boating and sailing in every kind he hazarded his health by long expeditions among the fairy isles of ocean but he was not a british sportsman though for his measure of strength a good pedestrian a friend of the open air and of all who live and toil therein  as to his literary likings they appear in his own confessions  he revelled in dickens but about thackeraywell i would rather have talked to somebody else  to my amazement he was of those i think who find thackeray cynical  he takes you into a garden and then pelts you withhorrid things  mr stevenson on the other hand had a free admiration of mr george meredith  he did not so easily forgive the longueus and lazinesses of scott as a scot should do  he read french much greek only in translations  literature was of course his first love but he was actually an advocate at the scottish bar and as such had his name on a brazen door plate  once he was a competitor for a chair of modern history in edinburgh university he knew the romantic side of scottish history very well  in his novel catriona the character of james mohr macgregor is wonderfully divined  once i read some unpublished letters of catrionas unworthy father written when he was selling himself as a spy and lying as he spied to the hanoverian usurper  mr stevenson might have written these letters for james mohr they might be extracts from catriona  in turning over old jacobite pamphlets i found a forgotten romance of prince charless hidden years and longed that mr stevenson should retell it  there was a treasure an authentic treasure there were real spies a real assassin a real or reported rescue of a lovely girl from a fire at strasbourg by the prince  the tale was to begin sur le pont davignon a young scotch exile watching the rhone thinking how much of it he could cover with a salmon fly thinking of the tay or beauly  to him enter another shady tramping exile blairthwaite a murderer  and so it was to run on as the authors fancy might lead him with alan breck and the master for characters  at last in unpublished mss i found an actual master of ballantrae a highland chiefnoble majestically handsomeand a paid spy of england  all these papers i sent out to samoa too late  the novel was to have been dedicated to me and that chance of immortality is gone with so much else  mr stevensons last letters to myself were full of his concern for a common friend of ours who was very ill  depressed himself mr stevenson wrote to this gentlemanwhy should i not mention mr james paynwith consoling gaiety  i attributed his depression to any cause but his own health of which he rarely spoke  he lamented the illstaged fifth act of life he at least had no long hopeless years of diminished force to bear  i have known no man in whom the preeminently manly virtues of kindness courage sympathy generosity helpfulness were more beautifully conspicuous than in mr stevenson no man so much lovedit is not too strong a wordby so many and such various people  he was as unique in character as in literary genius     chapter iii rabs friend   to say what ought to be said concerning dr john brown a man should have known him well and long and should remember much of that old generation of scotchmen to whom the author of rab and his friends belonged  but that generation has departed  one by one these wits and scholars of the north these epigoni who were not indeed of the heroes but who had seen and remembered scott and wilson have passed away  aytoun and carlyle and dr burton and last dr brown are gone  sir theodore martin alone is left  in her memoir of dr burtonthe historian of scotland and author of the bookhuntermrs burton remarks that in her husbands later days only dr john brown and professor blackie remained of all her husbands ancient friends and coevals of all who remembered lockhart and hogg and their times  but many are left who knew dr brown far better and more intimately than the author of this notice  i can hardly say when i first became acquainted with him probably it was in my childhood  ever since i was a boy certainly i used to see him at intervals especially in the christmas vacations  but he seldom moved from edinburgh except in summer which he frequently passed in the country house of certain friends of his whose affection made much of the happiness of his latest years and whose unfailing kindness attended him in his dying hours  living always in scotland dr brown was seen but rarely by his friends who resided in england  thus though dr browns sweetness of disposition and charm of manner his humour and his unfailing sympathy and encouragement made one feel toward him as to a familiar friend yet of his actual life i saw but little and have few reminiscences to contribute  one can only speak of that singular geniality of his that temper of goodness and natural tolerance and affection which as scotsmen best know is not universal among the scots  our race does not need to pray like the mechanic in the story that providence will give us a good conceit of ourselves but we must acknowledge that the scotch temper is critical if not captious argumentative inclined to look at the seamy side of men and of their performances and to dwell on imperfections rather than on merits and virtues  an example of these blemishes of the scotch disposition carried to an extreme degree in the nature of a man of genius is offered to the world in the writings and reminiscences of mr carlyle  now dr john brown was at the opposite pole of feeling  he had no mawkish toleration of things and people intolerable but he preferred not to turn his mind that way  his thoughts were with the good the wise the modest the learned the brave of times past and he was eager to catch a reflection of their qualities in the characters of the living of all with whom he came into contact  he was for example almost optimistic in his estimate of the work of young people in art or literature  from everything that was beautiful or good from a summer day by the tweed or from the eyes of a child or from the humorous saying of a friend or from treasured memories of old scotch worthies from recollections of his own childhood from experience of the stoical heroism of the poor he seemed to extract matter for pleasant thoughts of men and the world and nourishment for his own great and gentle nature  i have never known any man to whom other men seemed so dearmen dead and men living  he gave his genius to knowing them and to making them better known and his unselfishness thus became not only a great personal virtue but a great literary charm  when you met him he had some good story or some story of goodness to tellfor both came alike to him and his humour was as unfailing as his kindness  there was in his face a singular charm blended as it were of the expressions of mirth and of patience  being most sensitive to pain as well as to pleasure he was an exception to that rule of rochefoucauldsnous avons tous assez de force pour supporter les maux dautrui 2  he did not bear easily the misfortunes of others and the evils of his own lot were heavy enough  they saddened him but neither illness nor his poignant anxiety for others could sour a nature so unselfish  he appeared not to have lost that anodyne and consolation of religious hope which had been the strength of his forefathers and was his best inheritance from a remarkable race of scotsmen  wherever he came he was welcome people felt glad when they had encountered him in the streetsthe streets of edinburgh where almost every one knows every one by sightand he was at least as joyously received by the children and the dogs as by the grownup people of every family  a friend has kindly shown me a letter in which it is told how dr browns love of dogs his interest in a halfblind old dandy which was attached to him was evinced in the very last hours of his life  but enough has been said in general terms about the character of the beloved physician as dr brown was called in edinburgh and a brief account may be given in some detail of his life and ways  dr john brown was born in biggar one of the gray slatylooking little towns in the pastoral moorlands of southern scotland  these towns have no great beauty that they should be admired by strangers but the natives as scott said to washington irving are attached to their gray hills and to the tweed so beautiful where mans greed does not pollute it that the border people are all in love with it as tyro in homer loved the divine enipeus  we hold it far the fairest of the floods that run upon the earth  how dear the border scenery was to dr john brown and how well he knew and could express its legendary magic its charm woven of countless ancient spells the music of old ballads the sorcery of old stories may be understood by readers of his essay on minchmoor 3  the father of dr brown was the third in a lineage of ministers of the sect called seceders  to explain who the seceders were it would be necessary to explore the sinking morasses of scotch ecclesiastical history  the minister was proud of being not only a seceder but a burgher  he inherited to be brief the traditions of a most spirituallyminded and most spirited set of men too much bent it may appear to us on establishing delicate distinctions of opinions but certainly most true to themselves and to their own ideals of liberty and of faith  dr browns greatgrandfather had been a shepherd boy who taught himself greek that he might read the new testament who walked twentyfour milesleaving his folded sheep in the nightto buy the precious volume in st andrews and who finally became a teacher of much repute among his own people  of dr browns father he himself wrote a most touching and beautiful account in his letter to john cairns dd  this essay contains perhaps the very finest passages that the author ever penned  his sayings about his own childhood remind one of the manner of lamb without that curious fantastic touch which is of the essence of lambs style  the following lines for example are a revelation of childish psychology and probably may be applied with almost as much truth to the childhood of our race     children are long of seeing or at least of looking at what is above    them they like the ground and its flowers and stones its red    sodgers and ladybirds and all its queer things their world is    about three feet high and they are more often stooping than gazing    up  i know i was past ten before i saw or cared to see the ceilings    of the rooms in the manse at biggar  i have often thought that the earliest fathers of our race childlike in so many ways were childlike in this and worshipped not the phenomena of the heavens but objects more on a level with their eyesthe queer things of their lowlying world  in this essay on his father dr brown has written lines about a childs first knowledge of death which seem as noteworthy as steeles famous passage about his fathers death and his own halfconscious grief and anger  dr brown describes a scottish funeralthe funeral of his own motheras he saw it with the eyes of a boy of five years old while his younger brother a baby of a few months     leaped up and crowed with joy at the strange sightthe crowding    horsemen the coaches and the nodding plumes of the hearse       then to my surprise and alarm the coffin resting on its bearers    was placed over the dark hole and i watched with curious eye the    unrolling of those neat black bunches of cords which i have often    enough seen since  my father took the one at the head and also    another much smaller springing from the same point as his which he    had caused to be placed there and unrolling it put it into my hand    i twisted it firmly round my fingers and awaited the result the    burial men with their real ropes lowered the coffin and when it    rested at the bottom it was too far down for me to see it  the grave    was made very deep as he used afterwards to tell us that it might    hold us all  my father first and abruptly let his cord drop followed    by the rest  this was too much  i now saw what was meant and held    on and fixed my fist and feet and i believe my father had some    difficulty in forcing open my small fingers he let the little black    cord drop and i remember in my misery and anger seeing its open end    disappearing in the gloom 4  the man who wrote this and many another passage as true and tender might surely have been famous in fiction if he had turned his powers that way  he had imagination humour pathos he was always studying and observing life his last volume especially is like a collection of fragments that might have gone toward making a work in some ways not inferior to the romances of scott  when the third volume of essays was published in the spring of his last year a reviewer who apparently had no personal knowledge of dr brown asked why he did not write a novel he was by that time over seventy years of age and though none guessed it within a few weeks of his death  what he might have done had he given himself to literature only it is impossible to guess  but he caused so much happiness and did so much good in that gentle profession of healing which he chose and which brought him near to many who needed consolation more than physic that we need not forget his deliberate choice  literature had only his horae subsecivae as he said subseciva quaedam tempora quae ego perire non patior as cicero writes shreds and waste ends of time which i suffer not to be lost  the kind of life which dr browns father and his people lived at biggar the austere life of work and of thought intensely bent on the real aim of existence on god on the destiny of the soul is perhaps rare now even in rural scotland  we are less obedient than of old to the motto of that ring found on magus moor where archbishop shairp was murdered remember upon dethe  if any reader has not yet made the acquaintance of dr browns works one might counsel him to begin with the letter to john cairns dd the fragment of biography and autobiography the description of the fountainheads from which the genius of the author flowed  in his early boyhood john brown was educated by his father a man who from his sons affectionate description seems to have confined a fiery and romantic genius within the channels of seceder and burgher theology  when the father received a call to the rose street secession church in edinburgh the son became a pupil of that ancient scottish seminary the high schoolthe school where scott was taught not much latin and no greek worth mentioning  scott was still alive and strong in those days and dr brown describes how he and his school companions would take off their hats to the shirra as he passed in the streets  though lame he was nimble and all rough and alive with power had you met him anywhere else you would say he was a liddesdale store farmer come of gentle blooda stout blunt carle as he says of himself with the swing and stride and the eye of a man of the hillsa large sunny outofdoor air all about him  on his broad and stooping shoulders was set that head which with shakespeares and bonapartes is the best known in all the world  scott was then living in 39 castle street  i do not know whether the many pilgrims whom one meets moving constantly in the direction of melrose and abbotsford have thought of making pilgrimage to castle street and to the grave there of scotts dear old friendhis dog camp  of dr browns schoolboy days one knows littledays when bob ainslie and i were coming up infirmary street from the high school our heads together and our arms intertwisted as only lovers and boys know how or why  concerning the doctors character he has left it on record that he liked a dogfight  a dogfight shouted bob and was off and so was i both of us all hot praying that it might not be over before we were up    dogs like fighting old isaac watts not walton says they delight in it and for the best of all reasons and boys are not cruel because they like to see the fight  this is a very different thing from a love of making dogs fight  and this was the most famous of all dogfightssince the old irish brehons settled the laws of that sport and gravely decided what was to be done if a child interfered or an idiot or a woman or a oneeyed manfor this was the dogfight in which rab first was introduced to his historian  six years passed after this battle and dr brown was a medical student and a clerk at minto hospital  how he renewed his acquaintance there and in what sad circumstances with rab and his friends it is superfluous to tell for every one who reads at all has read that story and most readers not without tears  as a medical student in edinburgh dr brown made the friendship of mr syme the famous surgeona friendship only closed by death  i only saw them once together a very long time ago and then from the point of view of a patient  these occasions are not agreeable and patients like the old cock which did not crow when plucked are apt to be very much absorbed but dr browns attitude toward the man whom he regarded with the reverence of a disciple as well as with the affection of a friend was very remarkable  when his studies were over dr brown practised for a year as assistant to a surgeon in chatham  it must have been when he was at chatham that a curious event occurred  many years later charles dickens was in edinburgh reading his stories in public and was dining with some edinburgh people  dickens began to speak about the panic which the cholera had caused in england how ill some people had behaved  as a contrast he mentioned that at chatham one poor woman had died deserted by every one except a young physician  some one however ventured to open the door and found the woman dead and the young doctor asleep overcome with the fatigue that mastered him on his patients death but quite untouched by the general panic  why that was dr john brown one of the guests observed and it seems that thus early in his career the doctor had been setting an example of the courage and charity of his profession  after a year spent in chatham he returned to edinburgh where he spent the rest of his life busy partly with his art of healing partly with literature  he lived in rutland street near the railway station by which edinburgh is approached from the west and close to princes street the chief street of the town separated by a green valley once a loch from the high castle rock  it was the room in which his friends were accustomed to see dr brown and a room full of interest it was  in his long life the doctor had gathered round him many curious relics of artists and men of letters a drawing of a dog by turner i remember particularly and a copy of don juan in the first edition with byrons manuscript notes  dr brown had a great love and knowledge of art and of artists from turner to leech and he had very many friends among men of letters such as mr ruskin and mr thackeray dr brown himself was a clever designer of rapid little grotesques rough sketches of dogs and men  one or two of them are engraved in the little papercovered booklets in which some of his essays were separately publishedbooklets which he was used to present to people who came to see him and who were interested in all that he did  i remember some vivacious grotesques which he drew for one of my brothers when we were schoolboys  these little things were carefully treasured by boys who knew dr brown and found him friendly and capable of sustaining a conversation on the points of a dandy dinmont terrier and other mysteries important to youth  he was a bibliophilea taste which he inherited from his father who began collecting books when he was twelve and was collecting to his last hours  the last time i ever saw dr brown a year before his death he was kind enough to lend me one of the rarest of his treasures poems by mr ruskin  probably mr ruskin had presented the book to his old friend in no other way were it easy to procure writings which the author withdrew from publication if indeed they ever were properly speaking published  thus dr brown was all things to all men and to all boys  he had a word for every one as poor people say and a word to the point for he was as much at home with the shepherd on the hills or with the angler between hollylea and clovenfords as with the dusty bookhunter or the doggy young border yeoman or the child who asked him to draw her a picture or the friend of genius famous through all the world thackeray when he spoke as he seldom did of divine things  three volumes of essays are all that dr brown has left in the way of compositions a light but imperishable literary baggage  his studies are usually derived from personal experience which he reproduced with singular geniality and simplicity or they are drawn from the tradition of the elders the reminiscences of longlived scotch people who themselves had listened attentively to those who went before them  since scott these ancient ladies with wonderful memories have had no such attentive listener or appreciative reporter as dr brown  his paper called mystifications a narrative of the pranks of miss stirling graham is a brief vivid record of the clever and quaint society of scotland sixty years ago  scotland or at least scottish society is now only english societya little narrower a little prouder sometimes even a little duller  but old people of position spoke the old scotch tongue sixty years ago and were full of wonderful genealogies full of reminiscences of the 45 and the adventures of the jacobites  the very last echoes of that ancient world are dying now from memory like the wide reverberations of that gun which miss nelly macwilliam heard on the day when prince charles landed and which resounded strangely all through scotland  the children of this generation one fears will hardly hear of these old raids and duels risings and rebellions by oral tradition handed down unbroken through aunts and grandmothers  scott reaped a full late harvest of the memories of clannish and feudal scotland dr brown came as a later gleaner and gathered these stirring tales of a jacobite family which are published in the last volume of his essays  when he was an observer not a hearer only dr brown chiefly studied and best wrote of the following topics passages and characters of humour and pathos which he encountered in his life and profession children dogs border scenery and fellowworkers in life and science  under one or other of these categories all his best compositions might be arranged the most famous and most exquisite of all his works in the first class is the unrivalled rab and his friendsa study of the stoicism and tenderness of the lowland character worthy of scott  in a minor way the little paper on jeems the doorkeeper in a dissenting house of the lord is interesting to scotch people though it must seem a rather curious revelation to all others  her last halfcrown is another study of the honesty that survived in a starving and outcast scotch girl when all other virtues as we commonly reckon virtue had gone before her character to some place where let us hope they may rejoin her for if we are to suffer for the vices which have abandoned us may we not get some credit for the virtues that we have abandoned but that once were ours in some heaven paved with bad resolutions unfulfilled  the black dwarfs bones is a sketch of the misshapen creature from whom scott borrowed the character that gives a name to one of his minor border stories  the real black dwarf david ritchie he was called among men was fond of poetry but hated burns  he was polite to the fair but classed mankind at large with his favourite aversions ghosts fairies and robbers  there was this of human about the black dwarf that he hated folk that are aye gaun to dee and never dot  the village beauties were wont to come to him for a judgment of paris on their charms and he presented each with a flower which was of a fixed value in his standard of things beautiful  one kind of rose the prize of the most fair he only gave thrice  paris could not have done his dooms more courteously and if he had but made judicious use of rose lily and lotus as prizes he might have pleased all the three goddesses troy still might be standing and the lofty house of king priam  among dr browns papers on children that called pet marjorie holds the highest place  perhaps certain passages are wrote too sentimentally as marjorie fleming herself remarked about the practice of many authors  but it was difficult to be perfectly composed when speaking of this wonderful fairylike little girl whose affection was as warm as her humour and genius were precocious  infant phenomena are seldom agreeable but marjorie was so humorous so quicktempered so kind that we cease to regard her as an intellectual phenomenon  her memory remains sweet and blossoming in its dust like that of little penelope boothby the child in the mob cap whom sir joshua painted and who died very soon after she was thus made immortal  it is superfluous to quote from the essay on marjorie fleming every one knows about her and her studies isabella is teaching me to make simme colings nots of interrigations peorids commoes c  here is a shakespearian criticism of which few will deny the correctness macbeth is a pretty composition but awful one  again i never read sermons of any kind but i read novelettes and my bible  tom jones and grays elegy in a country churchyard are both excellent and much spoke of by both sex particularly by the men  her calvinistic belief in unquestionable fire and brimston is unhesitating but the young theologian appears to have substituted unquestionable for unquenchable  there is something humorous in the alteration as if marjorie refused to be put off with an excellent family substitute for fire and brimstone and demanded the unquestionable article no other being genuine please observe trade mark  among dr browns contributions to the humorous study of dogs rab of course holds the same place as marjorie among his sketches of children but if his queen marys child garden the description of the little garden in which mary stuart did not play when a child is second to marjorie so our dogs is a good second to rab  perhaps dr brown never wrote anything more mirthful than his description of the sudden birth of the virtue of courage in toby a comic but cowardly mongrel a cur of low degree     toby was in the way of hiding his culinary bones in the small gardens    before his own and the neighbouring doors  mr scrymgeour two doors    off a bulky choleric redfaced mantorvo vultuwas by law of    contrast a great cultivator of flowers and he had often scowled toby    into all but nonexistence by a stamp of his foot and a glare of his    eye  one day his gate being open in walks toby with a huge bone    and making a hole where scrymgeour had two minutes before been    planting some precious slip the name of which on paper and on a stick    toby made very light of substituted his bone and was engaged    covering it or thinking he was covering it up with his shovelling    nose when s spied him through the inner glass door and was out upon    him like the assyrian with a terrific gowl  i watched them    instantly toby made at him with a roar too and an eye more torve than    scrymgeours who retreating without reserve fell prostrate there    is reason to believe in his own lobby  toby contented himself with    proclaiming his victory at the door and returning finished his bone    planting at his leisure the enemy who had scuttled behind the glass    door glared at him  from this moment toby was an altered dog  pluck    at first sight was lord of all    that very evening he paid a visit    to leo next doors dog a big tyrannical bully and coward    to    him toby paid a visit that very evening down into his den and walked    about as much as to say come on macduff but macduff did not come    on  this story is one of the most amazing examples of instant change of character on record and disproves the sceptical remark that no one was ever converted except prizefighters and colonels in the army  i am sorry to say that dr brown was too fond of dogs to be very much attached to cats  i never heard him say anything against cats or indeed against anybody but there are passages in his writings which tend to show that when young and thoughtless he was not far from regarding cats as the higher vermin  he tells a story of a ghazi puss so to speak a victorious cat which entrenched in a drain defeated three dogs with severe loss and finally escaped unharmed from her enemies  dr browns family gloried in the possession of a dandy dinmont named john pym whose cousin auld pepper belonged to one of my brothers  dr brown was much interested in pepper a dog whose family pride was only matched by that of the mother of candide and at one time threatened to result in the extinction of this branch of the house of pepper  dr brown had remarked and my own observations confirm it that when a dandy is not game his apparent lack of courage arises from kindness of heart  among dr browns landscapes as one may call his descriptions of scenery and of the ancient historical associations with scotch scenery minchmoor is the most important  he had always been a great lover of the tweed  the walk which he commemorates in minchmoor was taken if i am not mistaken in company with principal shairp professor of poetry in the university of oxford and author of one of the most beautiful of tweedside songs a modern bush aboon traquair        and what saw ye there       at the bush aboon traquair    or what did ye hear that was worth your heed       i heard the cushie croon       thro the gowden afternoon    and the quair burn singing doon to the vale o tweed  there is in the country of scott no pleasanter walk than that which dr brown took in the summer afternoon  within a few miles many places famous in history and ballad may be visited the road by which montroses men fled from philiphaugh fight traquair house with the bears on its gates as on the portals of the baron of bradwardine williamhope where scott and mungo park the african explorer parted and went their several ways  from the crest of the road you see all the border hills the maiden paps the eildons cloven in three the dunion the windburg and so to the distant cheviots and smailholm tower where scott lay when a child and clapped his hands at the flashes of the lightning haud sine dis animosus infans like horace  from the crest of the hill you follow dr brown into the valley of yarrow and the deep black pools now called the dowie dens and so through the pomp of cultivated nature as wordsworth says to the railway at selkirk passing the plain where janet won back tamlane from the queen of the fairies  all this country was familiar to dr brown and on one of the last occasions when i met him he was living at hollylea on the tweed just above ashestiel scotts home while he was happy and prosperous before he had the unhappy thought of building abbotsford  at the time i speak of dr brown had long ceased to write and his health suffered from attacks of melancholy in which the world seemed very dark to him  i have been allowed to read some letters which he wrote in one of these intervals of depression  with his habitual unselfishness he kept his melancholy to himself and though he did not care for society at such times he said nothing of his own condition that could distress his correspondent  in the last year of his life everything around him seemed to brighten he was unusually well he even returned to his literary work and saw his last volume of collected essays through the press  they were most favourably received and the last letters which i had from him spoke of the pleasure which this success gave him  three editions of his book john leech and other essays were published in some six weeks  all seemed to go well and one might even have hoped that with renewed strength he would take up his pen again  but his strength was less than we had hoped  a cold settled on his lungs and in spite of the most affectionate nursing he grew rapidly weaker  he had little suffering at the end and his mind remained unclouded  no man of letters could be more widely regretted for he was the friend of all who read his books as even to people who only met him once or twice in life he seemed to become dear and familiar  in one of his very latest writings on thackerays death dr brown told people what some of them needed and still need to be told how good kind and thoughtful for others was our great writerour greatest master of fiction i venture to think since scott  some of the lines dr brown wrote of thackerary might be applied to himself he looked always fresh with that abounding silvery hair and his young almost infantile facea face very pale and yet radiant in his last years and mildly lit up with eyes full of kindness and softened by sorrow  in his last year mr swinburne wrote to dr brown this sonnet in which there seems something of the poets prophetic gift and a voice sounds as of a welcome home     beyond the north wind lay the land of old       where men dwelt blithe and blameless clothed and fed       with joys bright raiment and with loves sweet bread    the whitest flock of earths maternal fold    none there might wear about his brows enrolled       a light of lovelier fame than rings your head       whose lovesome love of children and the dead    all men give thanks for i far off behold       a dear dead hand that links us and a light       the blithest and benignest of the night          the night of deaths sweet sleep wherein may be       a star to show your spirit in present sight          some happier isle in the elysian sea          where rab may lick the hand of marjorie     chapter iv oliver wendell holmes   never but once did i enjoy the privilege of meeting the author of elsie venneroliver wendell holmes  it was at a dinner given by mr lowell and of conversation with dr holmes i had very little  he struck me as being wonderfully erect active and vivacious for his great age  he spoke perhaps i should not chronicle this impressionhe spoke much and freely but rather as if he were wound up to speak so to saywound up i mean by a sense of duty to himself and kindness to strangers who were naturally curious about so wellknown a man  in his aspect there was a certain dryness and altogether his vivacity his ceaselessness and a kind of equability of tone in his voice reminded me of what homer says concerning the old men around priam above the gate of troy how they chirped like cicalas on a summer day  about the matter of his talk i remember nothing only the manner remains with me and mine may have been a false impression or the manner may have been accidental and of the moment or again a manner appropriate for conversation with strangers each coming up one after the other to view respectfully so great a lion  among his friends and intimates he was probably a different man with a tone other and more reposeful  he had a long weary task before him then to talk his way ever courteous alert attentive through part of a london season  yet when it was all over he seems to have enjoyed it being a man who took pleasure in most sorts of experience  he did not affect me for that one time with such a sense of pleasure as mr lowell didmr lowell whom i knew so much better and who was so big strong humorous kind learned friendly and delightfully natural  dr holmes too was a delightful companion and i have merely tried to make a sort of photographic snapshot at him in a single casual moment one of myriads of such moments  turning to dr holmess popular as distinct from his professional writings one is reminded as one often is of the change which seems to come over some books as the reader grows older  many books are to one now what they always were some like the waverley novels and shakespeare grow better on every fresh reading there are books which filled me in boyhood or in youth with a sort of admiring rapture and a delighted wonder at their novelty their strangeness freshness greatness  thus homer and the best novels of thackeray and of fielding the plays of moliere and shakespeare the poems ofwell of all the real poets moved this astonishment of admiration and being read again they move it still  on a different level one may say as much about books so unlike each other as those of poe and of sir thomas browne of swift and of charles lamb  there are again other books which caused this happy emotion of wonder when first perused long since but which do so no longer  i am not much surprised to find charles kingsleys novels among them  in the case of dr holmess books i am very sensible of this disenchanting effect of time and experience  the professor at the breakfast table and the novels came into my hands when i was very young in green unknowing youth  they seemed extraordinary new fantasies of wisdom and wit the reflections were such as surprised me by their depth the illustrations dazzled by their novelty and brilliance probably they will still be as fortunate with young readers and i am to be pitied i hope rather than blamed if i cannot like the wise thrush        recapture    the first fine careless rapture  by this time of course one understands many of the constituents of dr holmess genius the social historical ancestral and professional elements thereof  now it is the business of criticism to search out and illustrate these antecedents and it seems a very odd and unlucky thing that the results of this knowledge when acquired should sometimes be a partial disenchantment  but we are not disenchanted at all by this kind of science when the author whom we are examining is a great natural genius like shakespeare or shelley keats or scott  such natures bring to the world far more than they receive as far as our means of knowing what they receive are concerned  the wind of the spirit that is not of this earth nor limited by time and space breathes through their words and thoughts and deeds  they are not mere combinations however deft and subtle of known atoms  they must continually delight and continually surprise custom cannot stale them like the heavenborn laws in sophocles age can never lull them to sleep  their works when they are authors never lose hold on our fancy and our interest  as far as my own feelings and admiration can inform me dr holmes though a most interesting and amiable and kindly man and writer was not of this class  as an essayist a delineator of men and morals an unassuming philosopher with a light friendly wit he certainly does not hold one as for example addison does  the old spectator makes me smile pleases tickles diverts me now even more than when i lay on the grass and read it by tweedside as a boy when the trout were sluggish in the early afternoon  it is only a personal fact that dr holmes read in the same old seasons with so much pleasure and admiration and surprise no longer affects me in the old way  carlyle on the other hand in his frederick which used to seem rather long now entertains me far more than ever  but i am well aware that this is a mere subjective estimate that dr holmes may really be as great a genius as i was wont to think him for criticism is only a part of our impressions the opinion of mature experience as a rule ought to be sounder than that of youth in this case i cannot but think that it is sounder  dr holmes was a new englander and born in what he calls the brahmin caste the class which in england before the sailing of the may flower and ever since had always been literary and highly educated  i like books i was born and bred among them he says and have the easy feeling when i get into their presence that a stableboy has among horses  he is fond of books and above all of old booksstrange old medical works for examplefull of portents and prodigies such as those of wierus  new england owing to its famous college harvard and its steady maintenance of the literary and learned tradition among the clergy was naturally the home of the earliest great american school of writers these menlongfellow lowell ticknor prescott hawthorne and so many othershad all received the same sort of education as europeans of letters used to receive  they had not started as printers devils or newspaper reporters or playwrights for the stage but were academic  it does not matter much how a genius beginsas a rural butcher or an apothecary or a clerk of a writer to the signet  still the new englanders were academic and classical  new england has by this time established a tradition of its literary origin and character  her children are sons of the puritans with their independence their narrowness their appreciation of comfort their hardiness in doing without it their singular scruples of conscience their sense of the awfulness of sin their accessibility to superstition  we can read of the later new englanders in the making among the works of cotton mather his father increase mather and the witchburning periwighating doctrinal judge sewall who so manfully confessed and atoned for his mistake about the salem witches  these men or many of them were deeply learned calvinists according to the standard of their day a day lasting from say the restoration to 1730  cotton mather in particular is erudite literarynay full of literary vanitymystical visionary credulous to an amusing degree  but he is really as british as baxter or his scottish correspondent and counterpart wodrow  the sons or grandsons of these men gained the war of independence  of this they are naturally proud and the circumstance is not infrequently mentioned in dr holmess works  their democracy is not roaring modern democracy but that of the cultivated middle classes their stern calvinism slackened into many isms but left a kind of religiosity behind it  one of dr holmess mouthpieces sums up his whole creed in the two words pater noster  all these hereditary influences are consciously made conspicuous in dr holmess writings as in hawthornes  in hawthorne you see the old horror of sin the old terror of conscience the old dread of witchcraft the old concern about conduct converted into aesthetic sources of literary pleasure of literary effects  as a physician and a man of science dr holmes added abundant knowledge of the new sort and apt unexpected bits of science made popular analogies and illustrations afforded by science are frequent in his works  thus in elsie venner and in the guardian angel heredity is his theme  he is always brooding over the thought that each of us is so much made up of earlier people our ancestors who bequeath to us so many disagreeable thingsvice madness disease emotions tricks of gesture  no doubt these things are bequeathed but all in such new proportions and relations that each of us is himself and nobody else and therefore had better make up his mind to be himself and for himself responsible  all this doctrine of heredity still so dimly understood dr holmes derives from science  but in passing through his mind that of a new englander conscious of new englands past science takes a stain of romance and superstition  elsie venner through an experience of her mothers inherits the nature of the serpent so the novel is as far from common life as the tale of melusine or any other echidna  the fantasy has its setting in a commonplace new england environment and thus recalls a hawthorne less subtle and concentrated but much more humorous the heroine of the guardian angel again exposes a character in layers as it were each stratum of consciousness being inherited from a different ancestoramong others a red indian  she has many personalities like the queer women we read about in french treatises on hysterics and nervous diseases  these stories are fairy tales of science by a man of science who is also a humourist and has a touch of the poet and of the old fathers who were afraid of witches  the blend is singular enough and not without its originality of fascination  though a man of science dr holmes apparently took an imaginative pleasure in all shapes of superstition that he could muster  i must quote a passage from the professor at the breakfast table as peculiarly illustrative of his method and his ways of half accepting the abnormally romanticaccepting just enough for pleasure like sir walter scott  connected with the extract is a curious anecdote  i think i am a little superstitious  there were two things when i was a boy that diabolised my imaginationi mean that gave me a distinct apprehension of a formidable bodily shape which prowled round the neighbourhood where i was born and bred  the first was a series of marks called the devils footsteps  these were patches of sand in the pastures where no grass grew where even the lowbush blackberry the dewberry as our southern neighbours call it in prettier and more shakespearian language did not spread its clinging creepers where even the pale dry sadlysweet everlasting could not grow but all was bare and blasted  the second was a mark in one of the public buildings near my homethe college dormitory named after a colonial governor  i do not think many persons are aware of the existence of this marklittle having been said about the story in print as it was considered very desirable for the sake of the institution to hush it up  in the north west corner and on the level of the third or fourth storey there are signs of a breach in the walls mended pretty well but not to be mistaken  a considerable portion of that corner must have been carried away from within outward  it was an unpleasant affair and i do not care to repeat the particulars but some young men had been using sacred things in a profane and unlawful way when the occurrence which was variously explained took place  the story of the appearance in the chamber was i suppose invented afterwards but of the injury to the building there could be no question and the zigzag line where the mortar is a little thicker than before is still distinctly visible  the queer burnt spots called the devils footsteps had never attracted attention before this time though there is no evidence that they had not existed previously except that of the late miss m a goody so called who was positive on the subject but had a strange horror of referring to an affair of which she was thought to know something    i tell you it was not so pleasant for a little boy of impressible nature to go up to bed in an old gambrelroofed house with untenanted locked upper chambers and a most ghostly garretwith devils footsteps in the fields behind the house and in front of it the patched dormitory where the unexplained occurrence had taken place which startled those godless youths at their mock devotions so that one of them was epileptic from that day forward and another after a dreadful season of mental conflict took to religion and became renowned for his ascetic sanctity  it is a pity that dr holmes does not give the whole story instead of hinting at it for a similar tale is told at brazenose college and elsewhere  now take along with dr holmess confession to a grain of superstition this remark on and explanation of the curious coincidences which thrust themselves on the notice of most people  excuse mei return to my story of the commonstable  young fellows being always hungry and tea and dry toast being the meagre fare of the evening meal it was a trick of some of the boys to impale a slice of meat upon a fork at dinnertime and stick the fork holding it beneath the table so that they could get it at teatime  the dragons that guarded this table of the hesperides found out the trick at last and kept a sharp lookout for missing forksthey knew where to find one if it was not in its place  now the odd thing was that after waiting so many years to hear of this college trick i should hear it mentioned a second time within the same twentyfour hours by a college youth of the present generation  strange but true  and so it has happened to me and to every person often and often to be hit in rapid succession by these twinned facts or thoughts as if they were linked like chainshot  i was going to leave the simple reader to wonder over this taking it as an unexplained marvel  i think however i will turn over a furrow of subsoil in it  the explanation is of course that in a great many thoughts there must be a few coincidences and these instantly arrest our attention  now we shall probably never have the least idea of the enormous number of impressions which pass through our consciousness until in some future life we see the photographic record of our thoughts and the stereoscopic picture of our actions  now my dear friends who are putting your hands to your foreheads and saying to yourselves that you feel a little confused as if you had been waltzing until things began to whirl slightly round you is it possible that you do not clearly apprehend the exact connection of all i have been saying and its bearing on what is now to come  listen then  the number of these living elements in our bodies illustrates the incalculable multitude of our thoughts the number of our thoughts accounts for those frequent coincidences spoken of these coincidences in the world of thought illustrate those which we constantly observe in the world of outward events  now for the anecdoteone of mark twains  some years ago mark twain published in harpers magazine an article on mental telegraphy  he illustrated his meaning by a story of how he once wrote a long letter on a complicated subject which had popped into his head between asleep and awake to a friend on the other side of america  he did not send the letter but by return of post received one from his friend  now ill tell you what he is going to say said mark twain read his own unsent epistle aloud and then opening his friends despatch proved that they were essentially identical  this is what he calls mental telegraphy others call it telepathy and the term is merely descriptive  now on his own showing in our second extract dr holmes should have explained coincidences like this as purely the work of chance and i rather incline to think that he would have been right  but mark twain in his article on mental telegraphy cites dr holmes for a story of how he once after dinner as his letters came in felt constrained to tell a propos des bottes the story of the last challenge to judicial combat in england 1817  he then opened a newspaper directed to him from england the sporting times and therein his eyes lighted on an account of this very affairabraham thorntons challenge to battle when he was accused of murder in 1817  according to mark twain dr holmes was disposed to accept mental telegraphy rather than mere chance as the cause of this coincidence  yet the anecdote of the challenge seems to have been a favourite of his  it occurs in the professor in the fifth section  perhaps he told it pretty frequently probably that is why the printed version was sent to him still he was a little staggered by the coincidence  there was enough of cotton mather in the man of science to give him pause  the form of dr holmess best known books the set concerned with the breakfasttable and over the teacups is not very fortunate  much conversation at breakfast is a weariness of the flesh  we want to eat what is necessary and then to go about our work or play  if american citizens in a boardinghouse could endure these long palavers they must have been very unlike the hasty feeders caricatured in martin chuzzlewit  macaulay may have monologuised thus at his breakfast parties in the albany but breakfast parties are obsoletean unregrettable parcel of things lost  the monologues or dialogues were published serially in the atlantic monthly but they have had a vitality and a vogue far beyond those of the magazine causerie  some of their popularity they may owe to the description of the other boarders and to the kind of novel which connects the fortunes of these personages  but it is impossible for an englishman to know whether these american types are exactly drawn or not  their fortunes do not strongly interest one though the sculpinthe patriotic deformed bostonian with his greatgreatgrandmothers ring she was hanged for a witchis a very original and singular creation  the real interest lies in the wit wisdom and learning  the wit now and then seems today rather in the nature of a goak  one might give examples but to do so seems ill natured and ungrateful  there are some very perishable puns  the learning is not so recherche as it appeared when we knew nothing of cotton mather and robert calef the author of a book against the persecution of witches  calef of course was in the right but i cannot forgive him for refusing to see a lady known to mr mather who floated about in the air  that she did so was no good reason for hanging or burning a number of parishioners but did she float and if so how  mr calef said it would be a miracle so he declined to view the performance  his logic was thin though of a familiar description  of all old things at all events dr holmes was fond  he found america scarcely aired new and raw devoid of history and of associations  the tiber has a voice for me as it whispers to the piers of the pons aelius even more full of meaning than my wellbeloved charles eddying round the piles of west boston bridge  no doubt this is a common sentiment among americans  occasionally like hawthorne they sigh for an historical atmosphere and then when they come to europe and get it they do not like it and think schenectady new york a better place  it is not easy to understand what ailed hawthorne with europe he was extremely caustic in his writings about that continent and discontented  our matrons were so stout and placid that they irritated him  indeed they are a little heavy in hand still there are examples of agreeable slimness even in this poor old country  fond as he was of the historical past mr holmes remained loyal to the historical present  he was not one of those americans who are always censuring england and always hankering after her  he had none of that irritable feeling which made a great contemporary of his angrily declare that he could endure to hear ye mariners of england sung because of his own countrys successes some time ago  they were gallant and conspicuous victories of the american frigates we do not grudge them  a fair fight should leave no rancour above all in the victors and dr holmess withers would have been unwrung by campbells ditty  he visited england in youth and fifty years later  on the anniversary of the american defeat at bunkers hill june 17 dr holmes got his degree in the old cambridge  he received degrees at edinburgh and at oxford in his hundred days in europe he says very little about these historic cities  the men at oxford asked did he come in the one hoss shay the name of his most familiar poem in the lighter vein  the whole visit to england pleased and wearied him  he likened it to the shass caffy of mr henry fokerthe fillip at the end of the long banquet of life  he went to see the derby for he was fond of horses of racing and in a sportsmanlike way of boxing  he had the great boldness once audax juventa to write a song in praise of that comfortable creaturewine  the prudery of many americans about the juice of the grape is a thing very astonishing to a temperate briton  an admirable author who wrote an account of the old convivial days of an american city found that reputable magazines could not accept such a degrading historical record  there was no nonsense about dr holmes  his poems were mainly occasional verses for friendly meetings or humorous like the celebrated one horse shay  of his serious verses the nautilus is probably too familiar to need quotation a noble fancy is nobly and tunefully moralised  pleasing cultivated and so forth are adjectives not dear to poets  to say sublime or magical or strenuous of dr holmess muse would be to exaggerate  how far he maintained his scholarship i am not certain but it is odd that in his preface to the guardian angel he should quote from jonathan edwards the younger a story for which he might have cited aristotle  were i to choose one character out of dr holmess creations as my favourite it would be a frequent correspondent of his and of minethe immortal gifted hopkins  never was minor poet more kindly and genially portrayed  and if one had to pick out three of his books as the best worth reading they would be the professor elsie venner and the guardian angel  they have not the impeccable art and distinction of the house of the seven gables and the scarlet letter but they combine fantasy with living human interest and with humour  with sir thomas browne and dr john brown andmay we not add dr weir mitchelldr holmes excellently represents the physician in humane letters  he has left a blameless and most amiable memory unspotted by the world  his works are full of the savour of his native soil naturally without straining after americanism and they are national not local or provincial  he crossed the great gulf of years between the central age of american literary productionthe time of hawthorne and poeto our own time and like nestor he reigned among the third generation  as far as the world knows the shadow of a literary quarrel never fell on him he was without envy or jealousy incurious of his own place never vain petulant or severe  he was even too goodhumoured and the worst thing i have heard of him is that he could never say no to an autograph hunter     chapter v mr morriss poems   enough said the pupil of the wise imlac you have convinced me that no man can be a poet  the study of mr william morriss poems in the new collected edition 5 has convinced me that no man or at least no middleaged man can be a critic  i read mr morriss poems thanks to the knightly honours conferred on the bard of penrhyn there is now no ambiguity as to mr morris but it is not the book only that i read the scroll of my youth is unfolded  i see the dear place where first i perused the blue closet the old faces of old friends flock around me old chaff old laughter old happiness reecho and revive  st andrews oxford come before the minds eye with        many a place       thats in sad case    where joy was wont afore oh  as minstrel burne sings  these voices faces landscapes mingle with the music and blur the pictures of the poet who enchanted for us certain hours passed in the paradise of youth  a reviewer who finds himself in this case may as well frankly confess that he can no more criticise mr morris dispassionately than he could criticise his old self and the friends whom he shall never see again till he meets them     beyond the sphere of time       and sin and griefs control    serene in changeless prime       of body and of soul  to write of ones own adventures among books may be to provide anecdotage more or less trivial more or less futile but at least it is to write historically  we know how books have affected and do affect ourselves our bundle of prejudices and tastes of old impressions and revived sensations  to judge books dispassionately and impersonally is much more difficultindeed it is practically impossible for our own tastes and experiences must more or less modify our verdicts do what we will  however the effort must be made for to say that at a certain age in certain circumstances an individual took much pleasure in the life and death of jason the present of a college friend is certainly not to criticise the life and death of jason  there have been three blossoming times in the english poetry of the nineteenth century  the first dates from wordsworth coleridge scott and later from shelley byron keats  by 1822 the blossoming time was over and the second blossoming time began in 18301833 with young mr tennyson and mr browning  it broke forth again in 1842 and did not practically cease till englands greatest laureate sang of the crossing of the bar  but while tennyson put out his full strength in 1842 and mr browning rather later in bells and pomegranates men and women the third spring came in 1858 with mr morriss defence of guenevere and flowered till mr swinburnes atalanta in calydon appeared in 1865 followed by his poems of 1866  mr rossettis book of 1870 belonged in date of composition mainly to this period  in 1858 when the defence of guenevere came out mr morris must have been but a year or two from his undergraduateship  every one has heard enough about his companions mr burne jones mr rossetti canon dixon and the others of the old oxford and cambridge magazine where mr morriss wonderful prose fantasies are buried  why should they not be revived these strangely coloured and magical dreams  as literature i prefer them vastly above mr morriss later romances in prosethe hollow land above news from nowhere  mr morris and his friends were active in the fresh dawn of a new romanticism a mediaeval and catholic revival with very little catholicism in it for the most part  this revival is more innerly as the scotch say more intimate more earnest than the larger and more genial if more superficial restoration by scott  the painful doubt the scepticism of the ages of faith the dark hours of that epoch its fantasy cruelty luxury no less than its colour and passion inform mr morriss first poems  the fourteenth and the early fifteenth century is his period  in the defence of guenevere he is not under the influence of chaucer whose narrative manner without one grain of his humour inspires the life and death of jason and the earthly paradise  in the early book the rugged style of mr browning has left a mark  there are cockney rhymes too such as short rhyming to thought  but on the whole mr morriss early manner was all his own nor has he ever returned to it  in the first poem the queens apology is this passage     listen suppose your time were come to die    and you were quite alone and very weak    yea laid adying while very mightily     the wind was ruffling up the narrow streak    of river through your broad lands running well    suppose a hush should come then some one speak     one of these cloths is heaven and one is hell    now choose one cloth for ever which they be    i will not tell you you must somehow tell     of your own strength and mightiness here see    yea yea my lord and you to ope your eyes    at foot of your familiar bed to see     a great gods angel standing with such dyes    not known on earth on his great wings and hands    held out two ways light from the inner skies     showing him well and making his commands    seem to be gods commands moreover too    holding within his hands the cloths on wands     and one of these strange choosingcloths was blue    wavy and long and one cut short and red    no man could tell the better of the two     after a shivering halfhour you said    god help heavens colour the blue and he said hell    perhaps you then would roll upon your bed     and cry to all good men that loved you well    ah christ if only i had known known known  there was nothing like that before in english poetry it has the bizarrerie of a new thing in beauty  how far it is really beautiful how can i tell  how can i discount the personal bias  only i know that it is unforgettable  again galahad speaks           i saw    one sitting on the altar as a throne       whose face no man could say he did not know    and though the bell still rang he sat alone       with raiment half bloodred half white as snow  such things made their own special ineffaceable impact  leaving the arthurian cycle mr morris entered on his especially sympathetic periodthe gloom and sad sunset glory of the late fourteenth century the age of froissart and wicked wasteful wars  to froissart it all seemed one magnificent pageant of knightly and kingly fortunes he only murmurs a great pity for the death of a knight or the massacre of a town  it is rather the pity of it that mr morris sees the hearts broken in a corner as in sir peter harpedons end or beside the haystack in the floods  here is a picture like life of what befell a hundred times  lady alice de la barde hears of the death of her knight     alice           can you talk faster sir    get over all this quicker fix your eyes    on mine i pray you and whateer you see    still go on talking fast unless i fall    or bid you stop     squire           i pray your pardon then    and looking in your eyes fair lady say    i am unhappy that your knight is dead    take heart and listen let me tell you all    we were five thousand goodly menatarms    and scant five hundred had he in that hold    his rotten sandstone walls were wet with rain    and fell in lumps wherever a stone hit    yet for three days about the barriers there    the deadly glaives were gatherd laid across    and pushd and pulld the fourth our engines came    but still amid the crash of falling walls    and roar of bombards rattle of hard bolts    the steady bowstrings flashd and still streamd out    st georges banner and the seven swords    and still they cried st george guienne until    their walls were flat as jerichos of old    and our rush came and cut them from the keep  the astonishing vividness again of the tragedy told in geffray teste noire is like that of a vision in a magic mirror or a crystal ball rather than like a picture suggested by printed words  shameful death has the same enchanted kind of presentment  we look through a magic casement opening on the foam of the old waves of war  poems of a pure fantasy unequalled out of coleridge and poe are the wind and the blue closet  each only lives in fantasy  motives and facts and story are unimportant and out of view  the pictures arise distinct unsummoned spontaneous like the faces and places which are flashed on our eyes between sleeping and waking  fantastic too but with more of a recognisable human setting is golden wings which to a slight degree reminds one of theophile gautiers chateau de souvenir     the apples now grow green and sour       upon the mouldering castle wall       before they ripen there they fall    there are no banners on the tower     the draggled swans most eagerly eat       the green weeds trailing in the moat       inside the rotting leaky boat    you see a slain mans stiffend feet  these with the sailing of the sword are my own old favourites  there was nothing like them before nor will be again for mr morris after several years of silence abandoned his early manner  no doubt it was not a manner to persevere in but happily in a mood and a moment never to be reborn or return mr morris did fill a fresh page in english poetry with these imperishable fantasies  they were absolutely neglected by the reading public but they found a few staunch friends  indeed i think of guenevere as fitzgerald did of tennysons poems before 1842 but this of course is a purely personal probably a purely capricious estimate  criticism may aver that the influence of mr rossetti was strong on mr morris before 1858  perhaps so but we read mr morris first as the world read the lay before christabel and my own preference is for mr morris  it was after eight or nine years of silence that mr morris produced in 1866 or 1867 the life and death of jason  young men who had read guenevere hastened to purchase it and of course found themselves in contact with something very unlike their old favourite  mr morris had told a classical tale in decasyllabic couplets of the chaucerian sort and he regarded the heroic age from a mediaeval point of view at all events not from an historical and archaeological point of view  it was natural in mr morris to envisage the greek heroic age in this way but it would not be natural in most other writers  the poem is not much shorter than the odyssey and long narrative poems had been out of fashion since the lord of the isles 1814  all this was a little disconcerting  we read jason and read it with pleasure but without much of the more essential pleasure which comes from magic and distinction of style  the peculiar qualities of keats and tennyson and virgil are not among the gifts of mr morris  as people say of scott in his long poems so it may be said of mr morristhat he does not furnish many quotations does not glitter in jewels five words long  in jason he entered on his long career as a narrator a poet retelling the immortal primeval stories of the human race  in one guise or another the legend of jason is the most widely distributed of romances the north american indians have it and the samoans and the samoyeds as well as all indoeuropean peoples  this tale told briefly by pindar and at greater length by apollonius rhodius and in the orphica mr morris took up and handled in a single and objective way  his art was always pictorial but in jason and later he described more and was less apt as it were to flash a picture on the reader in some incommunicable way  in the covers of the first edition were announcements of the earthly paradise that vast collection of the worlds old tales retold  one might almost conjecture that jason had originally been intended for a part of the earthly paradise and had outgrown its limits  the tone is much the same though the criticism of life is less formally and explicitly stated  for mr morris came at last to a criticism of life  it would not have satisfied mr matthew arnold and it did not satisfy mr morris  the burden of these long narrative poems is vanitas vanitatum the fleeting perishable unsatisfying nature of human existence the dream rounded by a sleep  the lesson drawn is to make life as full and as beautiful as may be by love and adventure and art  the hideousness of modern industrialism was oppressing to mr morris that hideousness he was doing his best to relieve and redeem by poetry and by all the many arts and crafts in which he was a master  his narrative poems are indeed part of his industry in this field  he was not born to slay monsters he says the idle singer of an empty day  later he set about slaying monsters like jason or unlike jason scattering dragons teeth to raise forces which he could not lay and could not direct  i shall go no further into politics or agitation and i say this much only to prove that mr morriss criticism of life and prolonged wistful dwelling on the thought of death ceased to satisfy himself  his own later part as a poet and an ally of socialism proved this to be true  it seems to follow that the peculiarly level lifeless decorative effect of his narratives which remind us rather of glorious tapestries than of pictures was no longer wholly satisfactory to himself  there is plenty of charmed and delightful readingjason and the earthly paradise are literature for the castle of indolence but we do miss a strenuous rendering of action and passion  these mr morris had rendered in the defence of guinevere now he gave us something different something beautiful but something deficient in dramatic vigour apollonius rhodius is no doubt much of a pedant a literary writer of epic in an age of criticism  he dealt with the tale of jason and conceivably he may have borrowed from older minstrels  but the medea of apollonius rhodius in her love her tenderness her regret for home in all her maiden words and ways is undeniably a character more living more human more passionate and more sympathetic than the medea of mr morris  i could almost wish that he had closely followed that classical original the first true love story in literature  in the same way i prefer apolloniuss spell for soothing the dragon as much terser and more somniferous than the spell put by mr morris into the lips of medea scholars will find it pleasant to compare these passages of the alexandrine and of the london poets  as a brick out of the vast palace of jason we may select the song of the nereid to hylasmr morris is always happy with his nymphs and nereids        i know a little gardenclose    set thick with lily and with rose    where i would wander if i might    from dewy dawn to dewy night    and have one with me wandering       and though within it no birds sing    and though no pillared house is there    and though the apple boughs are bare    of fruit and blossom would to god    her feet upon the green grass trod    and i beheld them as before       there comes a murmur from the shore    and in the place two fair streams are    drawn from the purple hills afar    drawn down unto the restless sea    the hills whose flowers neer fed the bee    the shore no ship has ever seen    still beaten by the billows green    whose murmur comes unceasingly    unto the place for which i cry       for which i cry both day and night    for which i let slip all delight    that maketh me both deaf and blind    careless to win unskilled to find    and quick to lose what all men seek       yet tottering as i am and weak    still have i left a little breath    to seek within the jaws of death    an entrance to that happy place    to seek the unforgotten face    once seen once kissed once rest from me    anigh the murmuring of the sea  jason is practically a very long tale from the earthly paradise as the earthly paradise is an immense treasure of shorter tales in the manner of jason  mr morris reverted for an hour to his fourteenth century a period when london was clean  this is a poetic license many a plague found mediaeval london abominably dirty  a celt himself no doubt with the celts proverbial way of being impossibilium cupitor mr morris was in full sympathy with his breton squire who in the reign of edward iii sets forth to seek the earthly paradise and the land where death never comes  much more dramatic i venture to think than any passage of jason is that where the dreamy seekers of dreamland breton and northman encounter the stout king edward iii whose kingdom is of this world  action and fantasy are met and the wanderers explain the nature of their quest  one of them speaks of death in many a form and of the flight from death        his words nigh made me weep but while he spoke    i noted how a mocking smile just broke    the thin line of the princes lips and he    who carried the aforenamed armoury    puffed out his windbeat cheeks and whistled low    but the king smiled and said can it be so    i know not and ye twain are such as find    the things whereto old kings must needs be blind    for you the world is widebut not for me    who once had dreams of one great victory    wherein that world lay vanquished by my throne    and now the victor in so many an one    find that in asia alexander died    and will not live again the world is wide    for you i sayfor me a narrow space    betwixt the four walls of a fighting place       poor man why should i stay thee live thy fill    of that fair life wherein thou seest no ill    but fear of that fair rest i hope to win    one day when i have purged me of my sin       farewell it yet may hap that i a king    shall be remembered but by this one thing    that on the morn before ye crossed the sea    ye gave and took in common talk with me    but with this ring keep memory with the morn    o breton and thou northman by this horn    remember me who am of odins blood  all this encounter is a passage of high invention  the adventures in anahuac are such as bishop erie may have achieved when he set out to find vinland the good and came back no more whether he was or was not remembered by the aztecs as quetzalcoatl  the tale of the wanderers was mr morriss own all the rest are of the dateless heritage of our race fairy tales coming to us now softly breathed through the flutes of the grecians now told by sagamen of iceland  the whole performance is astonishingly equable we move on a high tableland where no tall peaks of parnassus are to be climbed  once more literature has a narrator on the whole much more akin to spenser than to chaucer homer or sir walter  humour and action are not so prominent as contemplation of a pageant reflected in a fairy mirror  but mr morris has said himself about his poem what i am trying to say        death have we hated knowing not what it meant    life have we loved through green leaf and through sere    though still the less we knew of its intent    the earth and heaven through countless year on year    slow changing were to us but curtains fair    hung round about a little room where play    weeping and laughter of mans empty day  mr morris had shown in various ways the strength of his sympathy with the heroic sagas of iceland  he had rendered one into verse in the earthly paradise above all grettir the strong and the volsunga he had done into english prose  his next great poem was the story of sigurd a poetic rendering of the theme which is to the north what the tale of troy is to greece and to all the world  mr morris took the form of the story which is most archaic and bears most birthmarks of its savage originthe version of the volsunga not the german shape of the nibelungenlied  he showed extraordinary skill especially in making human and intelligible the story of regin otter fafnir and the dwarf andvaris hoard     it was reidmar the ancient begat me and now was he waxen old    and a covetous man and a king and he bade and i built him a hall    and a golden glorious house and thereto his sons did he call    and he bade them be evil and wise that his will through them might be    wrought    then he gave unto fafnir my brother the soul that feareth nought    and the brow of the hardened iron and the hand that may never fail    and the greedy heart of a king and the ear that hears no wail     but next unto otter my brother he gave the snare and the net    and the longing to wend through the wildwood and wade the highways    wet    and the foot that never resteth while aught be left alive    that hath cunning to match mans cunning or might with his might to    strive     and to me the least and the youngest what gift for the slaying of    ease    save the grief that remembers the past and the fear that the future    sees    and the hammer and fashioningiron and the living coal of fire    and the craft that createth a semblance and fails of the hearts    desire    and the toil that each dawning quickens and the task that is never    done    and the heart that longeth ever nor will look to the deed that is    won     thus gave my father the gifts that might never be taken again    far worse were we now than the gods and but little better than men    but yet of our ancient might one thing had we left us still    we had craft to change our semblance and could shift us at our will    into bodies of the beastkind or fowl or fishes cold    for belike no fixed semblance we had in the days of old    till the gods were waxen busy and all things their form must take    that knew of good and evil and longed to gather and make  but when we turn to the passage of the eclaircissement between sigurd and brynhild that most dramatic and most modern moment in the ancient tragedy the moment where the clouds of savage fancy scatter in the light of a hopeless human love then i must confess i prefer the simple brief prose of mr morriss translation of the volsunga to his rather periphrastic paraphrase  every student of poetry may make the comparison for himself and decide for himself whether the old or the new is better again in the final fight and massacre in the hall of atli i cannot but prefer the slaying of the wooers at the close of the odyssey or the last fight of roland at roncesvaux or the prose version of the volsunga  all these are the work of men who were warsmiths as well as songsmiths  here is a passage from the murder grim and great     so he saith in the midst of the foemen with his warflame reared on    high    but all about and around him goes up a bitter cry    from the iron men of atli and the bickering of the steel    sends a roar up to the roofridge and the niblung warranks reel    behind the steadfast gunnar but lo have ye seen the corn    while yet men grind the sickle by the wind streak overborne    when the sudden rain sweeps downward and summer groweth black    and the smitten woodside roareth neath the driving thunderwrack    so before the wiseheart hogni shrank the champions of the east    as his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of atlis feast    there he smote and beheld not the smitten and by nought were his    edges stopped    he smote and the dead were thrust from him a hand with its shield he    lopped    there met him atlis marshal and his arm at the shoulder he shred    three swords were upreared against him of the best of the kin of the    dead    and he struck off a head to the rightward and his sword through a    throat he thrust    but the third stroke fell on his helmcrest and he stooped to the    ruddy dust    and uprose as the ancient giant and both his hands were wet    red then was the world to his eyen as his hand to the labour he set    swords shook and fell in his pathway huge bodies leapt and fell    harsh grided shield and warhelm like the tempestsmitten bell    and the warcries ran together and no man his brother knew    and the dead men loaded the living as he went the warwood through    and man gainst man was huddled till no sword rose to smite    and clear stood the glorious hogni in an island of the fight    and there ran a river of death twixt the niblung and his foes    and therefrom the terror of men and the wrath of the gods arose  i admit that this does not affect me as does the figure of odysseus raining his darts of doom or the courtesy of roland when the blinded oliver smites him by mischance and indeed the keeping of the stair by umslopogaas appeals to me more vigorously as a strenuous picture of war to be just to mr morris let us give his rendering of part of the slaying of the wooers from his translation of the odyssey     and een as the word he uttered he drew his keen sword out    brazen on each side shearing and with a fearful shout    rushed on him but odysseus that very while let fly    and smote him with the arrow in the breast the pap hard by    and drove the swift shaft to the liver and adown to the ground fell    the sword    from out of his hand and doubled he hung above the board    and staggered and whirling he fell and the meat was scattered    around    and the double cup moreover and his forehead smote the ground    and his heart was wrung with torment and with both feet spurning he    smote    the highseat and over his eyen did the cloud of darkness float     and then it was amphinomus who drew his whetted sword    and fell on making his onrush gainst odysseus the glorious lord    if perchance he might get him outdoors but telemachus him forewent    and a cast of the brazen warspear from behind him therewith sent    amidmost of his shoulders that drave through his breast and out    and clattering he fell and the earth all the breadth of his forehead    smote  there is no need to say more of mr morriss odysseus  close to the letter of the greek he usually keeps but where are the surge and thunder of homer  apparently we must accent the penultimate in amphinomus if the line is to scan  i select a passage of peaceful beauty from book v     but all about that cavern there grew a blossoming wood    of alder and of poplar and of cypress savouring good    and fowl therein wingspreading were wont to roost and be    for owls were there and falcons and longtongued crows of the sea    and deeds of the sea they deal with and thereof they have a care    but round the hollow cavern there spread and flourished fair    a vine of garden breeding and in its grapes was glad    and four wells of the white water their heads together had    and flowing on in order four ways they thence did get    and soft were the meadows blooming with parsley and violet    yea if thither indeed had come een one of the deathless een he    had wondered and gladdened his heart with all that was there to see    and there in sooth stood wondering the flitter the argusbane    but when oer all these matters in his soul he had marvelled amain    then into the wide cave went he and calypso godheads grace    failed nowise there to know him as she looked upon his face    for never unknown to each other are the deathless gods though they    apart from one another may be dwelling far away    but odysseus the mightyhearted within he met not there    who on the beach sat weeping as oft he was wont to wear    his soul with grief and groaning and weeping yea and he    as the tears he was pouring downward yet gazed oer the untilled sea  this is close enough to the greek but     and flowing on in order four ways they thence did get  is not precisely musical  why is hermes the flitter  but i have often ventured to remonstrate against these archaistic peculiarities which to some extent mar our pleasure in mr morriss translations  in his version of the rich virgilian measure they are especially out of place the aeneid is rendered with a roughness which might better befit a translation of ennius  thus the reader of mr morriss poetical translations has in his hands versions of almost literal closeness and what is extremely rare versions of poetry by a poet  but his acquaintance with early english and icelandic has added to the poet a strain of the philologist and his english in the odyssey still more in the aeneid is occasionally more archaic than the greek of 900 bc  so at least it seems to a reader not unversed in attempts to fit the classical poets with an english rendering  but the true test is in the appreciation of the lovers of poetry in general  to them as to all who desire the restoration of beauty in modern life mr morris has been a benefactor almost without example  indeed were adequate knowledge mine mr morriss poetry should have been criticised as only a part of the vast industry of his life in many crafts and many arts  his place in english life and literature is unique as it is honourable  he did what he desired to dohe made vast additions to simple and stainless pleasures     chapter vi mrs radcliffes novels   does any one now read mrs radcliffe or am i the only wanderer in her windy corridors listening timidly to groans and hollow voices and shielding the flame of a lamp which i fear will presently flicker out and leave me in darkness  people know the name of the mysteries of udolpho they know that boys would say to thackeray at school old fellow draw us vivaldi in the inquisition  but have they penetrated into the chill galleries of the castle of udolpho  have they shuddered for vivaldi in face of the sableclad and masked inquisition  certainly mrs radcliffe within the memory of man has been extremely popular  the thick doublecolumned volume in which i peruse the works of the enchantress belongs to a public library  it is quite the dirtiest greasiest most dogseared and most bescribbled tome in the collection many of the books have remained during the last hundred years uncut even to this day and i have had to apply the paper knife to many an author from alciphron 1790 to mr max muller and dr birkbeck hills edition of bozzys life of dr johnson  but mrs radcliffe has been read diligently and copiously annotated  this lady was in a literary sense and though like the sire of evelina he cast her off the daughter of horace walpole  just when king romance seemed as dead as queen anne walpole produced that gothic tale the castle of otranto in 1764  in that very year was born anne ward who in 1787 married william radcliffe esq ma oxon  in 1789 she published the castles of athlin and dunbayne  the scene she tells us is laid in the most romantic part of the highlands the northeast coast of scotland  on castles anywhere she doted  walpole not smollett or miss burney inspired her with a passion for these homes of old romance but the northeast coast of scotland is hardly part of the highlands at all and is far from being very romantic  the period is the dark ages in general  yet the captive earl when the sweet tranquillity of evening threw an air of tender melancholy over his mind    composed the following sonnet which having committed it to paper he the next evening dropped upon the terrace  he had the pleasure to observe that the paper was taken up by the ladies who immediately retired into the castle  these were not the manners of the local mackays of the sinclairs and of the small but fierce clan of gunn in the dark ages  but this was mrs radcliffes way  she delighted in descriptions of scenery the more romantic the better and usually drawn entirely from her inner consciousness  her heroines write sonnets which never but once are sonnets and other lyrics on every occasion  with his usual generosity scott praised her landscape and her lyrics but indeed they are as sir walter said of mrs hemans too poetical and probably they were skipped even by her contemporary devotees  the castles of athlin and dunbayne frankly do not permit themselves to be read and it was not till 1790 with a sicilian romance that mrs radcliffe found herself and her public  after reading with breathless haste through a sicilian romance and the romance of the forest in a single day it would ill become me to speak lightly of mrs radcliffe  like catherine morland i love this ladys tender yet terrific fancy  mrs radcliffe does not always keep on her highest level but we must remember that her last romance the italian is by far her best  she had been feeling her way to this pitch of excellence and when she had attained to it she published no more  the reason is uncertain  she became a womans rights woman and wrote the female advocate not a novel  scott thinks that she may have been annoyed by her imitators or by her critics against whom he defends her in an admirable passage to be cited later  meanwhile let us follow mrs radcliffe in her upward course  the sicilian romance appeared in 1790 when the authors age was twenty six  the book has a treble attraction for it contains the germ of northanger abbey and the germ of jane eyre andthe germ of byron like joseph andrews northanger abbey began as a parody of mrs radcliffe and developed into a real novel of character  so too byrons gloomy scowling adventurers with their darkling past are mere repetitions in rhyme of mrs radcliffes schedoni  this is so obvious that when discussing mrs radcliffes schedoni scott adds in a note parallel passages from byrons giaour  sir walter did not mean to mock he merely compared two kindred spirits  the noble poet kept on the business still and broke into octosyllabics borrowed from scott his descriptions of miscreants borrowed from mrs radcliffe  a sicilian romance has its scene in the palace of ferdinand fifth marquis of mazzini on the northern coast of sicily  the time is about 1580 but there is nothing in the manners or costume to indicate that or any other period  such local colour was unknown to mrs radcliffe as to clara reeve  in horace walpole however a character goes so far in the mediaeval way as to say by my halidome  the marquis mazzini had one son and two daughters by his first amiable consort supposed to be long dead when the story opens  the son is the original of henry tilney in northanger abbey and in general tilney does catherine morland recognise a modern marquis of mazzini  but the marquiss wife to be sure is not dead like the first mrs rochester she is concealed about the back premises and as in jane eyre it is her movements and those of her gaolers that produce mystery and make the reader suppose that the place is haunted  it is of course only the mystery and the machinery of mrs radcliffe that miss bronte adapted  these passages in jane eyre have been censured but it is not easy to see how the novel could do without them  mrs radcliffes tale entirely depends on its machinery  her wicked marquis having secretly immured number one has now a new and beautiful number two whose character does not bear inspection  this domestic position as number two we know was declined by the austere virtue of jane eyre  phenomena begin in the first chapter of a sicilian romance mysterious lights wander about uninhabited parts of the castle and are vainly investigated by young ferdinand son of the marquis  this hippolytus the chaste loved all in vain by the reigning marchioness is adored by and adores her stepdaughter julia  jealousy and revenge are clearly indicated  but in chasing mysterious lights and figures through mouldering towers ferdinand gets into the very undesirable position of david balfour when he climbs in the dark the broken turret stair in his uncles house of shaws in kidnapped  here is a fourth author indebted to mrs radcliffe her disciples are miss austen byron miss bronte and mr louis stevenson  ferdinand began the ascent  he had not proceeded very far when the stones of a step which his foot had just quitted gave way and dragging with them those adjoining formed a chasm in the staircase that terrified even ferdinand who was left tottering on the suspended half of the steps in momentary expectation of falling to the bottom with the stone on which he rested  in the terror which this occasioned he attempted to save himself by catching at a kind of beam which suspended over the stairs when the lamp dropped from his hand and he was left in total darkness  can anything be more amazing horrid above all as there are mysterious figures in and about the tower  mrs radcliffes lamps always fall or are blown out in the nick of time an expedient already used by clara reeve in that very mild but once popular ghost story the old english baron 1777  all authors have such favourite devices and i wonder how many fights mr stanley weymans heroes have fought from the cellar to their favourite tilting ground the roof of a strange house  ferdinand hung on to the beam for an hour when the ladies came with a light and he scrambled back to solid earth  in his next nocturnal research a sullen groan arose from beneath where he stood and when he tried to force a door there are scores of such weird doors in mrs radcliffe a groan was repeated more hollow and dreadful than the first  his courage forsook himand no wonder  of course he could not know that the author of the groans was in fact his longlost mother immured by his father the wicked marquis  we need not follow the narrative through the darkling crimes and crumbling galleries of this terrible castle on the north coast of sicily  everybody is always gazing in silent terror and all the locks are rusty  a savage and dexterous banditti play a prominent part and the imprisoned ferdinand did not hesitate to believe that the moans he heard came from the restless spirit of the murdered della campo  no working hypothesis could seem more plausible but it was erroneous  mrs radcliffe does not deal in a single avowed ghost  she finally explains away by normal causes everything that she does not forget to explain  at the most she indulges herself in a premonitory dream  on this point she is true to common sense without quite adopting the philosophy of david hume  i do not say that spirits have appeared she remarks but if several discreet unprejudiced persons were to assure me that they had seen onei should not be bold or proud enough to reply it is impossible  but hume was bold and proud enough he went further than mrs radcliffe  scott censures mrs radcliffes employment of explanations  he is in favour of boldly avowing the use of supernatural machinery or of leaving the matter in the vague as in the appearance of the wraith of the dying alice to ravenswood  but in mrs radcliffes day common sense was so tyrannical that the poor ladys romances would have been excluded from families if she had not provided normal explanations of her groans moans voices lights and wandering figures  the ghosthunt in the castle finally brings julia to a door whose bolts strengthened by desperation she forced back  there was a middleaged lady in the room who after steadily gazing on julia suddenly exclaimed my daughter and fainted away  julia being about seventeen and madame mazzini her mamma having been immured for fifteen years we observe in this recognition the force of the maternal instinct  the wicked marquis was poisoned by the partner of his iniquities who anon stabbed herself with a poniard  the virtuous julia marries the chaste hippolytus and says the author in reviewing this story we perceive a singular and striking instance of moral retribution  we also remark the futility of locking up an inconvenient wife fabled to be defunct in ones own country house  had mr rochester in jane eyre studied the sicilian romance he would have shunned an obsolete system inconvenient at best and apt in the long run to be disastrous  in the romance of the forest 1791 mrs radcliffe remained true to mr stanley weymans favourite period the end of the sixteenth century but there are no historical characters or costumes in the story and all the persons as far as language and dress go might have been alive in 1791  the story runs thus one de la motte who appears to have fallen from dissipation to swindling is on the first page discovered flying from paris and the law with his wife in a carriage  lost in the dark on a moor he follows a light and enters an old lonely house  he is seized by ruffians locked in and expects to be murdered which he knows that he cannot stand for he is timid by nature  in fact a ruffian puts a pistol to la mottes breast with one hand while with the other he drags along a beautiful girl of eighteen  swear that you will convey this girl where i may never see her more exclaims the bully and la motte with the young lady is taken back to his carriage  if you return within an hour you will be welcomed with a brace of bullets is the ruffians parting threat  so la motte madame la motte and the beautiful girl drive away la mottes one desire being to find a retreat safe from the police of an offended justice  is this not a very original striking and affecting situation provocative too of the utmost curiosity  a fugitive from justice in a strange small dark ancient house is seized threatened and presented with a young and lovely female stranger  in this opening we recognise the hand of a master genius  there must be an explanation of proceedings so highly unconventional and what can the reason be  the reader is empoigne in the first page and eagerly follows the flight of la motte also of peter his coachman an attached comic and familiar domestic  after a few days the party observe in the recesses of a gloomy forest the remains of a gothic abbey  they enter by the light of a flickering lamp they penetrate horrible recesses discover a room handsomely provided with a trapdoor and determine to reside in a dwelling so congenial though as la motte judiciously remarks not in all respects strictly gothic  after a few days la motte finds that somebody is inquiring for him in the nearest town  he seeks for a hiding place and explores the chambers under the trapdoor  here he finds in a large chestwhat do you suppose he finds  it was a human skeleton  yet in this awful vicinity he and his wife with adeline the fair stranger conceal themselves  the brave adeline when footsteps are heard and a figure is beheld in the upper rooms accosts the stranger  his keen eye presently detects the practicable trapdoor he raises it and the cowering la motte recognises in the dreaded visitorhis own son who had sought him out of filial affection  already madame la motte has become jealous of adeline especially as her husband is oddly melancholy and apt to withdraw into a glade where he mysteriously disappears into the recesses of a genuine gothic sepulchre this to the watchful eyes of a wife is proof of faithlessness on the part of a husband  as the son louis really falls in love with adeline madame la motte becomes doubly unkind to her and adeline now composes quantities of poems to night to sunset to the nocturnal gale and so on  in this uncomfortable situation two strangers arrive in a terrific thunderstorm  one is young the other is a marquis  on seeing this nobleman la mottes limbs trembled and a ghastly paleness overspread his countenance  the marquis was little less agitated and was at first decidedly hostile  la motte implored forgivenessfor whatand the marquis who in fact owned the abbey and had a shooting lodge not far off was mollified  they all became rather friendly and adeline asked la motte about the stories of hauntings and a murder said to have been at some time committed in the abbey  la motte said that the marquis could have no connection with such fables still there was the skeleton  meanwhile adeline had conceived a flame for theodore the young officer who accompanied his colonel the marquis on their first visit to the family  theodore who returned her passion had vaguely warned her of an impending danger and then had failed to keep tryst with her one evening and had mysteriously disappeared  then unhappy adeline dreamed about a prisoner a dying man a coffin a voice from the coffin and the appearance within it of the dying man amidst torrents of blood  the chamber in which she saw these visions was most vividly represented  next day the marquis came to dinner and though reluctantly consented to pass the night adeline therefore was put in a new bedroom  disturbed by the wind shaking the mouldering tapestry she found a concealed door behind the arras and a suite of rooms one of which was the chamber of her dream  on the floor lay a rusty dagger  the bedstead being touched crumbled and disclosed a small roll of manuscripts  they were not washing bills like those discovered by catherine morland in northanger abbey  returning to her own chamber adeline heard the marquis professing to la motte a passion for herself  conceive her horror  silence then reigned till all was sudden noise and confusion the marquis flying in terror from his room and insisting on instant departure  his emotion was powerfully displayed  what had occurred  mrs radcliffe does not say but horror whether caused by a conscience ill at ease or by events of a terrific and supernatural kind is plainly indicated  in daylight the marquis audaciously pressed his unholy suit and even offered marriage a hollow mockery for he was well known to be already a married man  the scenes of adelines flight capture retention in an elegant villa of the licentious noble renewed flight rescue by theodore with theodores arrest and wounding of the tyrannical marquis are all of breathless interest  mrs radcliffe excels in narratives of romantic escapes a topic always thrilling when well handled  adeline herself is carried back to the abbey but la motte who had rather not be a villain if he could avoid it enables her again to secure her freedom  he is clearly in the power of the marquis and his life has been unscrupulous but he retains traces of better things  adeline is now secretly conveyed to a peaceful valley in savoy the home of the honest peter the coachman who accompanies her  here she learns to know and value the family of la luc the kindred of her theodore by a romantic coincidence and in the adorable scenery of savoy she throws many a ballad to the moon  la motte on the discovery of adelines flight was cast into prison by the revengeful marquis for in fact soon after settling in the abbey it had occurred to la motte to commence highwayman  his very first victim had been the marquis and during his mysterious retreats to a tomb in a glade in the forest he had in short been contemplating his booty jewels which he could not convert into ready money  consequently when the marquis first entered the abbey la motte had every reason for alarm and only pacified the vindictive aristocrat by yielding to his cruel schemes against the virtue of adeline  happily for la motte a witness appeared at his trial who cast a lurid light on the character of the marquis  that villain to be plain had murdered his elder brother the skeleton of the abbey and had been anxious to murder it was added his own natural daughterthat is adeline  his hired felons however placed her in a convent and later rather than kill her on which the marquis insisted simply thrust her into the hands of la motte who happened to pass by that way as we saw in the opening of this romance  thus in making love to adeline his daughter the marquis was unconsciously in an awkward position  on further examination of evidence however things proved otherwise adeline was not the natural daughter of the marquis but his niece the legitimate daughter and heiress of his brother the skeleton of the abbey  the ms found by adeline in the room of the rusty dagger added documentary evidence for it was a narrative of the sufferings of her father later the skeleton written by him in the abbey where he was imprisoned and stabbed and where his bones were discovered by la motte the hasty nocturnal flight of the marquis from the abbey is thus accounted for he had probably been the victim of a terrific hallucination representing his murdered brother whether it was veridical or merely subjective mrs radcliffe does not decide  rather than face the outraged justice of his country the marquis after these revelations took poison  la motte was banished and adeline now mistress of the abbey removed the paternal skeleton to the vault of his ancestors  theodore and adeline were united and virtuously resided in a villa on the beautiful banks of the lake of geneva  such is the romance of the forest a fiction in which character is subordinate to plot and incident  there is an attempt at character drawing in la motte and in his wife the hero and heroine are not distinguishable from julia and hippolytus  but mrs radcliffe does not aim at psychological niceties and we must not blame her for withholding what it was no part of her purpose to give  the romance of the forest was so far infinitely the most thrilling of modern english works of fiction  every reader felt the force says scott from the sage in his study to the family group in middle life and nobody felt it more than scott himself then a young gentleman of nineteen who when asked how his time was employed answered i read no civil law  he did read mrs radcliffe and in the betrothed followed her example in the story of the haunted chamber where the heroine faces the spectre attached to her ancient family  the mysteries of udolpho mrs radcliffes next and most celebrated work is not in the judgment of this reader at least her masterpiece the booksellers paid her what scott erroneously calls the unprecedented sum of 500 pounds for the romance and they must have made a profitable bargain  the public says scott rushed upon it with all the eagerness of curiosity and rose from it with unsated appetite  i arise with a thoroughly sated appetite from the mysteries of udolpho the book as sir walter saw is the romance of the forest raised to a higher power  we have a similar and similarly situated heroine cruelly detached from her young man and immured in a howling wilderness of a brigand castle in the apennines  in place of the marquis is a miscreant on a larger and more ferocious scale  the usual mysteries of voices lights secret passages and innumerable doors are provided regardless of economy  the great question which i shall not answer is what did the black veil conceal  not the bones of laurentina as catherine morland supposed  here is emilys adventure with the veil  she paused again and then with a timid hand lifted the veil but instantly let it fallperceiving that what it had concealed was no picture and before she could leave the chamber she dropped senseless on the floor  when she recovered her recollection    horror occupied her mind  countless mysteries coagulate around this veil and the reader is apt to be disappointed when the awful curtain is withdrawn  but he has enjoyed for several hundred pages the pleasures of anticipation  a pedantic censor may remark that while the date of the story is 1580 all the virtuous people live in an idyllic fashion like creatures of rousseau existing solely for landscape and the affections writing poetry on nature animate and inanimate including the common bat and drawing in water colours  in those elegant avocations began and in these after an interval of adventures amazing horrid concluded the career of emily  mrs radcliffe keeps the many entangled threads of her complex web well in hand and incidents which puzzle you at the beginning fall naturally into place before the end  the character of the heroines silly vain unkind and unreasonable aunt is vividly designed that emily should mistake the corse of a moustached bandit for that of her aunt is an incident hard to defend  valancourt is not an ordinary spotless hero but sows his wild oats and reaps the usual harvest and annette is a good sample of the usual soubrette  when one has said that the landscapes and bandits of this romance are worthy of poussin and salvator rosa from whom they were probably translated into words not much remains to be added  sir walter after repeated perusals considered udolpho a step beyond mrs radcliffes former work high as that had justly advanced her  but he admits that persons of no mean judgment preferred the romance of the forest  with these amateurs i would be ranked  the ingenuity and originality of the romance are greater our friend the skeleton is better than that thing which was behind the black veil the escapes of adeline are more thrilling than the escape of emily and the romance is not nearly so long not nearly so prolix as udolpho  the roof and crown of mrs radcliffes work is the italian 1797 for which she received 800 pounds 6  the scene is naples the date about 1764 the topic is the thwarted loves of vivaldi and ellena the villain is the admirable schedoni the prototype of byrons lurid characters  the italian is an excellent novel  the prelude the dark and vaulted gateway is not unworthy of hawthorne who i suspect had studied mrs radcliffe  the theme is more like a theme of this world than usual  the parents of a young noble might well try to prevent him from marrying an unknown and penniless girl  the marchese vivaldi only adopts the ordinary paternal measures the marchesa and her confessor the darksouled schedoni go fartheras far as assassination  the casuistry by which schedoni brings the lady to this pass while representing her as the originator of the scheme is really subtle and the scenes between the pair show an extraordinary advance on mrs radcliffes earlier art the mysterious monk who counteracts schedoni remains an unsolved mystery to me but of that i do not complain  he is as good as the dweller in the catacombs who haunts miriam in hawthornes marble faun  the inquisition its cells and its tribunals are coloured        as when some great painter dips    his pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse  the comic valet paulo who insists on being locked up in the dungeons of the inquisition merely because his master is there reminds one of samuel weller he is a neapolitan samivel  the escapes are mrs radcliffes most exciting escapes and to say that is to say a good deal  poetry is not written or not often by the heroine  the scene in which schedoni has his dagger raised to murder ellena when he discovers that she is his daughter is of a new grand and powerful character scott while it is even more satisfactory to learn later that ellena was not schedonis daughter after all  why mrs radcliffe having reached such a pitch of success never again published a novel remains more mysterious than any of her mysteries scott justly remarks that her censors attacked her by showing that she does not possess the excellences proper to a style of composition totally different from that which she has attempted  this is the usual way of reviewers  tales that fascinated scott fox and sheridan which possess charms for the learned and unlearned the grave and gay the gentleman and clown do not deserve to be dismissed with a sneer by people who have never read them  following horace walpole in some degree mrs radcliffe paved the way for scott byron maturin lewis and charlotte bronte just as miss burney filled the gap between smollett and miss austen  mrs radcliffe in short kept the lamp of romance burning much more steadily than the lamps which in her novels are always blown out in the moment of excited apprehension by the night wind walking in the dank corridors of haunted abbeys  but mark the cruelty of an intellectual parent  horace walpole was mrs radcliffes father in the spirit  yet on september 4 1794 he wrote to lady ossory i have read some of the descriptive verbose tales of which your ladyship says i was the patriarch by several mothers miss reeve and mrs radcliffe  all i can say for myself is that i do not think my concubines have produced issue more natural for excluding the aid of anything marvellous     chapter vii a scottish romanticist of 1830   the finding of a rare book that you have wanted long is one of the happier moments in life  whatever we may think of life when we contemplate it as a whole it is a delight to discover what one has sought for years especially if the book be a book which you really want to read and not a thing whose value is given by the fashion of collecting  perhaps nobody ever collected before     the    deathwake or lunacy    a necromaunt     in three chimeras     by thomas t stoddart     ist like that lead contains her    it were too gross    to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave    shakespeare     edinburgh    printed for henry constable edinburgh    and hurst chance  co london     mdcccxxxi  this is my rare book and it is rare for an excellent good reason as will be shown  but first of the author  mr thomas tod stoddart was born in 1810  he died in 1880  through all his pilgrimage of threescore years and ten his rod and staff did comfort him as the scottish version of the psalms has it nay his staff was his rod  he was an angler as he remarked when a friend asked well tom what are you doing now  he was the patriarch the father izaak of scottish fishers and he sleeps according to his desire like scott within hearing of the tweed  his memoir published by his daughter in stoddarts angling songs blackwood is an admirable biography quo fit ut omnis votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella vita senis  but it is with the young tom stoddart the poet of twenty not with the old angling sage that we have to do  miss stoddart has discreetly republished only the angling songs of her father the pick of them being classical in their way  now as mr arnold writes     two desires toss about       the poets feverish blood    one drives him to the world without       and one to solitude  the young stoddarts two desires were poetry and fishing  he began with poetry  at the age of ten his whole desire was to produce an immortal tragedy    blood and battle were the powers with which he worked and with no meaner tool  every other dramatic form he despised  it is curious to think of the schoolboy the born romanticist labouring at these things while gerard de nerval and victor hugo and theophile gautier and petrus borel were boys alsoboys of the same ambitions and with much the same romantic tastes  stoddart had luckily another love besides the muse  with the spring and the may fly the dagger dipped in gore paled before the supple rod and the dainty midge  finally the rod and midge prevailed     wee dourlooking hooks are the thing    mouse body and laverock wing  but before he quite abandoned all poetry save fishing ditties he wrote and published the volume whose titlepage we have printed the death wake  the lad who drove home from an angling expedition in a hearse had an odd way of combining his amusements  he lived among poets and critics who were anglershogg the ettrick shepherd who cast but a heavy line they say in yarrow aytoun christopher north de quincey     no fisher    but a wellwisher    to the game  as scott has itthese were his companions older or younger  none of these certainly not wilson nor hogg nor aytoun were friends of the romantic school as illustrated by keats and shelley  none of them probably knew much of gautier de nerval borel le lycanthrope and the other boys in that boyish movement of 1830  it was only stoddart unconsciously in sympathy with paris and censured by his literary friends who produced the one british romantic work of 1830  the title itself shows that he was partly laughing at his own performance he has the mockery of les jeunes france in him as well as the wormy and obituary joys of la comedie de la mort  the little book came out inspired by all the poetasters  christopher north wrote four years later in blackwoods magazine a tardy review  he styled it an ingeniously absurd poem with an ingeniously absurd title written in a strange nambypamby sort of style between the weakest of shelley and the strongest of barry cornwall  the book fell dead from the press far more dead than omar khayyam  nay misfortune pursued it miss stoddart kindly informs me and it was doomed to the flames  the remainder the bulk of the edition was returned to the poet in sheets and by him was deposited in a garret  the family had a cook one betty a descendant perhaps of that unhappy betty or elizabeth barnes cook of mr warburton somerset herald who burned among other quartos shakespeares henry i henry ii and king stephen  true to her inherited instincts mr stoddarts betty slowly relentlessly through forty years used the death wake for the needs and processes of her art  the whole of the edition except probably a few presentation copies perished in the kitchen  as for that fell cook let us hope that     the biblioclastic dead       have diverse pains to brook    they break afflictions bread       with betty barnes the cook  as the author of the bird bride sings  miss stoddart had just informed me of this disaster which left one almost hopeless of ever owning a copy of the death wake when i found a brown paper parcel among many that contained todays minor poetry with the authors compliments and lo in this unpromising parcel was the longsought volume  ever since one was a small boy reading stoddarts scottish angler and old blackwoods one had pined for a sight of the necromaunt and here clean in its pure purple mantle of smooth cloth lay the desired one     like dians kiss unasked unsought    it gave itself and was not bought  being indeed the discovery and gift of a friend who fishes and studies the lacustrine muses  the copy has a peculiar interest it once belonged to aytoun the writer of the scottish cavaliers of the bon gaultier ballads and of firmilian the scourge of the spasmodic school  mr aytoun has adorned the margins with notes and with caricatures of skulls and crossbones while the flyleaves bear a sonnet to the author and a lyric in doggerel  surely this is indeed a literary curiosity  the sonnet runs thus     o wormy thomas stoddart who inheritest       rich thoughts and loathsome nauseous words and rare    tell me my friend why is it that thou ferretest       and gropest in each deathcorrupted lair    seekst thou for maggots such as have affinity       with those in thine own brain or dost thou think       that all is sweet which hath a horrid stink    why dost thou make hautgout thy sole divinity    here is enough of genius to convert       vile dung to precious diamonds and to spare    then why transform the diamond into dirt       and change thy mind which should be rich and fair    into a medley of creations foul    as if a seraph would become a ghoul  no doubt mr stoddarts other passion for angling in which he used a scottish latitude concerning bait 7 impelled him to search for worms and maggots     fire and faggots    worms and maggots  as aytoun writes on the other flyleaf are indeed the matter of the death wake  then why some one may ask write about the death wake at all  why rouse again the nightmare of a boy of twenty  certainly i am not to say that the death wake is a pearl of great price but it does contain passages of poetryof poetry very curious because it is full of the new note the new melody which young mr tennyson was beginning to waken  it anticipates beddoes it coincides with gautier and les chimeres of gerard it answers the accents then unheard in england of poe  some american who read out of the way things and was not too scrupulous recognised and robbed a brother in tom stoddart  eleven years after the death wake appeared in england it was published in grahams magazine as agatha a necromaunt in three chimeras by louis fitzgerald tasistro  now poe was closely connected with grahams magazine and after arthur gordon pym louis fitzgerald tasistro does suggest edgar allen poe  but poe was not tasistro  so much for the literary history of the lunacy  the poem beginschimera i begins     an anthem of a sister choristry    and like a windward murmur of the sea    oer silver shells so solemnly it falls  the anthem accompanies a procession of holy fathers towards a bier           agathe    was on the lida name  and who  no more    twas only agathe  a solitary monk is prowling around in the moonlit cathedral he has a brow of stony marble he has raven hair and he falters out the name of agathe  he has said adieu to that fair one and to her sister peace that lieth in her grave  he has loved and loves the silent agathe  he was the son of a crusader           and julio had fain    have been a warrior but his very brain    grew fevered at the sickly thought of death    and to be stricken with a want of breath  on the whole he did well not to enter the service  mr aytoun has here writtena rum cove for a hussar           and he would say    a curse be on their laurels          and anon    was julio forgotten and his line    no wonder for this frenzied tale of mine  how asks aytoun nor has the grammatical enigma yet been unriddled     oh he was wearied of this passing scene    but loved not death his purpose was between    life and the grave and it would vibrate there    like a wild bird that floated far and fair    betwixt the sun and sea  so he became monk and was sorry he had done so especially when he met a pretty maid     and this was agathe young agathe    a motherless fair girl  whose father was a kind of dombey for        when she smiled    he bade no fathers welcome to the child    but even told his wish and willd it done    for her to be sadhearted and a nun  so she took the dreary veil  they met like a blighted isabella and lorenzo     they met many a time    in the lone chapels after vesper chime    they met in love and fear  then one day           he heard it said    poor julio thy agathe is dead  she died     like to a star within the twilight hours    of morning and she was not  some have thought    the lady abbess gave her a mad draught  here mr aytoun with sympathy writes damn her the lady abbess that is and suggests that thought must be read thaft  through the arras of the gloom arras is good the pale breezes are moaning and julio is wan as stars unseen for paleness  however he lifts the tombstone as it were lightsome as a summer gladness  a summer gladness remarks mr aytoun may possibly weigh about halfan ounce  julio came on a skull a haggard one in the grave and mr aytoun kindly designs a skeleton ringing a bell and crying dust ho  now go and give your poems to your friends  finally julio unburies agathe        thou must go    my sweet betrothed with me but not below    where there is darkness dream and solitude    but where is light and life and one to brood    above thee till thou wakest  ha i fear    thou wilt not wake for ever sleeping here    where there are none but the winds to visit thee    and convent fathers and a choristry    of sisters saying hush  but i will sing    rare songs to thy pure spirit wandering    down on the dews to hear me i will tune    the instrument of the ethereal moon    and all the choir of stars to rise and fall    in harmony and beauty musical  is this not melodious madness and is this picture of the distraught priest setting forth to sail the seas with his dead lady not an invention that nanteuil might have illustrated and the clan of bousingots approved  the second chimera opens nobly     a curse a curse 8 the beautiful pale wing    of a seabird was worn with wandering    and on a sunny rock beside the shore    it stood the golden waters gazing oer    and they were nearing a brown amber flow    of weeds that glittered gloriously below  julio appears with agathe in his arms and what ensues is excellent of its kind     he dropt upon a rock and by him placed    over a bed of seapinks growing waste    the silent ladye and he mutterd wild    strange words about a mother and no child    and i shall wed thee agathe although    ours be no godblest bridaleven so    and from the sand he took a silver shell    that had been wasted by the fall and swell    of many a moonborne tide into a ring    a rude rude ring it was a snowwhite thing    where a lone hermit limpet slept and died    in ages far away  thou art a bride    sweet agathe  wake up we must not linger    he pressd the ring upon her chilly finger    and to the seabird on its sunny stone    shouted pale priest that liest all alone    upon thy ocean altar rise away    to our glad bridal and its wings of gray    all lazily it spread and hoverd by    with a wild shrieka melancholy cry    then swooping slowly oer the heaving breast    of the blue ocean vanished in the west  julio sang a mad song of a mad priest to a dead maid            a rosary of stars love a prayer as we glide    and a whisper on the wind and a murmur on the tide    and well say a fair adieu to the flowers that are seen    with shells of silver sown in radiancy between     a rosary of stars love the purest they shall be    like spirits of pale pearls in the bosom of the sea    now help thee 9 virgin mother with a blessing as we go    upon the laughing waters that are wandering below  one can readily believe that poe admired this musical sad song if indeed he ever saw the poem  one may give too many extracts and there is scant room for the extraordinary witchery of the midnight sea and sky where the dead and the distraught drift wandering     and the great ocean like the holy hall    where slept a seraph host maritimal    was gorgeous with wings of diamond  it was a sea     of radiant and moonbreasted emerald  there follows another song     tis light to love thee living girl when hope is full and fair    in the springtide of thy beauty when there is no sorrow there    no sorrow on thy brow and no shadow on thy heart    when like a floating seabird bright and beautiful thou art            but when the brow is blighted like a star at morning tide    and faded is the crimson blush upon the cheek beside    it is to love as seldom love the brightest and the best    when our love lies like a dew upon the one that is at rest  we ought to distrust our own admiration of what is rare odd novel to us found by us in a sense and especially one must distrust ones liking for the verses of a tweedside angler of a poet whose forebears lie in the green kirkyard of yarrow  but allowing for all this i cannot but think these very musical accomplished and in their place appropriate verses to have been written by a boy of twenty  nor is it a common imagination though busy in this vulgar field of horrors that lifts the pallid bride to look upon the mirror of the sea     and bids her gaze into the startled sea    and says thine image from eternity    hath come to meet thee ladye and anon    he bade the cold corse kiss the shadowy one    that shook amid the waters  the picture of the madness of thirst allied to the disease of the brain is extremely powerful the delirious monk tells the salt sea waves     that ye have power and passion and a sound    as of the flying of an angel round    the mighty world that ye are one with time  here i cant but think is imagination  mr aytoun however noted none of those passages nor that where in tempest and thunder a shipwrecked sailor swims to the strange boat sees the living love and the dead and falls back into the trough of the wave but even the friendly pencil of bon gaultier approves the passage where an isle rises above the sea and the boat is lightly stranded on the shore of pure and silver shells  the horrors of corruption in the third chimera may be left unquoted aytoun parodies     the chalk the chalk the cheese the cheese the cheeses    and straightway dropped he down upon his kneeses  julio comes back to reason hates the dreadful bride and feeds on limpets by the mass he feasteth well  there was a holy hermit on the isle     i ween like other hermits so was he  he is agathes father and he has retired to an eligible island where he may repent his cruelty to his daughter  julio tells his tale and goes mad again  the apostrophe to lunacy which follows is marked beautiful by aytoun and is in the spirit of charles lambs remark that madness has pleasures unknown to the sane           thou art thou art alone    a pure pure being but the god on high    is with thee ever as thou goest by  julio watches again beside the dead till morning comes bringing     a murmur far and far of those that stirred    within the great encampment of the sea  the tide sweeps the mad and the dead down the shores  he perished in a dream  as for the hermit he buried them not knowing who they were but on a later day found and recognised the golden cross of agathe     for long ago he gave that blessed cross    to his fair girl and knew the relic still  so the hermit died of remorse and one cannot say with walton and i hope the reader is sorry  the other poems are vague memories of shelley or anticipations of poe one of them is curiously styled her a statue and contains a passage that reminds us of a rubaiyat of omars           she might see    a lovewingd seraph glide in glory by    striking the tent of its mortality     but that is but a tent wherein may rest    a sultan to the realm of death addrest    the sultan rises and the dark ferrash    strikes and prepares it for another guest  most akin to poe is the hymn to orion     dost thou in thy vigil hail    arcturus on his chariot pale    leading him with a fiery flight    over the hollow hill of night  this then is a hasty sketch and incomplete of a book which perhaps is only a curiosity but which i venture to think gave promise of a poet  where is the lad of twenty who has written as well todaynay where is the mature person of forty  there was a wind of poetry abroad in 1830 blowing over the barricades of paris breathing by the sedges of cam stirring the heather on the hills of yarrow  hugo mr browning lord tennyson caught the breeze in their sails and were borne adown the tigris of romance  but the breath that stirred the loch where tom stoddart lay and mused in his boat soon became to him merely the curl on the waters of lone st marys or loch skene and he began casting over the great uneducated trout of a happier time forgetful of the muse  he wrote another piece with a sonorous and delightful title ajalon of the winds  where is ajalon of the winds  miss stoddart knows nothing of it but i fancy that the thriceloathed betty could have told a tale     malim convivis qvam placvisse coqvis  we need not perhaps regret that mr stoddart withdrew from the struggles and competitions of poetic literature  no very high place no very glorious crown one fancies would have been his  his would have been anxiety doubt of self disappointment or if he succeeded the hatred and envyings and lies which even then dogged the steps of the victor  it was better to be quiet and go afishing     sorrow sorrow speed away       to our anglers quiet mound    with the old pilgrim twilight gray       enter through the holy ground    there he sleeps whose heart is twined       with wild stream and wandering burn    wooer of the western wind       watcher of the april morn     chapter viii the confessions of saint augustine   my copy of the confessions is a dark little book a size uncumbersome to the nicest hand in the format of an elzevir bound in black morocco and adorned with blindtooled that is ungilt skulls and crossbones it has lost the titlepage with the date but retains the frontispiece engraved by huret  saint augustine in his mitre and other episcopal array with a quill in his hand sits under a flood of inspiring sunshine  the dumpy book has been much read was at some time the property of mr john philips and bears one touching manuscript note of which more hereafter  it is i presume a copy of the translation by sir toby matthew  the author of the preface declares with truth that the translator hath consulted so closely and earnestly with the saint that he seemeth to have lighted his torch att his fire and to speak in the best and most significant english what and how he would have done had he understood our language  there can be no better english version of this famous book in which saint augustine tells the story of his eager and passionate youtha youth tossed about by the contending tides of love human and divine reading it today with a mundane curiosity we may half regret the space which he gives to theological metaphysics and his brief tantalising glimpses of what most interests us nowthe common life of men when the church was becoming mistress of the world when the old religions were dying of allegory and moral interpretations and occult dreams  but even so saint augustines interest in himself in the very obscure origins of each human existence in the psychology of infancy and youth in school disputes and magical pretensions his ardent affections his exultations and his faults make his memoirs immortal among the unveilings of the spirit  he has studied babies that he may know his dark beginnings and the seeds of grace and of evil  then by degrees i began to find where i was and i had certain desires to declare my will to those by whom it might be executed  but i could not do it    therefore would i be tossing my arms and sending out certain cryes    and when they obeyed me not    i would fall into a rage and that not against such as were my subjects or servants but against my elders and my betters and i would revenge myself upon them by crying  he has observed that infants begin to laugh first sleeping and then shortly waking a curious note but he does not ask wherefore the sense of humour or the expression of it comes to children first in their slumber  of what do babies dream  and what do the nested swallows chirrup to each other in their sleep  such have i understood that such infants are as i could know and such have i been told that i was by them who brought me up though even they may rather be accounted not to know than to know these things  one thing he knows that even infancy is subject to sin  from the womb we are touched with evil  myselfe have seene and observed some little child who could not speake and yet he was all in an envious kind of wrath looking pale with a bitter countenance upon his fosterbrother in an envious kind of wrath  is it not the motive of half our politics and too much of our criticism  such is mans inborn nature not to be cured by laws or reforms not to be washed out of his veins though blood be shed like rain and tears like a mist  for an infant cannot endure a companion to feed with him in a fountain of milk which is richly abounding and overflowing although that companion be wholly destitute and can take no other food but that  this is the original sin inherited innate unacquired for this are babes spanlong to suffer as the famous or infamous preacher declared  where or at what time was i ever innocent he cries and hears no answer from the dark backward and abysm of the prenatal life  then the saint describes a childs learning to speak how he amasses verbal tokens of things having tamed and as it were broken my mouth to the pronouncing of them  and so i began to launch out more deeply into the tempestuous traffique and society of mankind  tempestuous enough he found or made itthis child of a pagan father and a christian saint monica the saint of motherhood  the past generations had chalked out certain laborious ways of learning and perhaps saint augustine never forgave the flogging pedagoguethe plagosus orbilius of his boyhood  long before his day he had found out that the sorrows of children and their joys are no less serious than the sorrows of mature age  is there lord any man of so great a mind that he can think lightly of those racks and hooks and other torments for the avoiding whereof men pray unto thee with great fear from one end of the world to the other as that he can make sport at such as doe most sharply inflict these things upon them as our parents laughed at the torments which we children susteyned at our masters hands  can we suppose that monica laughed or was it only the heathen father who approved of roughing it being yet a childe i began to beg thy ayde and succour and i did loosen the knots of my tongue in praying thee and i begged being yet a little one with no little devotion that i might not be beaten at the schoole  one is reminded of tom tulliver who gave up even praying that he might learn one part of his work please make mr  say that i am not to do mathematics  the saint admits that he lacked neither memory nor wit but he took delight in playing  the plays and toys of men are called business yet when children fall unto them the same men punish them  yet the schoolmaster was more fed upon by rage if beaten in any little question of learning than the boy if in any match at ball i had been maistered by one of my playfellows  he aspired proudly to be victorious in the matches which he made and i seriously regret to say that he would buy a match and pay his opponent to lose when he could not win fairly  he liked romances also to have myne eares scratched with lying fablesa lazy idle boy like him who dallied with rebecca and rowena in the holidays of charter house  saint augustine like sir walter scott at the university of edinburgh was the greek dunce  both of these great men to their sorrow and loss absolutely and totally declined to learn greek  but what the reason was why i hated the greeke language while i was taught it being a child i do not yet understand  the saint was far from being alone in that distaste and he who writes loathed greek like poisontill he came to homer  latin the saint loved except when reading writing and casting of accounts was taught in latin which i held not for lesse paynefull or penal than the very greeke  i wept for didos death who made herselfe away with the sword he declares and even so the saying that two and two makes foure was an ungrateful song in mine ears whereas the wooden horse full of armed men the burning of troy and the very ghost of creusa was a most delightful spectacle of vanity  in short the saint was a regular boya highspirited clever sportive and wilful creature  he was as fond as most boys of the mythical tales and for that i was accounted to be a towardly boy  meanwhile he does not record that monica disliked his learning the foolish dear old heathen fablesthat flood of hell  boyhood gave place to youth and allowing for the vanity of selfaccusation there can be little doubt that the youth of saint augustine was une jeunesse orageuse  and what was that wherein i took delight but to love and to be beloved  there was ever much sentiment and affection in his amours but his soul could not distinguish the beauty of chast love from the muddy darkness of lust  streams of them did confusedly boyl in mein his african veins  with a restless kind of weariness he pursued that other self of the platonic dream neglecting the love of god     oh how late art thou come o my joy  the course of his educationfor the bar as we should saycarried him from home to carthage where he rapidly forgot the pure counsels of his mother as old wifes consailes  and we delighted in doing ill not only for the pleasure of the fact but even for the affection of prayse even monica it seems justified the saying     every woman is at heart a rake  marriage would have been his making saint augustine says but she desired not even that so very much lest the cloggs of a wife might have hindered her hopes of me    in the meantime the reins were loosed to me beyond reason  yet the sin which he regrets most bitterly was nothing more dreadful than the robbery of an orchard  pears he had in plenty none the less he went with a band of roisterers and pillaged another mans pear tree  i loved the sin not that which i obtained by the same but i loved the sin itself  there lay the sting of it  they were not even unusually excellent pears  a peare tree ther was neere our vineyard heavy loaden with fruite which tempted not greatly either the sight or tast  to the shaking and robbing thereof certaine most wicked youthes whereof i was one went late at night  we carried away huge burthens of fruit from thence not for our owne eating but to be cast before the hoggs  oh moonlit night of africa and orchard by these wild seabanks where once dido stood oh laughter of boys among the shaken leaves and sound of falling fruit how do you live alone out of so many nights that no man remembers  for carthage is destroyed indeed and forsaken of the sea yet that one hour of summer is to be unforgotten while man has memory of the story of his past  nothing of this to be sure is in the mind of the saint but a long remorse for this great sin which he earnestly analyses  nor is he so penitent but that he is clearsighted and finds the spring of his mis doing in the sense of humour  it was a delight and laughter which tickled us even at the very hart to find that we were upon the point of deceiving them who feared no such thing from us and who if they had known it would earnestly have procured the contrary  saint augustine admits that he lived with a fast set as people say nowthe depravers or destroyers though he loved them little whose actions i ever did abhor that is their destruction of others amongst whom i yet lived with a kind of shameless bashfulness  in short the hellfire club of that day numbered a reluctant saint among its members  it was no christian gospel but the hortensius of cicero which won him from this perilous society  it altered my affection and made me address my prayers to thee o lord and gave me other desires and purposes than i had before  all vain hopes did instantly grow base in myne eyes and i did with an incredible heat of hart aspire towards the immortality of wisdom  thus it was really saint tully and not the mystic call of tolle lege that converted augustine diverting the current of his life into the channel of righteousness  how was i kindled then oh my god with a desire to fly from earthly things towards thee  there now remained only the choice of a road  saint augustine dates his own conversion from the day of his turning to the strait christian orthodoxy  even the platonic writings had he known greek would not have satisfied his desire  for where was that charity that buildeth upon the foundation of humility which is christ jesus    these pages of the platonists carried not in them this countenance of pietythe tears of confession and that sacrifice of thine which is an afflicted spirit a contrite and humbled heart the salvation of thy people the spouse the city the pledge of thy holy spirit the cup of our redemption  no man doth there thus express himself  shall not my soul be subject to god for of him is my salvation  for he is my god and my salvation my protectour i shall never be moved  no man doth there once call and say to him come unto me all you that labour  the heathen doctors had not the grace which saint augustine instinctively knew he lackedthe grace of humility nor the comfort that is not from within but from without  to these he aspired let us follow him on the path by which he came within their influence but let us not forget that the guide on the way to the city was kind clever wordy vain old marcus tullius cicero  it is to the city that all our faces should be set if we knew what belongs to our peace thither we cast fond hopeless backward glances even if we be of those whom tertullian calls saint satans penitents  here in augustine we meet a man who found the pathone of the few who have found it of the few who have won that love which is our only rest  it may be worth while to follow him to the journeys end  the treatise of cicero then inflamed augustine to the loving and seeking and finding and holding and inseparably embracing of wisdom itself wheresoever it was  yet when he looked for wisdom in the christian scriptures all the literary man the rhetorician in him was repelled by the simplicity of the style  without going further than mr paters book marius the epicurean and his account of apuleius an english reader may learn what kind of style a learned african of that date found not too simple  but cicero rather than apuleius was augustines ideal that verbose and sonorous eloquence captivated him as it did the early scholars when learning revived  augustine had dallied a little with the sect of the manichees which appears to have grieved his mother more than his wild life  but she was comforted by a vision when she found herself in a wood and met a glorious young man who informed her that where she was there should her son be also  curious it is to think that this very semblance of a glorious young man haunts the magical dreams of heathen red indians advising them where they shall find game and was beheld in such ecstasies by john tanner a white man who lived with the indians and adopted their religion  the greeks would have called this appearance hermes even in this guise odysseus met him in the oak wood of circes isle  but augustine was not yet in his mothers faith he still taught and studied rhetoric contending for its prizes but declining to be aided by a certain wizard of his acquaintance  he had entered as a competitor for a tragicall poeme but was too sportsmanlike to seek victory by art necromantic  yet he followed after astrologers because they used no sacrifices and did not pretend to consult spirits  even the derision of his dear friend nebridius could not then move him from those absurd speculations  his friend died and his whole heart was darkened mine eyes would be looking for him in all places but they found him not and i hated all things because they told me no news of him  he fell into an extreme weariness of life and no less fear of death  he lived but by halves having lost dimidium animae suae and yet dreaded death lest he might chance to have wholy dyed whome i extremely loved  so he returned to carthage for change and sought pleasure in other friendships but blessed is the man that loves thee and his friend in thee and his enemy for thee  for he only never loseth a dear friend to whom all men are dear for his sake who is never lost  here on the margin of the old book beside these thoughts so beautiful if so helpless like all words to console some reader long dead has written     pray for your poor servant j m  and again     pray for your poor friend  doubtless some catholic reader himself bereaved is imploring the prayers of a dear friend dead and sure we need their petitions more than they need ours who have left this world of temptation and are at peace  after this loss saint augustine went to rome his ambition urging him perhaps but more his disgust with the violent and riotous life of students in carthage  to leave his mother was difficult but i lyed to my mother yea such a mother and so escaped from her  and now he had a dangerous sickness and afterwards betook himself to converse with the orthodox for example at milan with saint ambrose  in milan his mother would willingly have continued in the african rituala pagan survivalcarrying wine and food to the graves of the dead but this saint ambrose forbade and she obeyed him for him she did extremely affect for the regard of my spirituall good  from milan his friend alipius preceded him to rome and there was damnably delighted with the gladiatorial combats being made drunk with a delight in blood  augustine followed him to rome and there lost the girl of his heart so that my heart was wounded as that the very blood did follow  the lady had made a vow of eternal chastity having left me with a son by her  but he fell to a new love as the old one was departed and yet the ancient wound pained him still after a more desperate and dogged manner  haeret letalis arundo  by these passions his conversion was delayed the carnal and spiritual wills fighting against each other within him  give me chastity and continency o lord he would pray but do not give it yet and perhaps this is the frankest of the confessions of saint augustine  in the midst of this war of the spirit and the flesh behold i heard a voyce as if it had been of some boy or girl from some house not farre off uttering and often repeating these words in a kind of singing voice     tolle lege tolle lege    take up and read take up and read  so he took up a testament and opening it at random after the manner of his virgilian lots read  not in surfeiting and wantonness not in causality and uncleanness with what follows  neither would i read any further neither was there any cause why i should  saint augustine does not perhaps mean us to understand as his translator does that he was miraculously called he knew what was right perfectly well before the text only clinched a resolve which he has found it very hard to make  perhaps there was a trifle of superstition in the matter  we never know how superstitious we are  at all events henceforth i neither desired a wife nor had i any ambitious care of any worldly thing  he told his mother and monica rejoiced believing that now her prayers were answered  such is the story of the conversion of saint augustine  it was the maturing of an old purpose and long deferred  much stranger stories are told of bunyan and colonel gardiner  he gave up rhetoric another man was engaged to sell words to the students of milan  being now converted the saint becomes less interesting except for his account of his mothers death and of that ecstatic converse they held she and i alone leaning against a window which had a prospect upon the garden of our lodging at ostia  they     came on that which is and heard    the vast pulsations of the world  and whilest we thus spake and panted towards the divine we grew able to take a little taste thereof with the whole strife of our hearts and we sighed profoundly and left there confined the very top and flower of our souls and spirits and we returned to the noyse of language again where words are begun and ended  then monica fell sick to death and though she had ever wished to lie beside her husband in africa she said lay this body where you will let not any care of it disquiet you only this i entreat that you will remember me at the altar of the lord wheresoever you be  but upon the ninth day of her sickness in the sixandfiftieth year of her age and the threeandthirtieth of mine that religious and pious soul was discharged from the prison of her body  the grief of augustine was not less keen it seems than it had been at the death of his friend  but he could remember how she related with great dearness of affection how she never heard any harsh or unkind word to be darted out of my mouth against her  and to this consolation was added who knows what of confidence and tenderness of certain hope or a kind of deadness perhaps that may lighten the pain of a heart very often tried and inured to every pain  for it is certain that this green wound was green and grievous for a briefer time than the agony of his earlier sorrows  he himself so earnest in analysing his own emotions is perplexed by the short date of his tears and his sharpest grief let him read it who will and interpret it as it pleaseth him  so with the death of monica we may leave saint augustine  the most human of books the confessions now strays into theology  of all books that which it most oddly resembles to my fancy at least is the poems of catullus  the passion and the tender heart they have in common and in common the war of flesh and spirit the shameful inappeasable love of lesbia or of the worldly life so delightful and dear to the poet and to the saint so despised in other moods conquered and victorious again among the battles of the war in our members  the very words in which the veronese and the bishop of hippo described the pleasure and gaiety of an early friendship are almost the same and we feel that born four hundred years later the lover of lesbia the singer of sirmio might actually have found peace in religion and exchanged the earthly for the heavenly love     chapter ix smollett   the great english novelists of the eighteenth century turned the course of english literature out of its older channel  her streams had descended from the double peaks of parnassus to irrigate the enamelled fields and elegant parterres of poetry and the drama as the critics of the period might have said  but richardson fielding smollett and sterne diverted the waters from poetry and plays into the region of the novel whither they have brought down a copious alluvial deposit modern authors do little but till this fertile delta the drama is now in the desert poetry is a drug and fiction is literature  among the writers who made this revolution smollett is personally the least well known to the world despite the great part which autobiography and confessions play in his work  he is always talking about himself and introducing his own experiences  but there is little evidence from without his extant correspondence is scanty he was not in dr johnsons circle much less was he in that of horace walpole  he was not a popular man and probably he has long ceased to be a popular author  about 1780 the vendors of childrens books issued abridgments of tom jones and pamela clarissa and joseph andrews adapted to the needs of infant minds  it was a curious enterprise certainly but the booksellers do not seem to have produced every boys roderick random or peregrine pickle for the young  smollett in short is less known than fielding and sterne even thackeray says but a word about him in the english humorists and he has no place in the series of english men of letters  what we know of smollett reveals a thoroughly typical scot of his period a scot of the species absolutely opposed to sir pertinax macsycophant and rather akin to the species of robert burns  rather akin we may say for smollett like burns was a humorist and in his humour far from dainty he was a personal satirist and a satirist far from chivalrous like burns too he was a poet of independence like burns and even more than burns in a time of patronage he was recalcitrant against patrons but unlike burns he was farouche to an extreme degree and unlike burns he carried very far his prejudices about his gentrice his gentle birth  herein he is at the opposite pole from the great peasant poet  two potent characteristics of his country were at war within him  there was first the belief in gentrice in a natural difference of kind between men of coat armour and men without it  thus roderick random the starving cadet of a line of small lairds accepts the almost incredible selfdenial and devotion of strap as merely his due  prince charles could not have taken the devotion of henry goring or of neil maceachain more entirely as a matter of course involving no consideration in return than roderick took the unparalleled selfsacrifice of his barber friend and schoolmate  scott has remarked on this contemptuous and ungrateful selfishness and has contrasted it with the relations of tom jones and partridge  of course it is not to be assumed that smollett would have behaved like roderick when finding the fire in my apartment almost extinguished i vented my fury upon poor strap whose ear i pinched with such violence that he roared hideously with pain      to be sure roderick presently felt unspeakable remorse    foamed at the mouth and kicked the chairs about the room  now strap had rescued roderick from starvation had bestowed on him hundreds of pounds and had carried his baggage and dined on his leavings  but strap was not gently born  smollett would not probably have acted thus but he did not consider such conduct a thing out of nature  on the other side was smolletts scottish spirit of independence  as early as 1515 james ingles chaplain of margaret tudor wrote to adam williamson you know the use of this country    the man hath more words than the master and will not be content except he know the masters counsel  there is no order among us  strap had the instinct of feudal loyalty to a descendant of a laird  but smollett boasts that being at the time about twenty and having burdened a nobleman with his impossible play the regicide resolved to punish his barbarous indifference and actually discarded my patron  he was not given to booing in the sense of bowing but had of all known scots the most canty conceit o himsel  these qualities with a violence of temper which took the form of beating people when on his travels cannot have made smollett a popular character  he knew his faults as he shows in the dedication of ferdinand count fathom to himself  i have known you trifling superficial and obstinate in dispute meanly jealous and awkwardly reserved rash and haughty in your resentment and coarse and lowly in your connections  he could it is true on occasion forgive even where he had not been wronged and could compensate in milder moods for the fierce attacks made in hours when he was meanly jealous  yet in early life at least he regarded his own roderick random as modest and meritorious struggling nobly with the difficulties which beset a friendless orphan especially from the selfishness envy malice and base indifference of mankind  roderick himself is in fact the incarnation of the basest selfishness  in one of his adventures he is guilty of that extreme infamy which the dartagnan of the three musketeers and of the memoirs committed and for which the dartagnan of le vicomte de bragelonne took shame to himself  while engaged in a virtuous passion roderick not only behaves like a vulgar debauchee but pursues the meanest arts of the fortunehunter who is ready to marry any woman for her money  such is the modest and meritorious orphan and mankind now carries its base indifference so far that smolletts biographer mr hannay says if roderick had been hanged i for my part should have heard the tidings unmoved    smollett obviously died without realising how nearly the hero who was in some sort a portrait of himself came to being a ruffian  dr carlyle in 1758 being in london found smollett much of a humorist and not to be put out of his way  a humorist here means an overbearingly eccentric person such as smollett who lived much in a society of literary dependants was apt to become  but dr carlyle also found that though smollett described so well the characters of ruffians and profligates he did not resemble them  dr robertson the historian expressed great surprise at his polished and agreeable manners and the great urbanity of his conversation  he was handsome in person as his portrait shows but his nervous system was exceedingly irritable and subject to passion as he says in the latin account of his health which in 1763 he drew up for the physician at montpellier though when he chose he could behave like a man of breeding and though he undeniably had a warm heart for his wife and daughter he did not always choose to behave well  except dr moore his biographer he seems to have had few real friends during most of his career  as to persons whom he chose to regard as his enemies he was beyond measure rancorous and dangerous  from his first patron lord lyttelton to his last he pursued them with unscrupulous animosity  if he did not mean actually to draw portraits of his grandfather his cousins his schoolmaster and the apothecary whose gallipots he attendedin roderick randomyet he left the originals who suggested his characters in a very awkward situation  for assuredly he did entertain a spite against his grandfather and as many of the incidents in roderick random were autobiographical the public readily inferred that others were founded on fact  the outlines of smolletts career are familiar though gaps in our knowledge occur  perhaps they may partly be filled up by the aid of passages in his novels plays and poems in these at all events he describes conditions and situations through which he himself may or must have passed  born in 1721 he was a younger son of archibald a younger son of sir james smollett of bonhill a house on the now polluted leven between loch lomond and the estuary of the clyde  smolletts father made an imprudent marriage the grandfather provided a small but competent provision for him and his family during his own life  the father archibald died the grandfather left nothing to the mother of tobias and her children but they were assisted with scrimp decency by the heirs hence the attacks on the grandfather and cousins of roderick random but later smollett returned to kinder feelings  in some ways tobias resembled his old grandsire  about 1710 that gentleman wrote a memoir of his own life  hence we learn that he in childhood like roderick random was regarded as a clog and burden and was neglected by his father illused by his stepmother  thus tobias had not only his own early poverty to resent but had a hereditary grudge against fortune and the base indifference of mankind  the old gentleman was lodged with very hard and penurious people at glasgow university  he rose in the world and was a good presbyterian whig but had no liberty to help to forfeit james ii  the puir child his son james iii and viii if he was really such was innocent and it were hard to do anything that would touch the son for the fathers fault  the old gentleman therefore though a member of parliament evaded attending the first parliament after the union i had no freedom to do it because i understood that the great business to be agitated therein was to make laws for abjuring the pretender    which i could not go in with being always of opinion that it was hard to impose oaths on people who had not freedom to take them  this was uncommonly liberal conduct in a whig and our smollett though no jacobite was in distinct and courageous sympathy with jacobite scotland  indeed he was as patriotic as burns or as his own lismahago these were times we must remember in which scottish patriotism was more than a mere historical sentiment  scotland was inconceivably poor and scots in england were therefore ridiculous  the country had so far gained very little by the union and the union was detested even by scottish whig earls  it is recorded by moore that while at the dumbarton grammar school smollett wrote verses to the memory of wallace of whom he became an early admirer having read blind harrys translation of the latin poems of john blair chaplain to that hero there probably never were any such latin poems but smollett began with the same heroworship as burns  he had the attachment of a scot to his native stream the leven which later he was to celebrate  now if smollett had credited roderick random with these rural poetical and patriotic tastes his hero would have been much more human and amiable there was much good in smollett which is absent in random  but for some reason probably because scotland was unpopular after the fortyfive smollett merely describes the woes ill usage and retaliations of roderick  that he suffered as random did is to the last degree improbable  he had a fair knowledge of latin and was not destitute of greek while his master a mr love bore a good character both for humanity and scholarship  he must have studied the classics at glasgow university where he was apprenticed to mr gordon a surgeon  gordon again was an excellent man appreciated by smollett himself in after days and the odious potion of roderick random must like his rival crab have been merely a fancy sketch of meanness hypocrisy and profligacy  perhaps the good surgeon became the victim of that one continued string of epigrammatic sarcasms such as mr colquhoun told ramsay of ochtertyre smollett used to play off on his companions for which no talents could compensate  judging by dr carlyles memoirs this intolerable kind of display was not unusual in caledonian conversation but it was not likely to make tobias popular in england  thither he went in 1739 with very little money and a very large assortment of letters of recommendation whether his relatives intended to compensate for the scantiness of the one by their profusion in the other is uncertain but he has often been heard to declare that their liberality in the last article was prodigious  the smolletts were not kinless loons they had connections but who in scotland had money tobias had passed his medical examinations but he rather trusted in his ms tragedy the regicide  tragical were its results for the author inspired by george buchanans latin history of scotland smollett had produced a play in blank verse on the murder of james i  that a boy even a scottish boy should have an overweening passion for this unlucky piece that he should expect by such a work to climb a step on fortunes ladder is nowadays amazing  for ten years he clung to it modified it polished improved it and then published it in 1749 after the success of roderick random  twice he told the story of his theatrical mishaps and disappointments which were such as occur to every writer for the stage  he wailed over them in roderick random in the story of mr melopoyn he prolonged his cry in the preface to the regicide and probably the noble whom he lashed very indecently in his two satires advice 1746 reproof 1747 and in roderick random was the patron who could not get the tragedy acted  first in 1739 he had a patron whom he discarded  then he went to the west indies and returning in 1744 he lugged out his tragedy again and fell foul again of patrons actors and managers  what befell him was the common fate people did not probably hasten to read his play managers and supercilious peers postponed that entertainment or at least the noblemen could not make the managers accept it if they did not want it our taste differs so much from that of the time which admired homes douglas and the regicide was so often altered to meet objections that we can scarcely criticise it  of course it is absolutely unhistorical of course it is empty of character and replete with fustian and ineffably tedious but perhaps it is not much worse than other luckier tragedies of the age  naturally a lover calls his wounded lady the bleeding fair  naturally she exclaims           celestial powers    protect my father shower upon hisoh  dies  naturally her adorer answers with           so may our mingling souls    to bliss supernal wing our happyoh  dies  we are reminded of           alas my bom  dies    bastes he would have said  the piece if presented must have been damned  but smollett was so angry with one patron lord lyttelton that he burlesqued the poor mans dirge on the death of his wife  he was so angry with garrick that he dragged him into roderick random as marmozet  later obliged by garrick and forgiving lyttelton he wrote respectfully about both  but in 1746 in advice he had assailed the proud lord who smiles a gracious lie and the varnished ruffians of the state  because tobiass play was unacted people who tried to aid him were liars and ruffians and a great deal worse for in his satire as in his first novel smollett charges men of high rank with the worst of unnamable crimes  pollio and lord strutwell whoever they may have been were probably recognisable then and were undeniably libelled though they did not appeal to a jury  it is improbable that sir john cope had ever tried to oblige smollett  his ignoble attack on cope after that unfortunate general had been fairly and honourably acquitted of incompetence and cowardice was then wholly disinterested  cope is a courtier ape appointed general     then pug aghast fled faster than the wind    nor deignd in threescore miles to look behind    while every band for orders bleat in vain    and fall in slaughtered heaps upon the plain  of preston pans  nothing could be more remote from the truth or more unjustly cruel smollett had not here even the excuse of patriotism  sir john cope was no butcher cumberland  in fact the poets friend is not wrong when in reproof he calls smollett a flagrant misanthrope  the world was out of joint for the cadet of bonhill both before and after his very trying experiences as a ship surgeon the managers would not accept the regicide  this was reason good why smollett should try to make a little money and notoriety by penning satires  they are fierce foulmouthed and pointless  but smollett was poor and he was angry he had the examples of pope and swift before him which as far as truculence went he could imitate  above all it was then the fixed belief of men of letters that some peer or other ought to aid and support them and as no peer did support smollett obviously they were varnished ruffians  he erred as he would not err now for times and ways of going wrong are changed  but at best how different are his angry couplets from the lofty melancholy of johnsons satires  smolletts small sum of money did not permit him long to push the fortunes of his tragedy in 1739 and as for his very large assortment of letters of recommendation they only procured for him the post of surgeons mate in the cumberland of the line  here he saw enough of the horrors of naval life enough of misery brutality and mismanagement at carthagena 1741 to supply materials for the salutary and sickening pages on that theme in roderick random  he also saw and appreciated the sterling qualities of courage simplicity and generosity which he has made immortal in his bowlings and trunnions  it is part of a novelists business to make one half of the world know how the other half lives and in this province smollett anticipated dickens  he left the service as soon as he could when the beaten fleet was refitting at jamaica  in that isle he seems to have practised as a doctor and he married or was betrothed to a miss lascelles who had a small and far from valuable property  the real date of his marriage is obscure more obscure are smolletts resources on his return to london in 1744  houses in downing street can never have been cheap but we find mr smollett surgeon in downing street westminster and in 1746 he was living in may fair not a region for slender purses  his tragedy was now bringing in nothing but trouble to himself and others  his satires cannot have been lucrative  as a dweller in may fair he could not support himself like his mr melopoyn by writing ballads for street singers  probably he practised in his profession  in count fathom he makes his adventurer purchase an old chariot which was new painted for the occasion and likewise hire a footman    this equipage though much more expensive than his finances could bear he found absolutely necessary to give him a chance of employment    a walking physician was considered as an obscure pedlar  a chariot smollett insists was necessary to every raw surgeon while bob sawyers expedient of being called from church was already vieux jeu in the way of advertisement such things had been injudiciously hackneyed  in this passage of fathoms adventures smollett proclaims his insight into methods of getting practice  a physician must ingratiate himself with apothecaries and ladies maids or acquire interest enough to have an infirmary erected by the voluntary subscriptions of his friends  here smollett denounces hospitals which encourage the vulgar to be idle and dissolute by opening an asylum to them and their families from the diseases of poverty and intemperance  this is odd morality for one who suffered from the base indifference of mankind  he ought to have known that poverty is not a vice for which the poor are to be blamed and that intemperance is not the only other cause of their diseases  perhaps the unfeeling passage is a mere paradox in the style of his own lismahago  with or without a chariot it is probable that tobias had not an insinuating style or a good bedside manner friends to support a hospital for his renown he had none but somehow he could live in may fair and in 1746 could meet dr carlyle and stewart son of the provost of edinburgh and other scots at the golden ball in cockspur street  there they were enjoying a frugal supper and a little punch when the news of culloden arrived  carlyle had been a whig volunteer he probably was happy enough but stewart whose father was in prison grew pale and left the room  smollett and carlyle then walked home through secluded streets and were silent lest their speech should bewray them for scots  john bull quoth smollett is as haughty and valiant today as he was abject and cowardly on the black wednesday when the highlanders were at derby  weep caledonia weep he had written in his tragedy  now he wrote mourn hapless caledonia mourn  scott has quoted from graham of gartmore the story of smolletts writing verses while gartmore and others were playing cards  he read them what he had written the tears of scotland and added the last verse on the spot when warned that his opinions might give offence     yes spite of thine insulting foe    my sympathising verse shall flow  the tears are better than the ode to blueeyed ann probably mrs smollett  but the courageous author of the tears of scotland had manifestly broken with patrons  he also broke with rich the manager at covent garden for whom he had written an opera libretto  he had failed as doctor and as dramatist nor as satirist had he succeeded  yet he managed to wear wig and sword and to be seen in good mens company perhaps his wifes little fortune supported him till in 1748 he produced roderick random  it is certain that we never find smollett in the deep distresses of dr johnson and goldsmith  novels were now in vogue pamela was recent joseph andrews was yet more recent clarissa harlowe had just appeared and fielding was publishing tom jones  smollett too tried his hand and at last he succeeded  his ideas of the novel are offered in his preface  the novel for him is a department of satire the most entertaining and universally improving  to smollett roderick random seemed an improving work ou le didacticisme va til se nicher  romance he declares arose in ignorance vanity and superstition and declined into the ludicrous and unnatural  then cervantes converted romance to purposes far more useful and entertaining by making it assume the sock and point out the follies of ordinary life  romance was to revive again some twenty years after its funeral oration was thus delivered  as for smollett himself he professedly follows the plan of le sage in gil blas a plan as old as petronius arbiter and the golden ass of apuleius but he gives more place to compassion so as not to interfere with generous indignation which ought to animate the reader against the sordid and vicious disposition of the world  as a contrast to sordid vice we are to admire modest merit in that exemplary orphan mr random  this gentleman is a north briton because only in north britain can a poor orphan get such an education as rodericks birth and character require and for other reasons  now as for roderick the schoolmaster gave himself no concern about the progress i made but should endeavour with gods help to prevent my future improvement  it must have been at glasgow university then that roderick learned greek very well and was pretty far advanced in the mathematics and here he must have used his genius for the belles lettres in the interest of his amorous complexion by lampooning the rivals of the young ladies who admired him  such are the happy beginnings accompanied by practical jokes of this interesting model  smolletts heroes one conceives were intended to be fine though not faultless young fellows men not plaster images brave generous freeliving but as roderick finds once when examining his conscience pure from serious stains on that important faculty  to us these heroes often appear no better than ruffians peregrine pickle for example rather excels the infamy of ferdinand count fathom in certain respects though ferdinand is professedly often the object of our detestation and abhorrence and is left in a very bad but as humphrey clinker shows in by no means a hopeless way  yet throughout smollett regarded himself as a moralist a writer of improving tendencies one who lashed the vices of the age  he was by no means wholly mistaken but we should probably wrong the eighteenth century if we accepted all smolletts censures as entirely deserved  the vices which he lashed are those which he detected or fancied that he detected in people who regarded a modest and meritorious scottish orphan with base indifference unluckily the greater part of mankind was guilty of this crime and consequently was capable of everything  enough has probably been said about the utterly distasteful figure of smolletts hero  in chapter lx we find him living on the resources of strap then losing all straps money at play and then i bilk my taylor  that is roderick orders several suits of new clothes and sells them for what they will fetch  meanwhile strap can live honestly anywhere while he has his ten fingers  roderick rescues himself from poverty by engaging with his uncle in the slave trade  we are apt to consider this commerce infamous  but in 1763 the evangelical director who helped to make cowper a castaway wrote as to the slavers profession it is indeed accounted a genteel employment and is usually very profitable though to me it did not prove so the lord seeing that a large increase of wealth could not be good for me  the reverend gentleman had doubtless often sung        time for us to go       time for us to go    and when wed got the hatches down       twas time for us to go  roderick apart from black ivory is aided by his uncle and his long lost father  the base world in the persons of strap thompson the uncle mr sagely and other people treats him infinitely better than he deserves  his very love as always in smollett is only an animal appetite vigorously insisted upon by the author  by a natural reaction scott much as he admired smollett introduced his own blameless heroes and even thackeray could only hint at the defects of youth in esmond thackeray is accused of making his good people stupid or too simple or eccentric and otherwise contemptible  smollett went further strap a model of benevolence is ludicrous and a coward even bowling has the stage eccentricities of the sailor  mankind was certain in the long run to demand heroes more amiable and worthy of respect  our inclinations as scott says are with the openhearted goodhumoured and nobleminded tom jones whose libertinism one particular omitted is perhaps rendered but too amiable by his good qualities  to be sure roderick does befriend a reclaimed streetwalker in her worst need but why make her the confidante of the virginal narcissa  why reward strap with her hand  fielding decidedly as scott insists places before us heroes and especially heroines of a much higher as well as more pleasing character than smollett was able to present  but the deep and fertile genius of smollett afforded resources sufficient to make up for these deficiencies    if fielding had superior taste the palm of more brilliancy of genius more inexhaustible richness of invention must in justice be awarded to smollett  in comparison with his sphere that in which fielding walked was limited    the second part of scotts parallel between the men whom he considered the greatest of our novelists qualifies the first  smolletts invention was not richer than fieldings but the sphere in which he walked the circle of his experience was much wider  one division of life they knew about equally well the category of rakes adventurers cardsharpers unhappy authors people of the stage and ladies without reputations in every degree  there were conditions of higher society of english rural society and of clerical society which fielding by birth and education knew much better than smollett  but smollett had the advantage of his early years in scotland then as little known as japan with the nautical multitude from captain to loblolly boy he was intimately familiar with the west indies he was acquainted and he later resided in paris and travelled in flanders so that he had more experience certainly if not more invention than fielding  in roderick random he used scottish local colour very little but his life had furnished him with a surprising wealth of strange experiences inns were we must believe the favourite home of adventures and smollett could ring endless changes on mistakes about bedrooms  none of them is so innocently diverting as the affair of mr pickwick and the lady in yellow curlpapers but the absence of that innocence which heightens mr pickwicks distresses was welcome to admirers of what lady mary wortley montagu calls gay reading  she wrote from abroad in 1752 there is something humorous in r random that makes me believe that the author is h fieldingher kinsman  her ladyship did her cousin little justice  she did not complain of the morals of r random but thought pamela and clarissa likely to do more general mischief than the works of lord rochester  probably r random did little harm  his career is too obviously ideal  too many ups and downs occur to him and few orphans of merit could set before themselves the ideal of bilking their tailors gambling by way of a profession dealing in the slave trade and wheedling heiresses  the variety of character in the book is vast in morgan we have an excellent fiery welshman of the stage type the different minor miscreants are all vividly designed the eccentric lady author may have had a real original miss snapper has much vivacity as a wit the french adventures in the army are in their rude barbaric way a forecast of barry lyndons and generally both scott and thackeray owe a good deal to smollett in the way of suggestions  smolletts extraordinary love of dilating on noisome smells and noisome sights that intense affection for the physically nauseous which he shared with swift is rather less marked in roderick than in humphrey clinker and the adventures of an atom  the scenes in the marshalsea must have been familiar to dickens  the terrible history of miss williams is hogarths harlots progress done into unsparing prose  smollett guides us at a brisk pace through the shady and brutal side of the eighteenth century his vivacity is as unflagging as that of his disagreeable rattle of a hero  the passion usually understood as love is to be sure one of which he seems to have no conception he regards a woman much as a greedy person might regard a sirloin of beef or at least a plate of ortolans  at her marriage a bride is dished up that is all  thus this gay writing no longer makes us gay  in reading peregrine pickle and humphrey clinker a man may find himself laughing aloud but hardly in reading roderick random  the fun is of the cruel primitive sort arising merely from the contemplation of somebodys painful discomfiture  bowling and rattlin may be regarded with affectionate respect but roderick has only physical courage and vivacity to recommend him  whether smollett in flauberts deliberate way purposely abstained from moralising on the many scenes of physical distress which he painted or whether he merely regarded them without emotion has been debated  it seems more probable that he thought they carried their own moral  it is the most sympathetic touch in rodericks character that he writes thus of his miserable crew of slaves our ship being freed from the disagreeable lading of negroes to whom indeed i had been a miserable slave since our leaving the coast of guinea i began to enjoy myself  smollett was a physician and had the pitifulness of his profession though we see how casually he makes random touch on his own unwonted benevolence  people had not begun to know the extent of their own brutality in the slave trade but smollett probably did know it  if a curious prophetic letter attributed to him and published more than twenty years after his death be genuine he had the strongest opinions about this form of commercial enterprise  but he did not wear his heart on his sleeve where he wore his irritable nervous system  it is probable enough that he felt for the victims of poverty neglect and oppression despite his remarks on hospitals as keenly as dickens  we might regard his offensively ungrateful roderick as a purely dramatic exhibition of a young man if his other heroes were not as bad or worse if their few redeeming qualities were not stuck on in patches and if he had omitted his remark about rodericks modest merit  on the other hand the good side of matthew bramble seems to be drawn from smolletts own character and if that be the case he can have had little sympathy with his own humorous barry lyndons  scott and thackeray leaned to the favourable view smollett his nervous system apart was manly and kindly  as regards plot roderick random is a mere string of picturesque adventures  it is at the opposite pole from tom jones in the matter of construction  there is no reason why it should ever stop except the convenience of printers and binders  perhaps we lay too much stress on the somewhat mechanical art of plotbuilding  fielding was then setting the first and best english example of a craft in which the very greatest authors have been weak or of which they were careless  smollett was always rather more incapable or rather more indifferent in plotweaving than greater men  in our day of royalties and gossip about the gains of authors it would be interesting to know what manner and size of a cheque smollett received from his publisher the celebrated mr osborne  we do not know but smollett published his next novel on commission printed for the author so probably he was not well satisfied with the pecuniary result of roderick random  thereby says dr moore he acquired much more reputation than money  so he now published the regicide by subscription that method of publication being then more reputable than it has been thought since 1797  of the regicide and its unlucky preface enough or more has been said  the public sided with the managers not with the meritorious orphan  for the sake of pleasure or of new experiences or of economy smollett went to paris in 1750 where he met dr moore later his biographer the poetical dr akenside and an affected painter  he introduced the poet and painter into peregrine pickle and makes slight use of a group of exiled jacobites including mr hunter of burnside  in 1750 there were jacobites enough in the french capital all wondering very much where prince charles might be and quite unconscious that he was their neighbour in a convent in the rue st dominique  though moore does not say so he is provokingly economical of detail we may presume that smollett went wandering in flanders as does peregrine pickle  it is curious that he should introduce a capucin a jew and a blackeyed damsel all in the ghent diligence when we know that prince charles did live in ghent with the blackeyed miss walkenshaw did go about disguised as a capucin and was tracked by a jewish spy while the other spy young glengarry styled himself pickle  but all those events occurred about a year after the novel was published in 1751  before that date smollett had got an md degree from aberdeen university and after returning from france he practised for a year or two at bath  but he could not expect to be successful among fashionable invalids and in humphrey clinker he make matthew bramble give such an account of the bath waters as m zola might envy  he was still trying to gain ground in his profession when in march 1751 mr d wilson published the first edition of peregrine pickle for the author unnamed  i have never seen this first edition which was very curious and disgusting  smollett in his preface to the second edition talks of the art and industry that were used to stifle him in the birth by certain booksellers and others  he now reformed the manners and corrected the expressions removed or modified some passages of personal satire and held himself exempt from the numerous shafts of envy rancour and revenge that have lately both in private and public been levelled at his reputation  who were these base and pitiless dastards probably every one who did not write favourably about the book  perhaps smollett suspected fielding whom he attacks in several parts of his works treating him as a kind of jonathan wild a thieftaker and an associate with thieves  why smollett thus misconducted himself is a problem unless he was either meanly jealous or had taken offence at some remarks in fieldings newspaper  smollett certainly began the war in the first edition of peregrine pickle  he made a kind of palinode to the trading justice later as other people of his kind have done  a point in peregrine pickle easily assailed was the long episode about a lady of quality the beautiful lady vane whose memoirs smollett introduced into his tale  horace walpole found that she had omitted the only feature in her career of which she had just reason to be proud the number of her lovers  nobody doubted that smollett was paid for casting his mantle over lady vane moreover he might expect a success of scandal  the roman a clef is always popular with scandalmongers but its authors can hardly hope to escape rebuke  it was not till 1752 that lady mary wortley montagu in italy received peregrine with other fashionable romancespompey the little the parish girl eleanoras adventures the life of mrs theresa constantia phipps the adventures of mrs loveil and so on  most of them contained portraits of real people and no doubt most of them were therefore successful  but where are they now  lady mary thought lady vanes part of peregrine more instructive to young women than any sermon that i know  she regarded fielding as with congreve the only original of her age but fielding had to write for bread and that is the most contemptible way of getting bread  she did not at this time even know smolletts name but she admired him and later calls him my dear smollett  this lady thought that fielding did not know what sorry fellows his tom jones and captain booth were  not near so sorry as peregine pickle were they for this gentleman is a far more atrocious ruffian than roderick random  none the less peregrine is smolletts greatest work  nothing is so rich in variety of character scene and adventure  we are carried along by the swift and copious volume of the current carried into very queer places and into the oddest miscellaneous company but we cannot escape from smolletts vigorous grasp  sir walter thought that roderick excelled its successor in ease and simplicity and that smolletts sailors in pickle border on caricature  no doubt they do the eccentricities of hawser trunnion esq are exaggerated and pipes is less subdued than rattlin though always delightful  but trunnion absolutely makes one laugh out aloud whether he is criticising the sister of mr gamaliel pickle in that gentlemans presence at a pothouse or riding to the altar with his squadron of sailors tacking in an unfavourable gale or being run away into a pack of hounds and clearing a hollow road over a waggoner who views him with unspeakable terror and amazement  mr winkle as an equestrian is not more entirely acceptable to the mind than trunnion  we may speak of caricature but if an author can make us sob with laughter to criticise him solemnly is ungrateful  except fielding occasionally and smollett and swift and sheridan and the authors of the rovers one does not remember any writers of the eighteenth century who quite upset the gravity of the reader  the scene of the pedants dinner after the manner of the ancients does not seem to myself so comic as the adventures of trunnion while the bride is at the altar and the bridegroom is tacking and veering with his convoy about the fields  one sees how the dinner is done with a knowledge of athenaeus juvenal petronius and horace many men could have written this set piece  but trunnion is quite inimitable he is a child of humour and of the highest spirits like mr weller the elder  till scott created mause headrig no caledonian had ever produced anything except tam o shanter that could be a pendant to trunnion  his pathos is possibly just a trifle overdone though that is not my own opinion  dear trunnion he makes me overlook the gambols of his detestable protege the hero  that scoundrel is not an impossible caricature of an obstinate vain cruel libertine  peregrine was precisely the man to fall in love with emilia pour le bon motif and then attempt to ruin her though she was the sister of his friend by devices worthy of lovelace at his last and lowest stage  peregrines overwhelming vanity swollen by facile conquests would inevitably have degraded him to this abyss  the intrigue was only the worst of those infamous practical jokes of his in which smollett takes a cruel and unholy delight  peregrine in fact is a hero of naturalisme except that his fits of generosity are mere patches daubed on and that his reformation is a farce in which a modern naturaliste would have disdained to indulge  emilia in her scene with peregrine in the bouge to which he has carried her rises much above smolletts heroines and we could like her if she had never forgiven behaviour which was beneath pardon  peregrines education at winchester bears out lord elchos description of that academy in his lately published memoirs  it was apt to develop peregrines and lord elcho himself might have furnished smollett with suitable adventures  there can be no doubt that cadwallader crabtree suggested sir malachi malagrowther to scott and that hatchway and pipes taking up their abode with peregrine in the fleet gave a hint to dickens for sam weller and mr pickwick in the same abode  that peregrine does far excel joseph andrews and amelia as scott declares few modern readers will admit  the world could do much better without peregrine than without joseph while amelia herself alone is a study greatly preferable to the whole works of smollett such at least is the opinion of a declared worshipper of that peerless lady  yet peregrine is a kind of odyssey of the eighteenth century an epic of humour and of adventure  in february 1753 smollett obliged the town with his adventures of ferdinand count fathom a cosmopolitan swindler and adventurer  the book is smolletts barry lyndon yet as his hero does not tell his own story but is perpetually held up as a dreadful example there is none of thackerays irony none of his subtlety  here is a really bad man a foreigner too smollett seems to say do not be misled oh maidens by the wiles of such a count  impetuous youth play not with him at billiards basset or gleek  fathers on such a rogue shut your doors collectors handle not his nefarious antiques  let all avoid the path and shun the example of ferdinand count fathom  such is smolletts sermon but after all ferdinand is hardly worse than roderick or peregrine  the son of a terrible old sutler and campfollower a robber and slayer of wounded men ferdinand had to live by his wits and he was hardly less scrupulous after all than peregrine and roderick  the daubs of casual generosity were not laid on and that is all the difference  as sophia western was mistaken for miss jenny cameron so ferdinand was arrested as prince charles who in fact caused much inconvenience to harmless travellers  people were often arrested as the pretenders son abroad as well as in england  the life and death of ferdinands mother shot by a wounded hussar in her moment of victory make perhaps the most original and interesting part of this heros adventures  the rest is much akin to his earlier novels but the history of rinaldo and monimia has a passage not quite alien to the vein of mrs radcliffe  some remarks in the first chapter show that smollett felt the censures on his brutality and lowness and he promises to seek that goal of perfection where nature is castigated almost even to still life    where decency divested of all substance hovers about like a fantastic shadow  smollett never reached that goal and even the shadow of decency never haunted him so as to make him afraid with any amazement  smollett avers that he has had the courage to call in question the talents of a pseudo patron and so is charged with insolence rancour and scurrility  of all these things and of worse he had been guilty his offence had never been limited to calling in question the talents of persons who had been unsuccessful in getting his play represented  remonstrance merely irritated tobias  his new novel was but a fainter echo of his old novels a panorama of scoundrelism with the melodramatic fortunes of the virtuous monimia for a foil  if read today it is read as a sketch of manners or want of manners  the scene in which the bumpkin squire rooks the accomplished fathom at hazard in paris is prettily conceived and smolletts indignation at the british system of pews in church is edifying  but when monimia appears to her lover as he weeps at her tomb and proves to be no phantom but a warm and substantial monimia capable of being dished up like any other smollettian heroine the reader is sensibly annoyed  tobias as un romantique is absolutely too absurd not here oh tobias are haunts meet for thee  smolletts next novel sir launcelot greaves was not published till 1761 after it had appeared in numbers in the british magazine  this was a sixpenny serial published by newbery  the years between 1753 and 1760 had been occupied by smollett in quarrelling getting imprisoned for libel editing the critical review writing his history of england translating or adapting old translations of don quixote and driving a team of literary hacks whose labours he superintended and to whom he gave a weekly dinner  these exploits are described by dr carlyle and by smollett himself in humphrey clinker  he did not treat his vassals with much courtesy or consideration but then they expected no such treatment  we have no right to talk of his doings as a bloodsucking method literary sweating like a recent biographer of smollett  not to speak of the oddly mixed metaphor we do not know what smolletts relations to his retainers really were  as an editor he had to see his contributors  the work of others he may have recommended as reader to publishers  others may have made transcripts for him or translations that smollett sweated men or sucked their blood or both seems a crude way of saying that he found them employment  nobody says that johnson sweated the persons who helped him in compiling his dictionary or that mr jowett sweated the friends and pupils who aided him in his translation of plato  authors have a perfect right to procure literary assistance especially in learned books if they pay for it and acknowledge their debt to their allies  on the second point smollett was probably not in advance of his age  sir launcelot greaves is according to chambers a sorry specimen of the genius of the author and mr oliphant smeaton calls it decidedly the least popular of his novels while scott astonishes us by preferring it to jonathan wild  certainly it is inferior to roderick random and to peregrine pickle but it cannot be so utterly unreal as the adventures of an atom  i for one venture to prefer sir launcelot to ferdinand count fathom  smollett was really trying an experiment in the fantastic  just as mr anstey guthrie transfers the mediaeval myth of venus and the ring or the arabian tale of the bottledup geni or djinn into modern life so smollett transferred don quixote  his hero a young baronet of wealth and of a benevolent and generous temper is crossed in love  though not mad he is eccentric and commences knight errant  scott and others object to his armour and say that in his ordinary clothes and with his wellfilled purse he would have been more successful in righting wrongs  certainly but then the comic fantasy of the armed knight arriving at the alehouse and jangling about the rose hung lanes among the astonished folk of town and country would have been lost  smollett is certainly less unsuccessful in wild fantasy than in the ridiculous romantic scenes where the substantial phantom of monimia disports itself  the imitation of the knight by the nautical captain crowe an excellent smollettian mariner is entertaining and sir launcelots crusty sancho is a pleasant variety in squires  the various forms of oppression which the knight resists are of historical interest as also is the contested election between a rustic tory and a smooth ministerialist sincerely attached to the protestant succession in detestation of a popish an abjured and an outlawed pretender  the heroine aurelia darrel is more of a lady and less of a luxury than perhaps any other of smolletts women  but how smollett makes love  tea was called  the lovers were seated he looked and languished she flushed and faltered all was doubt and delirium fondness and flutter  all was gas and gaiters said the insane lover of mrs nickleby with equal delicacy and point  scott says that smollett when on a visit to scotland used to write his chapter of copy in the halfhour before the post went out  scott was very capable of having the same thing happen to himself  sir launcelot is hurriedly but vigorously written the fantasy was not understood as smollett intended it to be and the book is blotted as usual with loathsome medical details  but people in madame du deffands circle used openly to discuss the same topics to the confusion of horace walpole  as the hero of this book is a generous gentleman as the most of it is kind and manly and the humour provocative of an honest laugh it is by no means to be despised while the manners if caricatured are based on fact  it is curious to note that in sir launcelot greaves we find a character ferret who frankly poses as a strugforlifeur  m daudets strugforlifeur had heard of darwin  mr ferret had read hobbes learned that man was in a state of nature and inferred that we ought to prey upon each other as a pike eats trout  miss burney too at bath about 1780 met a perfectly emancipated young new woman  she had read bolingbroke and hume believed in nothing and was ready to be a woman who did  our ancestors could be just as advanced as we are  smollett went on compiling and supporting himself by his compilations and those of his vassals  in 1762 he unluckily edited a paper called the briton in the interests of lord bute  the briton was silenced by wilkess north briton  smollett lost his last patron he fell ill his daughter died he travelled angrily in france and italy  his travels show the choleric nature of the man and he was especially blamed for not admiring the venus de medici  modern taste enlightened by the works of a better period of greek art has come round to smolletts opinions  but in his own day he was regarded as a vandal and a heretic  in 1764 he visited scotland and was warmly welcomed by his kinsman the laird of bonhill  in 1769 he published the adventures of an atom a stupid foul and scurrilous political satire in which lord bute having been his patron was lashed in smolletts usual style  in 1768 smollett left england for ever  he desired a consulship but no consulship was found for him which is not surprising  he died at monte nova near leghorn in september others say october 1771  he had finished humphrey clinker which appeared a day or two before his death  thackeray thought humphrey clinker the most laughable book that ever was written  certainly nobody is to be envied who does not laugh over the epistles of winifred jenkins  the book is too well known for analysis  the family of matthew bramble esq are on their travels with his nephew and niece young melford and lydia melford with miss jenkins and the squires tart greedy and amorous old maid of a sister tabitha bramble  this ladys persistent amours and mean avarice scarcely strike modern readers as amusing  smollett gave aspects of his own character in the choleric kind benevolent matthew bramble and in the patriotic and paradoxical lieutenant lismahago  bramble a gouty invalid is as full of medical abominations as smollett himself as ready to fight and as generous and openhanded  probably the author shared lismahagos contempt of trade his dislike of the union 1707 his fiery independence yet he does marry tabitha and those opinions in which lismahago heralds some of the social notions of mr ruskin  melford is an honourable kind of walking gentleman lydia though enamoured is modest and dignified clinker is a worthy son of bramble with abundant good humour and a pleasing vein of wesleyan methodism  but the grotesque spelling rural vanity and naivete of winifred jenkins with her affection for her kitten make her the most delightful of this wandering company  after beholding the humours and partaking of the waters of bath they follow smolletts own scottish tour and each character gives his picture of the country which smollett had left at its lowest ebb of industry and comfort and found so much more prosperous the book is a mine for the historian of manners and customs the novel reader finds count fathom metamorphosed into mr grieve an exemplary apothecary a sincere convert to virtue and unaffectedly pious  apparently a wave of goodnature came over smollett he forgave everybody his own relations even and he reclaimed his villain  a patron might have played with him  he mellowed in scotland matthew there became less tart and more tolerant an actual english matthew would have behaved quite otherwise humphrey clinker is an astonishing book as the work of an exiled poor and dying man  none of his works leaves so admirable an impression of smolletts virtues none has so few of his less amiable qualities  with the cadet of bonhill outworn with living and with labour died the burly brawling picturesque old english novel of humour and of the road we have nothing notable in this manner before the arrival of mr pickwick  an exception will scarcely be made in the interest of richard cumberland who as scott says has occasionally    become disgusting when he meant to be humorous  already walpole had begun the new gothic romance and the castle of otranto with miss burneys novels was to lead up to mrs radcliffe and scott to miss edgeworth and miss austen     chapter x nathaniel hawthorne   saintebeuve says somewhere that it is impossible to speak of the german classics  perhaps he would not have allowed us to talk of the american classics  american literature is too nearly contemporary  time has not tried it  but if america possesses a classic author and i am not denying that she may have several that author is decidedly hawthorne his renown is unimpeached his greatness is probably permanent because he is at once such an original and personal genius and such a judicious and determined artist  hawthorne did not set himself to compete with life  he did not make the effortthe proverbially tedious effortto say everything  to his mind fiction was not a mirror of commonplace persons and he was not the analyst of the minutest among their ordinary emotions  nor did he make a moral or social or political purpose the end and aim of his art  moral as many of his pieces naturally are we cannot call them didactic  he did not expect nor intend to better people by them  he drew the rev arthur dimmesdale without hoping that his awful example would persuade readers to make a clean breast of their iniquities and their secrets it was the moral situation that interested him not the edifying effect of his picture of that situation upon the minds of novelreaders  he set himself to write romance with a definite idea of what romance writing should be to dream strange things and make them look like truth  nothing can be more remote from the modern system of reporting commonplace things in the hope that they will read like truth  as all painters must do according to good traditions he selected a subject and then placed it in a deliberately arranged lightnot in the full glare of the noonday sun and in the disturbances of wind and weather and cloud  moonshine filling a familiar chamber and making it unfamiliar moonshine mixed with the faint ruddiness on walls and ceiling of fire was the light or a clear brown twilight was the light by which he chose to work  so he tells us in the preface to the scarlet letter  the room could be filled with the ghosts of old dwellers in it faint yet distinct all the life that had passed through it came back and spoke with him and inspired him  he kept his eyes on these figures tangled in some rare knot of fate and of desire these he painted not attending much to the bustle of existence that surrounded them not permitting superfluous elements to mingle with them and to distract him  the method of hawthorne can be more easily traced than that of most artists as great as himself  popes brilliant passages and disconnected trains of thought are explained when we remember that papersparing as he says he wrote two or four or six couplets on odd stray bits of casual writing material  these he had to join together somehow and between his orient pearls at random strung there is occasionally too much string as dickens once said on another opportunity  hawthornes method is revealed in his published notebooks  in these he jotted the germ of an idea the first notion of a singular perhaps supernatural moral situation  many of these he never used at all on others he would dream and dream till the persons in the situations became characters and the thing was evolved into a story  thus he may have invented such a problem as this the effect of a great sudden sin on a simple and joyous nature and thence came all the substance of the marble faun transformation  the original and germinal idea would naturally divide itself into another as the protozoa reproduce themselves  another idea was the effect of nearness to the great crime on a pure and spotless nature hence the character of hilda  in the preface to the scarlet letter hawthorne shows us how he tried by reflection and dream to warm the vague persons of the first mere notion or hint into such life as characters in romance inherit  while he was in the civil service of his country in the custom house at salem he could not do this he needed freedom  he was dismissed by political opponents from office and instantly he was himself again and wrote his most popular and perhaps his best book  the evolution of his work was from the prime notion which he confessed that he loved best when strange to the short story and thence to the full and rounded novel  all his work was leisurely  all his language was picked though not with affectation  he did not strive to make a style out of the use of odd words or of familiar words in odd places  almost always he looked for a kind of spiritual medium seen through which his romances like the old manse in which he dwelt had not quite the aspect of belonging to the material world  the spiritual medium which he liked he was partly born into and partly he created it  the child of a race which came from england robust and puritanic he had in his veins the blood of judgesof those judges who burned witches and persecuted quakers  his fancy is as much influenced by the old fanciful traditions of providence of witchcraft of haunting indian magic as scotts is influenced by legends of foray and feud by ballad and song and old wives tales and records of conspiracies fire raisings tragic loveadventures and border wars  like scott hawthorne lived in phantasyin phantasy which returned to the romantic past wherein his ancestors had been notable men  it is a commonplace but an inevitable commonplace to add that he was filled with the idea of heredity with the belief that we are all only new combinations of our fathers that were before us  this has been made into a kind of pseudo scientific doctrine by m zola in the long series of his rougonmacquart novels  hawthorne treated it with a more delicate and a serener art in the house of the seven gables  it is curious to mark hawthornes attempts to break away from himselffrom the man that heredity and circumstance and the divine gift of genius had made him  he naturally haunts the mouldering lodges of the past but when he came to england where such lodges are abundant he was illpleased and crossgrained  he knew that a long past with mysteries dark places malisons curses historic wrongs was the proper atmosphere of his art  but a kind of conscientious desire to be something other than himselfsomething more ordinary and popularmake him thank heaven that his chosen atmosphere was rare in his native land he grumbled at it when he was in the midst of it he grumbled in england and how he grumbled in rome  he permitted the american eagle to make her nest in his bosom with the customary infirmity of temper that characterises this unhappy fowl as he says in his essay the custom house  the general truculency of her attitude seems to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community of europe and especially of england and italy  perhaps hawthorne travelled too late when his habits were too much fixed  it does not become englishmen to be angry because a voyager is annoyed at not finding everything familiar and customary in lands which he only visits because they are strange  this is an inconsistency to which english travellers are particularly prone  but it is in hawthornes case perhaps another instance of his conscientious attempts to be what he was not very much like other people  his unexpected explosions of puritanism perhaps are caused by the sense of being too much himself  he speaks of the squeamish love of the beautiful as if the love of the beautiful were something unworthy of an ablebodied citizen  in some arts as in painting and sculpture his taste was very far from being at home as his italian journals especially prove  in short he was an artist in a community for long most inartistic  he could not do what many of us find very difficulthe could not take beauty with gladness as it comes neither shrinking from it as immoral nor getting girlishly drunk upon it in the aesthetic fashion and screaming over it in an intoxication of surprise  his tendency was to be rather shy and afraid of beauty as a pleasant but not immaculately respectable acquaintance  or perhaps he was merely deferring to anglo saxon public opinion  possibly he was trying to wean himself from himself and from his own genius when he consorted with odd amateur socialists in farmwork and when he mixed at concord with the queer strangelydressed oddlybehaved mortals most of whom took upon themselves to be important agents of the worlds destiny yet were simple bores of a very intense water  they haunted mr emerson as they haunted shelley and hawthorne had to see much of them  but they neither made a convert of him nor irritated him into resentment  his longenduring kindness to the unfortunate miss delia bacon an early believer in the nonsense about bacon and shakespeare was a model of manly and generous conduct  he was indeed an admirable character and his goodness had the bloom on it of a courteous and kindly nature that loved the muses  but as one has ventured to hint the development of his genius and taste was hampered now and then apparently by a desire to put himself on the level of the general public and of their ideas  this at least is how one explains to oneself various remarks in his prefaces journals and notebooks this may account for the moral allegories which too weirdly haunt some of his short early pieces  edgar poe in a passage full of very honest and wellchosen praise found fault with the allegorical business  mr hutton from whose literary essays i borrow poes opinion says poe boldly asserted that the conspicuously ideal scaffoldings of hawthornes stories were but the monstrous fruits of the bad transcendental atmosphere which he breathed so long  but i hope this way of putting it is not poes  ideal scaffoldings are odd enough but when scaffoldings turn out to be fruits of an atmosphere and monstrous fruits of a bad transcendental atmosphere the brain reels in the fumes of mixed metaphors  let him mend his pen cried poe get a bottle of visible ink come out from the old manse cut mr alcott and in fact write about things less impalpable as mr mallocks heroine preferred to be loved in a more human sort of way  hawthornes way was never too ruddily and robustly human  perhaps even in the scarlet letter we feel too distinctly that certain characters are moral conceptions not warmed and wakened out of the allegorical into the real  the persons in an allegory may be real enough as bunyan has proved by examples  but that culpable clergyman mr arthur dimmesdale with his large white brow his melancholy eyes his hand on his heart and his general resemblance to the high church curate in thackerays our street is he real  to me he seems very unworthy to be hesters lover for she is a beautiful woman of flesh and blood  mr dimmesdale was not only immoral he was unsportsmanlike  he had no more pluck than a church mouse  his miserable passion was degraded by its brevity how could he see this womans disgrace for seven long years and never pluck up heart either to share her shame or peccare forliter  he is a lay figure very cleverly but somewhat conventionally made and painted  the vengeful husband of hester roger chillingworth is a mr casaubon stung into jealous anger  but his attitude watching ever by dimmesdale tormenting him and yet in his confidence and ever unsuspected reminds one of a conception dear to dickens  he uses it in david copperfield where mr micawber of all people plays this trick on uriah heep he uses it in hunted down he was about using it in edwin drood he used it old martin and pecksniff in martin chuzzlewit  the person of roger chillingworth and his conduct are a little too melodramatic for hawthornes genius  in dickenss manner too is hawthornes long sarcastic address to judge pyncheon in the house of the seven gables as the judge sits dead in his chair with his watch ticking in his hand  occasionally a chance remark reminds one of dickens this for example he is talking of large black old books of divinity and of their successors tiny books elzevirs perhaps  these little old volumes impressed me as if they had been intended for very large ones but had been unfortunately blighted at an early stage of their growth  this might almost deceive the elect as a piece of the true boz  their widely different talents did really intersect each other where the perverse the grotesque and the terrible dwell  to myself the house of the seven gables has always appeared the most beautiful and attractive of hawthornes novels  he actually gives us a love story and condescends to a pretty heroine  the curse of maules blood is a good old romantic idea terribly handled  there is more of lightness and of a cobwebby dusty humour in hepzibah pyncheon the decayed lady shopkeeper than hawthorne commonly cares to display  do you care for the first lover the photographers young man  it may be conventional prejudice but i seem to see him going about on a tricycle and i dont think him the right person for phoebe  perhaps it is really the beautiful gentle oppressed clifford who haunts ones memory most a kind of tragic and thwarted harold skimpole how pleasant how delightful he murmured but not as if addressing any one  will it last  how balmy the atmosphere through that open window  an open window  how beautiful that play of sunshine  those flowers how very fragrant  that young girls face how cheerful how blooming  a flower with the dew on it and sunbeams in the dewdrops      this comparison with skimpole may sound like an unkind criticism of cliffords character and place in the storyit is only a chance note of a chance resemblance  indeed it may be that hawthorne himself was aware of the resemblance an individual of cliffords character he remarks can always be pricked more acutely through his sense of the beautiful and harmonious than through his heart  and he suggests that if clifford had not been so long in prison his aesthetic zeal might have eaten out or filed away his affections  this was what befell harold skimpolehimself in prisons oftenat coavinses  the judge pyncheon of the tale is also a masterly study of swaggering blackhearted respectability and then in addition to all the poetry of his style and the charm of his haunted air hawthorne favours us with a brave conclusion of the good sort the old sort  they come into money they marry they are happy ever after this is doing things handsomely though some of our modern novelists think it coarse and degrading  hawthorne did not think so and they are not exactly better artists than hawthorne  yet he too had his economies which we resent  i do not mean his not telling us what it was that roger chillingworth saw on arthur dimmesdales bare breast  to leave that vague is quite legitimate  but what had miriam and the spectre of the catacombs done  who was the spectre  what did he want  to have told all this would have been better than to fill the novel with padding about rome sculpture and the ethics of art  as the silly saying runs the people has a right to know about miriam and her ghostly acquaintance 10  but the marble faun is not of hawthornes best period beautiful as are a hundred passages in the tale  beautiful passages are as common in his prose as gold in the richest quartz  how excellent are his words on the first faint but certain breath of autumn in the air felt perhaps early in july  and then came autumn with his immense burthen of apples dropping them continually from his overladen shoulders as he trudged along  keats might have written so of autumn in the orchardsif keats had been writing prose  there are geniuses more sunny large and glad than hawthornes none more original more surefooted in his own realm of moonlight and twilight     chapter xi the paradise of poets   we were talking of love constancy the ideal  who ever loved like the poets cried lady violet lebas her pure pale cheek flushing  ah if ever i am to love he shall be a singer  tenors are popular very said lord walter  i mean a poet she answered witheringly  near them stood mr witham the author of hearts chords tangled  ah said he that reminds me  i have been trying to catch it all the morning  that reminds me of my dream  tell us your dream murmured lady violet lebas and he told it  it was through an unfortunate but pardonable blunder said mr witham that i died and reached the paradise of poets  i had indeed published volumes of verse but with the most blameless motives  other poets were continually sending me theirs and as i could not admire them and did not like to reply by critical remarks i simply printed some rhymes for the purpose of sending them to the gentlemen who favoured me with theirs  i always wrote on the flyleaf a quotation from the iliad about giving copper in exchange for gold and the few poets who could read greek were gratified while the others probably thought a compliment was intended  nothing could be less culpable or pretentious but through some mistake on the part of charon i was drafted off to the paradise of poets  outside the golden gate a number of shadows were waiting in different attitudes of depression and languor  bavius and maevius were there still complaining of cliques railing at horace for a mere rhymer of society and at virgil as a plagiarist take away his cribs from homer and apollonius rhodius quoth honest maevius and what is there left of him  i also met a society of gentlemen in greek costume of various ages from a halfnaked minstrel with a tortoiseshell lyre in his hand to an elegant of the age of pericles  they all consorted together talking various dialects of aeolic ionian attic greek and so forth which were plainly not intelligible to each other  i ventured to ask one of the company who he was but he with a sweep of his hand said we are homer  when i expressed my regret and surprise that the golden gate had not yet opened for so distinguished though collective an artist my friend answered that according to fick peppmuller and many other learned men they were homer  but an impostor from chios has got in somehow he said they dont pay the least attention to the germans in the paradise of poets  at this moment the golden gates were thrown apart and a fair lady in an early italian costume carrying a laurel in her hand appeared at the entrance  all the shadows looked up with an air of weary expectation like people waiting for their turn in a doctors consultingroom  she beckoned to me however and i made haste to follow her  the words charlatan  you a poet in a variety of languages greeted me by way of farewell from the shadows  the renowned laura if i am not mistaken i ventured to remark recognising her indeed from the miniature in the laurentian library at florence  she bowed and i began to ask for her adorer petrarch  excuse me said laura as we glided down a mossy path under the shade of trees particularly dear to poets excuse me but the sonneteer of whom you speak is one whose name i cannot bear to mention  his conduct with burnss clarinda his heartless infatuation for stella  you astonish me i said  in the paradise of poets  they are poets stillincorrigible answered the lady then slightly raising her voice of silver as a beautiful appearance in a toga drew near she cried catullo mio  the greeting between these accomplished ghosts was too kindly to leave room for doubt as to the ardour of their affections  will you my catullus murmured laura explain to this poet from the land of fogs any matters which to him may seem puzzling and unfamiliar in our paradise  the veronese with a charming smile took my hand and led me to a shadowy arbour whence we enjoyed a prospect of many rivers and mountains in the poets heaven  among these i recognised the triple crest of the eildons grongar hill cithaeron and etna while the reedfringed waters of the mincius flowed musically between the banks and braes o bonny doon to join the tweed  blithe ghosts were wandering by in all varieties of apparel and i distinctly observed dantes beatrice leaning loving on the arm of sir philip sidney while dante was closely engaged in conversation with the lost lenore celebrated by mr edgar allan poe  in what can my knowledge of the paradise of poets be serviceable to you sir said catullus as he flung himself at the feet of laura on the velvet grass  i am disinclined to seem impertinently curious i answered but the ladies in this fair smiling countryhave the gods made them poetical  not generally replied catullus  indeed if you would be well with them i may warn you never to mention poetry in their hearing  they never cared for it while on earth and in this place it is a topic which the prudent carefully avoid among ladies  to tell the truth they have had to listen to far too much poetry and too many discussions on the caesura  there are indeed a few lady poetsvery few  sappho for example indeed i cannot recall any other at this moment  the result is that phaon of all the shadows here is the most distinguished by the fair  he was not a poet you know he got in on account of sappho who adored him  they are estranged now of course  you interest me deeply i answered  and now will you kindly tell me why these ladies are here if they were not poets  the women that were our ideals while we dwelt on earth the women we loved but never won or at all events never wedded they for whom we sighed while in the arms of a recognised and legitimate affection have been chosen by the olympians to keep us company in paradise  then wherefore i interrupted do i see robert burns loitering with that lady in a ruffcassandra i make no doubtronsards cassandra and why is the incomparable clarinda inseparable from petrarch and miss patty blount popes flame from the syrian meleager while his heliodore is manifestly devoted to mr emerson whom by the way i am delighted if rather surprised to see here  ah said catullus you are a newcomer among us  poets will be poets and no sooner have they attained their desire and dwelt in the company of their earthly ideals than they feel strangely yet irresistibly drawn to another  so it was in life so it will ever be  no ideal can survive a daily companionship and fortunate is the poet who did not marry his first love  as far as that goes i answered most of you were highly favoured indeed i do not remember any poet whose ideal was his wife or whose first love led him to the altar  i was not a marrying man myself answered the veronese few of us were  myself horace virgilwe were all bachelors  and lesbia  i said this in a low voice for laura was weaving bay into a chaplet and inattentive to our conversation  poor lesbia said catullus with a suppressed sigh  how i misjudged that girl  how cruel how causeless were my reproaches and wildly rending his curled locks and laurel crown he fled into a thicket whence there soon arose the melancholy notes of the ausonian lyre  he is incorrigible said laura very coldly and she deliberately began to tear and toss away the fragments of the chaplet she had been weaving  i shall never break him of that habit of versifying  but they are all alike  is there nobody here said i who is happy with his idealnobody but has exchanged ideals with some other poet  there is one she said  he comes of a northern tribe and in his lifetime he never rhymed upon his unattainable lady or if rhyme he did the accents never carried her name to the ears of the vulgar  look there  she pointed to the river at our feet and i knew the mounted figure that was riding the ford with a greenmantled lady beside him like the fairy queen  surely i had read of her and knew her     she whose blue eyes their secret told    though shaded by her locks of gold  they are different i know not why  they are constant said laura and rising with an air of chagrin she disappeared among the boughs of the trees that bear her name  unhappy hearts of poets i mused  light things and sacred they are but even in their paradise and among their chosen with every wish fulfilled and united to their beloved they cannot be at rest  thus moralising i wended my way to a crag whence there was a wide prospect  certain poets were standing there looking down into an abyss and to them i joined myself  ah i cannot bear it said a voice and as he turned away his brow already clearing his pain already forgotten i beheld the august form of shakespeare  marking my curiosity before it was expressed he answered the unuttered question  that is a sight for pagans he said and may give them pleasure  but my paradise were embittered if i had to watch the sorrows of others and their torments however well deserved  the others are gazing on the purgatory of critics and commentators  he passed from me and i joined the ionian father of the resthomer who with a countenance of unspeakable majesty was seated on a throne of rock between the mantuan virgil of the laurel crown hugo sophocles milton lovelace tennyson and shelley  at their feet i beheld in a vast and gloomy hall many an honest critic many an erudite commentator an army of reviewers  some were condemned to roll logs up insuperable heights whence they descended thundering to the plain  others were set to impositions and i particularly observed that the homeric commentators were obliged to write out the iliad and odyssey in their complete shape and were always driven by fiends to the task when they prayed for the bare charity of being permitted to leave out the interpolations  others fearful to narrate were torn into as many fragments as they had made of these immortal epics  others such as aristarchus were spitted on their own critical signs of disapproval  many reviewers were compelled to read the books which they had criticised without perusal and it was terrible to watch the agonies of the worthy pressmen who were set to this unwonted task  may we not be let off with the preface they cried in piteous accents  may we not glance at the table of contents and be done with it  but the presiding demons who had been examiners in the bodily life drove them remorseless to their toils  among the condemned i could not but witness with sympathy the punishment reserved for translators  the translators of virgil in particular were a vast and motley assemblage of most respectable men bishops were there from gawain douglas downwards judges in their ermine professors clergymen civil servants writhing in all the tortures that the blank verse the anapaestic measure the metre of the lay of the last minstrel the heroic couplet and similar devices can inflict  for all these men had loved virgil though not wisely and now their penance was to hear each other read their own translations  that must have been more than they could bear said lady violet  yes said mr witham i should know for down i fell into tartarus with a crash and writhed among the translators  why asked lady violet  because i have translated theocritus  mr witham said lady violet did you meet your ideal woman when you were in the paradise of poets  she yet walks this earth said the bard with a too significant bow  lady violet turned coldly away      mr witham was never invited to the blues againthe name of lord azures place in kent  the poet is shut out of paradise     chapter xii paris and helen   the first name in romance the most ancient and the most enduring is that of argive helen  during three thousand years fair women have been born have lived and been loved that there might be a song in the ears of men of later time but compared to the renown of helen their glory is dim  cleopatra who held the worlds fate in her hands and lay in the arms of caesar mary stuart maria verticordia for whose sake as a northern novelist tells peasants have lain awake sorrowing that she is dead agnes sorel fair rosamond la belle stuart the pompadour and the parabere can still enchant us from the page of history and chronicle  zeus gave them beauty which naturally rules even strength itself to quote the greek orator on the mistress of them all on her who having never lived can never die the daughter of the swan  while helen enjoys this immortality and is the ideal of beauty upon earth it is curious to reflect on the modernite of her story the oldest of the love stories of the world  in homer we first meet her the fairest of women in the song of the greatest of poets  it might almost seem as if homer meant to justify by his dealing with helen some of the most recent theories of literary art  in the iliad and odyssey the tale of helen is without a beginning and without an end like a frieze on a greek temple  she crosses the stage as a figure familiar to all the poets audience clearly did not need to be told who helen was nor anything about her youth  the famous judgment of paris the beginning of evil to achaeans and ilian men is only mentioned once by homer late and in a passage of doubtful authenticity  of her reconciliation to her wedded lord menelaus not a word is said of her end we are told no more than that for her and him a mansion in elysium is prepared     where falls not hail or rain or any snow  we leave her happy in argos a smile on her lips a gift in her hands as we met her in troy beautiful adored despite her guilt as sweet in her repentance as in her unvexed argive home  women seldom mention her in the epic but with horror and anger men never address her but in gentle courtesy  what is her secret  how did she leave her home with parisbeguiled by love by magic or driven by the implacable aphrodite homer is silent on all of these things these things doubtless were known by his audience  in his poem helen moves as a thing of simple grace courtesy and kindness save when she rebels against her doom after seeing her lover fly from her husbands spear  had we only homer by far our earliest literary source we should know little of the romance of helen should only know that a lawless love brought ruin on troy and sorrow on the achaeans and this is thrown out with no moral comment without praise or blame  the end we learn was peace and beauty was reconciled to life  there is no explanation no denouement and we know how much denouement and explanations hampered scott and shakespeare  from these trammels homer is free as a god is free from mortal limitations  all this manner of telling a talea manner so ancient so originalis akin in practice to recent theories of what art should be and what art seldom is perhaps never is in modern hands  modern enough again is the choice of a married woman for the heroine of the earliest love tale  apollonius rhodius sings and no man has ever sung so well of a maidens love virgil of a widows homer of love that has defied law blindly obedient to destiny which dominates even zeus  once again helen is not a very young girl ungallant chronologists have attributed to her i know not what age  we think of her as about the age of the venus of milo in truth she was ageless and immortal  homer never describes her beauty we only see it reflected in the eyes of the old men white and weak thinvoiced as cicalas but hers is a loveliness to turn an old man young  it is no marvel they say that for her sake trojans and achaeans slay each other  she was embroidering at a vast web working in gold and scarlet the sorrows that for her sake befell mankind when they called her to the walls to see paris fight menelaus in the last year of the war  there she stands in raiment of silvery white her heart yearning for her old love and her own city  already her thought is far from paris  was her heart ever with paris  that is her secret  a very old legend mentioned by the bishop of thessalonica eustathius tells us that paris magically beguiled her disguised in the form of menelaus her lord as uther beguiled ygerne  she sees the son of priam play the dastard in the fight she turns in wrath on aphrodite who would lure her back to his arms but to his arms she must go for the daughter of zeus was afraid violence is put upon beauty it is soiled or seems soiled in its way through the world  helen urges paris again into the war  he has a heart invincibly light and gay shame does not weigh on him  not every man is valiant every day he says yet once engaged in battle he bears him bravely and his arrows rain death among the mailclad achaeans  what homer thinks of paris we can only guess  his beauty is the bane of ilios but homer forgives so much to beauty  in the end of the iliad helen sings the immortal dirge over hector the stainless knight with thy loving kindness and thy gentle speech  in the odyssey she is at home again playing the gracious part of hostess to odysseuss wandering son pouring into the bowl the magic herb of egypt which brings forgetfulness of sorrow  the wandering son of odysseus departs with a gift for his bride to wear upon the day of her desire a memorial of the hands of helen the beautiful hands that in troy or argos were never idle  of helen from homer we know no more  grace penitence in exile peace at home these are the portion of her who set east and west at war and ruined the city of priam of the ashen spear  as in the strange legend preserved by servius the commentator on virgil who tells us that helen wore a red starstone whence fell gouts of blood that vanished ere they touched her swans neck so all the blood shed for her sake leaves helen stainless  of homers helen we know no more  the later greek fancy playing about this form of beauty wove a myriad of new fancies or disinterred from legend old beliefs untouched by homer  helen was the daughter of the swanthat is as was later explained of zeus in the shape of a swan  her loveliness even in childhood plunged her in many adventures  theseus carried her off her brothers rescued her  all the princes of achaea competed for her hand having first taken an oath to avenge whomsoever she might choose for her husband  the choice fell on the correct and honourable but rather inconspicuous menelaus and they dwelt in sparta beside the eurotas in a hollow of the rifted hills  then from across the sea came the beautiful and fatal paris son of priam king of troy  as a child paris had been exposed on the mountains because his mother dreamed that she brought forth a firebrand  he was rescued and fostered by a shepherd he tended the flocks he loved the daughter of a river god oenone  then came the naked goddesses to seek at the hand of the most beautiful of mortals the prize of beauty  aphrodite won the golden apple from the queen of heaven hera and from the goddess of war and wisdom athena bribing the judge by the promise of the fairest wife in the world  no incident is more frequently celebrated in poetry and art to which it lends such gracious opportunities  paris was later recognised as of the royal blood of troy  he came to lacedaemon on an embassy he saw helen and destiny had its way  concerning the details in this most ancient lovestory we learn nothing from homer who merely makes paris remind helen of their bridal night in the isle of cranae  but from homer we learn that paris carried off not only the wife of menelaus but many of his treasures  to the poet of the iliad the psychology of the wooing would have seemed a simple matter like the later vasepainters he would have shown us paris beside helen aphrodite standing near accompanied by the figure of peithopersuasion  homer always escapes our psychological problems by throwing the weight of our deeds and misdeeds on a god or a goddess or on destiny  to have fled from her lord and her one child hermione was not in keeping with the character of helen as homer draws it  her repentance is almost christian in its expression and repentance indicates a consciousness of sin and of shame which helen frequently professes  thus she at least does not like homer in his chivalrous way throw all the blame on the immortals and on destiny  the cheerful acquiescence of helen in destiny makes part of the comic element in la belle helene but the mirth only arises out of the incongruity between parisian ideas and those of ancient greece  helen is freely and bitterly blamed in the odyssey by penelope chiefly because of the ruinous consequences which followed her flight  still there is one passage when penelope prudently hesitates about recognising her returned lord which makes it just possible that a legend chronicled by eustathius was known to homernamely the tale already mentioned that paris beguiled her in the shape of menelaus  the incident is very old as in the story of zeus and amphitryon and might be used whenever a ladys character needed to be saved  but this anecdote on the whole is inconsistent with the repentance of helen and is not in homers manner  the early lyric poet stesichorus is said to have written harshly against helen  she punished him by blindness and he indited a palinode explaining that it was not she who went to troy but a woman fashioned in her likeness by zeus out of mist and light  the real helen remained safely and with honour in egypt  euripides has made this idea which was calculated to please him the groundwork of his helena but it never had a strong hold on the greek imagination  modern fancy is pleased by the picture of the cloudbride in troy greeks and trojans dying for a phantasm  shadows we are and shadows we pursue  concerning the later feats and the death of paris homer says very little  he slew achilles by an arrowshot in the scaean gate and prophecy was fulfilled  he himself fell by another shaft perhaps the poisoned shaft of philoctetes  in the fourth or fifth century of our era a late poet quintus smyrnaeus described pariss journey in quest of a healing spell to the forsaken oenone and her refusal to aid him her death on his funeral pyre  quintus is a poet of extraordinary merit for his age and scarcely deserves the reproach of laziness affixed on him by lord tennyson  on the whole homer seems to have a kind of halfcontemptuous liking for the beautiful paris  later art represents him as a bowman of girlish charms wearing a phrygian cap  there is a late legend that he had a son corythus by oenone and that he killed the lad in a moment of jealousy finding him with helen and failing to recognise him  on the death of paris perhaps by virtue of the custom of the levirate helen became the wife of his brother deiphobus  how her reconciliation with menelaus was brought about we do not learn from homer who in the odyssey accepts it as a fact  the earliest traditional hint on the subject is given by the famous coffer of cypselus a work of the seventh century bc which pausanias saw at olympia in ad 174  here on a band of ivory was represented among other scenes from the tale of troy menelaus rushing sword in hand to slay helen  according to stesichorus the army was about to stone her after the fall of ilios but relented amazed by her beauty  of her later life in lacedaemon nothing is known on really ancient authority and later traditions vary  the spartans showed her sepulchre and her shrine at therapnae where she was worshipped  herodotus tells us how helen as a goddess appeared in her temple and healed a deformed child making her the fairest woman in sparta in the reign of ariston it may perhaps be conjectured that in sparta helen occupied the place of a local aphrodite  in another late story she dwells in the isle of leuke a shadowy bride of the shadowy achilles  the mocking lucian in his vera historia meets helen in the fortunate islands whence she elopes with one of his companions  again the sons of menelaus by a concubine were said to have driven helen from sparta on the death of her lord and she was murdered in rhodes by the vengeance of polyxo whose husband fell at troy  but among all these inventions that of homer stands out preeminent  helen and menelaus do not die they are too near akin to zeus they dwell immortal not among the shadows of heroes and of famous ladies dead and gone but in elysium the paradise at the worlds end unvisited by storms     beyond these voices there is peace  it is plain that as a lovestory the tale of paris and helen must to modern readers seem meagre  to greece in every age the main interest lay not in the passion of the beautiful pair but in its worldwide consequences the clash of europe and asia the deaths of kings the ruin wrought in their homes the consequent fall of the great and ancient achaean civilisation  to the greeks the trojan war was what the crusades are in later history  as in the crusades the west assailed the east for an ideal not to recover the holy sepulchre of our religion but to win back the living type of beauty and of charm  perhaps ere the sun grows cold men will no more believe in the crusades as an historical fact than we do in the siege of troy  in a sense a very obvious sense the myth of helen is a parable of hellenic history  they sought beauty and they found it they bore it home and with beauty their bane wherever helen went she brought calamity in this a type of all the famous and peerless ladies of old days of cleopatra and of mary stuart romance and poetry have nothing less plausible than the part which cleopatra actually played in the history of the world a world well lost by mark antony for her sake  the flight from actium might seem as much a mere poets dream as the gathering of the achaeans at aulis if we were not certain that it is truly chronicled  from the earliest times even from times before homer whose audience is supposed to know all about helen the imagination of greece and later the imagination of the civilised world has played around helen devising about her all that possibly could be devised  she was the daughter of zeus by nemesis or by leda or the daughter of the swan or a child of the changeful moon brooding on the formless and multiform waters  she could speak in the voices of all women hence she was named echo and we might fancy that like the witch of the brocken she could appear to every man in the likeness of his own first love  the ancient egyptians either knew her or invented legends of her to amuse the inquiring greeks  she had touched at sidon and perhaps astaroth is only her sidonian name  whatever could be told of beauty in its charm its perils the dangers with which it surrounds its lovers the purity which it retains unsmirched by all the sins that are done for beautys sake could be told of helen  like a golden cup as m paul de st victor says she was carried from lips to lips of heroes but the gold remains unsullied and unalloyed  to heaven she returns again to heaven which is her own and looks down serenely on men slain and women widowed and sinking ships and burning towns  yet with death she gives immortality by her kiss and paris and menelaus live because they have touched the lips of helen  through the grace of helen for whom he fell sarpedons memory endures and achilles and memnon the son of the morning and troy is more imperishable than carthage or rome or corinth though helen     burnt the topless towers of ilium  in one brief passage marlowe did more than all poets since stesichorus or at least since the epithalamium of theocritus for the glory of helen  roman poets knew her best as an enemy of their fabulous ancestors and in the aeneid virgils hero draws his sword to slay her  through the middle ages in the romances of troy she wanders as a shining shadow of the ideally fair like guinevere who so often recalls her in the arthurian romances  the chivalrous mediaeval poets and the celts could understand better than the romans the philosophy of the world well lost for love  modern poetry even in goethes second part of faust has not been very fortunately inspired by helen except in the few lines which she speaks in the dream of fair women     i had great beauty ask thou not my name  mr william morriss helen in the earthly paradise charms at the time of reading but perhaps leaves little abiding memory  the helen of troilus and cressida is not one of shakespeares immortal women and mr rossettis ballad is fantastic and somewhat false in tonea romantic pastiche  where euripides twice failed in the troades and the helena it can be given to few to succeed  helen is best left to her earliest known minstrel for who can recapture the grace the tenderness the melancholy and the charm of the daughter of zeus in the odyssey and iliad  the sightless eyes of homer saw her clearest and helen was best understood by the wisdom of his unquestioning simplicity  as if to prove how entirely though so many hands paltered with her legend helen is homers alone there remains no great or typical work of greek art which represents her beauty and the breasts from which were modelled cups of gold for the service of the gods  we have only paintings on vases or work on gems which though graceful is conventional and might represent any other heroine polyxena or eriphyle  no helen from the hands of phidias or scopas has survived to our time and the grass may be growing in therapnae over the shattered remains of her only statue  as stesichorus fabled that only an eidolon of helen went to troy so except in the iliad and odyssey we meet but shadows of her loveliness phantasms woven out of clouds and the light of setting suns     chapter xiii enchanted cigarettes   to dream over literary projects balzac says is like smoking enchanted cigarettes but when we try to tackle our projects to make them real the enchantment disappears  we have to till the soil to sow the seed to gather the leaves and then the cigarettes must be manufactured while there may be no market for them after all  probably most people have enjoyed the fragrance of these enchanted cigarettes and have brooded over much which they will never put on paper  here are some of the ashes of the weeds of my delightmemories of romances whereof no single line is written or is likely to be written  of my earliest novel i remember but little  i know there had been a wreck and that the villain who was believed to be drowned came home and made himself disagreeable  i know that the heroines mouth was not too large for regular beauty  in that respect she was original  all heroines are mucklemoud i know not why  it is expected of them  i know she was melancholy and merry it would not surprise me to learn that she drowned herself from a canoe  but the villain never descended to crime the first lover would not fall in love the heroines own affections were provokingly disengaged and the whole affair came to a dead stop for want of a plot  perhaps considering modern canons of fiction this might have been a very successful novel  it was entirely devoid of incident or interest and consequently was a good deal like real life as real life appears to many cultivated authors  on the other hand all the characters were flippant  this would never have done and i do not regret novel no i which had not even a name  the second story had a plot quantities of plot nothing but plot  it was to have been written in collaboration with a very great novelist who as far as we went confined himself to making objections  this novel was stopped not that my friend would ever have gone on by called back which anticipated part of the idea  the story was entitled where is rose and the motto was        rosa quo locorum    sera moratur  the characters were1 rose a young lady of quality  2 the russian princess her friend need i add that to meet a public demand her name was vera  3 young man engaged to rose  4 charles his friend  5 an enterprising person named the whiteley of crime the universal provider of iniquity  in fact he anticipated sir arthur doyles professor moriarty  the rest were detectives old ladies mob and a wealthy young colonial larrikin  neither my friend nor i was fond of describing love scenes so we made the heroine disappear in the second chapter and she never turned up again till chapter the last  after playing in a comedy at the house of an earl rosa and vera entered her brougham  soon afterwards the brougham drew up empty at roses own door  where was rose  traces of her were found of all places in the haunted house in berkeley square which is not haunted any longer  after that rose was long sought in vain  this briefly is what had occurred  a russian detective wanted vera who to be sure was a nihilist  to catch vera he made an alliance with the whiteley of crime  he was a man who would destroy a parish register or forge a will or crack a crib or break up a proboer meeting or burn a house or kidnap a rightful heir or manage a personation or issue amateur banknotes or what you please  thinking to kill two birds with one stone he carried off rose for her diamonds and vera for his friend the muscovite police official lodging them both in the haunted house  but there he and the russian came to blows and in the confusion vera made her escape while rose was conveyed as vera to siberia  not knowing how to dispose of her the russian police consigned her to a nunnery at the mouth of the obi  her lover in a yacht found her hidingplace and got a friendly nun to give her some narcotic known to the samoyeds  it was the old truc of the friar in romeo and juliet  at the mouth of the obi they do not bury the dead but lay them down on platforms in the open air  rose was picked up there by her lover accompanied by a chaperon of course was got on board the steam yacht and all went well  i forget what happened to the whiteley of crime  after him i still rather hankerhe was a humorous ruffian something could be made of the whiteley of crime  something has been made by the author of sherlock holmes  in yet another romance a gentleman takes his friend in a country place to see his betrothed  the friend who had only come into the neighbourhood that day is found dead next morning hanging to a tree gipsies and others are suspected  but the lover was the murderer  he had been a priest in south america and the lady was a catholic who knew not of his orders  now the friend fell in love with the lady at first sight on being introduced to her by the lover  as the two men walked home the friend threatened to reveal the lovers secrethis tonsurewhich would be fatal to his hopes  they quarrelled parted and the expriest lassoed his friend  the motive i think is an original one and not likely to occur to the first comer  the inventor is open to offers  the next novel based on a dream was called in search of qrart  what is qrart  i decline to divulge this secret beyond saying that qrart was a product of the civilisation which now sleeps under the snows of the pole  it was an article of the utmost value to humanity farther i do not intend to commit myself  the bride of a god was one of the characters  the next novel is at present my favourite cigarette  the scene is partly in greece partly at the parthian court about 8060 bc  crassus is the villain  the heroine was an actress in one of the wandering greek companies splendid strollers who played at the indian and asiatic courts  the story ends with the representation of the bacchae in parthia  the head of pentheus is carried by one of the bacchae in that drama  behold it is not a mask but the head of crassus and thus conveys the first news of the roman defeat  obviously this is a novel that needs a great deal of preliminary study as much indeed as salammbo  another story will deal with the icelandic discoverers of america  mr kipling however has taken the wind out of its sails with his sketch the finest story in the world  there are all the marvels and portents of the eyrbyggja saga to draw upon there are skraelings to fight and why should not karlsefnis son kill the last mastodon and as quetzalcoatl be the whitebearded god of the aztecs  after that a romance on the intrigues to make charles edward king of poland sounds commonplace  but much might be made of that too if the right man took it in hand  believe me there are plenty of stories left waiting for the man who can tell them  i have said it before but i say it again if i were king i would keep court officials mr stanley weyman mr mason mr kipling and others to tell me my own stories  i know the kind of thing which i like from the discovery of qrart to that of the french gold in the burn at loch arkaig or in the wood by the lochside that murray of broughton mentions  another cigarette i have the adventures of a poet a poet born in a puritan village of massachusetts about 1670  hawthorne could have told me my story and how my friend was driven into the wilderness and lived among the red men  i think he was killed in an attempt to warn his countrymen of an indian raid i think his ms poems have a bullethole through them and blood on the leaves  they were in carews best manner these poems  another tale hawthorne might have told me the tale of an excellent man whose very virtues by some baneful moral chemistry corrupt and ruin the people with whom he comes in contact  i do not mean by goading them into the opposite extremes but rather something like a moral jettatura this needs a great deal of subtlety and what is to become of the hero is he to plunge into vice till everybody is virtuous again  it wants working out  i have omitted after all a schoolboy historical romance explaining why queen elizabeth was never married  a scottish paper offered a prize for a story of queen mary stuarts reign  i did not get the prizeperhaps did not deserve it but my story ran thus you must know that queen elizabeth was singularly like darnley in personal appearance  what so natural as that disguised as a page her majesty should come spying about the court of holyrood  darnley sees her walking out of queen marys room he thinks her an hallucination discovers that she is real challenges her and they fight at faldonside by the tweed shakespeare holding elizabeths horse  elizabeth is wounded and is carried to the kirk of field and laid in darnleys chamber while darnley goes out and makes love to my rural heroine the lady of fernilee a kerr  that night bothwell blows up the kirk of field elizabeth and all  darnley has only one resource  borrowing the riding habit of the rural heroine the lady of fernilee he flees across the border and for the rest of his life personates queen elizabeth  that is why elizabeth who was darnley hated mary so bitterly on account of the kirk of field affair and that is why queen elizabeth was never married  sidelights on shakespeares sonnets were obviously cast  the young man whom shakespeare admired so and urged to marry wasdarnley this romance did not get the prize the anachronism about shakespeare is worthy of scott but i am conceited enough to think it deserved an honourable mention  enough of my own cigarettes  but there are others of a more fragrant weed  who will end for me the novel of which byron only wrote a chapter who as bulwer lytton is dead  a finer opening one more mysteriously stirring you can nowhere read  and the novel in letters which scott began in 1819 who shall finish it or tell us what he did with his fair venetian courtezan a character so much out of sir walters way  he tossed it asideit was but an enchanted cigaretteand gave us the fortunes of nigel in its place  i want both  we cannot call up those who left half told these stories  in a happier world we shall listen to their endings and all our dreams shall be coherent and concluded meanwhile without trouble and expense and disappointment and reviews we can all smoke our cigarettes of fairyland  would that many people were content to smoke them peacefully and did not rush on pen paper and ink     chapter xiv stories and storytelling from strath naver   we have had a drought for three weeks  during a whole week this northern strath has been as sunny as the riviera is expected to be  the streams can be crossed dryshod kelts are plunging in the pools but even kelts will not look at a fly  now by way of a pleasant change an icy north wind is blowing with gusts of snow not snow enough to swell the loch that feeds the river but just enough snow as the tourist said of the water in the river styx to swear by or at  the field announces that a duke who rents three rods on a neighbouring river has not yet caught one salmon  the acrimoniously democratic mind may take comfort in that intelligence but if the weather will not improve for a duke it is not likely to change for a mere person of letters  thus the devotee of the muses is driven back by stress of climate upon literature and as there is nothing in the lodge to read he is compelled to write  now certainly one would not lack material if only one were capable of the art of fiction  the genesis of novels and stories is a topic little studied but i am inclined to believe that like the pearls in the mussels of the river fiction is a beautiful disease of the brain something an incident or an experience or a reflection gets imbedded incrusted in the properly constituted mind and becomes the nucleus of a pearl of romance  mr marion crawford in a recent work describes his hero who is a novelist at work  this young gentleman by a series of faults or misfortunes has himself become a centre of harrowing emotion two young ladies to each of whom he has been betrothed are weeping out their eyes for him or are kneeling to heaven with despairing cries or are hardening their hearts to marry men for whom they do not care a bawbee  the heros aunt has committed a crime everybody in fact is in despair when an idea occurs to the hero  indifferent to the sorrows of his nearest and dearest he sits down with his notion and writes a novelwrites like a person possessed  he has the proper kind of brain the nucleus has been dropped into it the pearl begins to grow and to assume prismatic hues  so he is happy and even the frozenout angler might be happy if he could write a novel in the absence of salmon  unluckily my brain is not capable of this aesthetic malady and to save my life or to milk a fine warm cow rain as the zulus say i could not write a novel or even a short story  about the short story as they call it with capital letters our critical american cousins have much to say  its germ one fancies is usually an incident or a mere anecdote according to the nature of the authors brain this germ becomes either the pearl of a brief conte or the seed of a stately tree in three volumes  an author of experience soon finds out how he should treat his material  one writer informs me that given the idea the germinal idea it is as easy for him to make a novel out of it as a taleas easy and much more satisfactory and remunerative others like m guy de maupassant for example seem to find their strength in brevity in cutting down not in amplifying in selecting and reducing not in allowing other ideas to group themselves round the first other characters to assemble about those who are essential  that seems to be really the whole philosophy of this matter concerning which so many words are expended  the growth of the germinal idea depends on the nature of an authors talenthe may excel in expansion or in reduction he may be economical and out of an anecdote may spin the whole cocoon of a romance or he may be extravagant and give a capable idea away in the briefest form possible  these ideas may come to a man in many ways as we said from a dream from a fragmentary experience as most experiences in life are fragmentary from a hint in a newspaper from a tale told in conversation  not long ago for example i heard an anecdote out of which m guy de maupassant could have made the most ghastly the most squalid and the most supernaturally moving of all his contes  indeed that is not saying much as he did not excel in the supernatural  were it written in french it might lie in my ladys chamber and as times go nobody would be shocked  but by our curious british conventions this tale cannot be told in an english book or magazine  it was not in its tendency immoral those terrible tales never are  the events were rather calculated to frighten the hearer into the paths of virtue  when mr richard cameron the founder of the cameronians and the godfather of the cameronian regiment was sent to his parish he was bidden by mr peden to put hellfire to the tails of his congregation  this vigorous expression was well fitted to describe the conte which i have in my mind i rather wish i had it not and which is not to be narrated here nor in english  for a combination of pity and terror it seemed to me unmatched in the works of the modern fancy or in the horrors of modern experience whether in experience or in imagination it had its original source  but even the english authors who plume themselves on their audacity or their realism or their contempt for the young person would not venture this little romance much less then is a timidly uncorrect pen man likely to tempt mr mudie with the conte  it is one of two tales both told as true which one would like to be able to narrate in the language of moliere  the other is also very good and has a wonderful scene with a corpse and a chapelle ardente and a young lady it is historical and of the last generation but one  even our frozen strath here has its modern legend which may be told in english and out of which i am sure a novelist could make a good short story or a pleasant opening chapter of a romance  what is the mysterious art by which these things are done  what makes the welltold story seem real rich with life actual engrossing  it is the secret of genius of the novelists art and the writer who cannot practise the art might as well try to discover the philosophers stone or to harp fish out of the water  however let me tell the legend as simply as may be and as it was told to me  the strath runs due north the river flowing from a great loch to the northern sea  all around are low undulating hills brown with heather and as lonely almost as the sahara  on the horizon to the south rise the mountains ben this and ben that real mountains of beautiful outline though no higher than some three thousand feet  before the country was divided into moors and forests tenanted by makers of patent corkscrews and boilers of patent soap before the rivers were distributed into beats marked off by white and red posts there lived over to the south under the mountains a sportsman of athletic frame and adventurous disposition  his name i have forgotten but we may call him dick lindsay  it is told of him that he once found a poacher in the forest and being unable to catch the intruder fired his rifle not at him but in his neighbourhood whereon the poacher deliberately kneeling down took a long shot at dick  how the duel ended and whether either party flew a flag of truce history does not record  at all events one stormy day in late september dick had stalked and wounded a stag on the hills to the southeast of the strath  here if only one were a novelist one could weave several pages of valuable copy out of the stalk  the stag made for the strath here and dick who had no gillie but was an independent sportsman of the old school pursued on foot  plunging down the low birchclad hills the stag found the flooded river before him black and swollen with rain  he took the water crossing by the big pool which looked almost like a little loch tempestuous under a north wind blowing up stream and covered with small white vicious crests  the stag crossed and staggered up the bank where he stood panting  it is not a humane thing to leave a deer to die slowly of a rifle bullet and dick reaching the pool hesitated not but threw off his clothes took his skene between his teeth plunged in and swam the river  all naked as he was he cut the stags throat in the usual manner and gralloched him with all the skill of bucklaw  this was very well and very well it would be to add a description of the stag at bay but as i never happened to see a stag at bay i omit all that  dick had achieved success but his clothes were on one side of a roaring river in spate and he and the dead stag were on the other  there was no chance of fording the stream and there was then no bridge  he did not care to swim back for the excitement was out of him  he was trembling with cold and afraid of cramp  a mothernaked man in a wilderness with a flood between him and his raiment was in a pitiable position  it did not occur to him to flay the stag and dress in the hide and indeed he would have been frozen before he could have accomplished that task  so he reconnoitred  there was nobody within sight but one girl who was herding cows  now for a naked man with a knife and bedabbled with blood to address a young woman on a lonely moor is a delicate business  the chances were that the girl would flee like a startled fawn and leave dick to walk just as he was to the nearest farmhouse about a mile away  however dick had to risk it he lay down so that only his face appeared above the bank and he shouted to the maiden  when he had caught her attention he briefly explained the unusual situation  then the young woman behaved like a trump or like a highland nausicaa for students of the odyssey will remember how odysseus simply clad in a leafy bough of a tree made supplication to the seakings daughter and how she befriended him  even if dick had been a reader of homer which is not probable there were no trees within convenient reach and he could not adopt the leafy covering of odysseus  you sit still if you move an inch before i give you the word ill leave you where you are said miss mary  she then cast her plaid over her face marched up to the bank where dick was crouching and shivering dropped her ample plaid over him and sped away towards the farmhouse when she had reached its shelter and was giving an account of the adventure dick set forth like a primeval highlander the covering doing duty both for plaid and kilt  clothes of some kind were provided for him at the cottage a rickety old boat was fetched and he and his stag were rowed across the river to the place where his clothes lay  that is all but if one were a dealer in romance much play might be made with the future fortunes of the sportsman and the maiden happy fortunes or unhappy  in real life the lassie drew up with a shepherd lad as miss jenny denison has it married him and helped to populate the strath  as for dick history tells no more of his adventures nor is it alleged that he ever again visited the distant valley or beheld the face of his highland nausicaa  now if one were a romancer this mere anecdote probably would rest lovely pearl in the brain and slowly mature in the oyster till it became a novel  properly handled the incident would make a very agreeable first chapter with the aid of scenery botany climate and remarks on the manners and customs of the red deer stolen from st john or the stuarts dalbanie  then probably one would reflect on the characters of mary and of richard mary must have parents of course and one would make them talk in scottish  probably she already had a lover how should she behave to that lover  there is plenty of room for speculation in that problem  as to dick is he to be a lothario or a lover pour le bon motif  what are his distinguished family to think of the love affair which would certainly ensue in fiction though in real life nobody thought of it at all  are we to end happily with a marriage or marriages or are we to wind all up in the pleasant pessimistic realistic fashionable modern way  is mary to drown the baby in the muckle pool  is she to suffer the penalty of her crime at inverness  or happy thought shall we not make her discarded rival lover meet dick in the hills on a sunny day and thenare they not taking a hint from facts to fight a duel with rifles  i see dick lying with a bullet in his brow on the side of a corrie his blood crimsons the snow an eagle stoops from the sky  that makes a pretty picturesque conclusion to the unwritten romance of the strath  another anecdote occurs to me good i think for a short story but capable also of being dumped down in the middle of a long novel  it was in the old coaching days  a border squire was going north in the coach alone  at a village he was joined by a man and a young lady their purpose was manifest they were a runaway couple bound for gretna green  they had not travelled long together before the young lady turning to the squire said vous parlez francais monsieur  he did speak frenchit was plain that the bridegroom did notand to the end of the journey that remarkable lady conducted a lively and affectionate conversation with the squire in french  manifestly he had only to ask and receive but alas he was an unadventurous plain gentleman he alighted at his own village he drove home in his own dogcart the fugitive pair went forward and the gretna blacksmith united them in holy matrimony  the rest is silence  i would give much to know what that young persons previous history and adventures had been to learn what befell her after her wedding to understand in brief her conduct and her motives  were i a novelist a maupassant or a meredith the muse from whatsoever quarter she chose would enlighten me about all and i would enlighten you  but i can only marvel only throw out the hint only deposit the grain of sand the nucleus of romance in some more fertile brain  indeed the topic is much more puzzling than the right conclusion for my highland romance  in that case fancy could find certain obvious channels into one or other of which it must flow  but i see no channels for the lives of these three queerly met people in the coach  as a rule fancies are capable of being arranged in but a few familiar patterns so that it seems hardly worth while to make the arrangement but he who looks at things thus will never be a writer of stories  nay even of the slowly unfolding tale of his own existence he may weary for the combinations therein have all occurred before it is in a hackneyed old story that he is living and you and i  yet to act on this knowledge is to make a bad affair of our little life we must try our best to take it seriously  and so of storywriting  as mr stevenson says a man must view his very trifling enterprise with a gravity that would befit the cares of empire and think the smallest improvement worth accomplishing at any expense of time and industry  the book the statue the sonata must be gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the unflagging spirit of children at their play  that is true that is the worst of it  the man the writer over whom the irresistible desire to mock at himself his work his puppets and their fortunes has power will never be a novelist  the novelist must make believe very much he must be in earnest with his characters  but how to be in earnest how to keep the note of disbelief and derision out of the memorial  ah there is the difficulty but it is a difficulty of which many authors appear to be insensible  perhaps they suffer from no such temptations     chapter xv the supernatural in fiction   it is a truism that the supernatural in fiction should as a general rule be left in the vague  in the creepiest tale i ever read the horror lay in thisthere was no ghost  you may describe a ghost with all the most hideous features that fancy can suggestsaucer eyes red staring hair a forked tail and what you pleasebut the reader only laughs  it is wiser to make as if you were going to describe the spectre and then break off exclaiming but no  no pen can describe no memory thank heaven can recall the horror of that hour  so writers as a rule prefer to leave their terror usually styled the thing entirely in the dark and to the frightened fancy of the student thus on the whole the treatment of the supernaturally terrible in fiction is achieved in two ways either by actual description or by adroit suggestion the author saying like cabmen i leave it to yourself sir  there are dangers in both methods the description if attempted is usually overdone and incredible the suggestion is apt to prepare us too anxiously for something that never becomes real and to leave us disappointed  examples of both methods may be selected from poetry and prose  the examples in verse are rare enough the first and best that occurs in the way of suggestion is of course the mysterious lady in christabel     she was most beautiful to see    like a lady of a far countree  who was she  what did she want  whence did she come  what was the horror she revealed to the night in the bower of christabel     then drawing in her breath aloud    like one that shuddered she unbound    the cincture from beneath her breast    her silken robe and inner vest    dropt to her feet and full in view    behold her bosom and half her side    a sight to dream of not to tell    o shield her shield sweet christabel  and then what do her words mean     thou knowest tonight and wilt know tomorrow    this mark of my shame this seal of my sorrow  what was itthe sight to dream of not to tell  coleridge never did tell and though he and mr gilman said he knew wordsworth thought he did not know  he raised a spirit that he had not the spell to lay  in the paradise of poets has he discovered the secret we only know that the mischief whatever it may have been was wrought     o sorrow and shame  can this be she    the lady who knelt at the old oak tree          a star hath set a star hath risen       o geraldine since arms of thine    have been the lovely ladys prison       o geraldine one hour was thine 11  if coleridge knew why did he never tell  and yet he maintains that in the very first conception of the tale i had the whole present to my mind with the wholeness no less than with the liveliness of a vision and he expected to finish the three remaining parts within the year  the year was 1816 the poem was begun in 1797 and finished as far as it goes in 1800  if coleridge ever knew what he meant he had time to forget  the chances are that his indolence or his forgetfulness was the making of christabel which remains a masterpiece of supernatural suggestion  for description it suffices to read the ancient mariner  these marvels truly are speciosa miracula and unlike southey we believe as we read  you have selected a passage fertile in unmeaning miracles lamb wrote to southey 1798 but have passed by fifty passages as miraculous as the miracles they celebrate  lamb appears to have been almost alone in appreciating this masterpiece of supernatural description  coleridge himself shrank from his own wonders and wanted to call the piece a poets reverie  it is as bad as bottom the weavers declaration that he is not a lion but only the scenical representation of a lion  what new idea is gained by this title but one subversive of all creditwhich the tale should force upon usof its truth  lamb himself was forced by the temper of the time to declare that he disliked all the miraculous part of it as if it were not all miraculous  wordsworth wanted the mariner to have a character and a profession perhaps would have liked him to be a gardener or a butler with an excellent character  in fact the love of the supernatural was then at so low an ebb that a certain mr marshall went to sleep while the ancient mariner was reading and the book was mainly bought by seafaring men deceived by the title and supposing that the ancient mariner was a nautical treatise  in verse then coleridge succeeds with the supernatural both by way of description in detail and of suggestion  if you wish to see a failure try the ghost the moral but not affable ghost in wordsworths laodamia  it is blasphemy to ask the question but is the ghost in hamlet quite a success  do we not see and hear a little too much of him  macbeths airy and viewless dagger is really much more successful by way of suggestion  the stage makes a ghost visible and familiar and this is one great danger of the supernatural in art  it is apt to insist on being too conspicuous  did the ghost of darius in aeschylus frighten the athenians  probably they smiled at the imperial spectre there is more discretion in caesars ghost     i think it is the weakness of mine eyes    that shapes this monstrous apparition  says brutus and he lays no very great stress on the brief visit of the appearance  for want of this discretion alexandre dumass ghosts as in the corsican brothers are failures  they make themselves too common and too cheap like the spectre in mrs oliphants novel the wizards son  this indeed is the crux of the whole adventure  if you paint your ghost with too heavy a hand you raise laughter not fear  if you touch him too lightly you raise unsatisfied curiosity not fear  it may be easy to shudder but it is difficult to teach shuddering  in prose a good example of the over vague is miriams mysterious visitorthe shadow of the catacombsin transformation or the marble faun  hawthorne should have told us more or less to be sure his contemporaries knew what he meant knew who miriam and the spectre were the dweller in the catacombs now powerfully excites curiosity and when that curiosity is unsatisfied we feel aggrieved vexed and suspect that hawthorne himself was puzzled and knew no more than his readers  he has notas in other tales he hasmanaged to throw the right atmosphere about this being  he is vague in the wrong way whereas george sand in les dames vertes is vague in the right way  we are left in les dames vertes with that kind of curiosity which persons really engaged in the adventure might have felt not with the irritation of having a secret kept from us as in transformation  in wandering willies tale in redgauntlet the right atmosphere is found the right note is struck  all is vividly real and yet if you close the book all melts into a dream again  scott was almost equally successful with a described horror in the tapestried chamber  the idea is the commonplace of haunted houses the apparition is described as minutely as a burglar might have been and yet we do not mock but shudder as we read  then on the other sidethe side of anticipationtake the scene outside the closed door of the vanished dr jekyll in mr stevensons wellknown apologue  they are waiting on the threshold of the chamber whence the doctor has disappearedthe chamber tenanted by what  a voice comes from the room sir said poole looking mr utterson in the eyes was that my masters voice  a friend a man of affairs and a person never accused of being fanciful told me that he read through the book to that point in a lonely highland chateau at night and that he did not think it well to finish the story till next morning but rushed to bed  so the passage seems wellfound and successful by dint of suggestion  on the other side perhaps only scotsmen brought up in country places familiar from childhood with the terrors of cameronian myth and from childhood apt to haunt the lonely churchyards never stirred since the year of the great plague choked the soil with the dead perhaps they only know how much shudder may be found in mr stevensons thrawn janet  the black smouldering heat in the hills and glens that are commonly so fresh the aspect of the man the tempter of the brethren we know them and we have enough of the old blood in us to be thrilled by that masterpiece of the described supernatural  it may be only a local success it may not much affect the english reader but it is of sure appeal to the lowland scot  the ancestral covenanter within us awakens and is terrified by his ancient fears  perhaps it may die out in a positive agethis power of learning to shudder  to us it descends from very long ago from the faroff forefathers who dreaded the dark and who half starved and all untaught saw spirits everywhere and scarce discerned waking experience from dreams  when we are all perfect positivist philosophers when a thousand generations of nurses that never heard of ghosts have educated the thousand and first generation of children then the supernatural may fade out of fiction  but has it not grown and increased since wordsworth wanted the ancient mariner to have a profession and a character since southey called that poem a dutch piece of work since lamb had to pretend to dislike its miracles  why as science becomes more cock sure have men and women become more and more fond of old follies and more pleased with the stirring of ancient dread within their veins  as the visible world is measured mapped tested weighed we seem to hope more and more that a world of invisible romance may not be far from us or at least we care more and more to follow fancy into these airy regions et inania regna  the supernatural has not ceased to tempt romancers like alexandre dumas usually to their destruction more rarely as in mrs oliphants beleaguered city to such success as they do not find in the world of daily occupation  the ordinary shilling tales of hypnotism and mesmerism are vulgar trash enough and yet i can believe that an impossible romance if the right man wrote it in the right mood might still win us from the newspapers and the stories of shabby love and cheap remorses and commonplace failures     but it needs heavensent moments for this skill     chapter xvi an old scottish psychical researcher      advertisement     if any gentlemen and others will be pleased to send me any    relations about spirits witches and apparitions in any part of the    kingdom or any information about the second sight charms spells    magic and the like they shall oblige the author and have them    publisht to their satisfaction     direct your relations to alexander ogstouns shop stationer at the    foot of the plainstones at edinburgh on the northside of the    street  is this not a pleasing opportunity for gentlemen and others whose aunts have beheld wraiths doubles and fetches  it answers very closely to the requests of the society for psychical research who publish as some one disparagingly says the dreams of the middle classes  thanks to freedom progress and the decline of superstition it is now quite safe to see apparitions and even to publish the narrative of their appearance  but when mr george sinclair sometime professor of philosophy in glasgow issued the invitation which i have copied at the end of his satans invisible world discovered 12 the vocation of a seer was not so secure from harm  he or she might just as probably be burned as not on the charge of sorcery in the year of grace 1685  however professor sinclair managed to rake together an odd enough set of legends proving clearly that there are devils a desirable matter to have certainty about  satans invisible world discovered is a very rare little book i think scott says in a ms note that he had great difficulty in procuring it when he was at work on his infernal demonology  as a copy fell in my way or rather as i fell in its way a helpless victim to its charms and its blue morocco binding i take this chance of telling again the old tales of 1685  mr sinclair began with a long dedicatory epistle about nothing at all to the lord winton of the period  the earl dug coalmines and constructed a moliminous rampier for a harbour  a moliminous rampier is a choice phrase and may be envied by novelists who aim at distinction of style  your defending the salt pans against the imperious waves of the raging sea from the ne is singular adds the professor addressing the greatest coal and saltmaster in scotland who is a nobleman and the greatest nobleman who is a coal and salt merchant  perhaps it is already plain to the modern mind that mr george sinclair though a professor of philosophy was not a very sagacious character  mr sinclair professes that his proofs of the existence of devils are no old wifes trattles about the fire but such as may bide the test  he lived one should remember in an age when faith was really seeking aid from ghost stories  glanvils booksand in america those of cotton mathershow the hospitality to anecdotes of an edifying sort which we admire in mr sinclair  indeed sinclair borrows from glanvil and henry more authors who like himself wished to establish the existence of the supernatural on the strange incidents which still perplex us but which are scarcely regarded as safe matter to argue upon  the testimony for a ghost would seldom go to a jury in our days though amply sufficient in the time of mr sinclair  about the devil of glenluce he took particular care to be well informed and first gave it to the world in a volume onyou will never guess what subjecthydrostatics  in the present work he offers us     the devil of glenluce enlarged    with several remarkable additions    from an eye and ear witness    a person of undoubted    honesty  mr sinclair recommends its usefulness for refuting atheism  probably mr sinclair got the story or had it put off on him rather through one campbell a student of philosophy in glasgow the son of gilbert campbell a weaver of glenluce in galloway the scene in our own time of a mysterious murder  campbell had refused alms to alexander agnew a bold and sturdy beggar who when asked by the judge whether he believed in a god answered he knew no god but salt meal and water  in consequence of the refusal of alms the stirs first began  the stirs are ghostly disturbances  they commenced with whistling in the house and out of it such as children use to make with their small slender glass whistles  about the middle of november says mr sinclair the foul fiend came on with his extraordinary assaults  observe that he takes the foul fiend entirely for granted and that he never tells us the date of the original quarrel and the early agitation  stones were thrown down the chimney and in at the windows but nobody was hurt  naturally gilbert campbell carried his tale of sorrow to the parish minister  this did not avail him  his warp and threads were cut on his loom and even the clothes of his family were cut while they were wearing them  at night something tugged the blankets off their beds a favourite old spiritual trick which was played if i remember well on a roman emperor according to suetonius  poor campbell had to remove his stock intrade and send his children to board out to try whom the trouble did most follow  after this all was quiet as perhaps might be expected and quiet all remained till a son named thomas was brought home again  then the house was twice set on fire and it might have been enough to give thomas a beating  on the other hand campbell sent thomas to stay with the minister  but the troubles continued in the old way  at last the family became so accustomed to the devil that they were no more afraid to keep up the clash chatter with the foul fiend than to speak to each other  they were like the wesleys who were so familiar with the fiend jeffrey that haunted their home  the minister with a few of the gentry heard of their unholy friendship and paid campbell a visit  at their first coming in the devil says quum literarum is good latin  these are the first words of the latin rudiments which scholars are taught when they go to the grammar school  then they all prayed and a voice came from under the bed would you know the witches of glenluce  the voice named a few including one long dead  but the minister with rare good sense remarked that what satan said was not evidence  let it be remarked that the lad tom had that very day come back with the minister  the fiend then offered terms  give me a spade and shovel and depart from the house for seven days and i will make a grave and lie down in it and trouble you no more  hereon campbell with scottish caution declined to give the devil the value of a straw the visitors then hunted after the voice observing that some of the children were in bed  they found nothing and then as the novelists say a strange thing happened  there appeared a naked hand and an arm from the elbow down beating upon the floor till the house did shake again  the fiend next exclaimed that if the candle were put out he would appear in the shape of fireballs  let it be observed that now for the first time we learn that all the scene occurred in candlelight  the appearance of floating balls of fire is frequent if we may believe the current reports at spiritualistic seances  but what a strange illdigested tale is mr sinclairs  he lets slip an expression which shows that the investigators were in one room the but while the fiend was diverting himself in the other room the ben  the fiend nobody going ben next chaffed a gentleman who wore a fashionable broadbrimmed hat whereupon he presently imagined that he felt a pair of shears going about his hat but there was no such matter the voice asked for a piece of bread which the others were eating and said the maid gave him a crust in the morning  this she denied but admitted that something had clicked a piece of bread out of her hand  the seance ended the devil slapping a safe portion of the childrens bodies with a sound resembling applause  after many months of this really annoying conduct poor campbell laid his case before the presbyters in 1655 thirty years before the date of publication  so a solemn humiliation was actually held all through the bounds of the synod  but to little purpose did glenluce sit in sackcloth and ashes the good wifes plate was snatched away before her very eyes and then thrown back at her  in similar stirs described by a catholic missionary in peru soon after pizarros conquest the cup of an indian chief was lifted up by an invisible hand and set down empty  in that case too stones were thrown as by the devil of glenluce  and what was the end of it all  mr sinclair has not even taken the trouble to inquire  it seems by some conjuration or other the devil suffered himself to be put away and gave the weaver a habitation  the weaver has been a very odd man that endured so long these marvellous disturbances  this is the tale which mr sinclair offers without mentioning his authority  he complains that dr henry more had plagiarised it from his book of hydrostatics  two points may be remarked  first modern psychical inquirers are more particular about evidence than mr sinclair not for nothing do we live in an age of science  next the stories of these stirs are always much the same everywhere in glenluce at tedworth where the drummer came in peru in wesleys house in heroic iceland when glam the vampire rode the roofs  it is curious to speculate on how the tradition of making themselves little nuisances in this particular manner has been handed down among children if we are to suppose that children do the trick  last autumn a farmers house in scotland was annoyed exactly as the weavers home was and that within a quarter of a mile of a wellknown man of science  the mattress of the father was tenanted by something that wriggled like a snake  the mattress was opened nothing was found and the disturbance began again as soon as the bed was restored to its place  this occurred when the farmers children had been sent to a distance  one cannot but be perplexed by the problem which these tales suggest almost bare of evidence as they are their great number their wide diffusion in many countries and in times ancient and modern may establish some substratum of truth  scott mentions a case in which the imposture was detected by a sheriffs officer  but a recent anecdote makes me almost distrust the detection  some english people having taken a country house in ireland were vexed by the usual rappings stonethrowings and all the rest of the business they sent to dublin for two detectives who arrived  on their first night the lady of the house went into a room where she found one of the policemen asleep in his chair  being a lively person she rapped twice or thrice on the table  he awakened and said ah so i suspected  it was hardly worth while madam to bring us so far for this  and next day the worthy men withdrew in dudgeon but quite convinced that they had discovered the agent in the hauntings  but they had not  on the other hand scott who had seen one ghost if not two and had heard a warning states that miss anne robinson managed the stockwell disturbances by tying horsehairs to plates and light articles which then demeaned themselves as if possessed  here we have vera causa a demonstrable cause of stirs and it may be inferred that all the other historical occurrences had a similar origin we have then only to be interested in the persistent tradition in accordance with which mischievous persons always do exactly the same sort of thing  but this is a mere example of the identity of human nature  it is curious to see how mr sinclair plumes himself on this devil of glenluce as a moliminous rampier against irreligion  this one relation is worth all the price that can be given for the book  the price i have given for the volume is ten golden guineas and perhaps the foul thief of glenluce is hardly worth the money  i believe if the obdurest atheist among men would seriously and in good earnest consider that relation and ponder all the circumstances thereof he would presently cry out as a dr of physick did hearing a story less considerable i believe i have been in the wrong all the timeif this be true  mr sinclair is also a believer in the woodstock devils on which scott founded his novel  he does not give the explanation that giles sharp alias joseph collins of oxford alias funny joe was all the devil in that affair  scott had read the story of funny joe but could never remember whether it exists in a separate collection or where it is to be looked for  indifferent to evidence mr sinclair confutes the obdurest atheists with the pied piper of hamelin with the young lady from howells letters whose house like rahabs was on the city wall and with the ghost of the major who appeared to the captain as he had promised and scolded him for not keeping his sword clean  he also gives us major weir at full length convincing us that as william erskine said the major was a disgusting fellow a most ungentlemanlike character  scott on the other hand remarked long before waverley if i ever were to become a writer of prose romances i think i would choose major weir if not for my hero at least for an agent and a leading one in my production  he admitted that the street where the major lived was haunted by a woman twice the common length but why should we set him down for an ungentlemanly fellow  readers of mr sinclair will understand the reason very well and it is not necessary nor here even possible to justify erskines opinion by quotations  suffice it that by virtue of his enchanted staff which was burned with him the major was enabled to commit evil not to be named yea even to reconcile man and wife when at variance  his sister who was hanged had redgauntlets horseshoe mark on her brow and one may marvel that scott does not seem to have remembered this coincidence  there was seen an exact horseshoe shaped for nails in her wrinkles  terrible enough i assure you to the stoutest beholder  most modern readers will believe that both the luckless major and his sister were religious maniacs  poverty solitude and the superstition of their time were the true demon of major weir burned at the stake in april 1670  perhaps the most singular impression made by satans invisible world discovered is that in sinclairs day people who did not believe in bogies believed in nothing while people who shared the common creed of christendom were capable of believing in everything  atheists are as common as ghosts in his marvellous relations and the very wizards themselves were often atheists  notei have said that scott himself had seen one ghost if not two and heard a warning  the ghost was seen near ashestiel on an open spot of hillside please to observe it was before dinner  the anecdote is in gilliss recollections of sir walter scott p 170  the vision of lord byron standing in the great hall of abbotsford is described in the demonology and witchcraft   scott alleges that it resolved itself into great coats shawls and plaidsa hallucination  but lockhart remarks life ix p 141 that he did not care to have the circumstance discussed in general  the stirs in abbotsford during the night when his architect bullock died in london are in lockhart v pp 309315 the noise resembled halfadozen men hard at work putting up boards and furniture and nothing can be more certain than that there was nobody on the premises at the time  the noise unluckily occurred twice april 28 and 29 1818 and lockhart does not tell us on which of these two nights mr bullock died  such is the casualness of ghost storytellers lockhart adds that the coincidence made a strong impression on sir walters mind  he did not care to ascertain the point in his own mental constitution where incredulity began to waver according to his friend mr j l adolphus     chapter xvii the boy   as a humble student of savage life i have found it necessary to make researches into the manners and customs of boys  boys are not what a vain people supposes  if you meet them in the holidays you find them affable and full of kindness and good qualities  they will condescend to your weakness at lawntennis they will aid you in your selection of fly hooks and to be brief will behave with much more than the civility of tame zulus or red men on a missionary settlement  but boys at school and among themselves left to the wild justice and traditional laws which many generations of boys have evolved are entirely different beings they resemble that polynesian prince who had rejected the errors of polytheism for those of an extreme sect of primitive seceders  for weeks at a time this prince was known to be steady but every month or so he disappeared and his subjects said he was lying off  to adopt an american idiom he felt like brandy and water he also felt like wearing no clothes and generally rejecting his new conceptions of duty and decency  in fact he had a good bout of savagery and then he returned to his tall hat his varnished boots his hymnbook and his edifying principles  the life of small boys at school before they get into longtailed coats and the upperfifth is often a mere course of lyingoffof relapse into native savagery with its laws and customs  if any one has so far forgotten his own boyhood as to think this description exaggerated let him just fancy what our comfortable civilised life would be if we could become boys in character and custom let us suppose that you are elected to a new club of which most of the members are strangers to you  you enter the doors for the first time when two older members who have been gossiping in the hall pounce upon you with the exclamation hullo heres a new fellow  you fellow whats your name  you reply let us say johnson  i dont believe it its such a rum name  whats your father  perhaps you are constrained to answer a duke or more probably a solicitor  in the former case your friends bound up into the smokingroom howling heres a new fellow says his father is a duke  lets take the cheek out of him  and they take it out with umbrellas slippers and other surgical instruments  or in the latter case your parent being a solicitor they reply then your father must be a beastly cad  all solicitors are sharks  my father says so and he knows  how many sisters have you  the new member answers four  any of them married  no  how awfully awkward for you  by this time perhaps luncheon is ready or the evening papers come in and you are released for a moment  you sneak up into the library where you naturally expect to be entirely alone and you settle on a sofa with a novel  but an old member bursts into the room spies a new fellow and puts him through the usual catechism  he ends with how much tin have you got  you answer twenty pounds or whatever the sum may be for perhaps you had contemplated playing whist  very well fork it out you must give a dinner all new fellows must and you are not going to begin by being a stingy beast  thus addressed as your friend is a big bald man who looks mischievous you do fork out all your ready money and your new friend goes off to consult the cook  meanwhile you shed a blooming tear as homer says and go home heartbroken  now does any grownup man call this state of society civilisation  would life be worth living whatever ones religious consolations on these terms  of course not and yet this picture is a not overdrawn sketch of the career of some new boy at some schools new or old  the existence of a small schoolboy is in other respects not unlike that of an outsider in a lawless brotherhood as the irish playfully call their murder clubs  the small boy is in the society but not of it as far as any benefits go  he has to field out and i admit that the discipline is salutary while other boys bat  other boys commit the faults and compel him to copy out the impositionssay five hundred lines of virgilwith which their sins are visited  other boys enjoy the pleasures of football while the small boy has to run vaguely about never within five yards of the ball  big boys reap the glories of paperchases the small boy gets lost in the bitter weather on the open moors or perhaps as in one historical case is frozen to death within a measurable distance of the school playground  and the worst of it is that as a member of the great school secret society the small boy can never complain of his wrongs or divulge the name of his tormentors  it is in this respect that he resembles a harmless fellow dragged into the coils of an anarchist inner brotherhood  he is exposed to all sorts of wrongs from his neighbours and he can only escape by turning informer by breaking the most sacred law of his society losing all social status and probably obliging his parents to remove him from school  life at school as among the celtic peoples turns on the belief that law and authority are natural enemies against which every one is banded  the chapter of bullying among boys is one on which a man enters with reluctance  boys are on the whole such good fellows and so full of fine unsophisticated qualities that the mature mind would gladly turn away its eyes from beholding their iniquities  even a cruel bully does not inevitably and invariably develop into a bad man  he is let us hope only passing through the savage stage in which the torture of prisoners is a recognised institution  he has perhaps too little imagination to understand the pain he causes  very often bullying is not physically cruel but only a perverted sort of humour such as kingsley in hypatia recognised among his favourite goths  i remember a feeble foolish boy at school feeble he certainly was and was thought foolish who became the subject of much humorous bullying  his companions used to tie a thin thread round his ear and attach this to a bar at such a height that he could only avoid breaking it by standing on tiptoe  but he was told that he must not break the thread  to avoid infringing this commandment he put himself to considerable inconvenience and afforded much enjoyment to the spectators  men of middle age rather early middle age remember the two following species of bullying to which they were subjected and which perhaps are obsolescent  tall stools were piled up in a pyramid and the victim was seated on the top near the roof of the room  the other savages brought him down from this bad eminence by hurling other stools at those which supported him  or the victim was made to place his hands against the door with the fingers outstretched while the young tormentors played at the chinese knifetrick  they threw knives that is to say at the door between the apertures of the fingers and as a rule they hit the fingers and not the door  these diversions i know to be correctly reported but the following pretty story is perhaps a myth  at one of the most famous public schools a praepostor or monitor or sixthform boy having authority heard a pistolshot in the room above his own  he went up and found a big boy and a little boy  they denied having any pistol  the monitor returned to his studies again was sure he heard a shot went up and found the little boy dead  the big boy had been playing the william tell trick with him and had hit his head instead of the apple  that is the legend  whether it be true or false all boys will agree that the little victim could not have escaped by complaining to the monitor  no  death before dishonour  but the side not so seamy of this picture of school life is the extraordinary power of honour among boys  of course the laws of the secret society might well terrify a puerile informer  but the sentiment of honour is even more strong than fear and will probably outlast the very disagreeable circumstances in which it was developed  people say bullying is not what it used to be  the much abused monitorial system has this in it of good that it enables a clever and kindly boy who is high up in the school to stop the cruelties if he hears of them of a much bigger boy who is low in the school  but he seldom hears of them  habitual bullies are very cunning and i am acquainted with instances in which they carry their victims off to lonely torture cells so to speak and deserted places fit for the sport  some years ago a small boy after a long course of ropesending in outofthe way dens revealed the abominations of some naval cadets  there was not much sympathy with him in the public mind and perhaps his case was not well managed  but it was made clear that whereas among men an unpopular person is only spoken evil of behind his back an unpopular small boy among boys is made to suffer in a more direct and very unpleasant way  most of us leave school with the impression that there was a good deal of bullying when we were little but that the institution has died out  the truth is that we have grown too big to be bullied and too goodnatured to bully ourselves  when i left school i thought bullying was an extinct art like encaustic painting before it was rediscovered by sir william richmond  but a distinguished writer who was a small boy when i was a big one has since revealed to me the most abominable cruelties which were being practised at the very moment when i supposed bullying to have had its day and ceased to be  now the small boy need only have mentioned the circumstances to any one of a score of big boys and the tormentor would have been first thrashed and then probably expelled  a friend of my own was travelling lately in a wild and hilly region on the other side of the world let us say in the mountains of the moon  in a mountain tavern he had thrust upon him the society of the cook a very useless young man who astonished him by references to one of our universities and to the enjoyments of that seat of learning  this youth who was made cook and a very bad cook too because he could do nothing else had been expelled from a large english school  and he was expelled because he had felled a bully with a pavingstone and had expressed his readiness to do it again  now there was no doubt that this cook in the mountain inn was a very unserviceable young fellow  but i wish more boys who have suffered things literally unspeakable from bullies would try whether force in the form of a paving stone is really no remedy  the catholic author of a recent book schools by lieutcol raleigh chichester is very hard on protestant schools and thinks that the catholic system of constant watching is a remedy for bullying and other evils  swingdoors with their upper half glazed might have their uses he says and he does not see why a boy should not be permitted to complain if he is roasted like tom brown before a large fire  the boys at one catholic school described by colonel raleigh chichester are never without surveillance of some sort  this is true of most french schools and any one who wishes to understand the consequences there may read the published confessions of a pionan usher or spy  a more degraded and degrading life than that of the wretched pion it is impossible to imagine  in an english private school the system of espionnage and tale bearing when it exists is probably not unlike what mr anstey describes in vice versa  but in the catholic schools spoken of by colonel raleigh chichester the surveillance may be as he says that of a parent an aid to the boys in their games rather than a check  the religious question as between catholics and protestants has no essential connection with the subject  a protestant school might and grimstones did have talebearers possibly a catholic school might exist without parental surveillance  that system is called by its foes a police by its friends a paternal system  but fathers dont exercise the paternal system themselves in this country and we may take it for granted that while english society and religion are as they are surveillance at our large schools will be impossible  if any one regrets this let him read the descriptions of french schools and schooldays in balzacs louis lambert in the memoirs of m maxime du camp in any book where a frenchman speaks his mind about his youth  he will find spying of course among the ushers contempt and hatred on the side of the boys unwholesome and cruel punishments a total lack of healthy exercise and he will hear of holidays spent in premature excursions into forbidden and shady quarters of the town  no doubt the best security against bullying is in constant occupation there can hardly in spite of master george osbornes experience in vanity fair be much bullying in an open cricketfield  big boys too with good hearts should not only stop bullying when they come across it but make it their business to find out where it exists  exist it will more or less despite all precautions while boys are boysthat is are passing through a modified form of the savage state  there is a curious fact in the boyish character which seems at first sight to make good the opinion that private education at home is the true method  before they go out into school life many little fellows of nine or so are extremely original imaginative and almost poetical they are fond of books fond of nature and if you can win their confidence will tell you all sorts of pretty thoughts and fancies which lie about them in their infancy  i have known a little boy who liked to lie on the grass and to people the alleys and glades of that miniature forest with fairies and dwarfs whom he seemed actually to see in a kind of vision  but he went to school he instantly won the hundred yards race for boys under twelve and he came back a young barbarian interested in the theory of touch at football curious in the art of bowling and no more capable than you or i of seeing fairies in a green meadow  he was caught up into the air of the boys world and his imagination was in abeyance for a season  this is a common enough thing and rather a melancholy spectacle to behold  one is tempted to believe that school causes the loss of a good deal of genius and that the small boys who leave home poets and come back barbarians have been wasted  but on the other hand if they had been kept at home and encouraged the chances are that they would have blossomed into infant phenomena and nothing better  the awful infancy of mr john stuart mill is a standing warning  mr mill would probably have been a much happier and wiser man if he had not been a precocious linguist economist and philosopher but had passed through a healthy stage of indifference to learning and speculation at a public school look again at the childhood of bishop thirlwall  his primitiae were published by samuel tipper london 1808 when young connop was but eleven years of age  his indiscreet father launched this slender bark as he says and it sailed through three editions between 1808 and 1809 young thirlwall was taught latin at three years of age and at four read greek with an ease and fluency which astonished all who heard him  at seven he composed an essay on the uncertainty of human life but his taste for poetry was not discovered till a later period  his sermons some forty occupy most of the little volume in which these primitiae were collected  he was especially concerned about sabbath desecration  i confess observes this sage of ten when i look upon the present and past state of our public morals and when i contrast our present luxury dissipation and depravity with past frugality and virtue i feel not merely a sensation of regret but also of terror for the result of the change  the late revolution in france he adds has afforded us a remarkable lesson how necessary religion is to a state and that from a deficiency on that head arise the chief evils which can befall society he then bids us remember that the nebuchadnezzar who may destroy our israel is near at hand though it might be difficult to show how nebuchadnezzar destroyed israel  as to the uncertainty of life he remarks that edward vi died in his minority and disappointed his subjects to whom he had promised a happy reign  of this infants thirtynine sermons just as many as the articles it may be said that they are in no way inferior to other examples of this class of literature  but sermons are among the least scarce and rare of human essays and many parents would rather see their boy patiently acquiring the art of wicketkeeping at school than moralising on the uncertainty of life at home  some one having presented to the young author a copy of verses on the trite and familiar subject of the ploughboy he replied with an ode on the potboy     bliss is not always joind to wealth       nor dwells beneath the gilded roof    for poverty is bliss with health       of that my potboy stands a proof  the volume ends with this determination     still shall i seek apollos sheltring ray    to cheer my spirits and inspire my lay  if any parent or guardian desires any further information about les enfans devenus celebres par leurs ecrits he will find it in a work of that name published in paris in 1688  the learned scioppius published works at sixteen which deserved and perhaps obtained the admiration of dotards  m du maurier asserts that at the age of fifteen grotius pleaded causes at the bar  at eleven meursius made orations and harangues which were much admired  at fifteen alexandre le jeune wrote anacreontic verses and less excusably a commentary on the institutions of gaius  grevin published a tragedy and two comedies at the age of thirteen and at fifteen louis stella was a professor of greek  but no one reads grevin now nor stella nor alexandre le jeune and perhaps their time might have been better occupied in being soaring human boys than in composing tragedies and commentaries  monsieur le duc de maine published in 1678 his oeuvres dun auteur de sept ans a royal example to be avoided by all boys  these and several score of other examples may perhaps reconcile us to the spectacle of puerile genius fading away in the existence of the common british schoolboy who is nothing of a poet and still less of a jurisconsult  the british authors who understand boys best are not those who have written books exclusively about boys  there is canon farrar for example whose romances of boyish life appear to be very popular but whose boys somehow are not real boys  they are too good when they are good and when they are bad they are not perhaps too bad that is impossible but they are bad in the wrong way  they are bad with a mannish and conscious vice whereas even bad boys seem to sin less consciously and after a ferocious fashion of their own  of the boys in tom brown it is difficult to speak because the rugby boy under arnold seems to have been of a peculiar species  a contemporary pupil was asked when an undergraduate what he conceived to be the peculiar characteristic of rugby boys  he said after mature reflection that the differentia of the rugby boy was his moral thoughtfulness  now the characteristic of the ordinary boy is his want of what is called moral thoughtfulness  he lives in simple obedience to school traditions  these may compel him at one school to speak in a peculiar language and to persecute and beat all boys who are slow at learning this language  at another school he may regard dislike of the manly game of football as the sin with which heaven heads the count of crimes  on the whole this notion seems a useful protest against the prematurely artistic beings who fill their studies with photographs of greek fragments vases etchings by the newest etcher bits of china oriental rugs and very curious old brass candlesticks  the challenge cup soon passes away from the keeping of any house in a public school where bunthorne is a popular and imitated character  but when we reach aesthetic boys we pass out of the savage stage into hobbledehoyhood  the bigger boys at public schools are often terribly advanced and when they are not at work or play they are vexing themselves with the riddle of the earth evolution agnosticism and all that kind of thing  latin verses may not be what conservatives fondly deem them and even cricket may it is said become too absorbing a pursuit but either or both are better than precocious freethinking and sacrifice on the altar of the beautiful  a big boy who is tackling haeckel or composing virelais in playtime is doing himself no good and is worse than useless to the society of which he is a member  the small boys who are the most ardent of heroworshippers either despise him or they allow him to address them in chansons royaux and respond with trebles in triolets  at present a great many boys leave school pass three years or four at the universities and go back as masters to the place where some of their old schoolfellows are still pupils  it is through these very young masters perhaps that advanced speculations and tastes get into schools where however excellent in themselves they are rather out of place  indeed the very young master though usually earnest in his work must be a sage indeed if he can avoid talking to the elder boys about the problems that interest him and so forcing their minds into precocious attitudes  the advantage of eton boys used to be perhaps is still that they came up to college absolutely destitute of ideas and guiltless of reading anything more modern than virgil  thus their intellects were quite fallow and they made astonishing progress when they bent their fresh and unwearied minds to study  but too many boys now leave school with settled opinions derived from the very latest thing out from the newest german pessimist or american socialist  it may however be argued that ideas of these sorts are like measles and that it is better to take them early and be done with them for ever  while schools are reformed and latin grammars of the utmost ingenuity and difficulty are published boys on the whole change very little  they remain the beings whom thackeray understood better than any other writer thackeray who liked boys so much and was so little blind to their defects  i think he exaggerates their habit of lying to masters or if they lied in his day their character has altered in that respect and they are more truthful than many men find it expedient to be  and they have given up fighting the old battles between berry and biggs or dobbin and cuff major are things of the glorious past  big boys dont fight and there is a whisper that little boys kick each others shins when in wrath  that practice can hardly be called an improvement even if we do not care for fisticuffs  perhaps the gloves are the best peacemakers at school  when all the boys by practice in boxing know pretty well whom they can in a friendly way lick they are less tempted to more crucial experiments without the gloves  but even the ascertainment of ones relative merits with the gloves hurts a good deal and one may thank heaven that the fountain of youth as described by pontus de tyarde is not a common beverage  by drinking this liquid says the old frenchman one is insensibly brought back from old to middle age and to youth and boyhood  but one would prefer to stop drinking of the fountain before actually being reduced to boys estate and passing once more through the tumultuous experiences of that period  and of these not having enough to eat is by no means the least common  the evidence as to execrable dinners is rather dispiriting and one may end by saying that if there is a worse fellow than a bully it is a master who does not see that his boys are
