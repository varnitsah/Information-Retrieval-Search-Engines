92814459	essays  scientific political  speculative   by  herbert spencer   library edition  otherwise fifth thousand  containing seven essays not before republished and various other additions   vol i

preface   excepting those which have appeared as articles in periodicals during the last eight years the essays here gathered together were originally republished in separate volumes at long intervals the first volume appeared in december 1857 the second in november 1863 and the third in february 1874 by the time the original editions of the first two had been sold american reprints differently entitled and having the essays differently arranged had been produced and for economys sake i have since contented myself with importing successive supplies printed from the american stereotype plates of the third volume however supplies have as they were required been printed over here from plates partly american and partly english the completion of this final edition of course puts an end to this makeshift arrangement  the essays above referred to as having been written since 1882 are now incorporated with those previously republished there are seven of them namelymorals and moral sentiments the factors of organic evolution professor greens explanations the ethics of kant absolute political ethics from freedom to bondage and the americans as well as these large additions there are small additions in the shape of postscripts to various essaysone to the constitution of the sun one to the philosophy of style one to railway morals one to prison ethics and one to the origin and function of music which last is about equal in length to the original essay changes have been made in many of the essays in some cases by omitting passages and in other cases by including new ones especially the essay on the nebular hypothesis may be named as one which though unchanged in essentials has been much altered by additions and subtractions and by bringing its statements up to date so that it has been in large measure recast beyond these respects in which this final edition differs from preceding editions it differs in having undergone a verification of its references and quotations as well as a second verbal revision  naturally the fusion of three separate series of essays into one series has made needful a general rearrangement whether to follow the order of time or the order of subjects was a question which presented itself and as neither alternative promised satisfactory results i eventually decided to compromiseto follow partly the one order and partly the other the first volume is made up of essays in which the idea of evolution general or special is dominant in the second volume essays dealing with philosophical questions with abstract and concrete science and with aesthetics are brought together but though all of them are tacitly evolutionary their evolutionism is an incidental rather than a necessary trait the ethical political and social essays composing the third volume though mostly written from the evolution point of view have for their more immediate purposes the enunciation of doctrines which are directly practical in their bearings meanwhile within each volume the essays are arranged in order of time not indeed strictly but so far as consists with the requirements of subclassing  beyond the essays included in these three volumes there remain several which i have not thought it well to includein some cases because of their personal character in other cases because of their relative unimportance and in yet other cases because they would scarcely be understood in the absence of the arguments to which they are replies but for the convenience of any who may wish to find them i append their titles and places of publication these are as

brief     though it is i place this essay before the rest partly because     with the exception of a similarlybrief essay on use and beauty     it came first in order of time but chiefly because it came first in     order of thought and struck the keynote of all that was to     follow   in a debate upon the development hypothesis lately narrated to me by a friend one of the disputants was described as arguing that as in all our experience we know no such phenomenon as transmutation of species it is unphilosophical to assume that transmutation of species ever takes place had i been present i think that passing over his assertion which is open to criticism i should have replied that as in all our experience we have never known a species created it was by his own showing unphilosophical to assume that any species ever had been created  those who cavalierly reject the theory of evolution as not being adequately supported by facts seem to forget that their own theory is supported by no facts at all like the majority of men who are born to a given belief they demand the most rigorous proof of any adverse belief but assume that their own needs none here we find scattered over the globe vegetable and animal organisms numbering of the one kind according to humboldt some 320000 species and of the other some 2000000 species see carpenter and if to these we add the numbers of animal and vegetable species which have become extinct we may safely estimate the number of species that have existed and are existing on the earth at not less than ten millions well which is the most rational theory about these ten millions of species is it most likely that there have been ten millions of special creations or is it most likely that by continual modifications due to change of circumstances ten millions of varieties have been produced as varieties are being produced still  doubtless many will reply that they can more easily conceive ten millions of special creations to have taken place than they can conceive that ten millions of varieties have arisen by successive modifications all such however will find on inquiry that they are under an illusion this is one of the many cases in which men do not really believe but rather believe they believe it is not that they can truly conceive ten millions of special creations to have taken place but that they think they can do so careful introspection will show them that they have never yet realized to themselves the creation of even one species if they have formed a definite conception of the process let them tell us how a new species is constructed and how it makes its appearance is it thrown down from the clouds or must we hold to the notion that it struggles up out of the ground do its limbs and viscera rush together from all the points of the compass or must we receive the old hebrew idea that god takes clay and moulds a new creature if they say that a new creature is produced in none of these modes which are too absurd to be believed then they are required to describe the mode in which a new creature may be produceda mode which does not seem absurd and such a mode they will find that they neither have conceived nor can conceive  should the believers in special creations consider it unfair thus to call upon them to describe how special creations take place i reply that this is far less than they demand from the supporters of the development hypothesis they are merely asked to point out a conceivable mode on the other hand they ask not simply for a conceivable mode but for the actual mode they do not sayshow us how this may take place but they sayshow us how this does take place so far from its being unreasonable to put the above question it would be reasonable to ask not only for a possible mode of special creation but for an ascertained mode seeing that this is no greater a demand than they make upon their opponents  and here we may perceive how much more defensible the new doctrine is than the old one even could the supporters of the development hypothesis merely show that the origination of species by the process of modification is conceivable they would be in a better position than their opponents but they can do much more than this they can show that the process of modification has effected and is effecting decided changes in all organisms subject to modifying influences though from the impossibility of getting at a sufficiency of facts they are unable to trace the many phases through which any existing species has passed in arriving at its present form or to identify the influences which caused the successive modifications yet they can show that any existing speciesanimal or vegetablewhen placed under conditions different from its previous ones immediately begins to undergo certain changes fitting it for the new conditions they can show that in successive generations these changes continue until ultimately the new conditions become the natural ones they can show that in cultivated plants in domesticated animals and in the several races of men such alterations have taken place they can show that the degrees of difference so produced are often as in dogs greater than those on which distinctions of species are in other cases founded they can show that it is a matter of dispute whether some of these modified forms are varieties or separate species they can show too that the changes daily taking place in ourselvesthe facility that attends long practice and the loss of aptitude that begins when practice ceasesthe strengthening of passions habitually gratified and the weakening of those habitually curbedthe development of every faculty bodily moral or intellectual according to the use made of itare all explicable on this same principle and thus they can show that throughout all organic nature there is at work a modifying influence of the kind they assign as the cause of these specific differences an influence which though slow in its action does in time if the circumstances demand it produce marked changesan influence which to all appearance would produce in the millions of years and under the great varieties of condition which geological records imply any amount of change  which then is the most rational hypothesisthat of special creations which has neither a fact to support it nor is even definitely conceivable or that of modification which is not only definitely conceivable but is countenanced by the habitudes of every existing organism  that by any series of changes a protozoon should ever become a mammal seems to those who are not familiar with zoology and who have not seen how clear becomes the relationship between the simplest and the most complex forms when intermediate forms are examined a very grotesque notion habitually looking at things rather in their statical aspect than in their dynamical aspect they never realize the fact that by small increments of modification any amount of modification may in time be generated that surprise which they feel on finding one whom they last saw as a boy grown into a man becomes incredulity when the degree of change is greater nevertheless abundant instances are at hand of the mode in which we may pass to the most diverse forms by insensible gradations arguing the matter some time since with a learned professor i illustrated my position thusyou admit that there is no apparent relationship between a circle and an hyperbola the one is a finite curve the other is an infinite one all parts of the one are alike of the other no parts are alike save parts on its opposite sides the one incloses a space the other will not inclose a space though produced for ever yet opposite as are these curves in all their properties they may be connected together by a series of intermediate curves no one of which differs from the adjacent ones in any appreciable degree thus if a cone be cut by a plane at right angles to its axis we get a circle if instead of being perfectly at right angles the plane subtends with the axis an angle of 89° 59´ we have an ellipse which no human eye even when aided by an accurate pair of compasses can distinguish from a circle decreasing the angle minute by minute the ellipse becomes first perceptibly eccentric then manifestly so and by and by acquires so immensely elongated a form as to bear no recognizable resemblance to a circle by continuing this process the ellipse passes insensibly into a parabola and ultimately by still further diminishing the angle into an hyperbola now here we have four different species of curvecircle ellipse parabola and hyperbolaeach having its peculiar properties and its separate equation and the first and last of which are quite opposite in nature connected together as members of one series all producible by a single process of insensible modification  but the blindness of those who think it absurd to suppose that complex organic forms may have arisen by successive modifications out of simple ones becomes astonishing when we remember that complex organic forms are daily being thus produced a tree differs from a seed immeasurably in every respectin bulk in structure in colour in form in chemical composition differs so greatly that no visible resemblance of any kind can be pointed out between them yet is the one changed in the course of a few years into the other changed so gradually that at no moment can it be saidnow the seed ceases to be and the tree exists what can be more widely contrasted than a newlyborn child and the small semitransparent spherule constituting the human ovum the infant is so complex in structure that a cyclopædia is needed to describe its constituent parts the germinal vesicle is so simple that it may be defined in a line nevertheless a few months suffice to develop the one out of the other and that too by a series of modifications so small that were the embryo examined at successive minutes even a microscope would with difficulty disclose any sensible changes that the uneducated and the illeducated should think the hypothesis that all races of beings man inclusive may in process of time have been evolved from the simplest monad a ludicrous one is not to be wondered at but for the physiologist who knows that every individual being is so evolvedwho knows further that in their earliest condition the germs of all plants and animals whatever are so similar that there is no appreciable distinction amongst them which would enable it to be determined whether a particular molecule is the germ of a conferva or of an oak of a zoophyte or of a man1for him to make a difficulty of the matter is inexcusable surely if a single cell may when subjected to certain influences become a man in the space of twenty years there is nothing absurd in the hypothesis that under certain other influences a cell may in the course of millions of years give origin to the human race  we have indeed in the part taken by many scientific men in this controversy of law versus miracle a good illustration of the tenacious vitality of superstitions ask one of our leading geologists or physiologists whether he believes in the mosaic account of the creation and he will take the question as next to an insult either he rejects the narrative entirely or understands it in some vague nonnatural sense yet one part of it he unconsciously adopts and that too literally for whence has he got this notion of special creations which he thinks so reasonable and fights for so vigorously evidently he can trace it back to no other source than this myth which he repudiates he has not a single fact in nature to cite in proof of it nor is he prepared with any chain of reasoning by which it may be established catechize him and he will be forced to confess that the notion was put into his mind in childhood as part of a story which he now thinks absurd and why after rejecting all the rest of the story he should strenuously defend this last remnant of it as though he had received it on valid authority he would be puzzled to say  footnote  footnote 1 carpenter principles of comparative physiology p 474     progress its law and cause      first published in the westminster review for april 1857     though the ideas and illustrations contained in this essay were     eventually incorporated in first principles yet i think it well     here to reproduce it as exhibiting the form under which the general     doctrine of evolution made its first appearance   the current conception of progress is shifting and indefinite sometimes it comprehends little more than simple growthas of a nation in the number of its members and the extent of territory over which it spreads sometimes it has reference to quantity of material productsas when the advance of agriculture and manufactures is the topic sometimes the superior quality of these products is contemplated and sometimes the new or improved appliances by which they are produced when again we speak of moral or intellectual progress we refer to states of the individual or people exhibiting it while when the progress of science or art is commented upon we have in view certain abstract results of human thought and action not only however is the current conception of progress more or less vague but it is in great measure erroneous it takes in not so much the reality of progress as its accompanimentsnot so much the substance as the shadow that progress in intelligence seen during the growth of the child into the man or the savage into the philosopher is commonly regarded as consisting in the greater number of facts known and laws understood whereas the actual progress consists in those internal modifications of which this larger knowledge is the expression social progress is supposed to consist in the making of a greater quantity and variety of the articles required for satisfying mens wants in the increasing security of person and property in widening freedom of action whereas rightly understood social progress consists in those changes of structure in the social organism which have entailed these consequences the current conception is a teleological one the phenomena are contemplated solely as bearing on human happiness only those changes are held to constitute progress which directly or indirectly tend to heighten human happiness and they are thought to constitute progress simply because they tend to heighten human happiness but rightly to understand progress we must learn the nature of these changes considered apart from our interests ceasing for example to regard the successive geological modifications that have taken place in the earth as modifications that have gradually fitted it for the habitation of man and as therefore constituting geological progress we must ascertain the character common to these modificationsthe law to which they all conform and similarly in every other case leaving out of sight concomitants and beneficial consequences let us ask what progress is in itself  in respect to that progress which individual organisms display in the course of their evolution this question has been answered by the germans the investigations of wolff goethe and von baer have established the truth that the series of changes gone through during the development of a seed into a tree or an ovum into an animal constitute an advance from homogeneity of structure to heterogeneity of structure in its primary stage every germ consists of a substance that is uniform throughout both in texture and chemical composition the first step is the appearance of a difference between two parts of this substance or as the phenomenon is called in physiological language a differentiation each of these differentiated divisions presently begins itself to exhibit some contrast of parts and by and by these secondary differentiations become as definite as the original one this process is continuously repeatedis simultaneously going on in all parts of the growing embryo and by endless such differentiations there is finally produced that complex combination of tissues and organs constituting the adult animal or plant this is the history of all organisms whatever it is settled beyond dispute that organic progress consists in a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous  now we propose in the first place to show that this law of organic progress is the law of all progress whether it be in the development of the earth in the development of life upon its surface in the development of society of government of manufactures of commerce of language literature science art this same evolution of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations holds throughout from the earliest traceable cosmical changes down to the latest results of civilization we shall find that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is that in which progress essentially consists  with the view of showing that if the nebular hypothesis be true the genesis of the solar system supplies one illustration of this law let us assume that the matter of which the sun and planets consist was once in a diffused form and that from the gravitation of its atoms there resulted a gradual concentration by the hypothesis the solar system in its nascent state existed as an indefinitely extended and nearly homogeneous mediuma medium almost homogeneous in density in temperature and in other physical attributes the first change in the direction of increased aggregation brought a contrast in density and a contrast in temperature between the interior and the exterior of this mass simultaneously the drawing in of outer parts caused motions ending in rotation round a centre with various angular velocities these differentiations increased in number and degree until there was evolved the organized group of sun planets and satellites which we now knowa group which presents numerous contrasts of structure and action among its members there are the immense contrasts between the sun and the planets in bulk and in weight as well as the subordinate contrasts between one planet and another and between the planets and their satellites there is the similarlymarked contrast between the sun as almost stationary relatively to the other members of the solar system and the planets as moving round him with great velocity while there are the secondary contrasts between the velocities and periods of the several planets and between their simple revolutions and the double ones of their satellites which have to move round their primaries while moving round the sun there is the yet further strong contrast between the sun and the planets in respect of temperature and there is good reason to suppose that the planets and satellites differ from each other in their proper heats as well as in the amounts of heat they receive from the sun when we bear in mind that in addition to these various contrasts the planets and satellites also differ in respect to their distances from each other and their primary in respect to the inclinations of their orbits the inclinations of their axes their times of rotation on their axes their specific gravities and their physical constitutions we see what a high degree of heterogeneity the solar system exhibits when compared with the almost complete homogeneity of the nebulous mass out of which it is supposed to have originated  passing from this hypothetical illustration which must be taken for what it is worth without prejudice to the general argument let us descend to a more certain order of evidence it is now generally agreed among geologists and physicists that the earth was at one time a mass of molten matter if so it was at that time relatively homogeneous in consistence and in virtue of the circulation which takes place in heated fluids must have been comparatively homogeneous in temperature and it must have been surrounded by an atmosphere consisting partly of the elements of air and water and partly of those various other elements which are among the more ready to assume gaseous forms at high temperatures that slow cooling by radiation which is still going on at an inappreciable rate and which though originally far more rapid than now necessarily required an immense time to produce any decided change must ultimately have resulted in the solidification of the portion most able to part with its heatnamely the surface in the thin crust thus formed we have the first marked differentiation a still further cooling a consequent thickening of this crust and an accompanying deposition of all solidifiable elements contained in the atmosphere must finally have been followed by the condensation of the water previously existing as vapour a second marked differentiation must thus have arisen and as the condensation must have taken place on the coolest parts of the surfacenamely about the polesthere must thus have resulted the first geographical distinction of parts to these illustrations of growing heterogeneity which though deduced from known physical laws may be regarded as more or less hypothetical geology adds an extensive series that have been inductively established investigations show that the earth has been continually becoming more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of sedimentary strata which form its crust also that it has been becoming more heterogeneous in respect of the composition of these strata the later of which being made from the detritus of the earlier are many of them rendered highly complex by the mixture of materials they contain and further that this heterogeneity has been vastly increased by the actions of the earths still molten nucleus upon its envelope whence have resulted not only many kinds of igneous rocks but the tilting up of sedimentary strata at all angles the formation of faults and metallic veins the production of endless dislocations and irregularities yet again geologists teach us that the earths surface has been growing more varied in elevationthat the most ancient mountain systems are the smallest and the andes and himalayas the most modern while in all probability there have been corresponding changes in the bed of the ocean as a consequence of these ceaseless differentiations we now find that no considerable portion of the earths exposed surface is like any other portion either in contour in geologic structure or in chemical composition and that in most parts it changes from mile to mile in all these characters moreover there has been simultaneously going on a differentiation of climates as fast as the earth cooled and its crust solidified there arose appreciable differences in temperature between those parts of its surface more exposed to the sun and those less exposed as the cooling progressed these differences became more pronounced until there finally resulted those marked contrasts between regions of perpetual ice and snow regions where winter and summer alternately reign for periods varying according to the latitude and regions where summer follows summer with scarcely an appreciable variation at the same time the many and varied elevations and subsidences of portions of the earths crust bringing about the present irregular distribution of land and sea have entailed modifications of climate beyond those dependent on latitude while a yet further series of such modifications have been produced by increasing differences of elevation in the land which have in sundry places brought arctic temperate and tropical climates to within a few miles of one another and the general outcome of these changes is that not only has every extensive region its own meteorologic conditions but that every locality in each region differs more or less from others in those conditions as in its structure its contour its soil thus between our existing earth the phenomena of whose crust neither geographers geologists mineralogists nor meteorologists have yet enumerated and the molten globe out of which it was evolved the contrast in heterogeneity is extreme  when from the earth itself we turn to the plants and animals which have lived or still live upon its surface we find ourselves in some difficulty from lack of facts that every existing organism has been developed out of the simple into the complex is indeed the first established truth of all and that every organism which existed in past times was similarly developed is an inference no physiologist will hesitate to draw but when we pass from individual forms of life to life in general and inquire whether the same law is seen in the ensemble of its manifestationswhether modern plants and animals are of more heterogeneous structure than ancient ones and whether the earths present flora and fauna are more heterogeneous than the flora and fauna of the pastwe find the evidence so fragmentary that every conclusion is open to dispute threefifths of the earths surface being covered by water a great part of the exposed land being inaccessible to or untravelled by the geologist the greater part of the remainder having been scarcely more than glanced at and even the most familiar portions as england having been so imperfectly explored that a new series of strata has been added within these four yearsit is impossible for us to say with certainty what creatures have and what have not existed at any particular period considering the perishable nature of many of the lower organic forms the metamorphosis of numerous sedimentary strata and the great gaps occurring among the rest we shall see further reason for distrusting our deductions on the one hand the repeated discovery of vertebrate remains in strata previously supposed to contain noneof reptiles where only fish were thought to existof mammals where it was believed there were no creatures higher than reptilesrenders it daily more manifest how small is the value of negative evidence on the other hand the worthlessness of the assumption that we have discovered the earliest or anything like the earliest organic remains is becoming equally clear that the oldest known sedimentary rocks have been greatly changed by igneous action and that still older ones have been totally transformed by it is becoming undeniable and the fact that sedimentary strata earlier than any we know have been melted up being admitted it must also be admitted that we cannot say how far back in time this destruction of sedimentary strata has been going on thus the title palæozoic as applied to the earliest known fossiliferous strata involves a petitio principii and for aught we know to the contrary only the last few chapters of the earths biological history may have come down to us on neither side therefore is the evidence conclusive nevertheless we cannot but think that scanty as they are the facts taken altogether tend to show both that the more heterogeneous organisms have been evolved in the later geologic periods and that life in general has been more heterogeneously manifested as time has advanced let us cite in illustration the one case of the vertebrata the earliest known vertebrate remains are those of fishes and fishes are the most homogeneous of the vertebrata later and more heterogeneous are reptiles later still and more heterogeneous still are birds and mammals if it be said that the palæozoic deposits not being estuary deposits are not likely to contain the remains of terrestrial vertebrata which may nevertheless have existed at that era we reply that we are merely pointing to the leading facts such as they are but to avoid any such criticism let us take the mammalian subdivision only the earliest known remains of mammals are those of small marsupials which are the lowest of the mammalian type while conversely the highest of the mammalian typemanis the most recent the evidence that the vertebrate fauna as a whole has become more heterogeneous is considerably stronger to the argument that the vertebrate fauna of the palæozoic period consisting so far as we know entirely of fishes was less heterogeneous than the modern vertebrate fauna which includes reptiles birds and mammals of multitudinous genera it may be replied as before that estuary deposits of the palæozoic period could we find them might contain other orders of vertebrata but no such reply can be made to the argument that whereas the marine vertebrata of the palæozoic period consisted entirely of cartilaginous fishes the marine vertebrata of later periods include numerous genera of osseous fishes and that therefore the later marine vertebrate faunas are more heterogeneous than the oldest known one nor again can any such reply be made to the fact that there are far more numerous orders and genera of mammalian remains in the tertiary formations than in the secondary formations did we wish merely to make out the best case we might dwell upon the opinion of dr carpenter who says that the general facts of palæontology appear to sanction the belief that the same plan may be traced out in what may be called the general life of the globe as in the individual life of every one of the forms of organized being which now people it or we might quote as decisive the judgment of professor owen who holds that the earlier examples of each group of creatures severally departed less widely from archetypal generality than the later exampleswere severally less unlike the fundamental form common to the group as a whole and thus constituted a less heterogeneous group of creatures but in deference to an authority for whom we have the highest respect who considers that the evidence at present obtained does not justify a verdict either way we are content to leave the question open2  whether an advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is or is not displayed in the biological history of the globe it is clearly enough displayed in the progress of the latest and most heterogeneous creatureman it is true alike that during the period in which the earth has been peopled the human organism has grown more heterogeneous among the civilized divisions of the species and that the species as a whole has been growing more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of races and the differentiation of these races from each other in proof of the first of these positions we may cite the fact that in the relative development of the limbs the civilized man departs more widely from the general type of the placental mammalia than do the lower human races while often possessing welldeveloped body and arms the australian has very small legs thus reminding us of the chimpanzee and the gorilla which present no great contrasts in size between the hind and fore limbs but in the european the greater length and massiveness of the legs have become markedthe fore and hind limbs are more heterogeneous again the greater ratio which the cranial bones bear to the facial bones illustrates the same truth among the vertebrata in general progress is marked by an increasing heterogeneity in the vertebral column and more especially in the segments constituting the skull the higher forms being distinguished by the relatively larger size of the bones which cover the brain and the relatively  smaller size of those which form the jaws c now this characteristic which is stronger in man than in any other creature is stronger in the european than in the savage moreover judging from the greater extent and variety of faculty he exhibits we may infer that the civilized man has also a more complex or heterogeneous nervous system than the uncivilized man and indeed the fact is in part visible in the increased ratio which his cerebrum bears to the subjacent ganglia as well as in the wider departure from symmetry in its convolutions if further elucidation be needed we may find it in every nursery the infant european has sundry marked points of resemblance to the lower human races as in the flatness of the alæ of the nose the depression of its bridge the divergence and forward opening of the nostrils the form of the lips the absence of a frontal sinus the width between the eyes the smallness of the legs now as the developmental process by which these traits are turned into those of the adult european is a continuation of that change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous displayed during the previous evolution of the embryo which every anatomist will admit it follows that the parallel developmental process by which the like traits of the barbarous races have been turned into those of the civilized races has also been a continuation of the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous the truth of the second positionthat mankind as a whole have become more heterogeneousis so obvious as scarcely to need illustration every work on ethnology by its divisions and subdivisions of races bears testimony to it even were we to admit the hypothesis that mankind originated from several separate stocks it would still remain true that as from each of these stocks there have sprung many now widelydifferent tribes which are proved by philological evidence to have had a common origin the race as a whole is far less homogeneous than it once was add to which that we have in the angloamericans an example of a new variety arising within these few generations and that if we may trust to the descriptions of observers we are likely soon to have another such example in australia  on passing from humanity under its individual form to humanity as socially embodied we find the general law still more variously exemplified the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is displayed in the progress of civilization as a whole as well as in the progress of every nation and is still going on with increasing rapidity as we see in existing barbarous tribes society in its first and lowest form is a homogeneous aggregation of individuals having like powers and like functions the only marked difference of function being that which accompanies difference of sex every man is warrior hunter fisherman toolmaker builder every woman performs the same drudgeries very early however in the course of social evolution there arises an incipient differentiation between the governing and the governed some kind of chieftainship seems coeval with the first advance from the state of separate wandering families to that of a nomadic tribe the authority of the strongest or the most cunning makes itself felt among a body of savages as in a herd of animals or a posse of schoolboys at first however it is indefinite uncertain is shared by others of scarcely inferior power and is unaccompanied by any difference in occupation or style of living the first ruler kills his own game makes his own weapons builds his own hut and economically considered does not differ from others of his tribe gradually as the tribe progresses the contrast between the governing and the governed grows more decided supreme power becomes hereditary in one family the head of that family ceasing to provide for his own wants is served by others and he begins to assume the sole office of ruling at the same time there has been arising a coordinate species of governmentthat of religion as all ancient records and traditions prove the earliest rulers are regarded as divine personages the maxims and commands they uttered during their lives are held sacred after their deaths and are enforced by their divinelydescended successors who in their turns are promoted to the pantheon of the race here to be worshipped and propitiated along with their predecessors the most ancient of whom is the supreme god and the rest subordinate gods for a long time these connate forms of governmentcivil and religiousremain closely associated for many generations the king continues to be the chief priest and the priesthood to be members of the royal race for many ages religious law continues to include more or less of civil regulation and civil law to possess more or less of religious sanction and even among the most advanced nations these two controlling agencies are by no means completely separated from each other having a common root with these and gradually diverging from them we find yet another controlling agencythat of ceremonial usages all titles of honour are originally the names of the godking afterwards of the god and the king still later of persons of high rank and finally come some of them to be used between man and man all forms of complimentary address were at first the expressions of submission from prisoners to their conqueror or from subjects to their ruler either human or divineexpressions which were afterwards used to propitiate subordinate authorities and slowly descended into ordinary intercourse all modes of salutation were once obeisances made before the monarch and used in worship of him after his death presently others of the goddescended race were similarly saluted and by degrees some of the salutations have become the due of all3 thus no sooner does the originallyhomogeneous social mass differentiate  into the governed and the governing parts than this last exhibits an incipient differentiation into religious and secularchurch and state while at the same time there begins to be differentiated from both that less definite species of government which rules our daily intercoursea species of government which as we may see in heralds colleges in books of the peerage in masters of ceremonies is not without a certain embodiment of its own each of these is itself subject to successive differentiations in the course of ages there arises as among ourselves a highly complex political organization of monarch ministers lords and commons with their subordinate administrative departments courts of justice revenue offices c supplemented in the provinces by municipal governments county governments parish or union governmentsall of them more or less elaborated by its side there grows up a highly complex religious organization with its various grades of officials from archbishops down to sextons its colleges convocations ecclesiastical courts c to all which must be added the evermultiplying independent sects each with its general and local authorities and at the same time there is developed a highly complex aggregation of customs manners and temporary fashions enforced by society at large and serving to control those minor transactions between man and man which are not regulated by civil and religious law moreover it is to be observed that this increasing heterogeneity in the governmental appliances of each nation has been accompanied by an increasing heterogeneity in the assemblage of governmental appliances of different nations all nations being more or less unlike in their political systems and legislation in their creeds and religious institutions in their customs and ceremonial usages  simultaneously there has been going on a second differentiation of a more familiar kind that namely by which the mass of the community has been segregated into distinct classes and orders of workers while the governing part has undergone the complex development above detailed the governed part has undergone an equally complex development which has resulted in that minute division of labour characterizing advanced nations it is needless to trace out this progress from its first stages up through the castedivisions of the east and the incorporated guilds of europe to the elaborate producing and distributing organization existing among ourselves it has been an evolution which beginning with a tribe whose members severally perform the same actions each for himself ends with a civilized community whose members severally perform different actions for each other and an evolution which has transformed the solitary producer of any one commodity into a combination of producers who united under a master take separate parts in the manufacture of such commodity but there are yet other and higher phases of this advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous in the industrial organization of society long after considerable progress has been made in the division of labour among different classes of workers there is still little or no division of labour among the widely separated parts of the community the nation continues comparatively homogeneous in the respect that in each district the same occupations are pursued but when roads and other means of transit become numerous and good the different districts begin to assume different functions and to become mutually dependent the calico manufacture locates itself in this county the woollencloth manufacture in that silks are produced here lace there stockings in one place shoes in another pottery hardware cutlery come to have their special towns and ultimately every locality becomes more or less distinguished from the rest by the leading occupation carried on in it this subdivision of functions shows itself not only among the different parts of the same nation but among different nations that exchange of commodities which freetrade is increasing so largely will ultimately have the effect of specializing in a greater or less degree the industry of each people so that beginning with a barbarous tribe almost if not quite homogeneous in the functions of its members the progress has been and still is towards an economic aggregation of the whole human race growing ever more heterogeneous in respect of the separate functions assumed by separate nations the separate functions assumed by the local sections of each nation the separate functions assumed by the many kinds of makers and traders in each town and the separate functions assumed by the workers united in producing each commodity  the law thus clearly exemplified in the evolution of the social organism is exemplified with equal clearness in the evolution of all products of human thought and action whether concrete or abstract real or ideal let us take language as our first illustration  the lowest form of language is the exclamation by which an entire idea is vaguely conveyed through a single sound as among the lower animals that human language ever consisted solely of exclamations and so was strictly homogeneous in respect of its parts of speech we have no evidence but that language can be traced down to a form in which nouns and verbs are its only elements is an established fact in the gradual multiplication of parts of speech out of these primary onesin the differentiation of verbs into active and passive of nouns into abstract and concretein the rise of distinctions of mood tense person of number and casein the formation of auxiliary verbs of adjectives adverbs pronouns prepositions articlesin the divergence of those orders genera species and varieties of parts of speech by which civilized races express minute modifications of meaningwe see a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous another aspect under which we may trace the development of language is the divergence of words having common origins philology early disclosed the truth that in all languages words may be grouped into families the members of each of which are allied by their derivation names springing from a primitive root themselves become the parents of other names still further modified and by the aid of those systematic modes which presently arise of making derivatives and forming compound terms there is finally developed a tribe of words so heterogeneous in sound and meaning that to the uninitiated it seems incredible they should be nearly related meanwhile from other roots there are being evolved other such tribes until there results a language of some sixty thousand or more unlike words signifying as many unlike objects qualities acts yet another way in which language in general advances from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is in the multiplication of languages whether all languages have grown from one stock or whether as some philologists think they have grown from two or more stocks it is clear that since large groups of languages as the indoeuropean are of one parentage they have become distinct through a process of continuous divergence the same diffusion over the earths surface which has led to differentiations of race has simultaneously led to differentiations of speech a truth which we see further illustrated in each nation by the distinct dialects found in separate districts thus the progress of language conforms to the general law alike in the evolution of languages in the evolution of families of words and in the evolution of parts of speech  on passing from spoken to written language we come upon several classes of facts having similar implications written language is connate with painting and sculpture and at first all three are appendages of architecture and have a direct connection with the primary form of all governmentthe theocratic merely noting by the way the fact that sundry wild races as for example the australians and the tribes of south africa are given to depicting personages and events upon the walls of caves which are probably regarded as sacred places let us pass to the case of the egyptians among them as also among the assyrians we find mural paintings used to decorate the temple of the god and the palace of the king which were indeed originally identical and as such they were governmental appliances in the same sense as statepageants and religious feasts were they were governmental appliances in another way representing as they did the worship of the god the triumphs of the godking the submission of his subjects and the punishment of the rebellious further they were governmental as being the products of an art reverenced by the people as a sacred mystery from the habitual use of this pictorial representation there grew up the butslightlymodified practice of picturewritinga practice which was found still extant among north american peoples at the time they were discovered by abbreviations analogous to those still going on in our own written language the most frequentlyrecurring of these pictured figures were successively simplified and ultimately there grew up a system of symbols most of which had but distant resemblances to the things for which they stood the inference that the hieroglyphics of the egyptians were thus produced is confirmed by the fact that the picturewriting of the mexicans was found to have given birth to a like family of ideographic forms and among them as among the egyptians these had been partially differentiated into the kuriological or imitative and the tropical or symbolic which were however used together in the same record in egypt written language underwent a further differentiation whence resulted the hieratic and the epistolographic or enchorial both of which are derived from the original hieroglyphic at the same time we find that for the expression of proper names which could not be otherwise conveyed signs having phonetic values were employed and though it is alleged that the egyptians never achieved complete alphabetic writing yet it can scarcely be doubted that these phonetic symbols occasionally used in aid of their ideographic ones were the germs of an alphabetic system once having become separate from hieroglyphics alphabetic writing itself underwent numerous differentiationsmultiplied alphabets were produced between most of which however more or less connection can still be traced and in each civilized nation there has now grown up for the representation of one set of sounds several sets of written signs used for distinct purposes finally from writing diverged printing which uniform in kind as it was at first has since become multiform  while written language was passing through its first stages of development the mural decoration which contained its root was being differentiated into painting and sculpture the gods kings men and animals represented were originally marked by indented outlines and coloured in most cases these outlines were of such depth and the object they circumscribed so far rounded and marked out in its leading parts as to form a species of work intermediate between intaglio and basrelief in other cases we see an advance upon this the raised spaces between the figures being chiselled off and the figures themselves appropriately tinted a painted basrelief was produced the restored assyrian architecture at sydenham exhibits this style of art carried to greater perfectionthe persons and things represented though still barbarously coloured are carved out with more truth and in greater detail and in the winged lions and bulls used for the angles of gateways we may see a considerable advance towards a completely sculptured figure which nevertheless is still coloured and still forms part of the building but while in assyria the production of a statue proper seems to have been little if at all attempted we may trace in egyptian art the gradual separation of the sculptured figure from the wall a walk through the collection in the british museum shows this while at the same time it affords an opportunity of observing the traces which the independent statues bear of their derivation from basrelief seeing that nearly all of them not only display that fusion of the legs with one another and of the arms with the body which is characteristic of basrelief but have the back united from head to foot with a block which stands in place of the original wall greece repeated the leading stages of this progress on the friezes of greek temples were coloured basreliefs representing sacrifices battles processions gamesall in some sort religious the pediments contained painted sculptures more or less united with the tympanum and having for subjects the triumphs of gods or heroes even statues definitely separated from buildings were coloured and only in the later periods of greek civilization does the differentiation of sculpture from painting appear to have become complete in christian art we may trace a parallel regenesis all early works of art throughout europe were religious in subjectrepresented christs crucifixions virgins holy families apostles saints they formed integral parts of church architecture and were among the means of exciting worship as in roman catholic countries they still are moreover the sculptured figures of christ on the cross of virgins of saints were coloured and it needs but to call to mind the painted madonnas still abundant in continental churches and highways to perceive the significant fact that painting and sculpture continue in closest connection with each other where they continue in closest connection with their parent even when christian sculpture became differentiated from painting it was still religious and governmental in its subjectswas used for tombs in churches and statues of kings while at the same time painting where not purely ecclesiastical was applied to the decoration of palaces and besides representing royal personages was mostly devoted to sacred legends only in recent times have painting and sculpture become quite separate and mainly secular only within these few centuries has painting been divided into historical landscape marine architectural genre animal stilllife c and sculpture grown heterogeneous in respect of the variety of real and ideal subjects with which it occupies itself  strange as it seems then we find that all forms of written language of painting and of sculpture have a common root in the politicoreligious decorations of ancient temples and palaces little resemblance as they now have the landscape that hangs against the wall and the copy of the times lying on the table are remotely akin the brazen face of the knocker which the postman has just lifted is related not only to the woodcuts of the illustrated london news which he is delivering but to the characters of the billetdoux which accompanies it between the painted window the prayerbook on which its light falls and the adjacent monument there is consanguinity the effigies on our coins the signs over shops the coat of arms outside the carriage panel and the placards inside the omnibus are in common with dolls and paperhangings lineally descended from the rude sculpturepaintings in which ancient peoples represented the triumphs and worship of their godkings perhaps no example can be given which more vividly illustrates the multiplicity and heterogeneity of the products that in course of time may arise by successive differentiations from a common stock  before passing to other classes of facts it should be observed that the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is displayed not only in the separation of painting and sculpture from architecture and from each other and in the greater variety of subjects they embody but it is further shown in the structure of each work a modern picture or statue is of far more heterogeneous nature than an ancient one an egyptian sculpturefresco usually represents all its figures as at the same distance from the eye and so is less heterogeneous than a painting that represents them as at various distances from the eye it exhibits all objects as exposed to the same degree of light and so is less heterogeneous than a painting which exhibits its different objects and different parts of each object as in different degrees of light it uses chiefly the primary colours and these in their full intensities and so is less heterogeneous than a painting which introducing the primary colours but sparingly employs numerous intermediate tints each of heterogeneous composition and differing from the rest not only in quality but in strength moreover we see in these early works great uniformity of conception the same arrangement of figures is perpetually reproducedthe same actions attitudes faces dresses in egypt the modes of representation were so fixed that it was sacrilege to introduce a novelty the assyrian basreliefs display parallel characters deities kings attendants wingedfigures and animals are time after time depicted in like positions holding like implements doing like things and with like expression or nonexpression of face if a palmgrove is introduced all the trees are of the same height have the same number of leaves and are equidistant when water is imitated each wave is a counterpart of the rest and the fish almost always of one kind are evenly distributed over the surface the beards of the kings the gods and the wingedfigures are everywhere similar as are the manes of the lions and equally so those of the horses hair is represented throughout by one form of curl the kings beard is quite architecturally built up of compound tiers of uniform curls alternating with twisted tiers placed in a transverse direction and arranged with perfect regularity and the terminal tufts of the bulls tails are represented in exactly the same manner without tracing out analogous facts in early christian art in which though less striking they are still visible the advance in heterogeneity will be sufficiently manifest on remembering that in the pictures of our own day the composition is endlessly varied the attitudes faces expressions unlike the subordinate objects different in sizes forms textures and more or less of contrast even in the smallest details or if we compare an egyptian statue seated bolt upright on a block with hands on knees fingers parallel eyes looking straight forward and the two sides perfectly symmetrical in every particular with a statue of the advanced greek school or the modern school which is asymmetrical in respect of the attitude of the head the body the limbs the arrangement of the hair dress appendages and in its relations to neighbouring objects we shall see the change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous clearly manifested  in the coordinate origin and gradual differentiation of poetry music and dancing we have another series of illustrations rhythm in words rhythm in sounds and rhythm in motions were in the beginning parts of the same thing and have only in process of time become separate things among existing barbarous tribes we find them still united the dances of savages are accompanied by some kind of monotonous chant the clapping of hands the striking of rude instruments there are measured movements measured words and measured tones the early records of historic races similarly show these three forms of metrical action united in religious festivals in the hebrew writings we read that the triumphal ode composed by moses on the defeat of the egyptians was sung to an accompaniment of dancing and timbrels the israelites danced and sung at the inauguration of the golden calf and as it is generally agreed that this representation of the deity was borrowed from the mysteries of apis it is probable that the dancing was copied from that of the egyptians on those occasions again in greece the like relation is everywhere seen the original type being there as probably in other cases a simultaneous chanting and mimetic representation of the life and adventures of the hero or the god the spartan dances were accompanied by hymns and songs and in general the greeks had no festivals or religious assemblies but what were accompanied with songs and dancesboth of them being forms of worship used before altars among the romans too there were sacred dances the salian and lupercalian being named as of that kind and even in christian countries as at limoges in comparatively recent times the people have danced in the choir in honour of a saint the incipient separation of these onceunited arts from each other and from religion was early visible in greece probably diverging from dances partly religious partly warlike as the corybantian came the wardances proper of which there were various kinds meanwhile music and poetry though still united came to have an existence separate from dancing the primitive greek poems religious in subject were not recited but chanted and though at first the chant of the poet was accompanied by the dance of the chorus it ultimately grew into independence later still when the poem had been differentiated into epic and lyricwhen it became the custom to sing the lyric and recite the epicpoetry proper was born as during the same period musical instruments were being multiplied we may presume that music came to have an existence apart from words and both of them were beginning to assume other forms besides the religious facts having like implications might be cited from the histories of later times and peoples as the practices of our own early minstrels who sang to the harp heroic narratives versified by themselves to music of their own composition thus uniting the now separate offices of poet composer vocalist and instrumentalist but without further illustration the common origin and gradual differentiation of dancing poetry and music will be sufficiently manifest  the advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is displayed not only in the separation of these arts from each other and from religion but also in the multiplied differentiations which each of them afterwards undergoes not to dwell upon the numberless kinds of dancing that have in course of time come into use and not to occupy space in detailing the progress of poetry as seen in the development of the various forms of metre of rhyme and of general organization let us confine our attention to music as a type of the group as implied by the customs of still extant barbarous races the first musical instruments were without doubt percussivesticks calabashes tomtomsand were used simply to mark the time of the dance and in this constant repetition of the same sound we see music in its most homogeneous form the egyptians had a lyre with three strings the early lyre of the greeks had four constituting their tetrachord in course of some centuries lyres of seven and eight strings were employed and by the expiration of a thousand years they had advanced to their great system of the double octave through all which changes there of course arose a greater heterogeneity of melody simultaneously there came into use the different modesdorian ionian phrygian Æolian and lydiananswering to our keys and of these there were ultimately fifteen as yet however there was but little heterogeneity in the time of their music instrumental music being at first merely the accompaniment of vocal music and vocal music being subordinated to wordsthe singer being also the poet chanting his own compositions and making the lengths of his notes agree with the feet of his versesthere resulted a tiresome uniformity of measure which as dr burney says no resources of melody could disguise lacking the complex rhythm obtained by our equal bars and unequal notes the only rhythm was that produced by the quantity of the syllables and was of necessity comparatively monotonous and further it maybe observed that the chant thus resulting being like recitative was much less clearly differentiated from ordinary speech than is our modern song nevertheless in virtue of the extended range of notes in use the variety of modes the occasional variations of time consequent on changes of metre and the multiplication of instruments music had towards the close of greek civilization attained to considerable heterogeneitynot indeed as compared with our music but as compared with that which preceded it still there existed nothing but melody harmony was unknown it was not until christian churchmusic had reached some development that music in parts was evolved and then it came into existence through a very unobtrusive differentiation difficult as it may be to conceive a priori how the advance from melody to harmony could take place without a sudden leap it is none the less true that it did so the circumstance which prepared the way for it was the employment of two choirs singing alternately the same air afterwards it became the practicevery possibly first suggested by a mistakefor the second choir to commence before the first had ceased thus producing a fugue with the simple airs then in use a partiallyharmonious fugue might not improbably thus result and a very partiallyharmonious fugue satisfied the ears of that age as we know from still preserved examples the idea having once been given the composing of airs productive of fugal harmony would naturally grow up as in some way it did grow up out of this alternate choirsinging and from the fugue to concerted music of two three four and more parts the transition was easy without pointing out in detail the increasing complexity that resulted from introducing notes of various lengths from the multiplication of keys from the use of accidentals from varieties of time and so forth it needs but to contrast music as it is with music as it was to see how immense is the increase of heterogeneity we see this if looking at music in its ensemble we enumerate its many different genera and speciesif we consider the divisions into vocal instrumental and mixed and their subdivisions into music for different voices and different instrumentsif we observe the many forms of sacred music from the simple hymn the chant the canon motet anthem c up to the oratorio and the still more numerous forms of secular music from the ballad up to the serenata from the instrumental solo up to the symphony again the same truth is seen on comparing any one sample of aboriginal music with a sample of modern musiceven an ordinary song for the piano which we find to be relatively very heterogeneous not only in respect of the variety in the pitches and in the lengths of the notes the number of different notes sounding at the same instant in company with the voice and the variations of strength with which they are sounded and sung but in respect of the changes of key the changes of time the changes of timbre of the voice and the many other modifications of expression while between the old monotonous dancechant and a grand opera of our own day with its endless orchestral complexities and vocal combinations the contrast in heterogeneity is so extreme that it seems scarcely credible that the one should have been the ancestor of the other  were they needed many further illustrations might be cited going back to the early time when the deeds of the godking were recorded in picturewritings on the walls of temples and palaces and so constituted a rude literature we might trace the development of literature through phases in which as in the hebrew scriptures it presents in one work theology cosmogony history biography law ethics poetry down to its present heterogeneous development in which its separated divisions and subdivisions are so numerous and varied as to defy complete classification or we might trace out the evolution of science beginning with the era in which it was not yet differentiated from art and was in union with art the handmaid of religion passing through the era in which the sciences were so few and rudimentary as to be simultaneously cultivated by the same men and ending with the era in which the genera and species are so numerous that few can enumerate them and no one can adequately grasp even one genus or we might do the like with architecture with the drama with dress but doubtless the reader is already weary of illustrations and our promise has been amply fulfilled abundant proof has been given that the law of organic development formulated by von baer is the law of all development the advance from the simple to the complex through a process of successive differentiations is seen alike in the earliest changes of the universe to which we can reason our way back and in the earliest changes which we can inductively establish it is seen in the geologic and climatic evolution of the earth it is seen in the unfolding of every single organism on its surface and in the multiplication of kinds of organisms it is seen in the evolution of humanity whether contemplated in the civilized individual or in the aggregate of races it is seen in the evolution of society in respect alike of its political its religious and its economical organization and it is seen in the evolution of all those endless concrete and abstract products of human activity which constitute the environment of our daily life from the remotest past which science can fathom up to the novelties of yesterday that in which progress essentially consists is the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous                                       and now must not this uniformity of procedure be a consequence of some fundamental necessity may we not rationally seek for some allpervading principle which determines this allpervading process of things does not the universality of the law imply a universal cause  that we can comprehend such cause noumenally considered is not to be supposed to do this would be to solve that ultimate mystery which must ever transcend human intelligence but it still may be possible for us to reduce the law of all progress above set forth from the condition of an empirical generalization to the condition of a rational generalization just as it was possible to interpret keplers laws as necessary consequences of the law of gravitation so it may be possible to interpret this law of progress in its multiform manifestations as the necessary consequence of some similarly universal principle as gravitation was assignable as the cause of each of the groups of phenomena which kepler generalized so may some equally simple attribute of things be assignable as the cause of each of the groups of phenomena generalized in the foregoing pages we may be able to affiliate all these varied evolutions of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous upon certain facts of immediate experience which in virtue of endless repetition we regard as necessary  the probability of a common cause and the possibility of formulating it being granted it will be well first to ask what must be the general characteristics of such cause and in what direction we ought to look for it we can with certainty predict that it has a high degree of abstractness seeing that it is common to such infinitelyvaried phenomena we need not expect to see in it an obvious solution of this or that form of progress because it is equally concerned with forms of progress bearing little apparent resemblance to them its association with multiform orders of facts involves its dissociation from any particular order of facts being that which determines progress of every kindastronomic geologic organic ethnologic social economic artistic cit must be involved with some fundamental trait displayed in common by these and must be expressible in terms of this fundamental trait the only obvious respect in which all kinds of progress are alike is that they are modes of change and hence in some characteristic of changes in general the desired solution will probably be found we may suspect a priori that in some universal law of change lies the explanation of this universal transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous  thus much premised we pass at once to the statement of the law which is thisevery active force produces more than one changeevery cause produces more than one effect  to make this proposition comprehensible a few examples must be given when one body strikes another that which we usually regard as the effect is a change of position or motion in one or both bodies but a moments thought shows us that this is a very incomplete view of the matter besides the visible mechanical result sound is produced or to speak accurately a vibration in one or both bodies which is communicated to the surrounding air and under some circumstances we call this the effect moreover the air has not only been made to undulate but has had currents caused in it by the transit of the bodies further there is a disarrangement of the particles of the two bodies in the neighbourhood of their point of collision amounting in some cases to a visible condensation yet more this condensation is accompanied by the disengagement of heat in some cases a sparkthat is lightresults from the incandescence of a portion struck off and sometimes this incandescence is associated with chemical combination thus by the mechanical force expended in the collision at least five and often more different kinds of changes have been produced take again the lighting of a candle primarily this is a chemical change consequent on a rise of temperature the process of combination having once been started by extraneous heat there is a continued formation of carbonic acid water cin itself a result more complex than the extraneous heat that first caused it but accompanying this process of combination there is a production of heat there is a production of light there is an ascending column of hot gases generated there are inflowing currents set going in the surrounding air moreover the complicating of effects does not end here each of the several changes produced becomes the parent of further changes the carbonic acid given off will by and by combine with some base or under the influence of sunshine give up its carbon to the leaf of a plant the water will modify the hygrometric state of the air around or if the current of hot gases containing it comes against a cold body will be condensed altering the temperature of the surface it covers the heat given out melts the subjacent tallow and expands whatever it warms the light falling on various substances calls forth from them reactions by which its composition is modified and so divers colours are produced similarly even with these secondary actions which may be traced out into evermultiplying ramifications until they become too minute to be appreciated and thus it is with all changes whatever no case can be named in which an active force does not evolve forces of several kinds and each of these other groups of forces universally the effect is more complex than the cause  doubtless the reader already foresees the course of our argument this multiplication of effects which is displayed in every event of today has been going on from the beginning and is true of the grandest phenomena of the universe as of the most insignificant from the law that every active force produces more than one change it is an inevitable corollary that during the past there has been an evergrowing complication of things throughout creation there must have gone on and must still go on a neverceasing transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous let us trace this truth in detail  without committing ourselves to it as more than a speculation though a highly probable one let us again commence with the evolution of the solar system out of a nebulous medium the hypothesis is that from the mutual attraction of the molecules of a diffused mass whose form is unsymmetrical there results not only condensation but rotation while the condensation and the rate of rotation go on increasing the approach of the molecules is necessarily accompanied by an increasing temperature as the temperature rises light begins to be evolved and ultimately there results a revolving sphere of fluid matter radiating intense heat and lighta sun there are reasons for believing that in consequence of the higher tangential velocity originally possessed by the outer parts of the condensing nebulous mass there will be occasional detachments of rotating rings and that from the breaking up of these nebulous rings there will arise masses which in the course of their condensation repeat the actions of the parent mass and so produce planets and their satellitesan inference strongly supported by the still extant rings of saturn should it hereafter be satisfactorily shown that planets and satellites were thus generated a striking illustration will be afforded of the highly heterogeneous effects produced by the primary homogeneous cause but it will serve our present purpose to point to the fact that from the mutual attraction of the particles of an irregular nebulous mass there result condensation rotation heat and light  it follows as a corollary from the nebular hypothesis that the earth must once have been incandescent and whether the nebular hypothesis be true or not this original incandescence of the earth is now inductively establishedor if not established at least rendered so highly probable that it is an accepted geological doctrine let us look first at the astronomical attributes of this once molten globe from its rotation there result the oblateness of its form the alternations of day and night and under the influence of the moon and in a smaller degree the sun the tides aqueous and atmospheric from the inclination of its axis there result the many differences of the seasons both simultaneous and successive that pervade its surface and from the same cause joined with the action of the moon on the equatorial protuberance there results the precession of the equinoxes thus the multiplication of effects is obvious several of the differentiations due to the gradual cooling of the earth have been already noticedas the formation of a crust the solidification of sublimed elements the precipitation of water cand we here again refer to them merely to point out that they are simultaneous effects of the one cause diminishing heat let us now however observe the multiplied changes afterwards arising from the continuance of this one cause the cooling of the earth involves its contraction hence the solid crust first formed is presently too large for the shrinking nucleus and as it cannot support itself inevitably follows the nucleus but a spheroidal envelope cannot sink down into contact with a smaller internal spheroid without disruption it must run into wrinkles as the rind of an apple does when the bulk of its interior decreases from evaporation as the cooling progresses and the envelope thickens the ridges consequent on these contractions will become greater rising ultimately into hills and mountains and the later systems of mountains thus produced will not only be higher as we find them to be but will be longer as we also find them to be thus leaving out of view other modifying forces we see what immense heterogeneity of surface has arisen from the one cause loss of heata heterogeneity which the telescope shows us to be paralleled on the face of mars and which in the moon too where aqueous and atmospheric agencies have been absent it reveals under a somewhat different form but we have yet to notice another kind of heterogeneity of surface similarly and simultaneously caused while the earths crust was still thin the ridges produced by its contraction must not only have been small but the spaces between these ridges must have rested with great evenness upon the subjacent liquid spheroid and the water in those arctic and antarctic regions in which it first condensed must have been evenly distributed but as fast as the crust thickened and gained corresponding strength the lines of fracture from time to time caused in it must have occurred at greater distances apart the intermediate surfaces must have followed the contracting nucleus with less uniformity and there must have resulted larger areas of land and water if any one after wrapping up an orange in tissue paper and observing not only how small are the wrinkles but how evenly the intervening spaces lie upon the surface of the orange will then wrap it up in thick cartridgepaper and note both the greater height of the ridges and the larger spaces throughout which the paper does not touch the orange he will realize the fact that as the earths solid envelope grew thicker the areas of elevation and depression increased in place of islands homogeneously dispersed amid an allembracing sea there must have gradually arisen heterogeneous arrangements of continent and ocean once more this double change in the extent and in the elevation of the lands involved yet another species of heterogeneitythat of coastline a tolerably even surface raised out of the ocean must have a simple regular seamargin but a surface varied by tablelands and intersected by mountainchains must when raised out of the ocean have an outline extremely irregular both in its leading features and in its details thus multitudinous geological and geographical results are slowly brought about by this one causethe contraction of the earth  when we pass from the agency termed igneous to aqueous and atmospheric agencies we see the like evergrowing complications of effects the denuding actions of air and water joined with those of changing temperature have from the beginning been modifying every exposed surface oxidation heat wind frost rain glaciers rivers tides waves have been unceasingly producing disintegration varying in kind and amount according to local circumstances acting upon a tract of granite they here work scarcely an appreciable effect there cause exfoliations of the surface and a resulting heap of débris and boulders and elsewhere after decomposing the feldspar into a white clay carry away this and the accompanying quartz and mica and deposit them in separate beds fluviatile and marine when the exposed land consists of several unlike kinds of sedimentary strata or igneous rocks or both denudation produces changes proportionably more heterogeneous the formations being disintegrable in different degrees there follows an increased irregularity of surface the areas drained by different rivers being differently constituted these rivers carry down to the sea different combinations of ingredients and so sundry new strata of unlike compositions are formed and here we may see very simply illustrated the truth which we shall presently have to trace out in more involved cases that in proportion to the heterogeneity of the object or objects on which any force expends itself is the heterogeneity of the effects a continent of complex structure exposing many strata irregularly distributed raised to various levels tilted up at all angles will under the same denuding agencies give origin to innumerable and involved results each district must be differently modified each river must carry down a different kind of detritus each deposit must be differently distributed by the entangled currents tidal and other which wash the contorted shores and this multiplication of results must manifestly be greatest where the complexity of surface is greatest  here we might show how the general truth that every active force produces more than one change is again exemplified in the highlyinvolved flow of the tides in the ocean currents in the winds in the distribution of rain in the distribution of heat and so forth but not to dwell upon these let us for the fuller elucidation of this truth in relation to the inorganic world consider what would be the consequences of some extensive cosmical catastrophesay the subsidence of central america the immediate results of the disturbance would themselves be sufficiently complex besides the numberless dislocations of strata the ejections of igneous matter the propagation of earthquake vibrations thousands of miles around the loud explosions and the escape of gases there would be the rush of the atlantic and pacific oceans to fill the vacant space the subsequent recoil of enormous waves which would traverse both these oceans and produce myriads of changes along their shores the corresponding atmospheric waves complicated by the currents surrounding each volcanic vent and the electrical discharges with which such disturbances are accompanied but these temporary effects would be insignificant compared with the permanent ones the currents of the atlantic and pacific would be altered in their directions and amounts the distribution of heat achieved by those ocean currents would be different from what it is the arrangement of the isothermal lines not only on neighbouring continents but even throughout europe would be changed the tides would flow differently from what they do now there would be more or less modification of the winds in their periods strengths directions qualities rain would fall scarcely anywhere at the same times and in the same quantities as at present in short the meteorological conditions thousands of miles off on all sides would be more or less revolutionized thus without taking into account the infinitude of modifications which these changes would produce upon the flora and fauna both of land and sea the reader will perceive the immense heterogeneity of the results wrought out by one force when that force expends itself upon a previously complicated area and he will draw the corollary that from the beginning the complication has advanced at an increasing rate  before going on to show how organic progress also depends on the law that every force produces more than one change we have to notice the manifestation of this law in yet another species of inorganic progressnamely chemical the same general causes that have wrought out the heterogeneity of the earth physically considered have simultaneously wrought out its chemical heterogeneity there is every reason to believe that at an extreme heat the elements cannot combine even under such heat as can be artificially produced some very strong affinities yield as for instance that of oxygen for hydrogen and the great majority of chemical compounds are decomposed at much lower temperatures but without insisting on the highly probable inference that when the earth was in its first state of incandescence there were no chemical combinations at all it will suffice for our purpose to point to the unquestionable fact that the compounds which can exist at the highest temperatures and which must therefore have been the first that were formed as the earth cooled are those of the simplest constitutions the protoxidesincluding under that head the alkalies earths care as a class the most stable compounds we know most of them resisting decomposition by any heat we can generate these are combinations of the simplest orderare but one degree less homogeneous than the elements themselves more heterogeneous less stable and therefore later in the earths history are the deutoxides tritoxides peroxides c in which two three four or more atoms of oxygen are united with one atom of metal or other element higher than these in heterogeneity are the hydrates in which an oxide of hydrogen united with an oxide of some other element forms a substance whose atoms severally contain at least four ultimate atoms of three different kinds yet more heterogeneous and less stable still are the salts which present us with molecules each made up of five six seven eight ten twelve or more atoms of three if not more kinds then there are the hydrated salts of a yet greater heterogeneity which undergo partial decomposition at much lower temperatures after them come the further complicated supersalts and double salts having a stability again decreased and so throughout without entering into qualifications for which space fails we believe no chemist will deny it to be a general law of these inorganic combinations that other things equal the stability decreases as the complexity increases when we pass to the compounds of organic chemistry we find this general law still further exemplified we find much greater complexity and much less stability a molecule of albumen for instance consists of 482 ultimate atoms of five different kinds fibrine still more intricate in constitution contains in each molecule 298 atoms of carbon 49 of nitrogen 2 of sulphur 228 of hydrogen and 92 of oxygenin all 669 atoms or more strictly speaking equivalents and these two substances are so unstable as to decompose at quite ordinary temperatures as that to which the outside of a joint of roast meat is exposed thus it is manifest that the present chemical heterogeneity of the earths surface has arisen by degrees as the decrease of heat has permitted and that it has shown itself in three formsfirst in the multiplication of chemical compounds second in the greater number of different elements contained in the more modern of these compounds and third in the higher and more varied multiples in which these more numerous elements combine  to say that this advance in chemical heterogeneity is due to the one cause diminution of the earths temperature would be to say too much for it is clear that aqueous and atmospheric agencies have been concerned and further that the affinities of the elements themselves are implied the cause has all along been a composite one the cooling of the earth having been simply the most general of the concurrent causes or assemblage of conditions and here indeed it may be remarked that in the several classes of facts already dealt with excepting perhaps the first and still more in those with which we shall presently deal the causes are more or less compound as indeed are nearly all causes with which we are acquainted scarcely any change can rightly be ascribed to one agency alone to the neglect of the permanent or temporary conditions under which only this agency produces the change but as it does not materially affect our argument we prefer for simplicitys sake to use throughout the popular mode of expression perhaps it will be further objected that to assign loss of heat as the cause of any changes is to attribute these changes not to a force but to the absence of a force and this is true strictly speaking the changes should be attributed to those forces which come into action when the antagonist force is withdrawn but though there is inaccuracy in saying that the freezing of water is due to the loss of its heat no practical error arises from it nor will a parallel laxity of expression vitiate our statements respecting the multiplication of effects indeed the objection serves but to draw attention to the fact that not only does the exertion of a force produce more than one change but the withdrawal of a force produces more than one change  returning to the thread of our exposition we have next to trace throughout organic progress this same allpervading principle and here where the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous was first observed the production of many effects by one cause is least easy to demonstrate the development of a seed into a plant or an ovum into an animal is so gradual while the forces which determine it are so involved and at the same time so unobtrusive that it is difficult to detect the multiplication of effects which is elsewhere so obvious but guided by indirect evidence we may safely conclude that here too the law holds note first how numerous are the changes which any marked action works upon an adult organisma human being for instance an alarming sound or sight besides the impressions on the organs of sense and the nerves may produce a start a scream a distortion of the face a trembling consequent on general muscular relaxation a burst of perspiration a rush of blood to the brain followed possibly by arrest of the hearts action and by syncope and if the subject be feeble an indisposition with its long train of complicated symptoms may set in similarly in cases of disease a minute portion of the smallpox virus introduced into the system will in a severe case cause during the first stage rigors heat of skin accelerated pulse furred tongue loss of appetite thirst epigastric uneasiness vomiting headache pains in the back and limbs muscular weakness convulsions delirium c in the second stage cutaneous eruption itching tingling sore throat swelled fauces salivation cough hoarseness dyspnoea c and in the third stage oedematous inflammations pneumonia pleurisy diarrhoea inflammation of the brain ophthalmia erysipelas c each of which enumerated symptoms is itself more or less complex medicines special foods better air might in like manner be instanced as producing multipled results now it needs only to consider that the many changes thus wrought by one force upon an adult organism will be in part paralleled in an embryo organism to understand how here also the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous may be due to the production of many effects by one cause the external heat which falling on a matter having special proclivities determines the first complications of the germ may by acting on these superinduce further complications upon these still higher and more numerous ones and so on continually each organ as it is developed serving by its actions and reactions on the rest to initiate new complexities the first pulsations of the foetal heart must simultaneously aid the unfolding of every part the growth of each tissue by taking from the blood special proportions of elements must modify the constitution of the blood and so must modify the nutrition of all the other tissues the hearts action implying as it does a certain waste necessitates an addition to the blood of effete matters which must influence the rest of the system and perhaps as some think cause the formation of excretory organs the nervous connexions established among the viscera must further multiply their mutual influences and so continually still stronger becomes the probability of this view when we call to mind the fact that the same germ may be evolved into different forms according to circumstances thus during its earlier stages every embryo is sexlessbecomes either male or female as the balance of forces acting on it determines again it is a wellestablished fact that the larva of a workingbee will develop into a queenbee if before it is too late its food be changed to that on which the larvæ of queenbees are fed all which instances suggest that the proximate cause of each advance in embryonic complication is the action of incident forces upon the complication previously existing indeed we may find a priori reason to think that the evolution proceeds after this manner for since no germ animal or vegetal contains the slightest rudiment or indication of the future organismsince the microscope has shown us that the first process set up in every fertilized germ is a process of repeated spontaneous fissions ending in the production of a mass of cells not one of which exhibits any special character there seems no alternative but to suppose that the partial organization at any moment existing in a growing embryo is transformed by the agencies acting upon it into the succeeding phase of organization and this into the next until through everincreasing complexities the ultimate form is reached not indeed that we can thus really explain the production of any plant or animal we are still in the dark respecting those mysterious properties in virtue of which the germ when subject to fit influences undergoes the special changes that begin the series of transformations all we aim to show is that given a germ possessing those particular proclivities distinguishing the species to which it belongs and the evolution of an organism from it probably depends on that multiplication of effects which we have seen to be the cause of progress in general so far as we have yet traced it  when leaving the development of single plants and animals we pass to that of the earths flora and fauna the course of our argument again becomes clear and simple though as was admitted in the first part of this article the fragmentary facts paleontology has accumulated do not clearly warrant us in saying that in the lapse of geologic time there have been evolved more heterogeneous organisms and more heterogeneous assemblages of organisms yet we shall now see that there must ever have been a tendency towards these results we shall find that the production of many effects by one cause which as already shown has been all along increasing the physical heterogeneity of the earth has further involved an increasing heterogeneity in its flora and fauna individually and collectively an illustration will make this clear suppose that by a series of upheavals occurring as they are now known to do at long intervals the east indian archipelago were to be step by step raised into a continent and a chain of mountains formed along the axis of elevation by the first of these upheavals the plants and animals inhabiting borneo sumatra new guinea and the rest would be subjected to slightly modified sets of conditions the climate in general would be altered in temperature in humidity and in its periodical variations while the local differences would be multiplied these modifications would affect perhaps inappreciably the entire flora and fauna of the region the change of level would produce additional modifications varying in different species and also in different members of the same species according to their distance from the axis of elevation plants growing only on the seashore in special localities might become extinct others living only in swamps of a certain humidity would if they survived at all probably undergo visible changes of appearance while still greater alterations would occur in the plants gradually spreading over the lands newly raised above the sea the animals and insects living on these modified plants would themselves be in some degree modified by change of food as well as by change of climate and the modification would be more marked where from the dwindling or disappearance of one kind of plant an allied kind was eaten in the lapse of the many generations arising before the next upheaval the sensible or insensible alterations thus produced in each species would become organizedthere would be a more or less complete adaptation to the new conditions the next upheaval would superinduce further organic changes implying wider divergences from the primary forms and so repeatedly but now let it be observed that the revolution thus resulting would not be a substitution of a thousand more or less modified species for the thousand original species but in place of the thousand original species there would arise several thousand species or varieties or changed forms each species being distributed over an area of some extent and tending continually to colonize the new area exposed its different members would be subject to different sets of changes plants and animals spreading towards the equator would not be affected in the same way as others spreading from it those spreading towards the new shores would undergo changes unlike the changes undergone by those spreading into the mountains thus each original race of organisms would become the root from which diverged several races differing more or less from it and from each other and while some of these might subsequently disappear probably more than one would survive in the next geologic period the very dispersion itself increasing the chances of survival not only would there be certain modifications thus caused by change of physical conditions and food but also in some cases other modifications caused by change of habit the fauna of each island peopling step by step the newlyraised tracts would eventually come in contact with the faunas of other islands and some members of these other faunas would be unlike any creatures before seen herbivores meeting with new beasts of prey would in some cases be led into modes of defence or escape differing from those previously used and simultaneously the beasts of prey would modify their modes of pursuit and attack we know that when circumstances demand it such changes of habit do take place in animals and we know that if the new habits become the dominant ones they must eventually in some degree alter the organization observe now however a further consequence there must arise not simply a tendency towards the differentiation of each race of organisms into several races but also a tendency to the occasional production of a somewhat higher organism taken in the mass these divergent varieties which have been caused by fresh physical conditions and habits of life will exhibit changes quite indefinite in kind and degree and changes that do not necessarily constitute an advance probably in most cases the modified type will be neither more nor less heterogeneous than the original one in some cases the habits of life adopted being simpler than before a less heterogeneous structure will result there will be a retrogradation but it must now and then occur that some division of a species falling into circumstances which give it rather more complex experiences and demand actions somewhat more involved will have certain of its organs further differentiated in proportionately small degreeswill become slightly more heterogeneous thus in the natural course of things there will from time to time arise an increased heterogeneity both of the earths flora and fauna and of individual races included in them omitting detailed explanations and allowing for the qualifications which cannot here be specified we think it is clear that geological mutations have all along tended to complicate the forms of life whether regarded separately or collectively the same causes which have led to the evolution of the earths crust from the simple into the complex have simultaneously led to a parallel evolution of the life upon its surface in this case as in previous ones we see that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is consequent upon the universal principle that every active force produces more than one change  the deduction here drawn from the established truths of geology and the general laws of life gains immensely in weight on finding it to be in harmony with an induction drawn from direct experience just that divergence of many races from one race which we inferred must have been continually occurring during geologic time we know to have occurred during the prehistoric and historic periods in man and domestic animals and just that multiplication of effects which we concluded must have produced the first we see has produced the last single causes as famine pressure of population war have periodically led to further dispersions of mankind and of dependent creatures each such dispersion initiating new modifications new varieties of type whether all the human races be or be not derived from one stock philology makes it clear that whole groups of races now easily distinguishable from each other were originally one racethat the diffusion of one race into different climates and conditions of existence has produced many modified forms of it similarly with domestic animals though in some casesas that of dogscommunity of origin will perhaps be disputed yet in other casesas that of the sheep or the cattle of our own countryit will not be questioned that local differences of climate food and treatment have transformed one original breed into numerous breeds now become so far distinct as to produce unstable hybrids moreover through the complication of effects flowing from single causes we here find what we before inferred not only an increase of general heterogeneity but also of special heterogeneity while of the divergent divisions and subdivisions of the human race many have undergone changes not constituting an advance while in some the type may have degraded in others it has become decidedly more heterogeneous the civilized european departs more widely from the vertebrate archetype than does the savage thus both the law and the cause of progress which from lack of evidence can be but hypothetically substantiated in respect of the earlier forms of life on our globe can be actually substantiated in respect of the latest forms4  if the advance of man towards greater heterogeneity is traceable to the production of many effects by one cause still more clearly may the advance of society towards greater heterogeneity be so explained consider the growth of an industrial organization when as must occasionally happen some member of a tribe displays unusual aptitude for making an article of general usea weapon for instancewhich was before made by each man for himself there arises a tendency towards the differentiation of that member into a maker of such weapon his companionswarriors and hunters all of themseverally feel the importance of having the best weapons that can be made and are therefore certain to offer strong inducements to this skilled individual to make weapons for them he on the other hand having not only an unusual faculty but an unusual liking for making such weapons the talent and the desire for any occupation being commonly associated is predisposed to fulfil each commission on the offer of an adequate reward especially as his love of distinction is also gratified and his living facilitated this first specialization of function once commenced tends ever to become more decided on the side of the weaponmaker practice gives increased skillincreased superiority to his products on the side of his clients cessation of practice entails decreased skill thus the influences which determine this division of labour grow stronger in both ways and the incipient heterogeneity is on the average of cases likely to become permanent for that generation if no longer this process not only differentiates the social mass into two parts the one monopolizing or almost monopolizing the performance of a certain function and the other losing the habit and in some measure the power of performing that function but it tends to initiate other differentiations the advance described implies the introduction of barterthe maker of weapons has on each occasion to be paid in such other articles as he agrees to take in exchange he will not habitually take in exchange one kind of article but many kinds he does not want mats only or skins or fishinggear but he wants all these and on each occasion will bargain for the particular things he most needs what follows if among his fellows there exist any slight differences of skill in the manufacture of these various things as there are almost sure to do the weaponmaker will take from each one the thing which that one excels in making he will exchange for mats with him whose mats are superior and will bargain for the fishinggear of him who has the best but he who has bartered away his mats or his fishinggear must make other mats or fishinggear for himself and in so doing must in some degree further develop his aptitude thus it results that the small specialities of faculty possessed by various members of the tribe will tend to grow more decided and whether or not there ensue distinct differentiations of other individuals into makers of particular articles it is clear that incipient differentiations take place throughout the tribe the one original cause produces not only the first dual effect but a number of secondary dual effects like in kind but minor in degree this process of which traces may be seen among schoolboys cannot well produce lasting effects in an unsettled tribe but where there grows up a fixed and multiplying community such differentiations become permanent and increase with each generation the enhanced demand for every commodity intensifies the functional activity of each specialized person or class and this renders the specialization more definite where it already exists and establishes it where it is but nascent by increasing the pressure on the means of subsistence a larger population again augments these results seeing that each person is forced more and more to confine himself to that which he can do best and by which he can gain most presently under these same stimuli new occupations arise competing workers ever aiming to produce improved articles occasionally discover better processes or raw materials the substitution of bronze for stone entails on him who first makes it a great increase of demand so that he or his successor eventually finds all his time occupied in making the bronze for the articles he sells and is obliged to depute the fashioning of these articles to others and eventually the making of bronze thus differentiated from a preexisting occupation becomes an occupation by itself but now mark the ramified changes which follow this change bronze presently replaces stone not only in the articles it was first used for but in many othersin arms tools and utensils of various kinds and so affects the manufacture of them further it affects the processes which these utensils subserve and the resulting productsmodifies buildings carvings personal decorations yet again it sets going manufactures which were before impossible from lack of a material fit for the requisite implements and all these changes react on the peopleincrease their manipulative skill their intelligence their comfortrefine their habits and tastes thus the evolution of a homogeneous society into a heterogeneous one is clearly consequent on the general principle that many effects are produced by one cause  space permitting we might show how the localization o£ special industries in special parts of a kingdom as well as the minute subdivision of labour in the making of each commodity are similarly determined or turning to a somewhat different order of illustrations we might dwell on the multitudinous changesmaterial intellectual moralcaused by printing or the further extensive series of changes wrought by gunpowder but leaving the intermediate phases of social development let us take a few illustrations from its most recent and its passing phases to trace the effects of steampower in its manifold applications to mining navigation and manufactures of all kinds would carry us into unmanageable detail let us confine ourselves to the latest embodiment of steam powerthe locomotive engine this as the proximate cause of our railway system has changed the face of the country the course of trade and the habits of the people consider first the complicated sets of changes that precede the making of every railwaythe provisional arrangements the meetings the registration the trial section the parliamentary survey the lithographed plans the books of reference the local deposits and notices the application to parliament the passing standing orders committee the first second and third readings each of which brief heads indicates a multiplicity of transactions and the extra development of sundry occupationsas those of engineers surveyors lithographers parliamentary agents sharebrokers and the creation of sundry othersas those of traffictakers referencetakers consider next the yet more marked changes implied in railway constructionthe cuttings embankings tunnellings diversions of roads the building of bridges and stations the laying down of ballast sleepers and rails the making of engines tenders carriages and waggons which processes acting on numerous trades increase the importation of timber the quarrying of stone the manufacture of iron the mining of coal the burning of bricks institute a variety of special manufactures weekly advertised in the railway times and finally open the way to sundry new occupations as those of drivers stokers cleaners platelayers c c and then consider the changes still more numerous and involved which railways in action produce on the community at large business agencies are established where previously they would not have paid goods are obtained from remote wholesale houses instead of near retail ones and commodities are used which distance once rendered inaccessible again the diminished cost of carriage tends to specialize more than ever the industries of different districtsto confine each manufacture to the parts in which from local advantages it can be best carried on further the fall in freights facilitating distribution equalizes prices and also on the average lowers prices thus bringing divers articles within the means of those before unable to buy them and so increasing their comforts and improving their habits at the same time the practice of travelling is immensely extended people who never before dreamed of it take trips to the sea visit their distant relations make tours and so we are benefited in body feelings and ideas the more prompt transmission of letters and of news produces other marked changesmakes the pulse of the nation faster once more there arises a wide dissemination of cheap literature through railway bookstalls and of advertisements in railway carriages both of them aiding ulterior progress and the countless changes here briefly indicated are consequent on the invention of the locomotive engine the social organism has been rendered more heterogeneous in virtue of the many new occupations introduced and the many old ones further specialized prices of nearly all things in every place have been altered each trader has modified his way of doing business and every person has been affected in his actions thoughts emotions  illustrations to the same effect might be indefinitely accumulated but they are needless the only further fact demanding notice is that we here see still more clearly the truth before pointed out that in proportion as the area on which any force expends itself becomes heterogeneous the results are in a yet higher degree multiplied in number and kind while among the simple tribes to whom it was first known caoutchouc caused but few changes among ourselves the changes have been so many and varied that the history of them occupies a volume5 upon the small homogeneous community inhabiting one of the hebrides the electric telegraph would produce were it used scarcely any results but in england the results it produces are multitudinous the comparatively simple organization under which our ancestors lived five centuries ago could have undergone but few modifications from an event like the recent one at canton but now the legislative decision respecting it sets up many hundreds of complex modifications each of which will be the parent of numerous future ones  space permitting we could willingly have pursued the argument in relation to all the subtler results of civilization as before we showed that the law of progress to which the organic and inorganic worlds conform is also conformed to by language the plastic arts music c so might we here show that the cause which we have hitherto found to determine progress holds in these cases also instances might be given proving how in science an advance of one division presently advances other divisionshow astronomy has been immensely forwarded by discoveries in optics while other optical discoveries have initiated microscopic anatomy and greatly aided the growth of physiologyhow chemistry has indirectly increased our knowledge of electricity magnetism biology geologyhow electricity has reacted on chemistry and magnetism and has developed our views of light and heat in literature the same truth might be exhibited in the manifold effects of the primitive mysteryplay as originating the modern drama which has variously branched or in the still multiplying forms of periodical literature which have descended from the first newspaper and which have severally acted and reacted on other forms of literature and on each other the influence which a new school of paintingas that of the preraphaelitesexercises upon other schools the hints which all kinds of pictorial art are deriving from photography the complex results of new critical doctrines as those of mr ruskin might severally be dwelt upon as displaying the like multiplication of effects  but we venture to think our case is already made out the imperfections of statement which brevity has necessitated do not we believe invalidate the propositions laid down the qualifications here and there demanded would not if made affect the inferences though in tracing the genesis of progress we have frequently spoken of complex causes as if they were simple ones it still remains true that such causes are far less complex than their results detailed criticisms do not affect our main position endless facts go to show that every kind of progress is from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous and that it is so because each change is followed by many changes and it is significant that where the facts are most accessible and abundant there these truths are most manifest  however to avoid committing ourselves to more than is yet proved we must be content with saying that such are the law and the cause of all progress that is known to us should the nebular hypothesis ever be established then it will become manifest that the universe at large like every organism was once homogeneous that as a whole and in every detail it has unceasingly advanced towards greater heterogeneity it will be seen that as in each event of today so from the beginning the decomposition of every expended force into several forces has been perpetually producing a higher complication that the increase of heterogeneity so brought about is still going on and must continue to go on and that thus progress is not an accident not a thing within human control but a beneficent necessity                                       a few words must be added on the ontological bearings of our argument probably not a few will conclude that here is an attempted solution of the great questions with which philosophy in all ages has perplexed itself let none thus deceive themselves after all that has been said the ultimate mystery remains just as it was the explanation of that which is explicable does but bring out into greater clearness the inexplicableness of that which remains behind little as it seems to do so fearless inquiry tends continually to give a firmer basis to all true religion the timid sectarian obliged to abandon one by one the superstitions bequeathed to him and daily finding his cherished beliefs more and more shaken secretly fears that all things may some day be explained and has a corresponding dread of science thus evincing the profoundest of all infidelitythe fear lest the truth be bad on the other hand the sincere man of science content to follow wherever the evidence leads him becomes by each new inquiry more profoundly convinced that the universe is an insoluble problem alike in the external and the internal worlds he sees himself in the midst of ceaseless changes of which he can discover neither beginning nor end if tracing back the evolution of things he allows himself to entertain the hypothesis that all matter once existed in a diffused form he finds it impossible to conceive how this came to be so and equally if he speculates on the future he can assign no limit to the grand succession of phenomena ever unfolding themselves before him similarly if he looks inward he perceives that both terminations of the thread of consciousness are beyond his grasp he cannot remember when or how consciousness commenced and he cannot examine the consciousness at any moment existing for only a state of consciousness which is already past can become the object of thought and never one which is passing when again he turns from the succession of phenomena external or internal to their essential nature he is equally at fault though he may succeed in resolving all properties of objects into manifestations of force he is not thereby enabled to conceive what force is but finds on the contrary that the more he thinks about it the more he is baffled similarly though analysis of mental actions may finally bring him down to sensations as the original materials out of which all thought is woven he is none the forwarder for he cannot in the least comprehend sensation inward and outward things he thus discovers to be alike inscrutable in their ultimate genesis and nature he sees that the materialist and spiritualist controversy is a mere war of words the disputants being equally absurdeach believing he understands that which it is impossible for any man to understand in all directions his investigations eventually bring him face to face with the unknowable and he ever more clearly perceives it to be the unknowable he learns at once the greatness and the littleness of human intellectits power in dealing with all that comes within the range of experience its impotence in dealing with all that transcends experience he feels more vividly than any others can feel the utter incomprehensibleness of the simplest fact considered in itself he alone truly sees that absolute knowledge is impossible he alone knows that under all things there lies an impenetrable mystery  footnotes  footnote 2 since this was written in 1857 the advance of paleontological discovery especially in america has shown conclusively in respect of certain groups of vertebrates that higher types have arisen by modifications of lower so that in common with others prof huxley to whom the above allusion is made now admits or rather asserts biological progression and by implication that there have arisen more heterogeneous organic forms and a more heterogeneous assemblage of organic forms  footnote 3 for detailed proof of these assertions see essay on manners and fashion  footnote 4 the argument concerning organic evolution contained in this paragraph and the one preceding it stands verbatim as it did when first published in the westminster review for april 1857 i have thus left it without the alteration of a word that it may show the view i then held concerning the origin of species the sole cause recognized is that of direct adaptation of constitution to conditions consequent on inheritance of the modifications of structure resulting from use and disuse there is no recognition of that further cause disclosed in mr darwins work published two and a half years laterthe indirect adaptation resulting from the natural selection of favourable variations the multiplication of effects is however equally illustrated in whatever way the adaptation to changing conditions is effected or if it is effected in both ways as i hold i may add that there is indicated the view that the succession of organic forms is not serial but proceeds by perpetual divergence and redivergencethat there has been a continual divergence of many races from one race each species being a root from which several other species branch out and the growth of a tree being thus the implied symbol  footnote 5 personal narrative of the origin of the caoutchouc or indiarubber manufacture in england by thomas hancock     transcendental physiology      first published in the national review for october 1857     under the title of the ultimate laws of physiology the title     transcendental physiology which the editor did not approve was     restored when the essay was republished with others in 1857   the title transcendental anatomy is used to distinguish that division of biological science which treats not of the structures of individual organisms considered separately but of the general principles of structure common to vast and varied groups of organismsthe unity of plan discernible throughout multitudinous species genera and orders which differ widely in appearance and here under the head of transcendental physiology we purpose putting together sundry laws of development and function which hold not of particular kinds or classes of organisms but of all organisms laws some of which have not we believe been hitherto enunciated  by way of unobtrusively introducing the general reader to biological truths of this class let us begin by noticing one or two with which he is familiar take first the relation between the activity of an organ and its growth this is a universal relation it holds not only of a bone a muscle a nerve an organ of sense a mental faculty but of every gland every viscus every element of the body it is seen not in man only but in each animal which affords us adequate opportunity of tracing it always providing that the performance of function is not so excessive as to produce disorder or to exceed the repairing powers either of the system at large or of the particular agencies by which nutriment is brought to the organalways providing this it is a law of organized bodies that other things equal development varies as function on this law are based all maxims and methods of right education intellectual moral and physical and when statesmen are wise enough to see it this law will be found to underlie all right legislation  another truth coextensive with the organic world is that of hereditary transmission it is not as commonly supposed that hereditary transmission is exemplified merely in reappearance of the family peculiarities displayed by immediate or remote progenitors nor does the law of hereditary transmission comprehend only such more general facts as that modified plants or animals become the parents of permanent varieties and that new kinds of potatoes new breeds of sheep new races of men have been thus originated these are but minor exemplifications of the law understood in its entirety the law is that each plant or animal produces others of like kind with itself the likeness of kind consisting not so much in the repetition of individual traits as in the assumption of the same general structure this truth has been made by daily illustration so familiar as nearly to have lost its significance that wheat produces wheatthat existing oxen are descended from ancestral oxenthat every unfolding organism ultimately takes the form of the class order genus and species from which it sprang is a fact which by force of repetition has assumed in our minds the character of a necessity it is in this however that the law of hereditary transmission is principally displayed the phenomena commonly named as exemplifying it being quite subordinate manifestations and the law as thus understood is universal not forgetting the apparent but only apparent exceptions presented by the strange class of phenomena known as alternate generation the truth that like produces like is common to all types of organisms  let us take next a universal physiological law of a less conspicuous kind to the ordinary observer it seems that the multiplication of organisms proceeds in various ways he sees that the young of the higher animals when born resemble their parents that birds lay eggs which they foster and hatch that fish deposit spawn and leave it among plants he finds that while in some cases new individuals grow from seeds only in other cases they also grow from tubers that by certain plants layers are sent out take root and develop new individuals and that many plants can be reproduced from cuttings further in the mould that quickly covers stale food and the infusoria that soon swarm in water exposed to air and light he sees a mode of generation which seeming inexplicable he is apt to consider spontaneous the reader of popular science thinks the modes of reproduction still more various he learns that whole tribes of creatures multiply by gemmationby a development from the body of the parent of buds which after unfolding into the parental form separate and lead independent lives concerning microscopic forms of both animal and vegetal life he reads that the ordinary mode of multiplication is by spontaneous fissiona splitting up of the original individual into two or more individuals which by and by severally repeat the process still more remarkable are the cases in which as in the aphis an egg gives rise to an imperfect female from which other imperfect females are born viviparously grow and in their turns bear other imperfect females and so on for eight ten or more generations until finally perfect males and females are viviparously produced but now under all these and many more modified modes of multiplication the physiologist finds complete uniformity the startingpoint not only of every higher animal or plant but of every clan of organisms which by fission or gemmation have sprung from a single organism is always a spore seed or ovum the millions of infusoria or of aphides which by subdivision or gemmation have proceeded from one individual the countless plants which have been successively propagated from one original plant by cuttings or tubers are in common with the highest creature primarily descended from a fertilized germ and in all casesin the humblest alga as in the oak in the protozoon as in the mammalthis fertilized germ results from the union of the contents of two cells whether as among the lowest forms of life these two cells are seemingly identical in nature or whether as among higher forms they are distinguishable into spermcell and germcell it remains throughout true that from their combination results the mass out of which is evolved a new organism or new series of organisms that this law is without exception we are not prepared to say for in the case of the aphis certain experiments are thought to imply that under special conditions the descendants of an original individual may continue multiplying for ever without further fecundation but we know of no case where it actually is so for although there are certain plants of which the seeds have never been seen it is more probable that our observations are in fault than that these plants are exceptions and until we find undoubted exceptions the abovestated induction must stand here then we have another of the truths of transcendental physiology a truth which so far as we know transcends all distinctions of genus order class kingdom and applies to every living thing  yet another generalization of like universality expresses the process of organic development to the ordinary observer there seems no unity in this no obvious parallelism exists between the unfolding of a plant and the unfolding of an animal there is no manifest similarity between the development of a mammal which proceeds without break from its first to its last stage and that of an insect which is divided into stronglymarked stagesegg larva pupa imago nevertheless it is now an established fact that all organisms are evolved after one general method at the outset the germ of every plant or animal is relatively homogeneous and advance towards maturity is advance towards greater heterogeneity each organized thing commences as an almost structureless mass and reaches its ultimate complexity by the establishment of distinctions upon distinctionsby the divergence of tissues from tissues and organs from organs here then we have yet another biological law of transcendent generality  having thus recognized the scope of transcendental physiology as presented in its leading truths we are prepared for the considerations that are to follow                                       and first returning to the last of the great generalizations above given let us inquire more nearly how this change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is carried on usually it is said to result from successive differentiations this however cannot be considered a complete account of the process during the evolution of an organism there occur not only separations of parts but coalescences of parts there is not only segregation but aggregation the heart at first a simple pulsating bloodvessel by and by twists upon itself and becomes integrated the bilecells constituting the rudimentary liver do not merely diverge from the surface of the intestine in which they at first form a simple layer but they simultaneously consolidate into a definite organ and the gradual concentration seen in these and other cases is a part of the developmental processa part which though more or less recognized by milneedwards and others does not seem to have been included as an essential element in it  this progressive integration manifest alike when tracing up the several stages passed through by every embryo and when ascending from the lower organic forms to the higher may be most conveniently studied under several heads let us consider first what may be called longitudinal integration  the lower annulosaworms myriapods care characterized by the great numbers of segments of which they respectively consist reaching in some cases to several hundreds but as we advance to the higher annulosacentipedes crustaceans insects spiderswe find these numbers greatly reduced down to twentytwo thirteen and even fewer and accompanying this there is a shortening or integration of the whole body reaching its extreme in crabs and spiders similarly with the development of an individual crustacean or insect the thorax of a lobster which in the adult forms with the head one compact box containing the viscera is made up by the union of a number of segments which in the embryo were separable the thirteen distinct divisions seen in the body of a caterpillar become further integrated in the butterfly several segments are consolidated to form the thorax and the abdominal segments are more aggregated than they originally were the like truth is seen when we pass to the internal organs in the lower annulose forms and in the larvæ of the higher ones the alimentary canal consists either of a tube that is uniform from end to end or else bulges into a succession of stomachs one to each segment but in the developed forms there is a single welldefined stomach in the nervous vascular and respiratory systems a parallel concentration may be traced again in the development of the vertebrata we have sundry examples of longitudinal integration the coalescence of several segmental groups of bones to form the skull is one instance of it it is further illustrated in the os coccygis which results from the fusion of a number of caudal vertebræ and in the consolidation of the sacral vertebræ of a bird it is also well exemplified  that which we may distinguish as transverse integration is well illustrated among the annulosa in the development of the nervous system leaving out those simple forms which do not present distinct ganglia it is to be observed that the lower annulose animals in common with the larvæ of the higher are severally characterized by a double chain of ganglia running from end to end of the body while in the more advanced annulose animals this double chain becomes a single chain mr newport has described the course of this concentration in insects and by rathke it has been traced in crustaceans in the early stages of the astacus fluviatilis or common crayfish there is a pair of separate ganglia to each ring of the fourteen pairs belonging to the head and thorax the three pairs in advance of the mouth consolidate into one mass to form the brain or cephalic ganglion meanwhile out of the remainder the first six pairs severally unite in the median line while the rest remain more or less separate of these six double ganglia thus formed the anterior four coalesce into one mass the remaining two coalesce into another mass and then these two masses coalesce into one here we see longitudinal and transverse integration going on simultaneously and in the highest crustaceans they are both carried still further the vertebrata exhibit this transverse integration in the development of the generative system the lowest of the mammaliathe monotrematain common with birds have oviducts which towards their lower extremities are dilated into cavities severally performing in an imperfect way the function of a uterus in the marsupialia there is a closer approximation of the two lateral sets of organs on the median line for the oviducts converge towards one another and meet without coalescing on the median line so that their uterine dilatations are in contact with each other forming a true double uterus  as we ascend the series of placental mammals we find the lateral coalescence becoming gradually more and more complete in many of the rodentia the uterus still remains completely divided into two lateral halves whilst in others these coalesce at their lower portion forming a rudiment of the true body of the uterus in the human subject this part increases at the expense of the lateral cornua in the higher herbivora and carnivora but even in the lower quadrumana the uterus is somewhat cleft at its summit6 and this process of transverse integration which is still more striking when observed in its details is accompanied by parallel though less important changes in the opposite sex once more in the increasing commissural connexion of the cerebral hemispheres which though separate in the lower vertebrata become gradually more united in the higher we have another instance and further ones of a different order but of like general implication are supplied by the vascular system  now it seems to us that the various kinds of integration here exemplified which are commonly set down as so many independent phenomena ought to be generalized and included in the formula describing the process of development the fact that in an adult crab many pairs of ganglia originally separate have become fused into a single mass is a fact only second in significance to the differentiation of its alimentary canal into stomach and intestine that in the higher annulosa a single heart replaces the string of rudimentary hearts constituting the dorsal bloodvessel in the lower annulosa reaching in one species to the number of one hundred and sixty is a truth as much needing to be comprised in the history of evolution as is the formation of a respiratory surface by a branched expansion of the skin a right conception of the genesis of a vertebral column includes not only the differentiations from which result the chorda dorsalis and the vertebral segments imbedded in it but quite as much it includes the coalescence of numerous vertebral processes with their respective vertebral bodies the changes in virtue of which several things become one demand recognition equally with those in virtue of which one thing becomes several evidently then the current statement which ascribes the developmental progress to differentiations alone is incomplete adequately to express the facts we must say that the transition from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is carried on by differentiations and accompanying integrations  it may not be amiss here to askwhat is the meaning of these integrations the evidence seems to show that they are in some way dependent on community of function the eight segments which coalesce to make the head of a centipede jointly protect the cephalic ganglion and afford a solid fulcrum for the jaws c the many bones which unite to form a vertebral skull have like uses in the consolidation of the several pieces which constitute a mammalian pelvis and in the anchylosis of from ten to nineteen vertebræ in the sacrum of a bird we have kindred instances of the integration of parts which transfer the weight of the body to the legs the more or less extensive fusion of the tibia with the fibula and the radius with the ulna in the ungulated mammals whose habits require only partial rotations of the limbs is a fact of like meaning and all the instances lately giventhe concentration of ganglia the replacement of many pulsating bloodsacs by fewer and finally by one the fusion of two uteri into a single uterushave the same implication whether as in some cases the integration is merely a consequence of the growth which eventually brings into contact adjacent parts performing similar duties or whether as in other cases there is an actual approximation of these parts before their union or whether as in yet other cases the integration is of that indirect kind which arises when out of a number of like organs one or a group discharges an everincreasing share of the common function and so grows while the rest dwindle and disappearthe general fact remains the same that there is a tendency to the unification of parts having similar duties  the tendency however acts under limiting conditions and recognition of them will explain some apparent exceptions in the human foetus as in the lower vertebrata the eyes are placed one on each side of the head during evolution they become relatively nearer and at birth are in front though they are still in the european infant as in the adult mongol proportionately further apart than they afterwards become but this approximation shows no signs of further increase two reasons suggest themselves one is that the two eyes have not quite the same function since they are directed to slightlydifferent aspects of each object looked at and since the resulting binocular vision has an advantage over monocular vision there results a check upon further approach towards identity of function and unity of structure the other reason is that the interposed structures do not admit of any nearer approach for the orbits of the eyes to be brought closer together would imply a decrease in the olfactory chambers and as these are probably not larger than is demanded by their present functional activity no decrease can take place again if we trace up the external organs of smell through fishes7 reptiles ungulate mammals and unguiculate mammals to man we perceive a general tendency to coalescence in the median line and on comparing the savage with the civilized or the infant with the adult we see this approach of the nostrils carried furthest in the most perfect of the species but since the septum which divides them has the function both of an evaporating surface for the lachrymal secretion and of a ramifying surface for a nerve ancillary to that of smell it does not disappear entirely the integration remains incomplete these and other like instances do not however militate against the hypothesis they merely show that the tendency is sometimes antagonized by other tendencies bearing in mind which qualification we may say that as differentiation of parts is connected with difference of function so there appears to be a connexion between integration of parts and sameness of function                                       closely related to the general truth that the evolution of all organisms is carried on by combined differentiations and integrations is another general truth which physiologists appear not to have recognized when we look at the organic world as a whole we may observe that on passing from lower to higher forms we pass to forms which are not only characterized by a greater differentiation of parts but are at the same time more completely differentiated from the surrounding medium this truth may be contemplated under various aspects  in the first place it is illustrated in structure the advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous itself involves an increasing distinction from the inorganic world in the lowest protozoa as some of the rhizopods we have a homogeneity approaching to that of air water or earth and the ascent to organisms of greater and greater complexity of structure is an ascent to organisms which are in that respect more strongly contrasted with the relatively structureless masses in the environment  in form again we see the same truth a general characteristic of inorganic matter is its indefiniteness of form and this is also a characteristic of the lower organisms as compared with the higher speaking generally plants are less definite than animals both in shape and sizeadmit of greater modifications from variations of position and nutrition among animals the amoeba and its allies are not only almost structureless but are amorphous and the irregular form is constantly changing of the organisms resulting from the aggregation of amoebalike creatures we find that while some assume a certain definiteness of form in their compound shells at least others as the sponges are irregular in the zoophytes and in the polyzoa we see compound organisms most of which have modes of growth not more determinate than those of plants but among the higher animals we find not only that the mature shape of each species is quite definite but that the individuals of each species differ very little in size  a parallel increase of contrast is seen in chemical composition with but few exceptions and those only partial ones the lowest animal and vegetal forms are inhabitants of the water and water is almost their sole constituent dessicated protophyta and protozoa shrink into mere dust and among the acalephes we find but a few grains of solid matter to a pound of water the higher aquatic plants in common with the higher aquatic animals possessing as they do much greater tenacity of substance also contain a greater proportion of the organic elements and so are chemically more unlike their medium and when we pass to the superior classes of organismsland plants and land animalswe find that chemically considered they have little in common either with the earth on which they stand or the air which surrounds them  in specific gravity too we may note the like the very simplest forms in common with the spores and gemmules of the higher ones are as nearly as may be of the same specific gravity as the water in which they float and though it cannot be said that among aquatic creatures superior specific gravity is a standard of general superiority yet we may fairly say that the superior orders of them when divested of the appliances by which their specific gravity is regulated differ more from water in their relative weights than do the lower in terrestrial organisms the contrast becomes extremely marked trees and plants in common with insects reptiles mammals birds are all of a specific gravity considerably less than the earth and immensely greater than the air  we see the law similarly fulfilled in respect of temperature plants generate but an extremely small quantity of heat which is to be detected only by delicate experiments and practically they may be considered as being in this respect like their environment aquatic animals rise very little above the surrounding water in temperature that of the invertebrata being mostly less than a degree above it and that of fishes not exceeding it by more than two or three degrees save in the case of some large redblooded fishes as the tunny which exceed it by nearly ten degrees among insects the range is from two to ten degrees above that of the air the excess varying according to their activity the heat of reptiles is from four to fifteen degrees more than that of their medium while mammals and birds maintain a heat which continues almost unaffected by external variations and is often greater than that of the air by seventy eighty ninety and even a hundred degrees  once more in greater selfmobility a progressive differentiation is traceable dead matter is inert some form of independent motion is our most general test of life passing over the indefinite borderland between the animal and vegetable kingdoms we may roughly class plants as organisms which while they exhibit the kind of motion implied in growth are not only without locomotive power but in nearly all cases are without the power of moving their parts in relation to one another and thus are less differentiated from the inorganic world than animals though in those microscopic protophyta and protozoa inhabiting the waterthe spores of algæ the gemmules of sponges and the infusoria generallywe see locomotion produced by ciliary action yet this locomotion while rapid relatively to their sizes is absolutely slow of the coelenterata a great part are either permanently rooted or habitually stationary and so have scarcely any selfmobility but that implied in the relative movements of parts while the rest of which the common jellyfish serves as a sample have mostly but little ability to move themselves through the water among the higher aquatic invertebratacuttlefishes and lobsters for instancethere is a very considerable power of locomotion and the aquatic vertebrata are considered as a class much more active in their movements than the other inhabitants of the water but it is only when we come to airbreathing creatures that we find the vital characteristic of selfmobility manifested in the highest degree flying insects mammals birds travel with velocities far exceeding those attained by any of the lower classes of animals and so are more strongly contrasted with their inert environments  thus on contemplating the various grades of organisms in their ascending order we find them more and more distinguished from their inanimate media in structure in form in chemical composition in specific gravity in temperature in selfmobility it is true that this generalization does not hold with regularity organisms which are in some respects the most strongly contrasted with the inorganic world are in other respects less contrasted than inferior organisms as a class mammals are higher than birds and yet they are of lower temperature and have smaller powers of locomotion the stationary oyster is of higher organization than the freeswimming medusa and the coldblooded and less heterogeneous fish is quicker in its movements than the warmblooded and more heterogeneous sloth but the admission that the several aspects under which this increasing contrast shows itself bear variable ratios to one another does not negative the general truth enunciated looking at the facts in the mass it cannot be denied that the successively higher groups of organisms are severally characterized not only by greater differentiation of parts but also by greater differentiation from the surrounding medium in sundry other physical attributes it would seem that this peculiarity has some necessary connexion with superior vital manifestations one of those lowly gelatinous forms which are some of them so transparent and colourless as to be with difficulty distinguished from the water they float in is not more like its medium in chemical mechanical optical thermal and other properties than it is in the passivity with which it submits to all the actions brought to bear on it while the mammal does not more widely differ from inanimate things in these properties than it does in the activity with which it meets surrounding changes by compensating changes in itself between these two extremes we see a tolerably constant ratio between these two kinds of contrast in proportion as an organism is physically like its environment it remains a passive partaker of the changes going on in its environment while in proportion as it is endowed with powers of counteracting such changes it exhibits greater unlikeness to its environment                                       thus far we have proceeded inductively in conformity with established usage but it seems to us that much may be done in this and other departments of biologic inquiry by pursuing the deductive method the generalizations at present constituting the science of physiology both general and special have been reached a posteriori but certain fundamental data have now been discovered starting from which we may reason our way a priori not only to some of the truths that have been ascertained by observation and experiment but also to some others the possibility of such a priori conclusions will be at once recognized on considering some familiar cases  chemists have shown that a necessary condition to vital activity in animals is oxidation of certain matters contained in the body either as components or as waste products the oxygen requisite for this oxidation is contained in the surrounding mediumair or water as the case may be if the organism be minute mere contact of its external surface with the oxygenated medium achieves the requisite oxidation but if the organism is bulky and so exposes a surface which is small in proportion to its mass any considerable oxidation cannot be thus achieved one of two things is therefore implied either this bulky organism receiving no oxygen but that absorbed through its integument must possess but little vital activity or else if it possesses much vital activity there must be some extensive ramified surface internal or external through which adequate aeration may take placea respiratory apparatus that is to say lungs or gills or branchiæ or their equivalents are predicable a priori as possessed by all active creatures of any size  similarly with respect to nutriment there are entozoa which living in the insides of other animals and being constantly bathed by nutritive fluids absorb a sufficiency through their outer surfaces and so have no need of stomachs and do not possess them but all other animals inhabiting media that are not in themselves nutritive but only contain masses of food here and there must have appliances by which these masses of food may be utilized evidently mere external contact of a solid organism with a solid portion of nutriment could not result in the absorption of it in any moderate time if at all to effect absorption there must be both a solvent or macerating action and an extended surface fit for containing and imbibing the dissolved products there must be a digestive cavity thus given the ordinary conditions of animal life and the possession of stomachs by all creatures living under these conditions may be deductively known  carrying out the train of reasoning still further we may infer the existence of a vascular system or something equivalent to it in all creatures of any size and activity in a comparatively small inert animal such as the hydra which consists of little more than a sac having a double wallan outer layer of cells forming the skin and an inner layer forming the digestive and absorbent surfacethere is no need for a special apparatus to diffuse through the body the aliment taken up for the body is little more than a wrapper to the food it encloses but where the bulk is considerable or where the activity is such as to involve much waste and repair or where both these characteristics exist there is a necessity for a system of bloodvessels it is not enough that there be adequately extensive surfaces for absorption and aeration for in the absence of any means of conveyance the absorbed elements can be of little or no use to the organism at large evidently there must be channels of communication when as in the medusæ we find these channels of communication consisting simply of branched canals opening out of the stomach and spreading through the disk we may know a priori that such creatures are comparatively inactive seeing that the nutritive liquid thus partially distributed throughout their bodies is crude and dilute and that there is no efficient appliance for keeping it in motion conversely when we meet with a creature of considerable size which displays much vivacity we may know a priori that it must have an apparatus for the unceasing supply of concentrated nutriment and of oxygen to every organa pulsating vascular system  it is manifest then that setting out from certain known fundamental conditions to vital activity we may deduce from them sundry of the chief characteristics of organized bodies doubtless these known fundamental conditions have been inductively established but what we wish to show is that given these inductivelyestablished primary facts in physiology we may with safety draw certain general deductions from them and indeed the legitimacy of such deductions though not formally acknowledged is practically recognized in the convictions of every physiologist as may be readily proved thus were a physiologist to find a creature exhibiting complex and variously coordinated movements and yet having no nervous system he would be less astonished at the breach of his empirical generalization that all such creatures have nervous systems than at the disproof of his unconscious deduction that all creatures exhibiting complex and variously coordinated movements must have an internuncial apparatus by which the coordination may be effected or were he to find a creature having blood rapidly circulated and rapidly aerated but yet showing a low temperature the proof so afforded that active change of matter is not as he had inferred from chemical data the cause of animal heat would stagger him more than would the exception to a constantlyobserved relation clearly then the a priori method already plays a part in physiological reasoning if not ostensibly employed as a means of reaching new truths it is at least privately appealed to for confirmation of truths reached a posteriori  but the illustrations above given go far to show that it may to a considerable extent be safely used as an independent instrument of research the necessities for a nutritive system a respiratory system and a vascular system in all animals of size and vivacity seem to us legitimately inferable from the conditions to continued vital activity given the physical and chemical data and these structural peculiarities may be deduced with as much certainty as may the hollowness of an iron ball from its power of floating in water  it is not of course asserted that the more special physiological truths can be deductively reached the argument by no means implies this legitimate deduction presupposes adequate data and in respect to the special phenomena of organic growth structure and function adequate data are unattainable and will probably ever remain so it is only in the case of the more general physiological truths such as those above instanced where we have something like adequate data that deductive reasoning becomes possible  and here is reached the stage to which the foregoing considerations are introductory we propose now to show that there are certain still more general attributes of organized bodies which are deducible from certain still more general attributes of things                                       in an essay on progress its law and cause elsewhere published8 we have endeavoured to show that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous in which all progress organic or other essentially consists is consequent on the production of many effects by one causemany changes by one force having pointed out that this is a law of all things we proceeded to show deductively that the multiform evolutions of the homogeneous into the heterogeneousastronomic geologic ethnologic social cwere explicable as consequences and though in the case of organic evolution lack of data disabled us from specifically tracing out the progressive complication as due to the multiplication of effects yet we found sundry indirect evidences that it was so now in so far as this conclusion that organic evolution results from the decomposition of each expended force into several forces was inferred from the general law previously pointed out it was an example of deductive physiology the particular was concluded from the universal  we here propose in the first place to show that there is another general truth closely connected with the above and in common with it underlying explanations of all progress and therefore the progress of organismsa truth which may indeed be considered as taking precedence of it in respect of time if not in respect of generality this truth is that the condition of homogeneity is a condition of unstable equilibrium  the phrase unstable equilibrium is one used in mechanics to express a balance of forces of such kind that the interference of any further force however minute will destroy the arrangement previously existing and bring about a different arrangement thus a stick poised on its lower end is in unstable equilibrium however exactly it may be placed in a perpendicular position as soon as it is left to itself it begins at first imperceptibly and then visibly to lean on one side and with increasing rapidity falls into another position conversely a stick suspended from its upper end is in stable equilibrium however much disturbed it will return to the same position our meaning is then that the state of homogeneity like the state of the stick poised on its lower end is one that cannot be maintained and that hence results the first step in its gravitation towards the heterogeneous let us take a few illustrations  of mechanical ones the most familiar is that of the scales if accurately made and not clogged by dirt or rust a pair of scales cannot be perfectly balanced eventually one scale will descend and the other ascendthey will assume a heterogeneous relation again if we sprinkle over the surface of a liquid a number of equalsized particles having an attraction for one another they will no matter how uniformly distributed by and by concentrate irregularly into groups were it possible to bring a mass of water into a state of perfect homogeneitya state of complete quiescence and exactly equal density throughoutyet the radiation of heat from neighbouring bodies by affecting differently its different parts would soon produce inequalities of density and consequent currents and would so render it to that extent heterogeneous take a piece of redhot matter and however evenly heated it may at first be it will quickly cease to be so the exterior cooling faster than the interior will become different in temperature from it and the lapse into heterogeneity of temperature so obvious in this extreme case is ever taking place more or less in all cases the actions of chemical forces supply other illustrations expose a fragment of metal to air or water and in course of time it will be coated with a film of oxide carbonate or other compound its outer parts will become unlike its inner parts thus every homogeneous aggregate of matter tends to lose its balance in some way or othereither mechanically chemically thermally or electrically and the rapidity with which it lapses into a nonhomogeneous state is simply a question of time and circumstances social bodies illustrate the law with like constancy endow the members of a community with equal properties positions powers and they will forthwith begin to slide into inequalities be it in a representative assembly a railway board or a private partnership the homogeneity though it may continue in name inevitably disappears in reality  the instability thus variously illustrated becomes still more manifest if we consider its rationale it is consequent on the fact that the several parts of any homogeneous mass are necessarily exposed to different forcesforces which differ either in their kinds or amounts and being exposed to different forces they are of necessity differently modified the relations of outside and inside and of comparative nearness to neighbouring sources of influence imply the reception of influences which are unlike in quantity or quality or both and it follows that unlike changes will be wrought in the parts dissimilarly acted upon the unstable equilibrium of any homogeneous aggregate can thus be shown both inductively and deductively  and now let us consider the bearing of this general truth on the evolution of organisms the germ of a plant or animal is one of these homogeneous aggregatesrelatively homogeneous if not absolutely sowhose equilibrium is unstable but it has not simply the ordinary instability of homogeneous aggregates it has something more for it consists of units which are themselves specially characterized by instability the constituent molecules of organic matter are distinguished by the feebleness of the affinities which hold their component elements together they are extremely sensitive to heat light electricity and the chemical actions of foreign elements that is they are peculiarly liable to be modified by disturbing forces hence then it follows a priori that a homogeneous aggregate of these unstable molecules will have an excessive tendency to lose its equilibrium it will have a quite special liability to lapse into a nonhomogeneous state it will rapidly gravitate towards heretogeneity  moreover the process must repeat itself in each of the subordinate groups of organic units which are differentiated by the modifying forces each of these subordinate groups like the original group must gradually in obedience to the influences acting on it lose its balance of partsmust pass from a uniform into a multiform state and so on continuously  thus starting from the general laws of things and the known chemical attributes of organic matter we may conclude deductively that the homogeneous germs of organisms have a peculiar proclivity towards a nonhomogeneous state which may be either the state we call decomposition or the state we call organization                                       at present we have reached a conclusion only of the most general nature we merely learn that some kind of heterogeneity is inevitable but as yet there is nothing to tell us what kind besides that orderly heterogeneity which distinguishes organisms there is the disorderly or chaotic heterogeneity into which a loose mass of inorganic matter lapses and at present no reason has been given why the homogeneous germ of a plant or animal should not lapse into the disorderly instead of the orderly heterogeneity but by pursuing still further the line of argument hitherto followed we shall find a reason  we have seen that the instability of homogeneous aggregates in general and of organic ones in particular is consequent on the various ways and degrees in which their constituent parts are exposed to the disturbing forces brought to bear on them their parts are differently acted upon and therefore become different manifestly then a rationale of the special changes which a germ undergoes must be sought in the particular relations which its several parts bear to each other and to their environment however it may be masked we may suspect the fundamental principle of organization to be that the many like units forming a germ acquire those kinds and degrees of unlikeness which their respective positions entail  take a mass of unorganized but organizable mattereither the body of one of the lowest living forms or the germ of one of the higher consider its circumstances it is immersed in water or air or it is contained within a parent organism wherever placed however its outer and inner parts stand differently related to surrounding existencesnutriment oxygen and the various stimuli but this is not all whether it lies quiescent at the bottom of the water whether it moves through the water preserving some definite attitude or whether it is in the inside of an adult it equally results that certain parts of its surface are more directly exposed to surrounding agencies than other partsin some cases more exposed to light heat or oxygen and in others to the maternal tissues and their contents the destruction of its original equilibrium is therefore certain it may take place in one of two ways either the disturbing forces may be such as to overbalance the affinities of the organic elements in which case there results that chaotic heterogeneity known as decomposition or as is ordinarily the case such changes are induced as do not destroy the organic compounds but only modify them the parts most exposed to the modifying forces being most modified hence result those first differentiations which constitute incipient organization from the point of view thus reached suppose we look at a few cases neglecting for the present all consideration of the tendency to assume the inherited type  note first what appear to be exceptions as the amoeba in this creature and its allies the substance of the jellylike body remains throughout life unorganizedundergoes no permanent differentiations but this fact which seems directly opposed to our inference is really one of the most significant evidences of its truth for what is the peculiarity of the rhizopods exemplified by the amoeba they undergo perpetual and irregular changes of shapethey show no persistent relations of parts what lately formed a portion of the interior is now protruded and as a temporary limb is attached to some object it happens to touch what is now a part of the surface will presently be drawn along with the atom of nutriment sticking to it into the centre of the mass thus there is an unceasing interchange of places and the relations of inner and outer have no settled existence but by the hypothesis it is only in virtue of their unlike positions with respect to modifying forces that the originallylike units of a living mass become unlike we must not therefore expect any established differentiation of parts in creatures which exhibit no established differences of position in their parts  this negative evidence is borne out by abundant positive evidence when we turn from these everchanging specks of living jelly to organisms having unchanging distributions of substance we find differences of tissue corresponding to differences of relative position in all the higher protozoa as also in the protophyta we meet with a fundamental differentiation into cellmembrane and cellcontents answering to that fundamental contrast of conditions implied by the words outside and inside and on passing from what are roughly classed as unicellular organisms to the lowest of those which consist of aggregated cells we equally observe the connexion between structural differences and differences of circumstance in the sponge permeated throughout by currents of seawater the absence of definite organization corresponds with the absence of definite unlikeness of conditions in the thalassicolla of professor huxleya transparent colourless body found floating passively at the surface of the sea and consisting essentially of a mass of cells united by jellythere is displayed a rude structure obviously subordinated to the primary relations of centre and surface in all of its many and important varieties the parts exhibit a more or less concentric arrangement  after this primary modification by which the outer tissues are differentiated from the inner the next in order of constancy and importance is that by which some part of the outer tissues is differentiated from the rest and this corresponds with the almost universal fact that some part of the outer tissues is more directly exposed to certain environing influences than the rest here as before the apparent exceptions are extremely significant some of the lowest vegetable organisms as the hematococci and protococci evenly imbedded in a mass of mucus or dispersed through the arctic snow display no differentiations of surface the several parts of the surface being subjected to no definite contrasts of conditions the thalassicolla above mentioned unfixed and rolled about by the waves presents all its sides successively to the same agencies and all its sides are alike a ciliated sphere like the volvox has no parts of its periphery unlike other parts and it is not to be expected that it should have seeing that as it revolves in all directions it does not in traversing the water permanently expose any part to special conditions but when we come to creatures that are either fixed or while moving severally preserve a definite attitude we no longer find uniformity of surface the gemmule of a zoophyte which during its locomotive stage is distinguishable only into outer and inner tissues no sooner takes root than its upper end begins to assume a different structure from its lower the freeswimming embryo of an aquatic annelid being ovate and not ciliated all over moves with one end foremost and its differentiations proceed in conformity with this contrast of circumstances  the principle thus displayed in the humbler forms of life is traceable during the development of the higher though being here soon masked by the assumption of the hereditary type it cannot be traced far thus the mulberrymass into which a fertilized ovum of a vertebrate animal first resolves itself soon begins to exhibit a difference between the outer and inner parts answering to the difference of circumstances the peripheral cells after reaching a more complete development than the central ones coalesce into a membrane enclosing the rest and then the cells lying next to these outer ones become aggregated with them and increase the thickness of the germinal membrane while the central cells liquefy again one part of the germinal membrane presently becomes distinguishable as the germinal spot and without asserting that the cause of this is to be found in the unlike relations which the respective parts of the germinal membrane bear to environing influences it is clear that we have in these unlike relations an element of disturbance tending to destroy the original homogeneity of the germinal membrane further the germinal membrane by and by divides into two layers internal and external the one in contact with the liquefied interior part or yelk the other exposed to the surrounding fluids this contrast of circumstances being in obvious correspondence with the contrast of structures which follows it once more the subsequent appearance of the vascular layer between these mucous and serous layers as they have been named admits of a like interpretation and in this and the various complications which now begin to show themselves we may see coming into play that general law of the multiplication of effects flowing from one cause to which the increase of heterogeneity was elsewhere ascribed9  confining our remarks as we do to the most general facts of development we think that some light is thus thrown on them that the unstable equilibrium of a homogeneous germ must be destroyed by the unlike exposure of its several units to surrounding influences is an a priori conclusion and it seems also to be an a priori conclusion that the several units thus differently acted upon must either be decomposed or must undergo such modifications of nature as may enable them to live in the respective circumstances they are thrown into in other wordsthey must either die or become adapted to their conditions indeed we might infer as much without going through the foregoing train of reasoning the superficial organic units be they the outer cells of a mulberrymass or be they the outer molecules of an individual cell must assume the function which their position necessitates and assuming this function must acquire such character as performance of it involves the layer of organic units lying in contact with the yelk must be those through which the yelk is absorbed and so must be adapted to the absorbent office on this condition only does the process of organization appear possible we might almost say that just as some race of animals which multiplies and spreads into divers regions of the earth becomes differentiated into several races through the adaptation of each to its conditions of life so the originally homogeneous population of cells arising in a fertilized germcell becomes divided into several populations of cells that grow unlike in virtue of the unlikeness of their circumstances  moreover it is to be remarked in further proof of our position that it finds its clearest and most abundant illustrations where the conditions of the case are the simplest and most generalwhere the phenomena are the least involved we mean in the production of individual cells the structures which presently arise round nuclei in a blastema and which have in some way been determined by those nuclei as centres of influence evidently conform to the law for the parts of the blastema in contact with the nuclei are differently conditioned from the parts not in contact with them again the formation of a membrane round each of the masses of granules into which the endochrome of an algacell breaks up is an instance of analogous kind and should the recentlyasserted fact that cells may arise round vacuoles in a mass of organizable substance be confirmed another good example will be furnished for such portions of substance as bound these vacant spaces are subject to influences unlike those to which other portions of the substance are subject if then we can most clearly trace this law of modification in these primordial processes as well as in those more complex but analogous ones exhibited in the early changes of an ovum we have strong reason for thinking that the law is fundamental  but as already more than once hinted this principle understood in the simple form here presented supplies no key to the detailed phenomena of organic development it fails entirely to explain generic and specific peculiarities and leaves us equally in the dark respecting those more important distinctions by which families and orders are marked out why two ova similarly exposed in the same pool should become the one a fish and the other a reptile it cannot tell us that from two different eggs placed under the same hen should respectively come forth a duckling and a chicken is a fact not to be accounted for on the hypothesis above developed here we are obliged to fall back upon the unexplained principle of hereditary transmission the capacity possessed by an unorganized germ of unfolding into a complex adult which repeats ancestral traits in minute details and that even when it has been placed in conditions unlike those of its ancestors is a capacity impossible for us to understand that a microscopic portion of seemingly structureless matter should embody an influence of such kind that the resulting man will in fifty years after become gouty or insane is a truth which would be incredible were it not daily illustrated but though the manner in which hereditary likeness in all its complications is conveyed is a mystery passing comprehension it is quite conceivable that it is conveyed in subordination to the law of adaptation above explained and we are not without reasons for thinking that it is so various facts show that acquired peculiarities resulting from the adaptation of constitution to conditions are transmissible to offspring such acquired peculiarities consist of differences of structure or composition in one or more of the tissues that is to say of the aggregate of similar organic units composing a germ the group going to the formation of a particular tissue will take on the special character which the adaptation of that tissue to new circumstances had produced in the parents we know this to be a general law of organic modifications further it is the only law of organic modifications of which we have any evidence10 it is not impossible then that it is the universal law comprehending not simply those minor modifications which offspring inherit from recent ancestry but comprehending also those larger modifications distinctive of species genus order class which they inherit from antecedent races of organisms and thus it may be that the law of adaptation is the sole law presiding not only over the differentiation of any race of organisms into several races but also over the differentiation of the race of organic units composing a germ into the many races of organic units composing an adult so understood the process gone through by every unfolding organism will consist partly in the direct adaptation of its elements to their several circumstances and partly in the assumption of characters resulting from analogous adaptations of the elements of all ancestral organisms  but our argument does not commit us to any such farreaching speculation as this which we introduce simply as suggested by it not involved all we are here concerned to show is that the deductive method aids us in interpreting some of the more general phenomena of development that all homogeneous aggregates are in unstable equilibrium is a universal truth from which is deducible the instability of every organic germ from the known sensitiveness of organic compounds to chemical thermal and other disturbing forces we further infer the unusual instability of every organic germa proneness far beyond that of other homogeneous aggregates to lapse into a heterogeneous state by the same line of reasoning we are led to the additional inference that the first divisions into which a germ resolves itself being severally in a state of unstable equilibrium are similarly prone to undergo further changes and so on continuously moreover we have found it to be equally an a priori conclusion that as in all other cases the loss of homogeneity is due to the different degrees and kinds of force brought to bear on the different parts so in this case too difference of circumstances is the primary cause of differentiation add to which that as the several changes undergone by the respective parts thus diversely acted upon are changes which do not destroy their vital activity they must be changes which bring that vital activity into subordination to the incident forcesthey must be adaptations and the like must be in some sense true of all the subsequent changes thus by deductive reasoning we get some insight into the method of organization however unable we are and probably ever shall be to comprehend the way in which a germ is made to take on the special form of its race we may yet comprehend the general principles which regulate its first modifications and remembering the unity of plan so conspicuous throughout nature we may suspect that these principles are in some way concerned in succeeding modifications                                       a controversy now going on among zoologists opens yet another field for the application of the deductive method we believe that the question whether there does or does not exist a necessary correlation among the several parts of an organism is determinable a priori  cuvier who first asserted this necessary correlation professed to base his restorations of extinct animals upon it geoffroy st hilaire and de blainville from different points of view contested cuviers hypothesis and the discussion which has much interest as bearing on paleontology has been recently revived under a somewhat modified form professors huxley and owen being respectively the assailant and defender of the hypothesis  cuvier sayscomparative anatomy possesses a principle whose just development is sufficient to dissipate all difficulties it is that of the correlation of forms in organized beings by means of which every kind of organized being might strictly speaking be recognized by a fragment of any of its parts every organized being constitutes a whole a single and complete system whose parts mutually correspond and concur by their reciprocal reaction to the same definite end none of these parts can be changed without affecting the others and consequently each taken separately indicates and gives all the rest he then gives illustrations arguing that the carnivorous form of tooth necessitating a certain action of the jaw implies a particular form in its condyles implies also limbs fit for seizing and holding prey therefore implies claws a certain structure of the legbones a certain form of shoulderblade summing up he says that the claw the scapula the condyle the femur and all the other bones taken separately will give the tooth or one another and by commencing with any one he who had a rational conception of the laws of the organic economy could reconstruct the whole animal  it will be seen that the method of restoration here contended for is based on the alleged physiological necessity of the connexion between these several peculiarities the argument used is not that a scapula of a certain shape may be recognized as having belonged to a carnivorous mammal because we always find that carnivorous mammals do possess such scapulas but the argument is that they must possess them because carnivorous habits would be impossible without them and in the above quotation cuvier asserts that the necessary correlation which he considers so obvious in these cases exists throughout the system admitting however that in consequence of our limited knowledge of physiology we are unable in many cases to trace this necessary correlation and are obliged to base our conclusions upon observed coexistences of which we do not understand the reason but which we find invariable  now professor huxley has recently shown that in the first place this empirical method which cuvier introduces as quite subordinate and to be used only in aid of the rational method is really the method which cuvier habitually employedthe socalled rational method remaining practically a dead letter and in the second place he has shown that cuvier himself has in several places so far admitted the inapplicability of the rational method as virtually to surrender it as a method but more than this professor huxley contends that the alleged necessary correlation is not true quite admitting the physiological dependence of parts on each other he denies that it is a dependence of a kind which could not be otherwise thus the teeth of a lion and the stomach of the animal are in such relation that the one is fitted to digest the food which the other can tear they are physiologically correlated but we have no reason for affirming this to be a necessary physiological correlation in the sense that no other could equally fit its possessor for living on recent flesh the number and form of the teeth might have been quite different from that which we know them to be and the construction of the stomach might have been greatly altered and yet the functions of these organs might have been equally well performed  thus much is needful to give an idea of the controversy it is not here our purpose to go more at length into the evidence cited on either side we simply wish to show that the question may be settled deductively before going on to do this however let us briefly notice two collateral points  in his defence of the cuvierian doctrine professor owen avails himself of the odium theologicum he attributes to his opponents the insinuation and masked advocacy of the doctrine subversive of a recognition of the higher mind now saying nothing about the questionable propriety of thus prejudging an issue in science we think this is an unfortunate accusation what is there in the hypothesis of necessary as distinguished from actual correlation of parts which is particularly in harmony with theism maintenance of the necessity whether of sequences or of coexistences is commonly thought rather a derogation from divine power than otherwise cuvier saysnone of these parts can be changed without affecting the others and consequently each taken separately indicates and gives all the rest that is to say in the nature of things the correlation could not have been otherwise on the other hand professor huxley says we have no warrant for asserting that the correlation could not have been otherwise but have not a little reason for thinking that the same physiological ends might have been differently achieved the one doctrine limits the possibilities of creation the other denies the implied limit which then is most open to the charge of covert atheism  on the other point we lean to the opinion of professor owen we agree with him in thinking that where a rational correlation in the highest sense of the term can be made out it affords a better basis for deduction than an empirical correlation ascertained only by accumulated observations premising that by rational correlation is not meant one in which we can trace or think we can trace a design but one of which the negation is inconceivable and this is the species of correlation which cuviers principle implies then we hold that our knowledge of the correlation is of a more certain kind than where it is simply inductive we think that professor huxley in his anxiety to avoid the error of making thought the measure of things does not sufficiently bear in mind the fact that as our notion of necessity is determined by some absolute uniformity pervading all orders of our experiences it follows that an organic correlation which cannot be conceived otherwise is guaranteed by a much wider induction than one ascertained only by the observation of organisms but the truth is that there are relatively few organic correlations of which the negation is inconceivable if we find the skull vertebræ ribs and phalanges of some quadruped as large as an elephant we may indeed be certain that the legs of this quadruped were of considerable sizemuch larger than those of a rat and our reason for conceiving this correlation as necessary is that it is based not only upon our experiences of moving organisms but upon all our mechanical experiences relative to masses and their supports but even were there many physiological correlations really of this order which there are not there would be danger in pursuing this line of reasoning in consequence of the liability to include within the class of truly necessary correlations those which are not such for instance there would seem to be a necessary correlation between the eye and the surface of the body light being needful for vision it might be supposed that every eye must be external nevertheless it is a fact that there are creatures as the cirrhipedia having eyes not very efficient ones it may be deeply imbedded within the body again a necessary correlation might be assumed between the dimensions of the mammalian uterus and those of the pelvis it would appear impossible that in any species there should exist a welldeveloped uterus containing a fullsized foetus and yet that the arch of the pelvis should be too small to allow the foetus to pass and were the only mammal having a very small pelvic arch a fossil one it would have been inferred on the cuvierian method that the foetus must have been born in a rudimentary state and that the uterus must have been proportionally small but there happens to be an extant mammal having an undeveloped pelvisthe molewhich presents us with a fact that saves us from this erroneous inference the young of the mole are not born through the pelvic arch at all but in front of it thus granting that some quite direct physiological correlations may be necessary we see that there is great risk of including among them some which are not  with regard to the great mass of the correlations however including all the indirect ones professor huxley seems to us warranted in denying that they are necessary and we now propose to show deductively the truth of his thesis let us begin with an analogy  whoever has been through an extensive ironworks has seen a gigantic pair of shears worked by machinery and used for cutting in two bars of iron that are from time to time thrust between its blades supposing these blades to be the only visible parts of the apparatus anyone observing their movements or rather the movement of one for the other is commonly fixed will see from the manner in which the angle increases and decreases and from the curve described by the moving extremity that there must be some centre of motioneither a pivot or an external box equivalent to it this may be regarded as a necessary correlation moreover he might infer that beyond the centre of motion the moving blade was produced into a lever to which the power was applied but as another arrangement is just possible this could not be called anything more than a highly probable correlation if now he went a step further and asked how the reciprocal movement was given to the lever he would perhaps conclude that it was given by a crank but if he knew anything of mechanics he would know that it might possibly be given by an eccentric or again he would know that the effect could be achieved by a cam that is to say he would see that there was no necessary correlation between the shears and the remoter parts of the apparatus take another case the plate of a printingpress is required to move up and down to the extent of an inch or so and it must exert its greatest pressure when it reaches the extreme of its downward movement if now anyone will look over the stock of a printingpress maker he will see half a dozen different mechanical arrangements by which these ends are achieved and a machinist would tell him that as many more might readily be invented if then there is no necessary correlation between the special parts of a machine still less is there between those of an organism  from a converse point of view the same truth is manifest bearing in mind the above analogy it will be foreseen that an alteration in one part of an organism will not necessarily entail some one specific set of alterations in the other parts cuvier says none of these parts can be changed without affecting the others and consequently each taken separately indicates and gives all the rest the first of these propositions may pass but the second which it is alleged follows from it is not true for it implies that all the rest can be severally affected in only one way and degree whereas they can be affected in many ways and degrees to show this we must again have recourse to a mechanical analogy  if you set a brick on end and thrust it over you can predict with certainty in what direction it will fall and what attitude it will assume if again setting it up you put another on the top of it you can no longer foresee with accuracy the results of an overthrow and on repeating the experiment no matter how much care is taken to place the bricks in the same positions and to apply the same degree of force in the same direction the effects will on no two occasions be exactly alike and in proportion as the aggregation is complicated by the addition of new and unlike parts will the results of any disturbance become more varied and incalculable the like truth is curiously illustrated by locomotive engines it is a fact familiar to mechanical engineers and enginedrivers that out of a number of engines built as accurately as possible to the same pattern no two will act in just the same manner each will have its peculiarities the play of actions and reactions will so far differ that under like conditions each will behave in a somewhat different way and every driver has to learn the idiosyncrasies of his own engine before he can work it to the greatest advantage in organisms themselves this indefiniteness of mechanical reaction is clearly traceable two boys throwing stones will always differ more or less in their attitudes as will two billiardplayers the familiar fact that each individual has a characteristic gait illustrates the point still better the rhythmical motion of the leg is simple and on the cuvierian hypothesis should react on the body in some uniform way but in consequence of those slight differences of structure which consist with identity of species no two individuals make exactly similar movements either of the trunk or the arms there is always a peculiarity recognizable by their friends  when we pass to disturbing forces of a nonmechanical kind the same truth becomes still more conspicuous expose several persons to a drenching storm and while one will subsequently feel no appreciable inconvenience another will have a cough another a catarrh another an attack of diarrhoea another a fit of rheumatism vaccinate several children of the same age with the same quantity of virus applied to the same part and the symptoms will not be quite alike in any of them either in kind or intensity and in some cases the differences will be extreme the quantity of alcohol which will send one man to sleep will render another unusually brilliantwill make this maudlin and that irritable opium will produce either drowsiness or wakefulness so will tobacco  now in all these casesmechanical and othersome force is brought to bear primarily on one part of an organism and secondarily on the rest and according to the doctrine of cuvier the rest ought to be affected in a specific way we find this to be by no means the case the original change produced in one part does not stand in any necessary correlation with every one of the changes produced in the other parts nor do these stand in any necessary correlation with one another the functional alteration which the disturbing force causes in the organ directly acted upon does not involve some particular set of functional alterations in the other organs but will be followed by some one out of various sets and it is a manifest corollary that any structural alteration which may eventually be produced in the one organ will not be accompanied by some particular set of structural alterations in the other organs there will be no necessary correlation of forms  thus paleontology must depend upon the empirical method a fossil species that was obliged to change its food or habits of life did not of necessity undergo the particular set of modifications exhibited but under some slight change of predisposing causesas of season or latitudemight have undergone some other set of modifications the determining circumstance being one which in the human sense we call fortuitous  may we not say then that the deductive method elucidates this vexed question in physiology while at the same time our argument collaterally exhibits the limits within which the deductive method is applicable for while we see that this extremely general question may be satisfactorily dealt with deductively the conclusion arrived at itself implies that the more special phenomena of organization cannot be so dealt with                                       there is yet another method of investigating the general truths of physiologya method to which physiology already owes one luminous idea but which is not at present formally recognized as a method we refer to the comparison of physiological phenomena with social phenomena  the analogy between individual organisms and the social organism is one that has from early days occasionally forced itself on the attention of the observant and though modern science does not countenance those crude ideas of this analogy which have been from time to time expressed since the greeks flourished yet it tends to show that there is an analogy and a remarkable one while it is becoming clear that there are not those special parallelisms between the constituent parts of a man and those of a nation which have been thought to exist it is also becoming clear that the general principles of development and structure displayed in organized bodies are displayed in societies also the fundamental characteristic both of societies and of living creatures is that they consist of mutuallydependent parts and it would seem that this involves a community of various other characteristics those who are acquainted with the broad facts of both physiology and sociology are beginning to recognize this correspondence not as a plausible fancy but as a scientific truth and we are strongly of opinion that it will by and by be seen to hold to an extent which few at present suspect  meanwhile if any such correspondence exists it is clear that physiology and sociology will more or less interpret each other each affords its special facilities for inquiry relations of cause and effect clearly traceable in the social organism may lead to the search for analogous ones in the individual organism and may so elucidate what might else be inexplicable laws of growth and function disclosed by the pure physiologist may occasionally give us the clue to certain social modifications otherwise difficult to understand if they can do no more the two sciences can at least exchange suggestions and confirmations and this will be no small aid the conception of the physiological division of labour which political economy has already supplied to physiology is one of no small value and probably it has others to give  in support of this opinion we will now cite cases in which such aid is furnished and in the first place let us see whether the facts of social organization do not afford additional support to some of the doctrines set forth in the foregoing parts of this article  one of the propositions supported by evidence was that in animals the process of development is carried on not by differentiations only but by subordinate integrations now in the social organism we may see the same duality of process and further it is to be observed that the integrations are of the same three kinds thus we have integrations which arise from the simple growth of adjacent parts that perform like functions as for instance the coalescence of manchester with its calicoweaving suburbs we have other integrations which arise when out of several places producing a particular commodity one monopolizes more and more of the business and leaves the rest to dwindle witness the growth of the yorkshire clothdistricts at the expense of those in the west of england or the absorption by staffordshire of the potterymanufacture and the consequent decay of the establishments that once flourished at worcester derby and elsewhere and we have those yet other integrations which result from the actual approximation of the similarlyoccupied parts whence result such facts as the concentration of publishers in paternoster row of lawyers in the temple and neighbourhood of cornmerchants about mark lane of civil engineers in great george street of bankers in the centre of the city finding thus that in the evolution of the social organism as in the evolution of individual organisms there are integrations as well as differentiations and moreover that these integrations are of the same three orders we have additional reason for considering these integrations as essential parts of the developmental process needed to be included in its formula and further the circumstance that in the social organism these integrations are determined by community of function confirms the hypothesis that they are thus determined in the individual organism  again we endeavoured to show deductively that the contrasts of parts first seen in all unfolding embryos are consequent upon the contrasted circumstances to which such parts are exposed that thus adaptation of constitution to conditions is the principle which determines their primary changes and that possibly if we include under the formula hereditarilytransmitted adaptations all subsequent differentiations may be similarly determined well we need not long contemplate the facts to see that some of the predominant social differentiations are brought about in an analogous way as the members of an originallyhomogeneous community multiply and spread the gradual separation into sections which simultaneously takes place manifestly depends on differences of local circumstances those who happen to live near some place chosen perhaps for its centrality as one of periodical assemblage become traders and a town springs up those who live dispersed continue to hunt or cultivate the earth those who spread to the seashore fall into maritime occupations and each of these classes undergoes modifications of character fitting to its function later in the process of social evolution these local adaptations are greatly multiplied in virtue of differences of soil and climate the rural inhabitants in different parts of the kingdom have their occupations partially specialized and are respectively distinguished as chiefly producing cattle or sheep or wheat or oats or hops or cider people living where coalfields are discovered become colliers cornishmen take to mining because cornwall is metalliferous and the ironmanufacture is the dominant industry where ironstone is plentiful liverpool has assumed the office of importing cotton in consequence of its proximity to the district where cotton goods are made and for analogous reasons hull has become the chief port at which foreign wools are brought in even in the establishment of breweries of dyeworks of slatequarries of brickyards we may see the same truth so that both in general and in detail these industrial specializations of the social organism which characterize separate districts primarily depend on local circumstances of the originallysimilar units making up the social mass different groups assume the different functions which their respective positions entail and become adapted to their conditions thus that which we concluded a priori to be the leading cause of organic differentiations we find a posteriori to be the leading cause of social differentiations nay further as we inferred that possibly the embryonic changes which are not thus directly caused are caused by hereditarilytransmitted adaptations so we may actually see that in embryonic societies such changes as are not due to direct adaptations are in the main traceable to adaptations originally undergone by the parent society the colonies founded by distinct nations while they are alike in exhibiting specializations caused in the way above described grow unlike in so far as they take on more or less the organizations of the nations they sprung from a french settlement does not develop exactly after the same manner as an english one and both assume forms different from those which roman settlements assumed now the fact that the differentiation of societies is determined partly by the direct adaptation of their units to local conditions and partly by the transmitted influence of like adaptations undergone by ancestral societies tends strongly to enforce the conclusion otherwise reached that the differentiation of individual organisms similarly results from immediate adaptations compounded with ancestral adaptations  from confirmations thus furnished by sociology to physiology let us now pass to a suggestion similarly furnished a factory or other producing establishment or a town made up of such establishments is an agency for elaborating some commodity consumed by society at large and may be regarded as analogous to a gland or viscus in an individual organism if we inquire what is the primitive mode in which one of these producing establishments grows up we find it to be this a single worker who himself sells the produce of his labour is the germ his business increasing he employs helpershis sons or others and having done this he becomes a vendor not only of his own handiwork but of that of others a further increase of his business compels him to multiply his assistants and his sale grows so rapid that he is obliged to confine himself to the process of selling he ceases to be a producer and becomes simply a channel through which the produce of others is conveyed to the public should his prosperity rise yet higher he finds that he is unable to manage even the sale of his commodities and has to employ others probably of his own family to aid him in selling so that to him as a main channel are now added subordinate channels moreover when there grow up in one place as a manchester or a birmingham many establishments of like kind this process is carried still further there arise factors and buyers who are the channels through which is transmitted the produce of many factories and we believe that primarily these factors were manufacturers who undertook to dispose of the produce of smaller houses as well as their own and ultimately became salesmen only under a converse aspect all the stages of this development have been within these few years exemplified in our railway contractors there are sundry men now living who illustrate the whole process in their own personsmen who were originally navvies digging and wheeling who then undertook some small subcontract and worked along with those they paid who presently took larger contracts and employed foremen and who now contract for whole railways and let portions to subcontractors that is to say we have men who were originally workers but have finally become the main channels out of which diverge secondary channels which again bifurcate into the subordinate channels through which flows the money representing the nutriment supplied by society to the actual makers of the railway now it seems worth inquiring whether this is not the original course followed in the evolution of secreting and excreting organs in an animal we know that such is the process by which the liver is developed out of the group of bilecells forming the germ of it some centrallyplaced ones lying next to the intestine are transformed into ducts through which the secretion of the peripheral bilecells is poured into the intestine and as the peripheral bilecells multiply there similarly arise secondary ducts emptying themselves into the main ones tertiary ones into these and so on recent inquiries show that the like is the case with the lungsthat the bronchial tubes are thus formed but while analogy suggests that this is the original mode in which such organs are developed it at the same time suggests that this does not necessarily continue to be the mode for as we find that in the social organism manufacturing establishments are no longer commonly developed through the series of modifications above described but now mostly arise by the direct transformation of a number of persons into master clerks foremen workers c so the approximate method of forming organs may in some cases be replaced by a direct metamorphosis of the organic units into the destined structure without any transitional structures being passed through that there are organs thus formed is an ascertained fact and the additional question which analogy suggests is whether the direct method is substituted for the indirect method  such parallelisms might be multiplied and were it possible here to show in detail the close correspondence between the two kinds of organization our case would be seen to have abundant support but as it is these few illustrations will sufficiently justify the opinion that study of organized bodies may be indirectly furthered by study of the body politic hints may be expected if nothing more and thus we venture to think that the inductive method usually alone employed by most physiologists may not only derive important assistance from the deductive method but may further be supplemented by the sociological method  footnotes  footnote 6 carpenters principles of comparative physiology pp 61617  footnote 7 with the exception perhaps of the myxinoid fishes in which what is considered as the

doctrine still held by some of the negroes livingstone visited science having divested the sun and planets of their divine personalities this old idea was succeeded by the idea which even kepler entertained that the planets are guided in their courses by presiding spirits no longer themselves gods they are still severally kept in their orbits by gods and when gravitation came to dispense with these celestial steersmen there was begotten a belief less gross than its parent but partaking of the same essential nature that the planets were originally launched into their orbits by the creators hand evidently though much refined the anthropomorphism of the current hypothesis is inherited from the aboriginal anthropomorphism which described gods as a stronger order of men  there is an antagonist hypothesis which does not propose to honour the unknown power manifested in the universe by such titles as the masterbuilder or the great artificer but which regards this unknown power as probably working after a method quite different from that of human mechanics and the genealogy of this hypothesis is as high as that of the other is low it is begotten by that everenlarging and everstrengthening belief in the presence of law which accumulated experiences have gradually produced in the human mind from generation to generation science has been proving uniformities of relation among phenomena which were before thought either fortuitous or supernatural in their originhas been showing an established order and a constant causation where ignorance had assumed irregularity and arbitrariness each further discovery of law has increased the presumption that law is everywhere conformed to and hence among other beliefs has arisen the belief that the solar system originated not by manufacture but by evolution besides its abstract parentage in those grand general conceptions which science has generated this hypothesis has a concrete parentage of the highest character based as it is on the law of universal gravitation it may claim for its remote progenitor the great thinker who established that law it was first suggested by one who ranks high among philosophers the man who collected evidence indicating that stars result from the aggregation of diffused matter was the most diligent careful and original astronomical observer of modern times and the world has not seen a more learned mathematician than the man who setting out with this conception of diffused matter concentrating towards its centre of gravity pointed out the way in which there would arise in the course of its concentration a balanced group of sun planets and satellites like that of which the earth is a member  thus even were there but little direct evidence assignable for the nebular hypothesis the probability of its truth would be strong its own high derivation and the low derivation of the antagonist hypothesis would together form a weighty reason for accepting itat any rate provisionally but the direct evidence assignable for the nebular hypothesis is by no means little it is far greater in quantity and more varied in kind than is commonly supposed much has been said here and there on this or that class of evidences but nowhere so far as we know have all the evidences been fully stated we propose here to do something towards supplying the deficiency believing that joined with the a priori reasons given above the array of a posteriori reasons will leave little doubt in the mind of any candid inquirer  and first let us address ourselves to those recent discoveries in stellar astronomy which have been supposed to conflict with this celebrated speculation                                       when sir william herschel directing his great reflector to various nebulous spots found them resolvable into clusters of stars he inferred and for a time maintained that all nebulous spots are clusters of stars exceedingly remote from us but after years of conscientious investigation he concluded that there were nebulosities which are not of a starry nature and on this conclusion was based his hypothesis of a diffused luminous fluid which by its eventual aggregation produced stars a telescopic power much exceeding that used by herschel has enabled lord rosse to resolve some of the nebulæ previously unresolved and returning to the conclusion which herschel first formed on similar grounds but afterwards rejected many astronomers have assumed that under sufficiently high powers every nebula would be decomposed into starsthat the irresolvability is due solely to distance the hypothesis now commonly entertained is that all nebulæ are galaxies more or less like in nature to that immediately surrounding us but that they are so inconceivably remote as to look through ordinary telescopes like small faint spots and not a few have drawn the corollary that by the discoveries of lord rosse the nebular hypothesis has been disproved  now even supposing that these inferences respecting the distances and natures of the nebulæ are valid they leave the nebular hypothesis substantially as it was admitting that each of these faint spots is a sidereal system so far removed that its countless stars give less light than one small star of our own sidereal system the admission is in no way inconsistent with the belief that stars and their attendant planets have been formed by the aggregation of nebulous matter though doubtless if the existence of nebulous matter now in course of concentration be disproved one of the evidences of the nebular hypothesis is destroyed yet the remaining evidences remain it is a tenable position that though nebular condensation is now nowhere to be seen in progress yet it was once going on universally and indeed it might be argued that the stillcontinued existence of diffused nebulous matter is scarcely to be expected seeing that the causes which have resulted in the aggregation of one mass must have been acting on all masses and that hence the existence of masses not aggregated would be a fact calling for explanation thus granting the immediate conclusions suggested by these recent disclosures of the sixfeet reflector the corollary which many have drawn is inadmissible  but these conclusions may be successfully contested receiving them though we have been for years past as established truths a critical examination of the facts has convinced us that they are quite unwarrantable they involve so many manifest incongruities that we have been astonished to find men of science entertaining them even as probable let us consider these incongruities                                       in the first place mark what is inferable from the distribution of nebulæ       the spaces which precede or which follow simple nebulæ says      arago and a fortiori groups of nebulæ contain generally few      stars herschel found this rule to be invariable thus every time      that during a short interval no star approached in virtue of the      diurnal motion to place itself in the field of his motionless      telescope he was accustomed to say to the secretary who assisted      himprepare to write nebulæ are about to arrive  how does this fact consist with the hypothesis that nebulæ are remote galaxies if there were but one nebula it would be a curious coincidence were this one nebula so placed in the distant regions of space as to agree in direction with a starless spot in our own sidereal system if there were but two nebulæ and both were so placed the coincidence would be excessively strange what then shall we say on finding that there are thousands of nebulæ so placed shall we believe that in thousands of cases these farremoved galaxies happen to agree in their visible positions with the thin places in our own galaxy such a belief is impossible  still more manifest does the impossibility of it become when we consider the general distribution of nebulæ besides again showing itself in the fact that the poorest regions in stars are near the richest in nebulæ the law above specified applies to the heavens as a whole in that zone of celestial space where stars are excessively abundant nebulæ are rare while in the two opposite celestial spaces that are furthest removed from this zone nebulæ are abundant scarcely any nebulæ lie near the galactic circle or plane of the milky way and the great mass of them lie round the galactic poles can this also be mere coincidence when to the fact that the general mass of nebulæ are antithetical in position to the general mass of stars we add the fact that local regions of nebulæ are regions where stars are scarce and the further fact that single nebulæ are habitually found in comparatively starless spots does not the proof of a physical connexion become overwhelming should it not require an infinity of evidence to show that nebulæ are not parts of our sidereal system let us see whether any such infinity of evidence is assignable let us see whether there is even a single alleged proof which will bear examination       as seen through colossal telescopes says humboldt the      contemplation of these nebulous masses leads us into regions from      whence a ray of light according to an assumption not wholly      improbable requires millions of years to reach our earthto      distances for whose measurement the dimensions the distance of      sirius or the calculated distances of the binary stars in cygnus      and the centaur of our nearest stratum of fixed stars scarcely      suffice  in this confused sentence there is implied a belief that the distances of the nebulæ from our galaxy of stars as much transcend the distances of our stars from one another as these interstellar distances transcend the dimensions of our planetary system just as the diameter of the earths orbit is a mere point when compared with the distance of our sun from sirius so is the distance of our sun from sirius a mere point when compared with the distance of our galaxy from those farremoved galaxies constituting nebulæ observe the consequences of this assumption  if one of these supposed galaxies is so remote that its distance dwarfs our interstellar spaces into points and therefore makes the dimensions of our whole sidereal system relatively insignificant does it not inevitably follow that the telescopic power required to resolve this remote galaxy into stars must be incomparably greater than the telescopic power required to resolve the whole of our own galaxy into stars is it not certain that an instrument which can just exhibit with clearness the most distant stars of our own cluster must be utterly unable to separate one of these remote clusters into stars what then are we to think when we find that the same instrument which decomposes hosts of nebulæ into stars fails to resolve completely our own milky way take a homely comparison suppose a man who was surrounded by a swarm of bees extending as they sometimes do so high in the air as to render some of the individual bees almost invisible were to declare that a certain spot on the horizon was a swarm of bees and that he knew it because he could see the bees as separate specks incredible as the assertion would be it would not exceed in incredibility this which we are criticising reduce the dimensions to figures and the absurdity becomes still more palpable in round numbers the distance of sirius from the earth is half a million times the distance of the earth from the sun and according to the hypothesis the distance of a nebula is something like half a million times the distance of sirius now our own starry island or nebula as humboldt calls it forms a lensshaped flattened and everywhere detached stratum whose major axis is estimated at seven or eight hundred and its minor axis at a hundred and fifty times the distance of sirius from the earth11 and since it is concluded that the solar system is near the centre of this aggregation it follows that our distance from the remotest parts of it is some four hundred distances of sirius but the stars forming these remotest parts are not individually visible even through telescopes of the highest power how then can such telescopes make individually visible the stars of a nebula which is half a million times the distance of sirius the implication is that a star rendered invisible by distance becomes visible if taken twelve hundred times further off shall we accept this implication or shall we not rather conclude that the nebulæ are not remote galaxies shall we not infer that be their nature what it may they must be at least as near to us as the extremities of our own sidereal system  throughout the above argument it is tacitly assumed that differences of apparent magnitude among the stars result mainly from differences of distance on this assumption the current doctrines respecting the nebulæ are founded and this assumption is for the nonce admitted in each of the foregoing criticisms from the time however when it was first made by sir w herschel this assumption has been purely gratuitous and it now proves to be inadmissible but awkwardly enough its truth and its untruth are alike fatal to the conclusions of those who argue after the manner of humboldt note the alternatives  on the one hand what follows from the untruth of the assumption if apparent largeness of stars is not due to comparative nearness and their successively smaller sizes to their greater and greater degrees of remoteness what becomes of the inferences respecting the dimensions of our sidereal system and the distances of nebulæ if as has lately been shown the almost invisible star 61 cygni has a greater parallax than greek a cygni though according to an estimate based on sir w herschels assumption it should be about twelve times more distantif as it turns out there exist telescopic stars which are nearer to us than sirius of what worth is the conclusion that the nebulæ are very remote because their component luminous masses are made visible only by high telescopic powers clearly if the most brilliant star in the heavens and a star that cannot be seen by the naked eye prove to be equidistant relative distances cannot be in the least inferred from relative visibilities and if so nebulæ may be comparatively near though the starlets of which they are made up appear extremely minute  on the other hand what follows if the truth of the assumption be granted the arguments used to justify this assumption in the case of the stars equally justify it in the case of the nebulæ it cannot be contended that on the average the apparent sizes of the stars indicate their distances without its being admitted that on the average the apparent sizes of the nebulæ indicate their distancesthat generally speaking the larger are the nearer and the smaller are the more distant mark now the necessary inference respecting their resolvability the largest or nearest nebulæ will be most easily resolved into stars the successively smaller will be successively more difficult of resolution and the irresolvable ones will be the smallest ones this however is exactly the reverse of the fact the largest nebulæ are either wholly irresolvable or but partially resolvable under the highest telescopic powers while large numbers of quite small nebulæ are easily resolved by far less powerful telescopes an instrument through which the great nebula in andromeda two and a half degrees long and one degree broad appears merely as a diffused light decomposes a nebula of fifteen minutes diameter into twenty thousand starry points at the same time that the individual stars of a nebula eight minutes in diameter are so clearly seen as to allow of their number being estimated a nebula covering an area five hundred times as great shows no stars at all what possible explanation of this can be given on the current hypothesis  yet a further difficulty remainsone which is perhaps still more obviously fatal than the foregoing this difficulty is presented by the phenomena of the magellanic clouds describing the larger of these sir john herschel says       the nubecula major like the minor consists partly of large      tracts and illdefined patches of irresolvable nebula and of      nebulosity in every stage of resolution up to perfectly resolved      stars like the milky way as also of regular and irregular nebulæ      properly so called of globular clusters in every stage of      resolvability and of clustering groups sufficiently insulated and      condensed to come under the designation of clusters of      starscape observations p 146  in his outlines of astronomy sir john herschel after repeating this description in other words goes on to remark that       this combination of characters rightly considered is in a high      degree instructive affording an insight into the probable      comparative distance of stars and nebulæ and the real      brightness of individual stars as compared with one another taking      the apparent semidiameter of the nubecula major at three degrees      and regarding its solid form as roughly speaking spherical its      nearest and most remote parts differ in their distance from us by a      little more than a tenth part of our distance from its center the      brightness of objects situated in its nearer portions therefore      cannot be much exaggerated nor that of its remoter much      enfeebled by their difference of distance yet within this      globular space we have collected upwards of six hundred stars of      the seventh eighth ninth and tenth magnitudes nearly three      hundred nebulæ and globular and other clusters of all degrees of      resolvability and smaller scattered stars innumerable of every      inferior magnitude from the tenth to such as by their multitude      and minuteness constitute irresolvable nebulosity extending over      tracts of many square degrees were there but one such object it      might be maintained without utter improbability that its apparent      sphericity is only an effect of foreshortening and that in reality      a much greater proportional difference of distance between its      nearer and more remote parts exists but such an adjustment      improbable enough in one case must be rejected as too much so for      fair argument in two it must therefore be taken as a      demonstrated fact that stars of the seventh or eighth magnitude      and irresolvable nebula may coexist within limits of distance not      differing in proportion more than as nine to tenoutlines of      astronomy 10th ed pp 65657  this supplies yet another reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine we are combating it gives us the choice of two incredibilities if we are to believe that one of these included nebulæ is so remote that its hundred thousand stars look like a milky spot invisible to the naked eye we must also believe that there are single stars so enormous that though removed to this same distance they remain visible if we accept the other alternative and say that many nebulæ are no further off than our own stars of the eighth magnitude then it is requisite to say that at a distance not greater than that at which a single star is still faintly visible to the naked eye there may exist a group of a hundred thousand stars which is invisible to the naked eye neither of these suppositions can be entertained what then is the conclusion that remains this onlythat the nebulæ are not further from us than parts of our own sidereal system of which they must be considered members and that when they are resolvable into discrete masses these masses cannot be considered as stars in anything like the ordinary sense of that word12  and now having seen the untenability of this idea rashly espoused by sundry astronomers that the nebulæ are extremely remote galaxies let us consider whether the various appearances they present are not reconcilable with the nebular hypothesis                                       given a rare and widelydiffused mass of nebulous matter having a diameter say of one hundred times that of the solar system13 what are the successive changes that may be expected to take place in it mutual gravitation will approximate its atoms or its molecules but their approximation will be opposed by that atomic motion the resultant of which we recognize as repulsion and the overcoming of which implies the evolution of heat as fast as this heat partially escapes by radiation further approximation will take place attended by further evolution of heat and so on continuously the processes not occurring separately as here described but simultaneously uninterruptedly and with increasing activity when the nebulous mass has reached a particular stage of condensationwhen its internallysituated atoms have approached to within certain distances have generated a certain amount of heat and are subject to a certain mutual pressure combinations may be anticipated whether the molecules produced be of kinds such as we know which is possible or whether they be of kinds simpler than any we know which is more probable matters not to the argument it suffices that molecular unions either between atoms of the same kind or between atoms of different kinds will finally take place when they do take place they will be accompanied by a sudden and great disengagement of heat and until this excess of heat has escaped the newlyformed molecules will remain uniformly diffused or as it were dissolved in the preexisting nebulous medium  but now what may be expected by and by to happen when radiation has adequately lowered the temperature these molecules will precipitate and having precipitated they will not remain uniformly diffused but will aggregate into flocculi just as water precipitated from air collects into clouds concluding thus that a nebulous mass will in course of time resolve itself into flocculi of precipitated denser matter floating in the rarer medium from which they were precipitated let us inquire what are the mechanical results to be inferred of clustered bodies in empty space each will move along a line which is the resultant of the tractive forces exercised by all the rest modified from moment to moment by the acquired motion and the aggregation of such clustered bodies if it eventually results at all can result only from collision dissipation and the formation of a resisting medium but with clustered bodies already immersed in a resisting medium and especially if such bodies are of small densities such as those we are considering the process of concentration will begin forthwith two factors conspiring to produce it the flocculi described irregular in their shapes and presenting as they must in nearly all cases unsymmetrical faces to their lines of motion will be deflected from those courses which mutual gravitation if uninterfered with would produce among them and this will militate against that balancing of movements which permanence of the cluster presupposes if it be said as it may truly be said that this is too trifling a cause of derangement to produce much effect then there comes the more important cause with which it cooperates the medium from which the flocculi have been precipitated and through which they are moving must by gravitation be rendered denser in its central parts than in its peripheral parts hence the flocculi none of them moving in straight lines to the common centre of gravity but having courses made to diverge to one or other side of it in small degrees by the cause just assigned and in much greater degrees by the tractive forces of other flocculi will in moving towards the central region meet with greater resistances on their inner sides than on their outer sides and will be thus made to diverge outwardly from their courses more than they would otherwise do hence a tendency which apart from other tendencies will cause them severally to go on one or other side of the centre of gravity and approaching it to get motions more and more tangential observe however that their respective motions will be deflected not towards one side of the common centre of gravity but towards various sides how then can there result a movement common to them all very simply each flocculus in describing its course must give motion to the medium through which it is moving but the probabilities are infinity to one against all the respective motions thus impressed on this medium exactly balancing one another and if they do not balance one another the result must be rotation of the whole mass of the medium in one direction but preponderating momentum in one direction having caused rotation of the medium in that direction the rotating medium must in its turn gradually arrest such flocculi as are moving in opposition and impress its own motion upon them and thus there will ultimately be formed a rotating medium with suspended flocculi partaking of its motion while they move in converging spirals towards the common centre of gravity14  before comparing these conclusions with facts let us pursue the reasoning a little further and observe certain subordinate actions the respective flocculi must be drawn not towards their common centre of gravity only but also towards neighbouring flocculi hence the whole assemblage of flocculi will break up into groups each group concentrating towards its local centre of gravity and in so doing acquiring a vortical movement like that subsequently acquired by the whole nebula according to circumstances and chiefly according to the size of the original nebulous mass this process of local aggregation will produce various results if the whole nebula is but small the local groups of flocculi may be drawn into the common centre of gravity before their constituent masses have coalesced with one another in a larger nebula these local aggregations may have concentrated into rotating spheroids of vapour while yet they have made but little approach towards the general focus of the system in a still larger nebula where the local aggregations are both greater and more remote from the common centre of gravity they may have condensed into masses of molten matter before the general distribution of them has greatly altered in short as the conditions in each case determine the discrete masses produced may vary indefinitely in number in size in density in motion in distribution  and now let us return to the visible characters of nebulæ as observed through modern telescopes take first the description of those nebulæ which by the hypothesis must be in an early stage of evolution       among the irregular nebulæ says sir john herschel may be      comprehended all which to a want of complete and in most      instances even of partial resolvability by the power of the      20feet reflector unite such a deviation from the circular or      elliptic form or such a want of symmetry with that form as      preclude their being placed in class 1 or that of regular nebulæ      this second class comprises many of the most remarkable and      interesting objects in the heavens as well as the most extensive      in respect of the area they occupy  and referring to this same order of objects m arago saysthe forms of very large diffuse nebulæ do not appear to admit of definition they have no regular outline  this coexistence of largeness irregularity and indefiniteness of outline with irresolvability is extremely significant the fact that the largest nebulæ are either irresolvable or very difficult to resolve might have been inferred a priori seeing that irresolvability implying that the aggregation of precipitated matter has gone on to but a small extent will be found in nebulæ of wide diffusion again the irregularity of these large irresolvable nebulæ might also have been expected seeing that their outlines compared by arago with the fantastic figures which characterize clouds carried away and tossed about by violent and often contrary winds are similarly characteristic of a mass not yet gathered together by the mutual attraction of its parts and once more the fact that these large irregular irresolvable nebulæ have indefinite outlinesoutlines that fade off insensibly into surrounding darknessis one of like meaning  speaking generally and of course differences of distance negative anything beyond average statements the spiral nebulæ are smaller than the irregular nebulæ and more resolvable at the same time that they are not so small as the regular nebulæ and not so resolvable this is as according to the hypothesis it should be the degree of condensation causing spiral movement is a degree of condensation also implying masses of flocculi that are larger and therefore more visible than those existing in an earlier stage moreover the forms of these spiral nebulæ are quite in harmony with the explanation given the curves of luminous matter which they exhibit are not such as would be described by discrete masses starting from a state of rest and moving through a resisting medium to a common centre of gravity but they are such as would be described by masses having their movements modified by the rotation of the medium  in the centre of a spiral nebula is seen a mass both more luminous and more resolvable than the rest assume that in process of time all the spiral streaks of luminous matter which converge to this centre are drawn into it as they must be assume further that the flocculi or other discrete portions constituting these luminous streaks aggregate into larger masses at the same time that they approach the central group and that the masses forming this central group also aggregate into larger masses and there will finally result a cluster of such larger masses which will be resolvable with comparative ease and as the coalescence and concentration go on the constituent masses will gradually become fewer larger brighter and more densely collected around the common centre of gravity see now how completely this inference agrees with observation the circular form is that which most commonly characterises resolvable nebulæ writes arago resolvable nebulæ says sir john herschel are almost universally round or oval moreover the centre of each group habitually displays a closer clustering of the constituent masses than the outer parts and it is shown that under the law of gravitation which we now know extends to the stars this distribution is not one of equilibrium but implies progressing concentration while just as we inferred that according to circumstances the extent to which aggregation has been carried must vary so we find that in fact there are regular nebulæ of all degrees of resolvability from those consisting of innumerable minute masses to those in which their numbers are smaller and the sizes greater and to those in which there are a few large bodies worthy to be called stars  on the one hand then we see that the notion of late years uncritically received that the nebulæ are extremely remote galaxies of stars like those which make up our own milky way is totally irreconcilable with the factsinvolves us in sundry absurdities on the other hand we see that the hypothesis of nebular condensation harmonizes with the most recent results of stellar astronomy nay morethat it supplies us with an explanation of various appearances which in its absence would be incomprehensible                                       descending now to the solar system let us consider first a class of phenomena in some sort transitionalthose offered by comets in them or at least in those most numerous of them which lie far out of the plane of the solar system and are not to be counted among its members we have still existing a kind of matter like that out of which according to the nebular hypothesis the solar system was evolved hence for the explanation of them we must go back to the time when the substances forming the sun and planets were yet unconcentrated  when diffused matter precipitated from a rarer medium is aggregating there are certain to be here and there produced small flocculi which long remain detached as do for instance minute shreds of cloud in a summer sky in a concentrating nebula these will in the majority of cases eventually coalesce with the larger flocculi near to them but it is tolerably evident that some of those formed at the outermost parts of the nebula will not coalesce with the larger internal masses but will slowly follow without overtaking them the relatively greater resistance of the medium necessitates this as a single feather falling to the ground will be rapidly left behind by a pillowfull of feathers so in their progress to the common centre of gravity will the outermost shreds of vapour be left behind by the great masses of vapour internally situated but we are not dependent merely on reasoning for this belief observation shows us that the less concentrated external parts of nebulæ are left behind by the more concentrated internal parts examined through high powers all nebulæ even when they have assumed regular forms are seen to be surrounded by luminous streaks of which the directions show that they are being drawn into the general mass still higher powers bring into view still smaller fainter and more widelydispersed streaks and it cannot be doubted that the minute fragments which no telescopic aid makes visible are yet more numerous and widely dispersed thus far then inference and observation are at one  granting that the great majority of these outlying portions of nebulous matter will be drawn into the central mass long before it reaches a definite form the presumption is that some of the very small farremoved portions will not be so but that before they arrive near it the central mass will have contracted into a comparatively moderate bulk what now will be the characters of these latearriving portions  in the first place they will have either extremely eccentric orbits or nonelliptic paths left behind at a time when they were moving towards the centre of gravity in slightlydeflected lines and therefore having but very small angular velocities they will approach the central mass in greatly elongated curves and rushing round it will go off again into space that is they will behave just as we see the majority of comets do the orbits of which are either so eccentric as to be indistinguishable from parabolas or else are not orbits at all but are paths which are distinctly either parabolic or hyperbolic  in the second place they will come from all parts of the heavens our supposition implies that they were left behind at a time when the nebulous mass was of irregular shape and had not acquired a definite rotation and as the separation of them would not be from any one surface of the nebulous mass more than another the conclusion must be that they will come to the central body from various directions in space this too is exactly what happens unlike planets whose orbits approximate to one plane comets have orbits that show no relation to one another but cut the plane of the ecliptic at all angles and have axes inclined to it at all angles  in the third place these remotest flocculi of nebulous matter will at the outset be deflected from their direct courses to the common centre of gravity not all on one side but each on such side as its form or its original proper motion determines and being left behind before the rotation of the nebula is set up they will severally retain their different individual motions hence following the concentrated mass they will eventually go round it on all sides and as often from right to left as from left to right here again the inference perfectly corresponds with the facts while all the planets go round the sun from west to east comets as often go round the sun from east to west as from west to east of 262 comets recorded since 1680 130 are direct and 132 are retrograde this equality is what the law of probabilities would indicate  then in the fourth place the physical constitution of comets accords with the hypothesis15 the ability of nebulous matter to concentrate into a concrete form depends on its mass to bring its ultimate atoms into that proximity requisite for chemical unionrequisite that is for the production of denser mattertheir repulsion must be overcome the only force antagonistic to their repulsion is their mutual gravitation that their mutual gravitation may generate a pressure and temperature of sufficient intensity there must be an enormous accumulation of them and even then the approximation can slowly go on only as fast as the evolved heat escapes but where the quantity of atoms is small and therefore the force of mutual gravitation small there will be nothing to coerce the atoms into union whence we infer that these detached fragments of nebulous matter will continue in their original state nonperiodic comets seem to do so  we have already seen that this view of the origin of comets harmonizes with the characters of their orbits but the evidence hence derived is much stronger than was indicated the great majority of cometary orbits are classed as parabolic and it is ordinarily inferred that they are visitors from remote space and will never return but are they rightly classed as parabolic observations on a comet moving in an extremely eccentric ellipse which are possible only when it is comparatively near perihelion must fail to distinguish its orbit from a parabola evidently then it is not safe to class it as a parabola because of inability to detect the elements of an ellipse but if extreme eccentricity of an orbit necessitates such inability it seems quite possible that comets have no other orbits than elliptic ones though five or six are said to be hyperbolic yet as i learn from one who has paid special attention to comets no such orbit has i believe been computed for a wellobserved comet hence the probability that all the orbits are ellipses is overwhelming ellipses and hyperbolas have countless varieties of forms but there is only one form of parabola or to speak literally all parabolas are similar while there are infinitely numerous dissimilar ellipses and dissimilar hyperbolas consequently anything coming to the sun from a great distance must have one exact amount of proper motion to produce a parabola all other amounts would give hyperbolas or ellipses and if there are no hyperbolic orbits then it is infinity to one that all the orbits are elliptical this is just what they would be if comets had the genesis above supposed                                       and now leaving these erratic bodies let us turn to the more familiar and important members of the solar system it was the remarkable harmony among their movements which first made laplace conceive that the sun planets and satellites had resulted from a common genetic process as sir william herschel by his observations on the nebulæ was led to the conclusion that stars resulted from the aggregation of diffused matter so laplace by his observations on the structure of the solar system was led to the conclusion that only by the rotation of aggregating matter were its peculiarities to be explained in his exposition du système du monde he enumerates as the leading evidences1 the movements of the planets in the same direction and in orbits approaching to the same plane 2 the movements of the satellites in the same direction as those of the planets 3 the movements of rotation of these various bodies and of the sun in the same direction as the orbital motions and mostly in planes little different 4 the small eccentricities of the orbits of the planets and satellites as contrasted with the great eccentricities of the cometary orbits and the probability that these harmonious movements had a common cause he calculates as two hundred thousand billions to one  this immense preponderance of probability does not point to a common cause under the form ordinarily conceivedan invisible power working after the method of a great artificer but to an invisible power working after the method of evolution for though the supporters of the common hypothesis may argue that it was necessary for the sake of stability that the planets should go round the sun in the same direction and nearly in one plane they cannot thus account for the direction of the axial motions16 the mechanical equilibrium would not have been interfered with had the sun been without any rotatory movement or had he revolved on his axis in a direction opposite to that in which the planets go round him or in a direction at right angles to the average plane of their orbits with equal safety the motion of the moon round the earth might have been the reverse of the earths motion round its axis or the motions of jupiters satellites might similarly have been at variance with his axial motion or those of saturns satellites with his as however none of these alternatives have been followed the uniformity must be considered in this case as in all others evidence of subordination to some general lawimplies what we call natural causation as distinguished from arbitrary arrangement  hence the hypothesis of evolution would be the only probable one even in the absence of any clue to the particular mode of evolution but when we have propounded by a mathematician of the highest authority a theory of this evolution based on established mechanical principles which accounts for these various peculiarities as well as for many minor ones the conclusion that the solar system was evolved becomes almost irresistible  the general nature of laplaces theory scarcely needs stating books of popular astronomy have familiarized most readers with his conceptionsnamely that the matter now condensed into the solar system once formed a vast rotating spheroid of extreme rarity extending beyond the orbit of the outermost planet that as this spheroid contracted its rate of rotation necessarily increased that by augmenting centrifugal force its equatorial zone was from time to time prevented from following any further the concentrating mass and so remained behind as a revolving ring that each of the revolving rings thus periodically detached eventually became ruptured at its weakest point and contracting on itself gradually aggregated into a rotating mass that this like the parent mass increased in rapidity of rotation as it decreased in size and where the centrifugal force was sufficient similarly left behind rings which finally collapsed into rotating spheroids and that thus out of these primary and secondary rings there arose planets and their satellites while from the central mass there resulted the sun moreover it is tolerably well known that this a priori reasoning harmonizes with the results of experiment dr plateau has shown that when a mass of fluid is as far may be protected from the action of external forces it will if made to rotate with adequate velocity form detached rings and that these rings will break up into spheroids which turn on their axes in the same direction with the central mass thus given the original nebula which acquiring a vortical motion in the way indicated has at length concentrated into a vast spheroid of aeriform matter moving round its axisgiven this and mechanical principles explain the rest the genesis of a solar system displaying movements like those observed may be predicted and the reasoning on which the prediction is based is countenanced by experiment17  but now let us inquire whether besides these most conspicuous structural and dynamic peculiarities of the solar system sundry minor ones are not similarly explicable                                       take first the relation between the planes of the planetary orbits and the plane of the suns equator if when the nebulous spheroid extended beyond the orbit of neptune all parts of it had been revolving exactly in the same plane or rather in parallel planesif all its parts had had one axis then the planes of the successive rings would have been coincident with each other and with that of the suns rotation but it needs only to go back to the earlier stages of concentration to see that there could exist no such complete uniformity of motion the flocculi already described as precipitated from an irregular and widelydiffused nebula and as starting from all points to their common centre of gravity must move not in one plane but in innumerable planes cutting each other at all angles the gradual establishment of a vortical motion such as we at present see indicated in the spiral nebulæ is the gradual approach towards motion in one plane but this plane can but slowly become decided flocculi not moving in this plane but entering into the aggregation at various inclinations will tend to perform their revolutions round its centre in their own planes and only in course of time will their motions be partly destroyed by conflicting ones and partly resolved into the general motion especially will the outermost portions of the rotating mass retain for a long time their more or less independent directions hence the probabilities are that the planes of the rings first detached will differ considerably from the average plane of the mass while the planes of those detached latest will differ from it less  here again inference to a considerable extent agrees with observation though the progression is irregular yet on the average the inclinations decrease on approaching the sun and this is all we can expect for as the portions of the nebulous spheroid must have arrived with miscellaneous inclinations its strata must have had planes of rotation diverging from the average plane in degrees not always proportionate to their distances from the centre                                       consider next the movements of the planets on their axes laplace alleged as one among other evidences of a common genetic cause that the planets rotate in a direction the same as that in which they go round the sun and on axes approximately perpendicular to their orbits since he wrote an exception to this general rule has been discovered in the case of uranus and another still more recently in the case of neptunejudging at least from the motions of their respective satellites this anomaly has been thought to throw considerable doubt on his speculation and at first sight it does so but a little reflection shows that the anomaly is not inexplicable and that laplace simply went too far in putting down as a certain result of nebular genesis what is in some instances only a probable result the cause he pointed out as determining the direction of rotation is the greater absolute velocity of the outer part of the detached ring but there are conditions under which this difference of velocity may be too insignificant even if it exists if a mass of nebulous matter approaching spirally to the central spheroid and eventually joining it tangentially is made up of parts having the same absolute velocities then after joining the equatorial periphery of the spheroid and being made to rotate with it the angular velocity of its outer parts will be smaller than the angular velocity of its inner parts hence if when the angular velocities of the outer and inner parts of a detached ring are the same there results a tendency to rotation in the same direction with the orbital motion it may be inferred that when the outer parts of the ring have a smaller angular velocity than the inner parts a tendency to retrograde rotation will be the consequence  again the sectional form of the ring is a circumstance of moment and this form must have differed more or less in every case to make this clear some illustration will be necessary suppose we take an orange and assuming the marks of the stalk and the calyx to represent the poles cut off round the line of the equator a strip of peel this strip of peel if placed on the table with its ends meeting will make a ring shaped like the hoop of a barrela ring of which the thickness in the line of its diameter is very small but of which the width in a direction perpendicular to its diameter is considerable suppose now that in place of an orange which is a spheroid of very slight oblateness we take a spheroid of very great oblateness shaped somewhat like a lens of small convexity if from the edge or equator of this lensshaped spheroid a ring of moderate size were cut off it would be unlike the previous ring in this respect that its greatest thickness would be in the line of its diameter and not in a line at right angles to its diameter it would be a ring shaped somewhat like a quoit only far more slender that is to say according to the oblateness of a rotating spheroid the detached ring may be either a hoopshaped ring or a quoitshaped ring  one further implication must be noted in a muchflattened or lensshaped spheroid the form of the ring will vary with its bulk a very slender ring taking off just the equatorial surface will be hoopshaped while a tolerably massive ring trenching appreciably on the diameter of the spheroid will be quoitshaped thus then according to the oblateness of the spheroid and the bulkiness of the detached ring will the greatest thickness of that ring be in the direction of its plane or in a direction perpendicular to its plane but this circumstance must greatly affect the rotation of the resulting planet in a decidedly hoopshaped nebulous ring the differences of velocity between the inner and outer surfaces will be small and such a ring aggregating into a mass of which the greatest diameter is at right angles to the plane of the orbit will almost certainly give to this mass a predominant tendency to rotate in a direction at right angles to the plane of the orbit where the ring is but little hoopshaped and the difference between the inner and outer velocities greater as it must be the opposing tendenciesone to produce rotation in the plane of the orbit and the other rotation perpendicular to itwill both be influential and an intermediate plane of rotation will be taken up while if the nebulous ring is decidedly quoitshaped and therefore aggregates into a mass whose greatest dimension lies in the plane of the orbit both tendencies will conspire to produce rotation in that plane  on referring to the facts we find them as far as can be judged in harmony with this view considering the enormous circumference of uranuss orbit and his comparatively small mass we may conclude that the ring from which he resulted was a comparatively slender and therefore a hoopshaped one especially as the nebulous mass must have been at that time less oblate than afterwards hence a plane of rotation nearly perpendicular to his orbit and a direction of rotation having no reference to his orbital movement saturn has a mass seven times as great and an orbit of less than half the diameter whence it follows that his genetic ring having less than half the circumference and less than half the vertical thickness the spheroid being then certainly as oblate and indeed more oblate must have had a much greater widthmust have been less hoopshaped and more approaching to the quoitshaped notwithstanding difference of density it must have been at least two or three times as broad in the line of its plane consequently saturn has a rotatory movement in the same direction as the movement of translation and in a plane differing from it by thirty degrees only in the case of jupiter again whose mass is three and a half times that of saturn and whose orbit is little more than half the size the genetic ring must for the like reasons have been still broaderdecidedly quoitshaped we may say and there hence resulted a planet whose plane of rotation differs from that of his orbit by scarcely more than three degrees once more considering the comparative insignificance of mars earth venus and mercury it follows that the diminishing circumferences of the rings not sufficing to account for the smallness of the resulting masses the rings must have been slender onesmust have again approximated to the hoopshaped and thus it happens that the planes of rotation again diverge more or less widely from those of the orbits taking into account the increasing oblateness of the original spheroid in the successive stages of its concentration and the different proportions of the detached rings it may fairly be held that the respective rotatory motions are not at variance with the hypothesis but contrariwise tend to confirm it  not only the directions but also the velocities of rotation seem thus explicable it might naturally be supposed that the large planets would revolve on their axes more slowly than the small ones our terrestrial experiences of big and little bodies incline us to expect this it is a corollary from the nebular hypothesis however more especially when interpreted as above that while large planets will rotate rapidly small ones will rotate slowly and we find that in fact they do so other things equal a concentrating nebulous mass which is diffused through a wide space and whose outer parts have therefore to travel from great distances to the common centre of gravity will acquire a high axial velocity in course of its aggregation and conversely with a small mass still more marked will be the difference where the form of the genetic ring conspires to increase the rate of rotation other things equal a genetic ring which is broadest in the direction of its plane will produce a mass rotating faster than one which is broadest at right angles to its plane and if the ring is absolutely as well as relatively broad the rotation will be very rapid these conditions were as we saw fulfilled in the case of jupiter and jupiter turns round his axis in less than ten hours saturn in whose case as above explained the conditions were less favourable to rapid rotation takes nearly ten hours and a half while mars earth venus and mercury whose rings must have been slender take more than double that time the smallest taking the longest                                       from the planets let us now pass to the satellites here beyond the conspicuous facts commonly adverted to that they go round their primaries in the directions in which these turn on their axes in planes diverging but little from their equators and in orbits nearly circular there are several significant traits which must not be passed over  one of them is that each set of satellites repeats in miniature the relations of the planets to the sun both in certain respects above named and in the order of their sizes on progressing from the outside of the solar system to its centre we see that there are four large external planets and four internal ones which are comparatively small a like contrast holds between the outer and inner satellites in every case among the four satellites of jupiter the parallel is maintained as well as the comparative smallness of the number allows the two outer ones are the largest and the two inner ones the smallest according to the most recent observations made by mr lassell the like is true of the four satellites of uranus in the case of saturn who has eight secondary planets revolving round him the likeness is still more close in arrangement as in number the three outer satellites are large the inner ones small and the contrasts of size are here much greater between the largest which is nearly as big as mars and the smallest which is with difficulty discovered even by the best telescopes but the analogy does not end here just as with the planets there is at first a general increase of size on travelling inwards from neptune and uranus which do not differ very widely to saturn which is much larger and to jupiter which is the largest so of the eight satellites of saturn the largest is not the outermost but the outermost save two so of jupiters four secondaries the largest is the most remote but one now these parallelisms are inexplicable by the theory of final causes for purposes of lighting if this be the presumed object of these attendant bodies it would have been far better had the larger been the nearer at present their remoteness renders them of less service than the smallest to the nebular hypothesis however these analogies give further support they show the action of a common physical cause they imply a law of genesis holding in the secondary systems as in the primary system  still more instructive shall we find the distribution of the satellitestheir absence in some instances and their presence in other instances in smaller or greater numbers the argument from design fails to account for this distribution supposing it be granted that planets nearer the sun than ourselves have no need of moons though considering that their nights are as dark and relatively to their brilliant days even darker than ours the need seems quite as greatsupposing this to be granted how are we to explain the fact that uranus has but half as many moons as saturn though he is at double the distance while however the current presumption is untenable the nebular hypothesis furnishes us with an explanation it enables us to predict where satellites will be abundant and where they will be absent the reasoning is as follows  in a rotating nebulous spheroid which is concentrating into a planet there are at work two antagonist mechanical tendenciesthe centripetal and the centrifugal while the force of gravitation draws all the atoms of the spheroid together their tangential momentum is resolvable into two parts of which one resists gravitation the ratio which this centrifugal force bears to gravitation varies other things equal as the square of the velocity hence the aggregation of a rotating nebulous spheroid will be more or less hindered by this resisting force according as the rate of rotation is high or low the opposition in equal spheroids being four times as great when the rotation is twice as rapid nine times as great when it is three times as rapid and so on now the detachment of a ring from a planetforming body of nebulous matter implies that at its equatorial zone the increasing centrifugal force consequent on concentration has become so great as to balance gravity whence it is tolerably obvious that the detachment of rings will be most frequent from those masses in which the centrifugal tendency bears the greatest ratio to the gravitative tendency though it is not possible to calculate what ratio these two tendencies had to each other in the genetic spheroid which produced each planet it is possible to calculate where each was the greatest and where the least while it is true that the ratio which centrifugal force now bears to gravity at the equator of each planet differs widely from that which it bore during the earlier stages of concentration and while it is true that this change in the ratio depending on the degree of contraction each planet has undergone has in no two cases been the same yet we may fairly conclude that where the ratio is still the greatest it has been the greatest from the beginning the satelliteforming tendency which each planet had will be approximately indicated by the proportion now existing in it between the aggregating power and the power that has opposed aggregation on making the requisite calculations a remarkable harmony with this inference comes out the following table shows what fraction the centrifugal force is of the centripetal force in every case and the relation which that fraction bears to the number of satellites18     mercury  1360    venus    1253    earth    1289    1 satellite    mars     1127    2 satellites    jupiter  111·4   4 satellites    saturn   16·4    8 satellites and three rings    uranus   110·9   4 satellites  thus taking as our standard of comparison the earth with its one moon we see that mercury in which the centrifugal force is relatively less has no moon mars in which it is relatively much greater has two moons jupiter in which it is far greater has four moons uranus in which it is greater still has certainly four and more if herschel was right saturn in which it is the greatest being nearly onesixth of gravity has including his rings eleven attendants the only instance in which there is nonconformity with observation is that of venus here it appears that the centrifugal force is relatively greater than in the earth and according to the hypothesis venus ought to have a satellite respecting this anomaly several remarks are to be made without putting any faith in the alleged discovery of a satellite of venus repeated at intervals by five different observers it may yet be contended that as the satellites of mars eluded observation up to 1877 a satellite of venus may have eluded observation up to the present time merely naming this as possible but not probable a consideration of more weight is that the period of rotation of venus is but indefinitely fixed and that a small diminution in the estimated angular velocity of her equator would bring the result into congruity with the hypothesis further it may be remarked that not exact but only general congruity is to be expected since the process of condensation of each planet from nebulous matter can scarcely be expected to have gone on with absolute uniformity the angular velocities of the superposed strata of nebulous matter probably differed from one another in degrees unlike in each case and such differences would affect the satelliteforming tendency but without making much of these possible explanations of the discrepancy the correspondence between inference and fact which we find in so many planets may be held to afford strong support to the nebular hypothesis  certain more special peculiarities of the satellites must be mentioned as suggestive one of them is the relation between the period of revolution and that of rotation no discoverable purpose is served by making the moon go round its axis in the same time that it goes round the earth for our convenience a more rapid axial motion would have been equally good and for any possible inhabitants of the moon much better against the alternative supposition that the equality occurred by accident the probabilities are as laplace says infinity to one but to this arrangement which is explicable neither as the result of design nor of chance the nebular hypothesis furnishes a clue in his exposition du système du monde laplace shows by reasoning too detailed to be here repeated that under the circumstances such a relation of movements would be likely to establish itself  among jupiters satellites which severally display these same synchronous movements there also exists a still more remarkable relation if the mean angular velocity of the first satellite be added to twice that of the third the sum will be equal to three times that of the second and from this it results that the situations of any two of them being given that of the third can be found now here as before no conceivable advantage results neither in this case can the connexion have been accidental the probabilities are infinity to one to the contrary but again according to laplace the nebular hypothesis supplies a solution are not these significant facts  most significant fact of all however is that presented by the rings of saturn as laplace remarks they are as it were still extant witnesses of the genetic process he propounded here we have continuing permanently forms of aggregation like those through which each planet and satellite once passed and their movements are just what in conformity with the hypothesis they should be la durée de la rotation dune planète doit donc être daprès cette hypothèse plus petite que la durée de la révolution du corps le plus voisin qui circule autour delle says laplace and he then points out that the time of saturns rotation is to that of his rings as 427 to 438an amount of difference such as was to be expected19  respecting saturns rings it may be further remarked that the place of their occurrence is not without significance  rings detached early in the process of concentration consisting of gaseous matter having extremely little power of cohesion can have little ability to resist the disruptive forces due to imperfect balance and therefore collapse into satellites a ring of a denser kind whether solid liquid or composed of small discrete masses as saturns rings are now concluded to be we can expect will be formed only near the body of a planet when it has reached so late a stage of concentration that its equatorial portions contain matters capable of easy precipitation into liquid and finally solid forms even then it can be produced only under special conditions gaining a rapidlyincreasing preponderance as the gravitative force does during the closing stages of concentration the centrifugal force cannot in ordinary cases cause the leaving behind of rings when the mass has become dense only where the centrifugal force has all along been very great and remains powerful to the last as in saturn can we expect dense rings to be formed  we find then that besides those most conspicuous peculiarities of the solar system which first suggested the theory of its evolution there are many minor ones pointing in the same direction were there no other evidence these mechanical arrangements would considered in their totality go far to establish the nebular hypothesis                                       from the mechanical arrangements of the solar system turn we now to its physical characters and first let us consider the inferences deducible from relative specific gravities  the fact that speaking generally the denser planets are the nearer to the sun has been by some considered as adding another to the many indications of nebular origin legitimately assuming that the outermost parts of a rotating nebulous spheroid in its earlier stages of concentration must be comparatively rare and that the increasing density which the whole mass acquires as it contracts must hold of the outermost parts as well as the rest it is argued that the rings successively detached will be more and more dense and will form planets of higher and higher specific gravities but passing over other objections this explanation is quite inadequate to account for the facts using the earth as a standard of comparison the relative densities run thus     neptune uranus saturn jupiter mars earth venus mercury sun     0·17     0·25    0·11    0·23    0·45   1·00   0·92   1·26    0·25  two insurmountable objections are presented by this series the first is that the progression is but a broken one neptune is denser than saturn which by the hypothesis it ought not to be uranus is denser than jupiter which it ought not to be uranus is denser than saturn and the earth is denser than venusfacts which not only give no countenance to but directly contradict the alleged explanation the second objection still more manifestly fatal is the low specific gravity of the sun if when the matter of the sun filled the orbit of mercury its state of aggregation was such that the detached ring formed a planet having a specific gravity equal to that of iron then the sun itself now that it has concentrated should have a specific gravity much greater than that of iron whereas its specific gravity is only half as much again as that of water instead of being far denser than the nearest planet it is but onefifth as dense  while these anomalies render untenable the position that the relative specific gravities of the planets are direct indications of nebular condensation it by no means follows that they negative it several causes may be assigned for these unlikenesses1 differences among the planets in respect of the elementary substances composing them or in the proportions of such elementary substances if they contain the same kinds 2 differences among them in respect of the quantities of matter they contain for other things equal the mutual gravitation of molecules will make a larger mass denser than a smaller 3 differences of temperatures for other things equal those having higher temperatures will have lower specific gravities 4 differences of physical states as being gaseous liquid or solid or otherwise differences in the relative amounts of the solid liquid and gaseous matter they contain  it is quite possible and we may indeed say probable that all these causes come into play and that they take various shares in the production of the several results but difficulties stand in the way of definite conclusions nevertheless if we revert to the hypothesis of nebular genesis we are furnished with partial explanations if nothing more  in the cooling of celestial bodies several factors are concerned the first and simplest is the one illustrated at every fireside by the rapid blackening of little cinders which fall into the ashes in contrast with the longcontinued redness of big lumps this factor is the relation between increase of surface and increase of content surfaces in similar bodies increasing as the squares of the dimensions while contents increase as their cubes hence on comparing the earth with jupiter whose diameter is about eleven times that of the earth it results that while his surface is 125 times as great his content is 1390 times as great now even supposing we assume like temperatures and like densities if the only effect were that through a given area of surface eleven times more matter had to be cooled in the one case than in the other there would be a vast difference between the times occupied in concentration but in virtue of a second factor the difference would be much greater than that consequent on these geometrical relations the escape of heat from a cooling mass is effected by conduction or by convection or by both in a solid it is wholly by conduction in a liquid or gas the chief part is played by convectionby circulating currents which continually transpose the hotter and cooler parts now in fluid spheroidsgaseous or liquid or mixedincreasing size entails an increasing obstacle to cooling consequent on the increasing distances to be travelled by the circulating currents of course the relation is not a simple one the velocities of the currents will be unlike it is manifest however that in a sphere of eleven times the diameter the transit of matter from centre to surface and back from surface to centre will take a much longer time even if its movement is unrestrained but its movement is in such cases as we are considering greatly restrained in a rotating spheroid there come into play retarding forces augmenting with the velocity of rotation in such a spheroid the respective portions of matter supposing them equal in their angular velocities round the axis which they will tend more and more to become as the density increases must vary in their absolute velocities according to their distances from the axis and each portion cannot have its distance from the axis changed by circulating currents which it must continually be without loss or gain in its quantity of motion through the medium of fluid friction force must be expended now in increasing its motion and now in retarding its motion hence when the larger spheroid has also a higher velocity of rotation the relative slowness of the circulating currents and the consequent retardation of cooling must be much greater than is implied by the extra distances to be travelled  and now observe the correspondence between inference and fact in the first place if we compare the group of the great planets jupiter saturn and uranus with the group of the small planets mars earth venus and mercury we see that low density goes along with great size and great velocity of rotation and that high density goes along with small size and small velocity of rotation in the second place we are shown this relation still more clearly if we compare the extreme instancessaturn and mercury the special contrast of these two like the general contrast of the groups points to the truth that low density like the satelliteforming tendency is associated with the ratio borne by centrifugal force to gravity for in the case of saturn with his many satellites and least density centrifugal force at the equator is nearly 16th of gravity whereas in mercury with no satellite and greatest density centrifugal force is but 1360th of gravity  there are however certain factors which working in an opposite way qualify and complicate these effects other things equal mutual gravitation among the parts of a large mass will cause a greater evolution of heat than is similarly caused in a small mass and the resulting difference of temperature will tend to produce more rapid dissipation of heat to this must be added the greater velocity of the circulating currents which the intenser forces at work in larger spheroids will producea contrast made still greater by the relatively smaller retardation by friction to which the more voluminous currents are exposed in these causes joined with causes previously indicated we may recognize a probable explanation of the otherwise anomalous fact that the sun though having a thousand times the mass of jupiter has yet reached as advanced a stage of concentration for the force of gravity in the sun which at his surface is some ten times that at the surface of jupiter must expose his central parts to a pressure relatively very intense producing during contraction a relatively rapid genesis of heat and it is further to be remarked that though the circulating currents in the sun have far greater distances to travel yet since his rotation is relatively so slow that the angular velocity of his substance is but about onesixtieth of that of jupiters substance the resulting obstacle to circulating currents is relatively small and the escape of heat far less retarded here too we may note that in the cooperation of these factors there seems a reason for the greater concentration reached by jupiter than by saturn though saturn is the elder as well as the smaller of the two for at the same time that the gravitative force in jupiter is more than twice as great as in saturn his velocity of rotation is very little greater so that the opposition of the centrifugal force to the centripetal is not much more than half  but now not judging more than roughly of the effects of these several factors cooperating in various ways and degrees some to aid concentration and others to resist it it is sufficiently manifest that other things equal the larger nebulous spheroids longer in losing their heat will more slowly reach high specific gravities and that where the contrasts in size are so immense as those between the greater and the smaller planets the smaller may have reached relatively high specific gravities when the greater have reached but relatively low ones further it appears that such qualification of the process as results from the more rapid genesis of heat in the larger masses will be countervailed where high velocity of rotation greatly impedes the circulating currents thus interpreted then the various specific gravities of the planets may be held to furnish further evidences supporting the nebular hypothesis                                       increase of density and escape of heat are correlated phenomena and hence in the foregoing section treating of the respective densities of the celestial bodies in connexion with nebular condensation much has been said and implied respecting the accompanying genesis and dissipation of heat quite apart however from the foregoing arguments and inferences there is to be noted the fact that in the present temperatures of the celestial bodies at large we find additional supports to the hypothesis and these too of the most substantial character for if as is implied above heat must inevitably be generated by the aggregation of diffused matter we ought to find in all the heavenly bodies either present high temperatures or marks of past high temperatures this we do in the places and in the degrees which the hypothesis requires  observations showing that as we descend below the earths surface there is a progressive increase of heat joined with the conspicuous evidence furnished by volcanoes necessitate the conclusion that the temperature is very high at great depths whether as some believe the interior of the earth is still molten or whether as sir william thomson contends it must be solid there is agreement in the inference that its heat is intense and it has been further shown that the rate at which the temperature increases on descending below the surface is such as would be found in a mass which had been cooling for an indefinite period the moon too shows us by its corrugations and its conspicuous extinct volcanoes that in it there has been a process of refrigeration and contraction like that which has gone on in the earth there is no teleological explanation of these facts the frequent destructions of life by earthquakes and volcanoes imply rather that it would have been better had the earth been created with a low internal temperature but if we contemplate the facts in connexion with the nebular hypothesis we see that this stillcontinued high internal heat is one of its corollaries the earth must have passed through the gaseous and the molten conditions before it became solid and must for an almost infinite period by its internal heat continue to bear evidence of this origin  the group of giant planets furnishes remarkable evidence the a priori inference drawn above that great size joined with relatively high ratio of centrifugal force to gravity must greatly retard aggregation and must thus by checking the genesis and dissipation of heat make the process of cooling a slow one has of late years received verifications from inferences drawn a posteriori so that now the current conclusion among astronomers is that in physical condition the great planets are in stages midway between that of the earth and that of the sun the fact that the centre of jupiters disc is twice or thrice as bright as his periphery joined with the facts that he seems to radiate more light than is accounted for by reflection of the suns rays and that his spectrum shows the redstar line are taken as evidences of luminosity while the immense and rapid perturbations in his atmosphere far greater than could be caused by heat received from the sun as well as the formation of spots analogous to those of the sun which also like those of the sun show a higher rate of rotation near the equator than further from it are held to imply high internal temperature thus in jupiter as also in saturn we find states which not admitting of any teleological explanations for they manifestly exclude the possibility of life admit of explanations derived from the nebular hypothesis  but the argument from temperature does not end here there remains to be noticed a more conspicuous and still more significant fact if the solar system was produced by the concentration of diffused matter which evolved heat while gravitating into its present dense form then there is an obvious implication other things equal the latestformed mass will be the latest in coolingwill for an almost infinite time possess a greater heat than the earlierformed ones other things equal the largest mass will because of its superior aggregative force become hotter than the others and radiate more intensely other things equal the largest mass notwithstanding the higher temperature it reaches will in consequence of its relatively small surface be the slowest in losing its evolved heat and hence if there is one mass which was not only formed after the rest but exceeds them enormously in size it follows that this one will reach an intensity of incandescence far beyond that reached by the rest and will continue in a state of intense incandescence long after the rest have cooled such a mass we have in the sun it is a corollary from the nebular hypothesis that the matter forming the sun assumed its present integrated shape at a period much more recent than that at which the planets became definite bodies the quantity of matter contained in the sun is nearly five million times that contained in the smallest planet and above a thousand times that contained in the largest and while from the enormous gravitative force of his parts to their common centre the evolution of heat has been intense the facilities of radiation have been relatively small hence the stillcontinued high temperature just that condition of the central body which is a necessary inference from the nebular hypothesis we find actually existing in the sun  the paragraph which here follows though it contains some questionable propositions i reproduce just as it stood when first published in 1858 for reasons which will presently be apparent  it may be well to consider more closely what is the probable condition of the suns surface round the globe of incandescent molten substances thus conceived to form the visible body of the sun which in conformity with the argument in a previous section now transferred to the addenda was inferred to be hollow and filled with gaseous matter at high tension there is known to exist a voluminous atmosphere the inferior brilliancy of the suns border and the appearances during a total eclipse alike show this what now must be the constitution of this atmosphere at a temperature approaching a thousand times that of molten iron which is the calculated temperature of the solar surface very many if not all of the substances we know as solid would become gaseous and though the suns enormous attractive force must be a powerful check on this tendency to assume the form of vapour yet it cannot be questioned that if the body of the sun consists of molten substances some of them must be constantly undergoing evaporation that the dense gases thus continually being generated will form the entire mass of the solar atmosphere is not probable if anything is to be inferred either from the nebular hypothesis or from the analogies supplied by the planets it must be concluded that the outermost part of the solar atmosphere consists of what are called permanent gasesgases that are not condensible into fluid even at low temperatures if we consider what must have been the state of things here when the surface of the earth was molten we shall see that round the still molten surface of the sun there probably exists a stratum of dense aeriform matter made up of sublimed metals and metallic compounds and above this a stratum of comparatively rare medium analogous to air what now will happen with these two strata did they both consist of permanent gases they could not remain separate according to a wellknown law they would eventually form a homogeneous mixture but this will by no means happen when the lower stratum consists of matters that are gaseous only at excessively high temperatures given off from a molten surface ascending expanding and cooling these will presently reach a limit of elevation above which they cannot exist as vapour but must condense and precipitate meanwhile the upper stratum habitually charged with its quantum of these denser matters as our air with its quantum of water and ready to deposit them on any depression of temperature must be habitually unable to take up any more of the lower stratum and therefore this lower stratum will remain quite distinct from it20                                       considered in their ensemble the several groups of evidences assigned amount almost to proof we have seen that when critically examined the speculations of late years current respecting the nature of the nebulæ commit their promulgators to sundry absurdities while on the other hand we see that the various appearances these nebulæ present are explicable as different stages in the precipitation and aggregation of diffused matter we find that the immense majority of comets ie omitting the periodic ones by their physical constitution their immenselyextended and variouslydirected paths the distribution of those paths and their manifest structural relation to the solar system bear testimony to the past existence of that system in a nebulous form not only do those obvious peculiarities in the motions of the planets which first suggested the nebular hypothesis supply proofs of it but on closer examination we discover in the slightlydiverging inclinations of their orbits in their various rates of rotation and their differentlydirected axes of rotation that the planets yield us yet further testimony while the satellites by sundry traits and especially by their occurrence in greater or less abundance where the hypothesis implies greater or less abundance confirm this testimony by tracing out the process of planetary condensation we are led to conclusions respecting the physical states of planets which explain their anomalous specific gravities once more it turns out that what is inferable from the nebular hypothesis respecting the temperatures of celestial bodies is just what observation establishes and that both the absolute and the relative temperatures of the sun and planets are thus accounted for when we contemplate these various evidences in their totalitywhen we observe that by the nebular hypothesis the leading phenomena of the solar system and the heavens in general are explicable and when on the other hand we consider that the current cosmogony is not only without a single fact to stand on but is at variance with all our positive knowledge of nature we see that the proof becomes overwhelming  it remains only to point out that while the genesis of the solar system and of countless other systems like it is thus rendered comprehensible the ultimate mystery continues as great as ever the problem of existence is not solved it is simply removed further back the nebular hypothesis throws no light on the origin of diffused matter and diffused matter as much needs accounting for as concrete matter the genesis of an atom is not easier to conceive than the genesis of a planet nay indeed so far from making the universe less a mystery than before it makes it a greater mystery creation by manufacture is a much lower thing than creation by evolution a man can put together a machine but he cannot make a machine develop itself that our harmonious universe once existed potentially as formless diffused matter and has slowly grown into its present organized state is a far more astonishing fact than would have been its formation after the artificial method vulgarly supposed those who hold it legitimate to argue from phenomena to noumena may rightly contend that the nebular hypothesis implies a first cause as much transcending the mechanical god of paley as this does the fetish of the savage  footnotes  footnote 11 cosmos seventh edition vol i pp 79 80  footnote 12 since the publication of this essay the late mr r a proctor has given various further reasons for the conclusion that the nebulæ belong to our own sidereal system the opposite conclusion contested throughout the foregoing section has now been tacitly abandoned  footnote 13 any objection made to the extreme tenuity this involves is met by the calculation of newton who proved that were a spherical inch of air removed four thousand miles from the earth it would expand into a sphere more than filling the orbit of saturn  footnote 14 a reference may fitly be made here to a reason given by mons babinet for rejection of the nebular hypothesis he has calculated that taking the existing sun with its observed angular velocity its substance if expanded so as to fill the orbit of neptune would have nothing approaching the angular velocity which the time of revolution of that planet implies the assumption he makes is inadmissible he supposes that all parts of the nebulous spheroid when it filled neptunes orbit had the same angular velocities but the process of nebular condensation as indicated above implies that the remoter flocculi of nebulous matter later in reaching the central mass and forming its peripheral portions will acquire during their longer journeys towards it greater velocities an inspection of one of the spiral nebulæ as 51st or 99th messier at once shows that the outlying portions when they reach the nucleus will form an equatorial belt moving round the common centre more rapidly than the rest thus the central parts will have small angular velocities while there will be increasing angular velocities of parts increasingly remote from the centre and while the density of the spheroid continues small fluid friction will scarcely at all change these differences  a like criticism may i think be passed on an opinion expressed by prof newcomb he sayswhen the contraction of the nebulous spheroid had gone so far that the centrifugal and attracting forces nearly balanced each other at the outer equatorial limit of the mass the result would have been that contraction in the direction of the equator would cease entirely and be confined to the polar regions each particle dropping not towards the sun but towards the plane of the solar equator thus we should have a constant flattening of the spheroidal atmosphere until it was reduced to a thin flat disk this disk might then separate itself into rings which would form planets in much the same way that laplace supposed but there would probably be no marked difference in the age of the planets popular astronomy p 512 now this conclusion assumes like that of m babinet that all parts of the nebulous spheroid had equal angular velocities if as above contended it is inferable from the process by which a nebulous spheroid was formed that its outer portions revolved with greater angular velocities than its inner then the inference which prof newcomb draws is not necessitated  footnote 15 it is true that since this essay was written reasons have been given for concluding that comets consist of swarms of meteors enveloped in aeriform matter very possibly this is the constitution of the periodic comets which approximating their orbits to the plane of the solar system form established parts of the system and which as will be hereafter indicated have probably a quite different origin  footnote 16 though this rule fails at the periphery of the solar system yet it fails only where the axis of rotation instead of being almost perpendicular to the orbitplane is very little inclined to it and where therefore the forces tending to produce the congruity of motions were but little operative  footnote 17 it is true that as expressed by him these propositions of laplace are not all beyond dispute an astronomer of the highest authority who has favoured me with some criticisms on this essay alleges that instead of a nebulous ring rupturing at one point and collapsing into a single mass all probability would be in favour of its breaking up into many masses this alternative result certainly seems the more likely but granting that a nebulous ring would break up into many masses it may still be contended that since the chances are infinity to one against these being of equal sizes and equidistant they could not remain evenly distributed round their orbit this annular chain of gaseous masses would break up into groups of masses these groups would eventually aggregate into larger groups and the final result would be the formation of a single mass i have put the question to an astronomer scarcely second in authority to the one above referred to and he agrees that this would probably be the process  footnote 18 the comparative statement here given differs slightly in most cases and in one case largely from the statement included in this essay as originally published in 1858 as then given the table ran thus     mercury   1362    venus     1282    earth     1289   1 satellite    mars      1326    jupiter   114    4 satellites    saturn    16·2   8 satellites and three rings    uranus    19     4 or 6 according to herschel  the calculations ending with these figures were made while the suns distance was still estimated at 95 millions of miles of course the reduction afterwards established in the estimated distance entailing as it did changes in the factors which entered into the calculations affected the results and though it was unlikely that the relations stated would be materially changed it was needful to have the calculations made afresh mr lynn has been good enough to undertake this task and the figures given in the text are his in the case of mars a large error in my calculation had arisen from accepting aragos statement of his density 0·95 which proves to be something like double what it should be here a curious incident may be named when in 1877 it was discovered that mars has two satellites though according to my hypothesis it seemed that he should have none my faith in it received a shock and since that time i have occasionally considered whether the fact is in any way reconcilable with the hypothesis but now the proof afforded by mr lynn that my calculation contained a wrong factor disposes of the difficultynay changes the objection to a verification it turns out that according to the hypothesis mars ought to have satellites and further that he ought to have a number intermediate between 1 and 4  footnote 19 since this paragraph was first published the discovery that mars has two satellites revolving round him in periods shorter than that of his rotation has shown that the implication on which laplace here insists is general only and not absolute were it a necessary assumption that all parts of a concentrating nebulous spheroid revolve with the same angular velocities the exception would appear an inexplicable one but if as suggested in a preceding section it is inferable from the process of formation of a nebulous spheroid that its outer strata will move round the general axis with higher angular velocities than the inner ones there follows a possible interpretation though during the earlier stages of concentration while the nebulous matter and especially its peripheral portions are very rare the effects of fluidfriction will be too small to change greatly such differences of angular velocities as exist yet when concentration has reached its last stages and the matter is passing from the gaseous into the liquid and solid states and when also the convectioncurrents have become common to the whole mass which they probably at first are not the angular velocity of the peripheral portion will gradually be assimilated to that of the interior and it becomes comprehensible that in the case of mars the peripheral portion more and more dragged back by the internal mass lost part of its velocity during the interval between the formation of the innermost satellite and the arrival at the final form  footnote 20 i was about to suppress part of the above paragraph written before the science of solar physics had taken shape because of certain physical difficulties which stand in the way of its argument when on looking into recent astronomical works i found that the hypothesis it sets forth respecting the suns structure has kinships to the several hypotheses since set forth by zöllner faye and young i have therefore decided to let it stand as it originally did  the contemplated partial suppression just named was prompted by recognition of the truth that to effect mechanical stability the gaseous interior of the sun must have a density at least equal to that of the molten shell greater indeed at the centre and this seems to imply a specific gravity higher than that which he possesses it may indeed be that the unknown elements which spectrum analysis shows to exist in the sun are metals of very low specific gravities and that existing in large proportion with other of the lighter metals they may form a molten shell not denser than is implied by the facts but this can be regarded as nothing more than a possibility  no need however has arisen for either relinquishing or holding but loosely the associated conclusions respecting the constitution of the photosphere and its envelope widely speculative as seemed these suggested corollaries from the nebular hypothesis when set forth in 1858 and quite at variance with the beliefs then current they proved to be not illfounded at the close of 1859 there came the discoveries of kirchhoff proving the existence of various metallic vapours in the suns atmosphere     addenda   speculative as is much of the foregoing essay it appears undesirable to include in it anything still more speculative for this reason i have decided to set forth separately some views concerning the genesis of the socalled elements during nebular condensation and concerning the accompanying physical effects at the same time it has seemed best to detach from the essay some of the more debatable conclusions originally contained in it so that its general argument may not be needlessly implicated with them these new portions together with the old portions which reappear more or less modified i here append in a series of notes   note i for the belief that the socalled elements are compound there are both special reasons and general reasons among the special may be named the parallelism between allotropy and isomerism the numerous lines in the spectrum of each element and the cyclical law of newlands and mendeljeff of the more general reasons which as distinguished from these chemical or chemicophysical ones may fitly be called cosmical the following are the chief  the general law of evolution if it does not actually involve the conclusion that the socalled elements are compounds yet affords a priori ground for suspecting that they are such the implication is that while the matter composing the solar system has progressed physically from that relativelyhomogeneous state which it had as a nebula to that relativelyheterogeneous state presented by sun planets and satellites it has also progressed chemically from the relativelyhomogeneous state in which it was composed of one or a few types of matter to that relativelyheterogeneous state in which it is composed of many types of matter very diverse in their properties this deduction from the law which holds throughout the cosmos as now known to us would have much weight even were it unsupported by induction but a survey of chemical phenomena at large discloses several groups of inductive evidences supporting it  the first is that since the cooling of the earth reached an advanced stage the components of its crust have been ever increasing in heterogeneity when the socalled elements originally existing in a dissociated state united into oxides acids and other binary compounds the total number of different substances was immensely augmented the new substances were more complex than the old and their properties were more varied that is the assemblage became more heterogeneous in its kinds in the composition of each kind and in the range of chemical characters when at a later period there arose salts and other compounds of similar degrees of complexity there was again an increase of heterogeneity alike in the aggregate and in its members and when still later matters classed as organic became possible the multiformity was yet further augmented in kindred ways if then chemical evolution so far as we can trace it has been from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous may we not fairly suppose that it has been so from the beginning if from late stages in the earths history we run back and find the lines of chemical evolution continually converging until they bring us to bodies which we cannot decompose may we not suspect that could we run back these lines still further we should come to still decreasing heterogeneity in the number and nature of the substances until we reached something like homogeneity  a parallel argument may be derived from consideration of the affinities and stabilities of chemical compounds beginning with the complex nitrogenous bodies out of which living things are formed and which in the history of the earth are the most modern at the same time that they are the most heterogeneous we see that the affinities and stabilities of these are extremely small their molecules do not enter bodily into union with those of other substances so as to form more complex compounds still and their components often fail to hold together under ordinary conditions a stage lower in degree of composition we come to the vast assemblage of oxyhydrocarbons numbers of which show many and decided affinities and are stable at common temperatures passing to the inorganic group we are shown by the salts c strong affinities between their components and unions which are in many cases not very easily broken and then when we come to the oxides acids and other binary compounds we see that in many cases the elements of which they are formed when brought into the presence of one another under favourable conditions unite with violence and that many of their unions cannot be dissolved by heat alone if then as we go back from the most modern and most complex substances to the most ancient and simplest substances we see on the average a great increase in affinity and stability it results that if the same law holds with the simplest substances known to us the components of these if they are compound may be assumed to have united with affinities far more intense than any we have experience of and to cling together with tenacities far exceeding the tenacities with which chemistry acquaints us hence the existence of a class of substances which are undecomposable and therefore seem simple appears to be an implication and the corollary is that these were formed during early stages of terrestrial concentration under conditions of heat and pressure which we cannot now parallel  yet another support for the belief that the socalled elements are compounds is derived from a comparison of them considered as an aggregate ascending in their molecular weights with the aggregate of bodies known to be compound similarly considered in their ascending molecular weights contrast the binary compounds as a class with the quaternary compounds as a class the molecules constituting oxides whether alkaline or acid or neutral chlorides sulphurets c are relatively small and combining with great avidity form stable compounds on the other hand the molecules constituting nitrogenous bodies are relatively vast and are chemically inert and such combinations as their simpler types enter into cannot withstand disturbing forces now a like difference is seen if we contrast with one another the socalled elements those of relativelylow molecular weightsoxygen hydrogen potassium sodium cshow great readiness to unite among themselves and indeed many of them cannot be prevented from uniting under ordinary conditions contrariwise under ordinary conditions the substances of high molecular weightsthe noble metalsare indifferent to other substances and such compounds as they do form under conditions specially adjusted are easily destroyed thus as among the bodies we know to be compound increasing molecular weight is associated with the appearance of certain characters and as among the bodies we class as simple increasing molecular weight is associated with the appearance of similar characters the composite nature of the elements is in another way pointed to  there has to be added one further class of phenomena congruous with those above named which here specially concerns us looking generally at chemical unions we see that the heat evolved usually decreases as the degree of composition and consequent massiveness of the molecules increases in the first place we have the fact that during the formation of simple compounds the heat evolved is much greater than that which is evolved during the formation of complex compounds the elements when uniting with one another usually give out much heat while when the compounds they form are recompounded but little heat is given out and as shown by the experiments of prof andrews the heat given out during the union of acids and bases is habitually smaller where the molecular weight of the base is greater then in the second place we see that among the elements themselves the unions of those having low molecular weights result in far more heat than do the unions of those having high molecular weights if we proceed on the supposition that the socalled elements are compounds and if this law if not universal holds of undecomposable substances as of decomposable then there are two implications the one is that those compoundings and recompoundings by which the elements were formed must have been accompanied by degrees of heat exceeding any degrees of heat known to us the other is that among these compoundings and recompoundings themselves those by which the smallmoleculed elements were formed produced more intense heat than those by which the largemoleculed elements were formed the elements formed by the final recompoundings being necessarily later in origin and at the same time less stable than the earlierformed ones   note ii may we from these propositions and especially from the last draw any conclusions respecting the evolution of heat during nebular condensation and do such conclusions affect in any way the conclusions now current  in the first place it seems inferable from physicochemical facts at large that only through the instrumentality of those combinations which formed the elements did the concentration of diffused nebulous matter into concrete masses become possible if we remember that hydrogen and oxygen in their uncombined states oppose the one an insuperable and the other an almost insuperable resistance to liquefaction while when combined the compound assumes the liquid state with facility we may suspect that in like manner the simpler types of matter out of which the elements were formed could not have been reduced even to such degrees of density as the known gases show us without what we may call protochemical unions the implication being that after the heat resulting from each of such protochemical unions had escaped mutual gravitation of the parts was able to produce further condensation of the nebulous mass  if we thus distinguish between the two sources of heat accompanying nebular condensationthe heat due to protochemical combinations and that due to the contraction caused by gravitation both of them however being interpretable as consequent on loss of motion it may be inferred that they take different shares during the earlier and during the later stages of aggregation it seems probable that while the diffusion is great and the force of mutual gravitation small the chief source of heat is combination of units of matter simpler than any known to us into such units of matter as those we know while conversely when there has been reached close aggregation the chief source of heat is gravitation with consequent pressure and gradual contraction supposing this to be so let us ask what may be inferred if at the time when the nebulous spheroid from which the solar system resulted filled the orbit of neptune it had reached such a degree of density as enabled those units of matter which compose the sodium molecules to enter into combination and if in conformity with the analogies above indicated the heat evolved by this protochemical combination was great compared with the heats evolved by the chemical combinations known to us the implication is that the nebulous spheroid in the course of its contraction would have to get rid of a much larger quantity of heat than it would did it commence at any ordinary temperature and had only to lose the heat consequent on contraction that is to say in estimating the past period during which solar emission of heat has been going on at a high rate much must depend on the initial temperature assumed and this may have been rendered intense by the protochemical changes which took place in early stages21  respecting the future duration of the solar heat there must also be differences between the estimates made according as we do or do not take into account the protochemical changes which possibly have still to take place true as it may be that the quantity of heat to be emitted is measured by the quantity of motion to be lost and that this must be the same whether the approximation of the molecules is effected by chemical unions or by mutual gravitation or by both yet evidently everything must turn on the degree of condensation supposed to be eventually reached and this must in large measure depend on the natures of the substances eventually formed though by spectrumanalysis platinum has recently been detected in the solar atmosphere it seems clear that the metals of low molecular weights greatly predominate and supposing the foregoing arguments to be valid it may be inferred as not improbable that the compoundings and recompoundings by which the heavymoleculed elements are produced not hitherto possible in large measure will hereafter take place and that as a result the suns density will finally become very great in comparison with what it is now i say not hitherto possible in large measure because it is a feasible supposition that they may be formed and can continue to exist only in certain outer parts of the solar mass where the pressure is sufficiently great while the heat is not too great and if this be so the implication is that the interior body of the sun higher in temperature than its peripheral layers may consist wholly of the metals of low atomic weights and that this may be a part cause of his low specific gravity and a further implication is that when in course of time the internal temperature falls the heavymoleculed elements as they severally become capable of existing in it may arise the formation of each having an evolution of heat as its concomitant22 if so it would seem to follow that the amount of heat to be emitted by the sun and the length of the period during which the emission will go on must be taken as much greater than if the sun is supposed to be permanently constituted of the elements now predominating in him and to be capable of only that degree of condensation which such composition permits   note iii are the internal structures of celestial bodies all the same or do they differ and if they differ can we from the process of nebular condensation infer the conditions under which they assume one or other character in the foregoing essay as originally published these questions were discussed and though the conclusions reached cannot be sustained in the form given to them they foreshadow conclusions which may perhaps be sustained referring to the conceivable causes of unlike specific gravities in the members of the solar system it was said that these might be       1 differences between the kinds of matter or matters composing      them 2 differences between the quantities of matter for other      things equal the mutual gravitation of atoms will make a large      mass denser than a small one 3 differences between the      structures the masses being either solid or liquid throughout or      having central cavities filled with elastic aëriform substance of      these three conceivable causes that commonly assigned is the      first more or less modified by the second  written as this was before spectrumanalysis had made its disclosures no notice could of course be taken of the way in which these conflict with the first of the foregoing suppositions but after pointing out other objections to it the argument continued thus       however spite of these difficulties the current hypothesis is      that the sun and planets inclusive of the earth are either solid      or liquid or have solid crusts with liquid nuclei23  after saying that the familiarity of this hypothesis must not delude us into uncritical acceptance of it but that if any other hypothesis is physically possible it may reasonably be entertained it was argued that by tracing out the process of condensation in a nebulous spheroid we are led to infer the eventual formation of a molten shell with a nucleus consisting of gaseous matter at high tension the paragraph which then follows runs thus       but what it may be asked will become of this gaseous nucleus      when exposed to the enormous gravitative pressure of a shell some      thousands of miles thick how can aeriform matter withstand such a      pressure very readily it has been proved that even when the      heat generated by compression is allowed to escape some gases      remain uncondensible by any force we can produce an unsuccessful      attempt lately made in vienna to liquify oxygen clearly shows this      enormous resistance the steel piston employed was literally      shortened by the pressure used and yet the gas remained      unliquified if then the expansive force is thus immense when the      heat evolved is dissipated what must it be when that heat is in      great measure detained as in the case we are considering indeed      the experiences of m cagniard de latour have shown that gases may      under pressure acquire the density of liquids while retaining the      aeriform state provided the temperature continues extremely high      in such a case every addition to the heat is an addition to the      repulsive power of the atoms the increased pressure itself      generates an increased ability to resist and this remains true to      whatever extent the compression is carried indeed it is a      corollary from the persistence of force that if under increasing      pressure a gas retains all the heat evolved its resisting force      is absolutely unlimited hence the internal planetary structure      we have described is as physically stable a one as that commonly      assumed  had this paragraph and the subsequent paragraphs been written five years later when prof andrews had published an account of his researches the propositions they contain while rendered more specific and at the same time more defensible would perhaps have been freed from the erroneous implication that the internal structure indicated is an universal one let us while guided by prof andrews results consider what would probably be the successive changes in a condensing nebulous spheroid  prof andrews has shown that for each kind of gaseous matter there is a temperature above which no amount of pressure can cause liquefaction the remark made a priori in the above extract that if under increasing pressure a gas retains all the heat evolved its resisting force is absolutely unlimited harmonizes with the inductivelyreached result that if the temperature is not lowered to its critical point a gas does not liquify however great the force applied at the same time prof andrews experiments imply that supposing the temperature to be lowered to the point at which liquefaction becomes possible then liquefaction will take place where there is first reached the required pressure what are the corollaries in relation to concentrating nebulous spheroids  assume a spheroid of such size as will form one of the inferior planets and consisting externally of a voluminous cloudy atmosphere composed of the less condensible elements and internally of metallic gases such internal gases being kept by convectioncurrents at temperatures not very widely differing and assume that continuous radiation has brought the internal mass of metallic gases down to the critical point of the most condensible may we not say that there is a size of the spheroid such that the pressure will not be great enough to produce liquefaction at any other place than the centre or in other words that in the process of decreasing temperature and increasing pressure the centre will be the place at which the combined conditions of pressure and temperature will be first reached if so liquefaction commencing at the centre will spread thence to the periphery and in virtue of the law that solids have higher melting points under pressure than when free it may be that solidification will similarly at a later stage begin at the centre and progress outwards eventually producing in that case a state such as sir william thomson alleges exists in the earth but now suppose that instead of such a spheroid we assume one of say twenty or thirty times the mass what will then happen notwithstanding convectioncurrents the temperature at the centre must always be higher than elsewhere and in the process of cooling the critical point of temperature will sooner be reached in the outer parts though the requisite pressure will not exist near the surface there is evidently in a large spheroid a depth below the surface at which the pressure will be great enough if the temperature is sufficiently low hence it is inferable that somewhere between centre and surface in the supposed larger spheroid there will arise that state described by prof andrews in which flickering striæ of liquid float in gaseous matter of equal density and it may be inferred that gradually as the process goes on these striæ will become more abundant while the gaseous interspaces diminish until eventually the liquid becomes continuous thus there will result a molten shell containing a gaseous nucleus equally dense with itself at their surface of contact and more dense at the centrea molten shell which will slowly thicken by additions to both exterior and interior  that a solid crust will eventually form on this molten shell may be reasonably concluded to the demurrer that solidification cannot commence at the surface because the solids formed would sink there are two replies the first is that various metals expand while solidifying and therefore would float the second is that since the envelope of the supposed spheroid would consist of the gases and nonmetallic elements compounds of these with the metals and with one another would continually accumulate on the molten shell and the crust consisting of oxides chlorides sulphurets and the rest having much less specific gravity than the molten shell would be readily supported by it  clearly a planet thus constituted would be in an unstable state always it would remain liable to a catastrophe resulting from change in its gaseous nucleus if under some condition of pressure and temperature eventually reached the components of this suddenly entered into one of those protochemical combinations forming a new element there might result an explosion capable of shattering the entire planet and propelling its fragments in all directions with high velocities if the hypothetical planet between jupiter and mars was intermediate in size as in position it would apparently fulfil the conditions under which such a catastrophe might occur   note iv the argument set forth in the foregoing note is in part designed to introduce a question which seems to require reconsiderationthe origin of the minor planets or planetoids the hypothesis of olbers as propounded by him implied that the disruption of the assumed planet between mars and jupiter had taken place at no very remote period in the past and this implication was shown to be inadmissible by the discovery that there exists no such point of intersection of the orbits of the planetoids as the hypothesis requires the inquiry whether in the past there was any nearer approach to a point of intersection than at present having resulted in a negative it is held that the hypothesis must be abandoned it is however admitted that the mutual perturbations of the planetoids themselves would suffice in the course of some millions of years to destroy all traces of a place of intersection of their orbits if it once existed but if this be admitted why need the hypothesis be abandoned given such duration of the solar system as is currently assumed there seems no reason why lapse of a few millions of years should present any difficulty the explosion may as well have taken place ten million years ago as at any more recent period and whoever grants this must grant that the probability of the hypothesis has to be estimated from other data  as a preliminary to closer consideration let us ask what may be inferred from the rate of discovery of the planetoids and from the sizes of those most recently discovered in 1878 prof newcomb arguing that the preponderance of evidence is on the side of the number and magnitude being limited says that the newly discovered ones do not seem on the average to be materially smaller than those which were discovered ten years ago and further that the new ones will probably be found to grow decidedly rare before another hundred are discovered now inspection of the tables contained in the justpublished fourth edition of chambers descriptive astronomy vol i shows that whereas the planetoids discovered in 1868 the year prof newcomb singles out for comparison have an average magnitude of 11·56 those discovered last year 1888 have an average magnitude of 12·43 further it is observable that though more than ninety have been discovered since prof newcomb wrote they have by no means become rare the year 1888 having added ten to the list and having therefore maintained the average rate of the preceding ten years if then the indications prof newcomb names had they arisen would have implied a limitation of the number these opposite indications imply that the number is unlimited the reasonable conclusion appears to be that these minor planets are to be counted not by hundreds but by thousands that more powerful telescopes will go on revealing still smaller ones and that additions to the list will cease only when the smallness ends in invisibility  commencing now to scrutinize the two hypotheses respecting the genesis of these multitudinous bodies i may first remark concerning that of laplace that he might possibly not have propounded it had he known that instead of four such bodies there are hundreds if not thousands the supposition that they resulted from the breaking up of a nebulous ring into numerous small portions instead of its collapse into one mass might not in such case have seemed to him so probable it would have appeared still less probable had he been aware of all that has since been discovered concerning the wide differences of the orbits in size their various and often great eccentricities and their various and often great inclinations let us look at these and other incongruous traits of them  1 between the greatest and least mean distances of the planetoids there is a space of 200 millions of miles so that the whole of the earths orbit might be placed between the limits of the zone occupied and leave 7 millions of miles on either side add to which that the widest excursions of the planetoids occupy a zone of 270 millions of miles had the rings from which mercury venus and the earth were formed been onesixth of the smaller width or oneninth of the greater they would have united there would have been no nebulous rings at all but a continuous disk nay more since one of the planetoids trenches upon the orbit of mars it follows that the nebulous ring out of which the planetoids were formed must have overlapped that out of which mars was formed how do these implications consist with the nebular hypothesis 2 the tacit assumption usually made is that the different parts of a nebulous ring have the same angular velocities though this assumption may not be strictly true yet it seems scarcely likely that it is so widely untrue as it would be had the inner part of the ring an angular velocity nearly thrice that of the outer yet this is implied while the period of thule is 88 years the period of medusa is 3·1 years 3 the eccentricity of jupiters orbit is 0·04816 and the eccentricity of mars orbit is 0·09311 estimated by groups of the first found and last found of the planetoids the average eccentricity of the assemblage is about three times that of jupiter and more than one and a half times that of mars and among the members of the assemblage themselves some have an eccentricity thirtyfive times that of others how came this nebulous zone out of which it is supposed the planetoids arose to have originated eccentricities so divergent from one another as well as from those of the neighbouring planets 4 a like question may be asked respecting the inclinations of the orbits the average inclination of the planetoidorbits is four times the inclination of mars orbit and six times the inclination of jupiters orbit and among the planetoidorbits themselves the inclinations of some are fifty times those of others how are all these differences to be accounted for on the hypothesis of genesis from a nebulous ring 5 much greater becomes the difficulty on inquiring how these extremely unlike eccentricities and inclinations came to coexist before the parts of the nebulous ring separated and how they survived after the separation were all the great eccentricities displayed by the outermost members of the group and the small by the innermost members and were the inclinations so distributed that the orbits having much belonged to one part of the group and those having little to another part of the group the difficulty of explanation might not be insuperable but the arrangement is by no means this the orbits are to use an expressive word miscellaneously jumbled hence if we go back to the nebulous ring there presents itself the questionhow came each planetoidforming portion of nebulous matter when it gathered itself together and separated to have a motion round the sun differing so much from the motions of its neighbours in eccentricity and inclination and there presents itself the further questionhow during the time when it was concentrating into a planetoid did it manage to jostle its way through all the differentlymoving like masses of nebulous matter and yet to preserve its individuality answers to these questions are it seems to me not even imaginable                                       turn we now to the alternative hypothesis during revision of the foregoing essay in preparation for that edition of the volume containing it which was published in 1883 there occurred the thought that some light on the origin of the planetoids ought to be obtained by study of their distributions and movements if as olbers supposed they resulted from the bursting of a planet once revolving in the region they occupy the implications arefirst that the fragments must be most abundant in the space immediately about the original orbit and less abundant far away from it second that the large fragments must be relatively few while of smaller fragments the numbers will increase as the sizes decrease third that as some among the smaller fragments will be propelled further than any of the larger the widest deviations in mean distance from the mean distance of the original planet will be presented by the smallest members of the assemblage and fourth that the orbits differing most from the rest in eccentricity and in inclination will be among those of these smallest members in the fourth edition of chamberss handbook of descriptive and practical astronomy the first volume of which has just been issued there is a list of the elements extracted and adapted from the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch for 1890 of all the small planets 281 in number which had been discovered up to the end of 1888 the apparent brightness as expressed in equivalent starmagnitudes is the only index we have to the probable comparative sizes of by far the largest number of the planetoids the exceptions being among those first discovered thus much premised let us take the above points in order 1 there is a region lying between 2·50 and 2·80 in terms of the earths mean distance from the sun where the planetoids are found in maximum abundance the mean between these extremes 2·65 is nearly the same as the average of the distances of the four largest and earliestknown of these bodies which amounts to 2·64 may we not say that the thick clustering about this distance which is however rather less than that assigned for the original planet by bodes empirical law in contrast with the wide scattering of the comparatively few whose distances are little more than 2 or exceed 3 is a fact in accordance with the hypothesis in question24 2 any table which gives the apparent magnitudes of the planetoids shows at once how much the number of the smaller members of the assemblage exceeds that of those which are comparatively large and every succeeding year has emphasized this contrast more strongly only one of them vesta exceeds in brightness the seventh starmagnitude while one other ceres is between the seventh and eighth and a third pallas is above the eighth but between the eighth and ninth there are six between the ninth and tenth twenty between the tenth and eleventh fiftyfive below the eleventh a much larger number is known and the number existing is probably far greatera conclusion we cannot doubt when the difficulty of finding the very faint members of the family visible only in the largest telescopes is considered 3 kindred evidence is furnished if we broadly contrast their mean distances out of the 13 largest planetoids whose apparent brightnesses exceed that of a star of the 9·5 magnitude there is not one having a mean distance that exceeds 3 of those having magnitudes at least 9·5 and smaller than 10 there are 15 and of these one only has a mean distance greater than 3 of those between 10 and 10·5 there are 17 and of these also there is one exceeding 3 in mean distance in the next group there are 37 and of these 5 have this great mean distance the next group 48 contains 12 such the next 47 contains 13 such of those of the twelfth magnitude and fainter 72 planetoids have been discovered and of those of them of which the orbits have been computed no fewer than 23 have a mean distance exceeding 3 in terms of the earths it is evident from this how comparatively erratic are the fainter members of the extensive family with which we are dealing 4 to illustrate the next point it may be noted that among the planetoids whose sizes have been approximately measured the orbits of the two largest vesta and ceres have eccentricities falling between 05 and 10 whilst the orbits of the two smallest menippe and eva have eccentricities falling between 20 and 25 and between 30 and 35 and then among those more recently discovered having diameters so small that measurement of them has not been practicable come the extremely erratic oneshilda and thule which have mean distances of 397 and 425 respectively Æthra having an orbit so eccentric that it cuts the orbit of mars and medusa which has the smallest mean distance from the sun of any 5 if the average eccentricities of the orbits of the planetoids grouped according to their decreasing sizes are compared no very definite results are disclosed excepting this that the eight polyhymnia atalanta eurydice Æthra eva andromache istria and eudora which have the greatest eccentricities falling between 30 and 38 are all among those of smallest starmagnitudes nor when we consider the inclinations of the orbits do we meet with obvious verifications since the proportion of highlyinclined orbits among the smaller planetoids does not appear to be greater than among the others but consideration shows that there are two ways in which these last comparisons are vitiated one is that the inclinations are measured from the plane of the ecliptic instead of being measured from the plane of the orbit of the hypothetical planet the other and more important one is that the search for planetoids has naturally been carried on in that comparatively narrow zone within which most of their orbits fall and that consequently those having the most highlyinclined orbits are the least likely to have been detected especially if they are at the same time among the smallest moreover considering the general relation between the inclination of planetoid orbits and their eccentricities it is probable that among the orbits of these undetected planetoids are many of the most eccentric but while recognizing the incompleteness of the evidence it seems to me that it goes far to justify the hypothesis of olbers and is quite incongruous with that of laplace and as having the same meanings let me not omit the remarkable fact concerning the planetoids discovered by darrest that if their orbits are figured under the form of material rings these rings will be found so entangled that it would be possible by means of one among them taken at hazard to lift up all the resta fact incongruous with laplaces hypothesis which implies an approximate concentricity but quite congruous with the hypothesis of an exploded planet  next to be considered come phenomena the bearings of which on the question before us are scarcely consideredi mean those presented by meteors and shooting stars the natures and distributions of these harmonize with the hypothesis of an exploded planet and i think with no other hypothesis the theory of volcanic origin joined with the remark that the sun emits jets which might propel them with adequate velocities seems quite untenable such meteoric bodies as have descended to us forbid absolutely the supposition of solar origin nor can they rationally be ascribed to planetary volcanoes even were their mineral characters appropriate which many of them are not for volcanoes do not eject iron no planetary volcanoes could propel them with anything like the implied velocitycould no more withstand the tremendous force to be assumed than could a cardboard gun the force behind a rifle bullet but that their mineral characters various as they are harmonize with the supposition that they were derived from the crust of a planet is manifest and that the bursting of a planet might give to them and to shooting stars the needful velocities is a reasonable conclusion along with those larger fragments of the crust constituting the known planetoids varying from some 200 miles in diameter to little over a dozen there would be sent out still more multitudinous portions of the crust decreasing in size as they increased in number and while there would thus result such masses as occasionally fall through the earths atmosphere to its surface there would in an accompanying process be an adequate cause for the myriads of far smaller masses which as shooting stars are dissipated in passing through the earths atmosphere let us figure to ourselves as well as we may the process of explosion  assume that the diameter of the missing planet was 20000 miles that its solid crust was a thousand miles thick that under this came a shell of molten metallic matter which was another thousand miles thick and that the space 16000 miles in diameter within this was occupied by the equally dense mass of gases above the critical point which entering into a protochemical combination caused the destroying explosion the primary fissures in the crust must have been far apartprobably averaging distances between them as great as the thickness of the crust supposing them approximately equidistant there would in the equatorial periphery be between 60 and 70 fissures by the time the primary fragments thus separated had been heaved a mile outwards the fissures formed would severally have at the surface a width of 170 odd yards of course these great masses as soon as they moved would themselves begin to fall in pieces especially at their bounding surfaces but passing over the resulting complications we see that when the masses had been propelled 10 miles outwards the fissures between them would be each a mile wide notwithstanding the enormous forces at work an appreciable interval would elapse before these vast portions of the crust could be put in motion with any considerable velocities perhaps the estimate will be under the mark if we assume that it took 10 seconds to propel them through the first mile and that by implication at the end of 20 seconds they had travelled 4 miles and at the end of 30 seconds 9 miles supposing this granted let us ask what would be taking place in each intervening fissure a thousand miles deep which in the space of half a minute had opened out to nearly a mile wide and in the subsequent half minute to a chasm approaching 3 miles in width there would first be propelled through it enormous jets of the molten metals composing the internal liquid shell and these would part into relatively small masses as they were shot into space presently as the chasm opened to some miles in width the molten metals would begin to be followed by the equally dense gaseous matter behind and the two would rush out together soon the gases predominating would carry with them the portions of the liquid shell continually collapsing until the blast became one filled with millions of small masses billions of smaller masses and trillions of drops these would be driven into space in a stream the emission of which would continue for many seconds or even several minutes remembering the rate of motion of the jets emitted from the solar surface and supposing that the blasts produced by this explosion reached only onetenth of that rate these myriads of small masses and drops would be propelled with planetary velocities and in approximately the same direction i say approximately because they would be made to deviate somewhat by the friction and irregularities of the chasm passed through and also by the rotation of the planet observe however that though they would all have immense velocities their velocities would not be equal during its earlier stages the blast would be considerably retarded by the resistance which the sides of its channel offered when this became relatively small the velocity of the blast would reach its maximum from which it would decline when the space for emission became very wide and the pressure behind consequently less hence these almost infinitely numerous particles of planetspray as we might call it as well as those formed by the condensation of the metallic vapours accompanying them would forthwith begin to part company some going rapidly in advance and others falling behind until the stream of them perpetually elongating formed an orbit round the sun or rather an assemblage of innumerable orbits separating widely at aphelion and perihelion but approximating midway where they might fall within a space of say some two millions of miles as do the orbits of the november meteors at a later stage of the explosion when the large masses having moved far outwards had also fallen to pieces of every size from that of vesta to that of an aerolite and when the channels just described had ceased to exist the contents of the planet would disperse themselves with lower velocities and without any unity of direction hence we see causes alike for the streams of shooting stars for the solitary shooting stars visible to the naked eye and for the telescopic shooting stars a score times more numerous  further significant evidence is furnished by the comets of short periods of the thirteen constituting this group twelve have orbits falling between those of mars and jupiter one only having its aphelion beyond the orbit of jupiter that is to say nearly all of them frequent the same region as the planetoids by implication they are similarly associated in respect of their periods the periods of the planetoids range from 31 to 88 years and all these twelve comets have periods falling between these extremes the least being 329 and the greatest 886 once more this family of comets like the planetoids in the zone they occupy and like them in their periods are like them also in the respect that as mr lynn has pointed out their motions are all direct how happens this close kinshiphow happens there to be this family of comets so much like the planetoids and so much like one another but so unlike comets at large the obvious suggestion is that they are among the products of the explosion which originated the planetoids the aerolites and the streams of meteors and consideration of the probable circumstances shows us that such products might be expected if the hypothetical planet was like its neighbour jupiter in having an atmosphere or like its neighbour mars in having water on its surface or like both in these respects then these superficial masses of liquid of vapour and of gas blown into space along with the solid matters would yield the materials for comets there would result too comets unlike one another in constitution if a fissure opened beneath one of the seas the molten metals and metallic gases rushing through it as above described would decompose part of the water carried with them and the oxygen and hydrogen liberated would be mingled with undecomposed vapour in other cases portions of the atmosphere might be propelled probably with portions of vapour and in yet other cases masses of water alone severally subject to great heat at perihelion these would behave more or less differently once more it would ordinarily happen that detached swarms of meteors projected as implied would carry with them masses of vapours and gases whence would result the cometic constitution now insisted on and sometimes there would be like accompaniments to meteoric streams  see then the contrast between the two hypotheses that of laplace looking probable while there were only four planetoids but decreasing in apparent likelihood as the planetoids increase in number until as they pass through the hundreds on their way to the thousands it becomes obviously improbable is at the same time otherwise objectionable it presupposes a nebulous ring of a width so enormous that it would have overlapped the ring of mars this ring would have had differences between the angular velocities of its parts quite inconsistent with the nebular hypothesis the average eccentricities of the orbits of its parts must have differed greatly from those of adjacent orbits and the average inclinations of the orbits of its parts must similarly have differed greatly from those of adjacent orbits once more the orbits of its parts confusedly interspersed must have had varieties of eccentricity and inclination unaccountable in portions of the same nebulous ring and during concentration into planetoids each must have had to maintain its course while struggling through the assemblage of other small nebulous masses severally moving in ways unlike its own on the other hand the hypothesis of an exploded planet is supported by every increase in the number of planetoids discovered by the greater numbers of the smaller sizes by the thicker clustering near the inferred place of the missing planet by the occurrence of the greatest mean distances among the smallest members of the assemblage by the occurrence of the greatest eccentricities in the orbits of these smallest members and by the entanglement of all the orbits further support for the hypothesis is yielded by aerolites so various in their kinds but all suggestive of a planets crust by the streams of shooting stars having their radiant points variously placed in the heavens and also by the solitary shooting stars visible to the naked eye and the more numerous ones visible through telescopes once more it harmonizes with the discovery of a family of comets twelve out of thirteen of which have mean distances falling within the zone of the planetoids have similarly associated periods have all the same direct motions and are connected with swarms of meteors and with meteoric streams may we not indeed say that if there once existed a planet between mars and jupiter which burst the explosion must have produced just such clusters of bodies and classes of phenomena as we actually find  and what is the objection merely that if such an explosion occurred it must have occurred many millions of years agoan objection which is in fact no objection for the supposition that the explosion occurred many millions of years ago is just as reasonable as the supposition that it occurred recently  it is indeed further objected that some of the resulting fragments ought to have retrograde motions it turns out on calculation however that this is not the case assuming as true the velocity which lagrange estimated would have sufficed to give the four chief planetoids the positions they occupy it results that such a velocity given to the fragments which were propelled backwards by the explosion would not have given them retrograde motions but would simply have reduced their direct motions from something over 11 miles per second to about 6 miles per second it is however manifest that this reduction of velocity would have necessitated the formation of highlyelliptic orbitsmore elliptic than any of those at present known this seems to me the most serious difficulty which has presented itself still considering that there remain probably an immense number of planetoids to be discovered it is quite possible that among these there may be some having orbits answering to the requirement   note v shortly before i commenced the revision of the foregoing essay friends on two occasions named to me some remarkable photographs of nebulæ recently obtained by mr isaac roberts and exhibited at the royal astronomical society saying that they presented appearances such as might have been sketched by laplace in illustration of his hypothesis mr roberts has been kind enough to send me copies of the photographs in question and sundry others illustrative of stellar evolution those representing the great nebulæ in andromeda and canum venaticorum as well as 81 messier are at once impressive and instructiveillustrating as they do the genesis of nebulous rings round a central mass  i may remark however that they seem to suggest the need for some modification of the current conception since they make it tolerably clear that the process is a much less uniform one than is supposed the usual idea is that a vast rotating nebulous spheroid arises before there are produced any of the planetforming rings but both of these photographs apparently imply that in some cases at any rate the portions of nebulous matter composing the rings take shape before they reach the central mass it looks as though these partiallyformed annuli must be prevented by their acquired motions from approaching even very near to the stillirregular body they surround  be this as it may however and be the dimensions of the incipient systems what they may and it would seem to be a necessary implication that they are vastly larger than our solar system the process remains essentially the same practically demonstrated as this process now is we may say that the doctrine of nebular genesis passes from the region of hypothesis into the region of established truth  footnotes  footnote 21 of course there remains the question whether before the stage here recognized there had already been produced a high temperature by those collisions of celestial masses which reduced the matter to a nebulous form as suggested in first principles § 136 in the edition of 1862 and § 182 in subsequent editions there must after there have been effected all those minor dissolutions which follow evolutions remain to be effected the dissolutions of the great bodies in and on which the minor evolutions and dissolutions have taken place and it was argued that such dissolutions will be at some time or other effected by those immense transformations of molar motion into molecular motion consequent on collisions the argument being based on the statement of sir john herschel that in clusters of stars collisions must inevitably occur it may however be objected that though such a result may be reasonably looked for in closely aggregated assemblages of stars it is difficult to conceive of its taking place throughout our sidereal system at large the members of which and their intervals may be roughly figured as pinsheads 50 miles apart it would seem that something like an eternity must elapse before by ethereal resistance or other cause these can be brought into proximity great enough to make collisions probable  footnote 22 the two sentences which in the text precede the asterisk i have introduced while these pages are standing in type being led to do so by the perusal of some notes kindly lent to me by prof dewar containing the outline of a lecture he gave at the royal institution during the session of 1880 discussing the conditions under which if our socalled elements are compounded of elemental matter they may have been formed prof dewar arguing from the known habitudes of compound substances concludes that the formation is in each case a function of pressure temperature and nature of the environing gases  footnote 23 at the date of this passage the established teleology made it seem needful to assume that all the planets are habitable and that even beneath the photosphere of the sun there exists a dark body which may be the scene of life but since then the influence of teleology has so far diminished that this hypothesis can no longer be called the current one  footnote 24 it may here be mentioned though the principal significance of this comes under the next head that the average mean distance of the laterdiscovered planetoids is somewhat greater than that of these earlierdiscovered amounting to 2·61 for nos 1 to 35 and 2·80 for nos 211 to 245 for this observation i am indebted to mr lynn whose attention was drawn to it while revising for me the statements contained in this paragraph so as to include discoveries made since the paragraph was written     the constitution of the sun      first published in the reader for february 25 1865 i     reproduce this essay chiefly to give a place to the speculation     concerning the solar spots which forms the latter portion of it   the hypothesis of m faye described in your numbers for january 28 and february 4 respectively is to a considerable extent coincident with one which i ventured to suggest in an article on recent astronomy and the nebular hypothesis published in the westminster review for july 1858 in considering the possible causes of the immense differences of specific gravity among the planets i was led to question the validity of the tacit assumption that each planet consists of solid or liquid matter from centre to surface it seemed to me that any other internal structure which was mechanically stable might be assumed with equal legitimacy and the hypothesis of a solid or liquid shell having its cavity filled with gaseous matter at high pressure and temperature and of great density was one which seemed worth considering  hence arose the inquirywhat structure will result from the process of nebular condensation here followed a long speculation respecting the processes going on in a concentrating nebulous spheroid the general outcome of which is implied in note iii of the foregoing essay i do not reproduce it because not having the guidance of prof andrews researches i had concluded that the formation of a molten shell would occur universally instead of occasionally as is now argued in the note named the essay then proceeded thus  the process of condensation being in its essentials the same for all concentrating nebular spheroids planetary or solar it was argued that the sun is still passing through that incandescent stage which all the planets have long ago passed through his later aggregation joined with the immensely greater ratio of his mass to his surface involving comparative lateness of cooling supposing the sun to have reached the state of a molten shell inclosing a gaseous nucleus it was concluded that this molten shell ever radiating its heat but ever acquiring fresh heat by further integration of the suns mass must be constantly kept up to that temperature at which its substance evaporates  here followed part of the paragraph quoted in the preceding essay on p 155 and there succeeded in subsequent editions a paragraph aiming to show that the inferred structure of the suns interior was congruous with the low specific gravity of the suna conclusion which as indicated on p 156 implies some very problematical assumptions respecting the natures of the unknown elements of the sun there then came this passage  the conception of the suns constitution thus set forth is like that of m faye in so far as the successive changes the resulting structures and the ultimate state are concerned but unlike it in so far as the sun is supposed to have reached a later stage of concentration as i gather from your abstract of m fayes paper this referred to an article in the reader he considers the sun to be at present a gaseous spheroid having an envelope of metallic matters precipitated in the shape of luminous clouds the local dispersions of which caused by currents from within appear to us as spots and he looks forward to the future formation of a liquid film as an event that will soon be followed by extinction whereas the above hypothesis is that the liquid film already exists beneath the visible photosphere and that extinction cannot result until in the course of further aggregation the gaseous nucleus has become so much reduced and the shell so much thickened that the escape of the heat generated is greatly retarded m fayes hypothesis appears to be espoused by him partly because it affords an explanation of the spots which are considered as openings in the photosphere exposing the comparatively nonluminous gases filling the interior but if these interior gases are nonluminous from the absence of precipitated matter must they not for the same reason be transparent and if transparent will not the light from the remote side of the photosphere seen through them be nearly as bright as that of the side next to us by as much as the intenselyheated gases of the interior are disabled by the dissociation of their molecules from giving off luminiferous undulations by so much must they be disabled from absorbing the light transmitted through them and if their great lighttransmitting power is exactly complementary to their small lightemitting power there seems no reason why the interior of the sun disclosed to us by openings in the photosphere should not appear as bright as its exterior  take on the other hand the supposition that a more advanced state of concentration has been reached a shell of molten metallic matter enclosing a gaseous nucleus still higher in temperature than itself will be continually kept at the highest temperature consistent with its state of liquid aggregation unless we assume that simple radiation suffices to give off all the heat generated by progressing integration we must conclude that the mass will be raised to that temperature at which part of its heat is absorbed in vaporizing its superficial parts the atmosphere of metallic gases hence resulting cannot continue to accumulate without reaching a height above the suns surface at which the cooling due to radiation and rarefaction will cause condensation into cloudcannot indeed cease accumulating until the precipitation from the upper limit of the atmosphere balances the evaporation from its lower limit this upper limit of the atmosphere of metallic gases whence precipitation is perpetually taking place will form the visible photospherepartly giving off light of its own partly letting through the more brilliant light of the incandescent mass below this conclusion harmonizes with the appearances sir john herschel advocating though he does an antagonist hypothesis gives a description of the suns surface which agrees completely with the processes here supposed he says       there is nothing which represents so faithfully this appearance as      the slow subsidence of some flocculent chemical precipitates in a      transparent fluid when viewed perpendicularly from above so      faithfully indeed that it is hardly possible not to be impressed      with the idea of a luminous medium intermixed but not confounded      with a transparent and nonluminous atmosphere either floating as      clouds in our air or pervading it in vast sheets and columns like      flame or the streamers of our northern lightstreatise on      astronomy p 208  if the constitution of the sun be that which is above inferred it does not seem difficult to conceive still more specifically the production of these appearances everywhere throughout the atmosphere of metallic vapours which clothes the solar surface there must be ascending and descending currents the magnitude of these currents must obviously depend on the depth of this atmosphere if it is shallow the currents must be small but if many thousands of miles deep the currents may be wide enough to render visible to us the places at which they severally impinge on the limit of the atmosphere and the places whence the descending currents commence the top of an ascending current will be a space over which the thickness of condensed cloud is the least and through which the greatest amount of light from beneath penetrates the clouds perpetually formed at the top of such a current will be perpetually thrust aside by the uncondensed gases from below them and growing while they are thrust aside will collect in the spaces between the ascending currents where there will result the greatest degree of opacity hence the mottled appearancehence the pores or dark interspaces separating the lightgiving spots25  of the more special appearances which the photosphere presents let us take first the faculæ these are ascribed to waves in the photosphere and the way in which such waves might produce an excess of light has been variously explained in conformity with various hypotheses what would result from them in a photosphere constituted and conditioned as above supposed traversing a canopy of cloud here thicker and there thinner a wave would cause a disturbance very unlikely to leave the thin and thick parts without any change in their average permeability to light there would probably be at some parts of the wave extensions in the areas of the lighttransmitting clouds resulting in the passage of more rays from below another phenomenon less common but more striking appears also to be in harmony with the hypothesis i refer to those bright spots of a brilliancy greater than that of the photosphere which are sometimes observed in the course of a physical process so vast and so active as that here supposed to be going on in the sun we may expect that concurrent causes will occasionally produce ascending currents much hotter than usual or more voluminous or both one of these on reaching the stratum of luminous and illuminated cloud forming the photosphere will burst through it dispersing and dissolving it and ascending to a greater height before it begins itself to condense meanwhile allowing to be seen through its transparent mass the incandescent molten shell of the suns body  the foregoing passages to most of which i do not commit myself as more than possibilities i republish chiefly as introductory to the following speculation which since it was propounded in 1865 has met with some acceptance  but what of the spots commonly so called it will be asked in the essay on the nebular hypothesis above quoted from it was suggested that refraction of the light passing through the depressed centres of cyclones in this atmosphere of metallic gases might possibly be the cause but this though defensible as a true cause appeared on further consideration to be an inadequate cause keeping the question in mind however and still taking as a postulate the conclusion of sir john herschel that the spots are in some way produced by cyclones i was led in the course of the year following the publication of the essay to an hypothesis which seemed more satisfactory this which i named at the time to prof tyndall had a point in common with the one afterward published by prof kirchhoff in so far as it supposed cloud to be the cause of darkness but differed in so far as it assigned the cause of such cloud more pressing matters prevented me from developing the idea for some time and afterwards i was deterred from including it in the revised edition of the essay by its inconsistency with the willowleaf doctrine at that time dominant the reasoning was as followsthe central region of a cyclone must be a region of rarefaction and consequently a region of refrigeration in an atmosphere of metallic gases rising from a molten surface and presently reaching a limit at which condensation takes place the molecular state especially toward its upper part must be such that a moderate diminution of density and fall of temperature will cause precipitation that is to say the rarefied interior of a solar cyclone will be filled with cloud condensation instead of taking place only at the level of the photosphere will here extend to a great depth below it and over a wide area what will be the characters of a cloud thus occupying the interior of a cyclone it will have a rotatory motion and this it has been seen to have being funnelshaped as analogy warrants us in assuming its central parts will be much deeper than its peripheral parts and therefore more opaque this too corresponds with observation mr dawes has discovered that in the middle of the spot there is a blacker spot just where there would exist a funnelshaped prolongation of the cyclonic cloud down toward the suns body the darkness is greater than elsewhere moreover there is furnished an adequate reason for the depression which one of these dark spaces exhibits in a whirlwind as in a whirlpool the vortex will be below the general level and all around the surface of the medium will descend toward it hence a spot seen obliquely as when carried toward the suns limb will have its umbra more and more hidden while its penumbra still remains visible nor are we without some interpretation of the penumbra if as is implied by what has been said the socalled willowleaves or ricegrains are the tops of the currents ascending from the suns body what changes of appearance are they likely to undergo in the neighbourhood of a cyclone for some distance round a cyclone there will be a drawing in of the superficial gases toward the vortex all the luminous spaces of more transparent cloud forming the adjacent photosphere will be changed in shape by these centripetal currents they will be greatly elongated and there will so be produced that thatchlike aspect which the penumbra presents                                       the explanation of the solar spots above suggested which was originally propounded in opposition to that of m faye was eventually adopted by him in place of his own in the comptes rendus for 1867 vol lxiv p 404 he refers to the article in the reader partly reproduced above and speaks of me as having been replied to in a previous note again in the comptes rendus for 1872 vol lxxv p 1664 he recognizes the inadequacy of his hypothesis sayingil est certain que lobjection de m spencer reproduit et développée par m kirchoff est fondée jusquà un certain point lintérieur des taches si ce sont des lacunes dans la photosphère doit être froid relativement il est donc impossible quelles proviennent déruptions ascendantes he then proceeds to set forth the hypothesis that the spots are caused by the precipitation of vapour in the interiors of cyclones but though as above shown he refers to the objection made in the foregoing essay to his original hypothesis and recognizes its cogency he does not say that the hypothesis which he thereupon substitutes is also to be found in the foregoing essay nor does he intimate this in the elaborate paper on the subject read before the french association for the advancement of science and published in the revue scientifique for the 24th march 1883 the result is that the hypothesis is now currently ascribed to him26  about four months before i had to revise this essay on the constitution of the sun while staying near pewsey in wiltshire i was fortunate enough to witness a phenomenon which furnished by analogy a verification of the above hypothesis and served more especially to elucidate one of the traits of solar spots otherwise difficult to understand it was at the close of august when there had been a spell of very hot weather a slight current of air from the west moving along the line of the valley had persisted through the day which up to 5 oclock had been cloudless and with the exception now to be named remained cloudless the exception was furnished by a strangelooking cloud almost directly overhead its central part was comparatively dense and structureless its peripheral part or to speak strictly the twothirds of it which were nearest and most clearly visible consisted of converging streaks of comparatively thin cloud possibly the third part on the remoter side was similarly constituted but this i could not see it did not occur to me at the time to think about its cause though had the question been raised i should doubtless have concluded that as the sky still remained cloudless everywhere else this precipitated mass of vapour must have resulted from a local eddy in the space of perhaps halfanhour the gentle breeze had carried this cloud some miles to the east and now its nature became obvious that central part which seen from underneath seemed simply a dense confused part apparently no nearer than the rest now seen sideways was obviously much lower than the rest and rudely funnelshapednippleshaped one might say while the wide thin portion of cloud above it was diskshaped the converging streaks of cloud being now in perspective merged together it thus became manifest that the cloud was produced by a feeble whirlwind perhaps a quarter to halfamile in diameter further the appearances made it clear that this feeble whirlwind was limited to the lower stratum of air the stratum of air above it was not implicated in the cyclonic action and then lastly there was the striking fact that the upper stratum though not involved in the whirl was by its proximity to a region of diminished pressure slightly rarified and that its precipitated vapour was by the draught set up towards the vortex below drawn into converging streaks here then was an action analogous to that which as above suggested happens around a sunspot where the masses of illuminated vapour constituting the photosphere are drawn towards the vortex of the cyclone and simultaneously elongated into striæ so forming the penumbra at the same time there was furnished an answer to the chief objection to the cyclonic theory of solar spots for if as here seen a cyclone in a lower stratum may fail to communicate a vortical motion to the stratum above it we may comprehend how in a solar cyclone the photosphere commonly fails to give any indication of the revolving currents below and is only occasionally so entangled in these currents as itself to display a vortical motion  let me add that apart from the elucidations furnished by the phenomenon above described the probabilities are greatly in favour of the cyclonic origin of the solar spots that some of them exhibit clear marks of vortical motion is undeniable and if this is so the question ariseswhat is the degree of likelihood that there are two causes for spots considering that they have so many characters in common it is extremely improbable that their common characters are in some cases the concomitants of vortical motion and in other cases the concomitants of a different kind of action recognizing this great improbability even in the absence of a reconciliation between the apparently conflicting traits it is i think clear that when in the way above shown we are enabled to understand how it happens that the vortical motion not ordinarily implicating the photosphere may consequently be in most cases unapparent the reasons for accepting the cyclonic theory become almost conclusive  footnotes  footnote 25 if the ricegrain appearance is thus produced by the tops of the ascending currents and m faye accepts this interpretation then i think it excludes m fayes hypothesis that the sun is gaseous throughout the comparative smallness of the lightgiving spots and their comparative uniformity of size show us that they have ascended through a stratum of but moderate depth say 10000 miles and that this stratum has a definite lower limit this favours the hypothesis of a molten shell  footnote 26 i should add that while m faye ascribes solar spots to clouds formed within cyclones we differ concerning the nature of the cloud i have argued that it is formed by rarefaction and consequent refrigeration of the metallic gases constituting the stratum in which the cyclone exists he argues that it is formed within the mass of cooled hydrogen drawn from the chromosphere into the vortex of the cyclone speaking of the cyclones he saysdans leur embouchure évasée ils entraîneront lhydrogène froid de la chromosphère produisant partout sur leur trajet vertical un abaissement notable de température et une obscurité relative due à lopacité de lhydrogène froid englouti revue scientifique 24 march 1883 considering the intense cold required to reduce hydrogen to the critical point it is a strong supposition that the motion given to it by fluid friction on entering the vortex of the cyclone can produce a rotation rarefaction and cooling great enough to produce precipitation in a region so intensely heated     illogical geology      first published in the universal review for july 1859   that proclivity to generalization which is possessed in greater or less degree by all minds and without which indeed intelligence cannot exist has unavoidable inconveniences through it alone can truth be reached and yet it almost inevitably betrays into error but for the tendency to predicate of every other case that which has been found in the observed cases there could be no rational thinking and yet by this indispensable tendency men are perpetually led to found on limited experience propositions which they wrongly assume to be universal or absolute in one sense however this can scarcely be regarded as an evil for without premature generalizations the true generalization would never be arrived at if we waited till all the facts were accumulated before trying to formulate them the vast unorganized mass would be unmanageable only by provisional grouping can they be brought into such order as to be dealt with and this provisional grouping is but another name for premature generalization how uniformly men follow this course and how needful the errors are as steps to truth is well illustrated in the history of astronomy the heavenly bodies move round the earth in circles said the earliest observers led partly by the appearances and partly by their experiences of central motions in terrestrial objects with which as all circular they classed the celestial motions from lack of any alternative conception without this provisional belief wrong as it was there could not have been that comparison of positions which showed that the motions are not representable by circles and which led to the hypothesis of epicycles and eccentrics only by the aid of this hypothesis equally untrue but capable of accounting more nearly for the appearances and so of inducing more accurate observationsonly thus did it become possible for copernicus to show that the heliocentric theory is more feasible than the geocentric theory or for kepler to show that the planets move round the sun in ellipses yet again without the aid of keplers more advanced theory of the solar system newton could not have established that general law from which it follows that the motion of a heavenly body is not necessarily in an ellipse but may be in any conic section and lastly it was only after the law of gravitation had been verified that it became possible to determine the actual courses of planets satellites and comets and to prove that in consequence of perturbations their orbits always deviate more or less from regular curves in these successive theories we may trace both the tendency men have to leap from scanty data to wide generalizations that are either untrue or but partially true and the necessity there is for such transitional generalizations as steps to the final one  in the progress of geological speculation the same laws of thought are displayed we have dogmas that were more than half false passing current for a time as universal truths we have evidence collected in proof of these dogmas by and by a colligation of facts in antagonism with them and eventually a consequent modification in conformity with this improved hypothesis we have a better classification of facts a greater power of arranging and interpreting the new facts now rapidly gathered together and further resulting corrections of hypothesis being as we are at present in the midst of this process it is not possible to give an adequate account of the development of geological science as thus regarded the earlier stages are alone known to us not only however is it interesting to observe how the more advanced views now received respecting the earths history have been evolved out of the crude views which preceded them but we shall find it extremely instructive to observe this we shall see how greatly the old ideas still sway both the general mind and the minds of geologists themselves we shall see how the kind of evidence that has in part abolished these old ideas is still daily accumulating and threatens to make other like revolutions in brief we shall see whereabouts we are in the elaboration of a true theory of the earth and seeing our whereabouts shall be the better able to judge among various conflicting opinions which best conform to the ascertained direction of geological discovery  it is needless here to enumerate the many speculations which were in earlier ages propounded by acute menspeculations some of which contained portions of truth falling in unfit times these speculations did not germinate and hence do not concern us we have nothing to do with ideas however good out of which no science grew but only with those which gave origin to the existing system of geology we therefore begin with werner  taking for data the appearances of the earths crust in a narrow district of germany observing the constant order of superposition of strata and their respective physical characters werner drew the inference that strata of like characters succeeded each other in like order over the entire surface of the earth and seeing from the laminated structure of many formations and the organic remains contained in others that they were sedimentary he further inferred that these universal strata had been in succession precipitated from a chaotic menstruum which once covered our planet thus on a very incomplete acquaintance with a thousandth part of the earths crust he based a sweeping generalization applying to the whole of it this neptunist hypothesis mark borne out though it seemed to be by the most conspicuous surrounding facts was quite untenable if analyzed that a universal chaotic menstruum should deposit a series of numerous sharplydefined strata differing from one another in composition is incomprehensible that the strata so deposited should contain the remains of plants and animals which could not have lived under the supposed conditions is still more incomprehensible physically absurd however as was this hypothesis it recognized though under a distorted form one of the great agencies of geological changethe action of water it served also to express the fact that the formations of the earths crust stand in some kind of order further it did a little towards supplying a nomenclature without which much progress was impossible lastly it furnished a standard with which successions of strata in various regions could be compared the differences noted and the actual sections tabulated it was the first provisional generalization and was useful if not indispensable as a step to truer ones  following this rude conception which ascribed geological phenomena to one agency acting during one primeval epoch there came a greatlyimproved conception which ascribed them to two agencies acting alternately during successive epochs hutton perceiving that sedimentary deposits were still being formed at the bottom of the sea from the detritus carried down by rivers perceiving further that the strata of which the visible surface chiefly consists bore marks of having been similarly formed out of preexisting land and inferring that these strata could have become land only by upheaval after their deposit concluded that throughout an indefinite past there had been periodic convulsions by which continents were raised with intervening eras of repose during which such continents were worn down and transformed into new marine strata fated to be in their turns elevated above the surface of the ocean and finding that igneous action to which sundry earlier geologists had ascribed basaltic rocks was in countless places a cause of disturbance he taught that from it resulted these periodic convulsions in this theory we seefirst that the previouslyrecognized agency of water was conceived to act not as by werner after a manner of which we have no experience but after a manner daily displayed to us and secondly that the igneous agency before considered only as originating special formations was recognized as a universal agency but assumed to act in an unproved way werners sole process hutton developed from the catastrophic and inexplicable into the uniform and explicable while that antagonistic second process of which he first adequately estimated the importance was regarded by him as a catastrophic one and was not assimilated to known processesnot explained we have here to note however that the facts collected and provisionally arranged in conformity with werners theory served after a time to establish huttons more rational theoryin so far at least as aqueous formations are concerned while the doctrine of periodic subterranean convulsions crudely as it was conceived by hutton was a temporary generalization needful as a step towards the theory of igneous action  since huttons time the development of geological thought has gone still further in the same direction these early sweeping doctrines have received additional qualifications it has been discovered that more numerous and more heterogeneous agencies have been at work than was at first believed the conception of igneous action has been rationalized as the conception of aqueous action had previously been the gratuitous assumption that vast elevations suddenly occurred after long intervals of quiescence has grown into the consistent theory that islands and continents are the accumulated results of successive small upheavals like those experienced in ordinary earthquakes to speak more specifically we find in the first place that instead of assuming the denudation produced by rain and rivers to be the sole means of wearing down lands and producing their irregularities of surface geologists now see that denudation is only a partcause of such irregularities and further that the new strata deposited at the bottom of the sea are not the products of riversediment solely but are in part due to the actions of waves and tidal currents on the coasts in the second place we find that huttons conception of upheaval by subterranean forces has not only been modified by assimilating these subterranean forces to ordinary earthquakeforces but modern inquiries have shown that besides elevations of surface subsidences are thus produced that local upheavals as well as the general upheavals which raise continents come within the same category and that all these changes are probably consequent on the progressive collapse of the earths crust upon its cooling and contracting nucleus in the third place we find that beyond these two great antagonistic agencies modern geology recognizes sundry minor ones those of glaciers and icebergs those of coralpolypes those of protozoa having siliceous or calcareous shellseach of which agencies insignificant as it seems is found capable of slowly working terrestrial changes of considerable magnitude thus then the recent progress of geology has been a still further departure from primitive conceptions instead of one catastrophic cause once in universal action as supposed by wernerinstead of one general continuous cause antagonized at long intervals by a catastrophic cause as taught by hutton we now recognize several causes all more or less general and continuous we no longer resort to hypothetical agencies to explain the phenomena displayed by the earths crust but we are day by day more clearly perceiving that these phenomena have arisen from forces like those now at work which have acted in all varieties of combination through immeasurable periods of time                                       having thus briefly traced the evolution of geologic science and noted its present form let us go on to observe the way in which it is still swayed by the crude hypotheses it set out with so that even now doctrines long since abandoned as untenable in theory continue in practice to mould the ideas of geologists and to foster sundry beliefs that are logically indefensible we shall see both how those simple sweeping conceptions with which the science commenced are those which every student is apt at first to seize hold of and how several influences conspire to maintain the twist thus resultinghow the original nomenclature of periods and formations necessarily keeps alive the original implications and how the need for arranging new data in some order results in their being thrust into the old classification unless their incongruity with it is very glaring a few facts will best prepare the way for criticism  up to 1839 it was inferred from their crystalline character that the metamorphic rocks of anglesea were more ancient than any rocks of the adjacent main land but it has since been shown that they are of the same age with the slates and grits of carnarvon and merioneth again slaty cleavage having been first found only in the lowest rocks was taken as an indication of the highest antiquity whence resulted serious mistakes for this mineral characteristic is now known to occur in the carboniferous system once more certain red conglomerates and grits on the northwest coast of scotland long supposed from their lithological aspect to belong to the old red sandstone are now identified with the lower silurians these are a few instances of the small trust to be placed in mineral qualities as evidence of the ages or relative positions of strata from the recentlypublished third edition of siluria may be culled numerous facts of like implication sir r murchison considers it ascertained that the siliceous stiper stones of shropshire are the equivalents of the tremadock slates of north wales judged by their fossils bala slate and limestone are of the same age as the caradoc sandstone lying forty miles off in radnorshire the formation classed as upper llandovery rock is described at different spots as sandstone or conglomerate impure limestone hard coarse grits siliceous grita considerable variation for so small an area as that of a county certain sandy beds on the left bank of the towy which sir r murchison had in his silurian system classed as caradoc sandstone evidently from their mineral characters he now finds from their fossils belong to the llandeilo formation nevertheless inferences from mineral characters are still habitually drawn and received though siluria in common with other geological works supplies numerous proofs that rocks of the same age are often of widelydifferent composition a few miles off while rocks of widelydifferent ages are often of similar composition and though sir r murchison shows us as in the case just cited that he has himself in past times been misled by trusting to lithological evidence yet his reasoning all through siluria shows that he still thinks it natural to expect formations of the same age to be chemically similar even in remote regions for example in treating of the silurian rocks of south scotland he sayswhen traversing the tract between dumfries and moffat in 1850 it occurred to me that the dull reddish or purple sandstone and schist to the north of the former town which so resembled the bottom rocks of longmynd llanberis and st davids would prove to be of the same age and further on he again insists upon the fact that these strata are absolutely of the same composition as the bottom rocks of the silurian region on this unity of mineral character it is that this scottish formation is concluded to be contemporaneous with the lowest formations in wales for the scanty paleontological evidence suffices for neither proof nor disproof now had there been a continuity of like strata in like order between wales and scotland there might have been little to criticize in this conclusion but since sir r murchison himself admits that in westmoreland and cumberland some members of the system assume a lithological aspect different from what they maintain in the silurian and welsh region there seems no reason to expect mineralogical continuity in scotland obviously therefore the assumption that these scottish formations are of the same age with the longmynd of shropshire implies the latent belief that certain mineral characters indicate certain eras far more striking instances however of the influence of this latent belief remain to be given not in such comparatively near districts as the scottish lowlands only does sir r murchison expect a repetition of the longmynd strata but in the rhenish provinces certain quartzose flagstones and grits like those of the longmynd are seemingly concluded to be of contemporaneous origin because of their likeness quartzites in roofingslates with a greenish tinge that reminded us of the lower slates of cumberland and westmoreland are evidently suspected to be of the same age in russia he remarks that the carboniferous limestones are overlaid along the western edge of the ural chain by sandstones and grits which occupy much the same place in the general series as the millstone grit of england and in calling this group as he does the representative of the millstone grit sir r murchison clearly shows that he thinks likeness of mineral composition some evidence of equivalence in time even at that great distance nay on the flanks of the andes and in the united states such similarities are looked for and considered as significant of certain ages not that sir r murchison contends theoretically for this relation between lithological character and date for on the page from which we have just quoted siluria p 387 he says that whilst the soft lower silurian clays and sands of st petersburg have their equivalents in the hard schists and quartz rocks with gold veins in the heart of the ural mountains the equally soft red and green devonian marls of the valdai hills are represented on the western flank of that chain by hard contorted and fractured limestones but these and other such admissions seem to go for little while himself asserting that the potsdamsandstone of north america the lingulaflags of england and the alumslates of scandinavia are of the same periodwhile fully aware that among the silurian formations of wales there are oolitic strata like those of secondary age yet his reasoning is more or less coloured by the assumption that formations of like qualities probably belong to the same era is it not manifest then that the exploded hypothesis of werner continues to influence geological speculation  but it will perhaps be said though individual strata are not continuous over large areas yet systems of strata are though within a few miles the same bed gradually passes from clay into sand or thins out and disappears yet the group of strata to which it belongs does not do so but maintains in remote regions the same relations to other groups  this is the generallycurrent belief on this assumption the received geological classifications appear to be framed the silurian system the devonian system the carboniferous system etc are set down in our books as groups of formations which everywhere succeed each other in a given order and are severally everywhere of the same age though it may not be asserted that these successive systems are universal yet it seems to be tacitly assumed that they are in north and south america in asia in australia sets of strata are assimilated to one or other of these groups and their possession of certain mineral characters and a certain order of superposition are among the reasons assigned for so assimilating them though probably no competent geologist would contend that the european classification of strata is applicable to the globe as a whole yet most if not all geologists write as though it were among readers of works on geology nine out of ten carry away the impression that the divisions primary secondary and tertiary are of absolute and uniform application that these great divisions are separable into subdivisions each of which is definitely distinguishable from the rest and is everywhere recognizable by its characters as such or such and that in all parts of the earth these minor systems severally began and ended at the same time when they meet with the term carboniferous era they take for granted that it was an era universally carboniferousthat it was what hugh miller indeed actually describes it an era when the earth bore a vegetation far more luxuriant than it has since done and were they in any of our colonies to meet with a coalbed they would conclude that as a matter of course it was of the same age as the english coalbeds  now this belief that geologic systems are universal is no more tenable than the other it is just as absurd when considered a priori and it is equally inconsistent with the facts though some series of strata classed together as oolite may range over a wider district than any one stratum of the series yet we have but to ask what were the circumstances under which it was deposited to see that the oolitic series like one of its individual strata must be of local origin and that there is not likely to be anywhere else a series which corresponds either in its characters or in its commencement and termination for the formation of such a series implies an area of subsidence in which its component beds were thrown down every area of subsidence is necessarily limited and to suppose that there exist elsewhere groups of beds completely answering to those known as oolite is to suppose that in contemporaneous areas of subsidence like processes were going on there is no reason to suppose this but good reason to suppose the reverse that in contemporaneous areas of subsidence throughout the globe the conditions would cause the formation of oolite is an assumption which no modern geologist would openly make he would say that the equivalent series of beds found elsewhere would probably be of dissimilar mineral character moreover in these contemporaneous areas of subsidence the processes going on would not only be different in kind but in no two cases would they be likely to agree in their commencements and terminations the probabilities are greatly against separate portions of the earths surface beginning to subside at the same time and ceasing to subside at the same timea coincidence which alone could produce equivalent groups of strata subsidences in different places begin and end with utter irregularity and hence the groups of strata thrown down in them can but rarely correspond measured against each other in time their limits must disagree on turning to the evidence we find that it daily tends more and more to justify these a priori positions take as an example the old red sandstone system in the north of england this is represented by a single stratum of conglomerate in herefordshire worcestershire and shropshire it expands into a series of strata from eight to ten thousand feet thick made up of conglomerates red green and white sandstones red green and spotted marls and concretionary limestones to the southwest as between caermarthen and pembroke these old red sandstone strata exhibit considerable lithological changes on the other side of the bristol channel they display further changes in mineral characters while in south devon and cornwall the equivalent strata consisting chiefly of slates schists and limestones are so wholly different that they were for a long time classed as silurian when we thus see that in certain directions the whole group of deposits thins out and that its mineral characters change within moderate distances does it not become clear that the whole group of deposits was a local one and when we find in other regions formations analogous to these old red sandstone or devonian formations is it certainis it even probablethat they severally began and ended at the same time with them should it not require overwhelming evidence to make us believe as much  yet so strongly is geological speculation swayed by the tendency to regard the phenomena as general instead of local that even those most on their guard against it seem unable to escape its influence at page 158 of his principles of geology sir charles lyell says       a group of red marl and red sandstone containing salt and gypsum      being interposed in england between the lias and the coal all      other red marls and sandstones associated some of them with salt      and others with gypsum and occurring not only in different parts      of europe but in north america peru india the salt deserts of      asia those of africain a word in every quarter of the globe      were referred to one and the same period it was in vain to urge      as an objection the improbability of the hypothesis which implies      that all the moving waters on the globe were once simultaneously      charged with sediment of a red colour but the rashness of      pretending to identify in age all the red sandstones and marls in      question has at length been sufficiently exposed by the discovery      that even in europe they belong decidedly to many different      epochs  nevertheless while in this and many kindred passages sir c lyell protests against the bias here illustrated he seems himself not completely free from it though he utterly rejects the old hypothesis that all over the earth the same continuous strata lie one upon another in regular order like the coats of an onion he still writes as though geologic systems do thus succeed each other a reader of his manual would certainly suppose him to believe that the primary epoch ended and the secondary epoch began all over the world at the same timethat these terms really correspond to distinct universal eras when he assumes as he does that the division between cambrian and lower silurian in america answers chronologically to the division between cambrian and lower silurian in waleswhen he takes for granted that the partings of lower from middle silurian and of middle silurian from upper in the one region are of the same dates as the like partings in the other region does it not seem that he believes geologic systems to be universal in the sense that their separations were in all places contemporaneous though he would doubtless disown this as an article of faith is not his thinking unconsciously influenced by it must we not say that though the onioncoat hypothesis is dead its spirit is traceable under a transcendental form even in the conclusions of its antagonists                                       let us now consider another leading geological doctrinethe doctrine that strata of the same age contain like fossils and that therefore the age and relative position of any stratum may be known by its fossils while the theory that strata of like mineral characters were everywhere deposited simultaneously has been ostensibly abandoned there has been accepted the theory that in each geologic epoch similar plants and animals existed everywhere and that therefore the epoch to which any formation belongs may be known by the organic remains contained in the formation though perhaps no leading geologist would openly commit himself to an unqualified assertion of this theory yet it is tacitly assumed in current geological reasoning  this theory however is scarcely more tenable than the other it cannot be concluded with any certainty that formations in which similar organic remains are found were of contemporaneous origin nor can it be safely concluded that strata containing different organic remains are of different ages to most readers these will be startling propositions but they are fully admitted by the highest authorities sir charles lyell confesses that the test of organic remains must be used under very much the same restrictions as the test of mineral composition sir henry de la beche who variously illustrates this truth remarks on the great incongruity there must be between the fossils of our carboniferous rocks and those of the marine strata deposited at the same period but though in the abstract the danger of basing positive conclusions on evidence derived from fossils is recognized yet in the concrete this danger is generally disregarded the established convictions respecting the ages of strata have been formed in spite of it and by some geologists it seems altogether ignored throughout his siluria sir r murchison habitually assumes that the same or kindred species lived in all parts of the earth at the same time in russia in bohemia in the united states in south america strata are classed as belonging to this or that part of the silurian system because of the similar fossils contained in themare concluded to be everywhere contemporaneous if they enclose a proportion of identical or allied forms in russia the relative position of a stratum is inferred from the fact that along with some wenlock forms it yields the pentamerus oblongus certain crustaceans called eurypteri being characteristic of the upper ludlow rock it is remarked that large eurypteri occur in a socalled black greywacke slate in westmoreland in oneida county new york which will probably be found to be on the parallel of the upper ludlow rock in which word probably we see both how dominant is this belief of universal distribution of similar creatures at the same period and how apt this belief is to make its own proof by raising the expectation that the ages are identical when the forms are alike besides thus interpreting the formations of russia england and america sir r murchison thus interprets those of the antipodes fossils from victoria colony he agrees with the governmentsurveyor in classing as of lower silurian or llandovery age that is he takes for granted that when certain crustaceans and mollusks were living in wales certain similar crustaceans and mollusks were living in australia yet the improbability of this assumption may be readily shown from sir r murchisons own facts if as he points out the fossil crustaceans of the uppermost silurian rocks in lanarkshire are with one doubtful exception all distinct from any of the forms known on the same horizon in england how can it be fairly presumed that the forms existing on the other side of the earth during the silurian period were nearly allied to those existing here not only indeed do sir r murchisons conclusions tacitly assume this doctrine of universal distribution but he distinctly enunciates it the mere presence of a graptolite he says will at once decide that the enclosing rock is silurian and he says this notwithstanding repeated warnings against such generalizations during the progress of geology it has over and over again happened that a particular fossil long considered characteristic of a particular formation has been afterwards discovered in other formations until some twelve years ago goniatites had not been found lower than the devonian rocks but now in bohemia they have been found in rocks classed as silurian quite recently the orthoceras previously supposed to be a type exclusively palæozoic has been detected along with mesozoic ammonites and belemnites yet hosts of such experiences fail to extinguish the assumption that the age of a stratum may be determined by the occurrence in it of a single fossil form nay this assumption survives evidence of even a still more destructive kind referring to the silurian system in western ireland sir r murchison says in the beds near maam professor nicol and myself collected remains some of which would be considered lower and others upper silurian and he then names sundry fossils which in england belong to the summit of the ludlow rocks or highest silurian strata some which elsewhere are known only in rocks of llandovery agethat is of middle silurian age and some only before known in lower silurian strata not far above the most ancient fossiliferous beds now what do these facts prove clearly they prove that species which in wales are separated by strata more than twenty thousand feet deep and therefore seem to belong to periods far more remote from each other were really coexistent they prove that the mollusks and crinoids held to be characteristic of early silurian strata and supposed to have become extinct long before the mollusks and crinoids of the later silurian strata came into existence were really flourishing at the same time with these last and that these last possibly date back to as early a period as the first they prove that not only the mineral characters of sedimentary formations but also the collections of organic forms they contain depend to a great extent on local circumstances they prove that the fossils met with in any series of strata cannot be taken as representing anything like the whole flora and fauna of the period they belong to in brief they throw great doubt upon numerous geological generalizations  notwithstanding facts like these and notwithstanding his avowed opinion that the test of organic remains must be used under very much the same restrictions as the test of mineral composition sir charles lyell too considers sundry positive conclusions to be justified by this test even where the community of fossils is slight and the distance great having decided that in various places in europe middle eocene strata are distinguished by nummulites he infers without any other assigned evidence that wherever nummulites are foundin morocco algeria egypt in persia scinde cutch eastern bengal and the frontiers of chinathe containing formation is middle eocene and from this inference he draws the following important corollary       when we have once arrived at the conviction that the nummulitic      formation occupies a middle place in the eocene series we are      struck with the comparatively modern date to which some of the      greatest revolutions in the physical geography of europe asia and      northern africa must be referred all the mountain chains such as      the alps pyrenees carpathians and himalayas into the      composition of whose central and loftiest parts the nummulitic      strata enter bodily could have had no existence till after the      middle eocene periodmanual p 232  a still more marked case follows on the next page because a certain bed at claiborne in alabama which contains four hundred species of marine shells includes among them the cardita planicosta and some others identical with european species or very nearly allied to them sir c lyell says it is highly probable the claiborne beds agree in age with the central or bracklesham group of england when we find contemporaneity alleged on the strength of a community no greater than that which sometimes exists between strata of widelydifferent ages in the same country it seems as though the abovequoted caution had been forgotten it appears to be assumed for the occasion that species which had a wide range in space had a narrow range in time which is the reverse of the fact the tendency to systematize overrides the evidence and thrusts nature into a formula too rigid to fit her endless variety  but it may be urged surely when in different places the order of superposition the mineral characters and the fossils agree it may safely be concluded that the formations thus corresponding date back to the same time if for example the united states display a succession of silurian devonian and carboniferous systems lithologically similar to those known here by those names and characterized by like fossils it is a fair inference that these groups of strata were severally being deposited in america while their equivalents were being deposited here  on this position which seems a strong one we have in the first place to remark that the evidence of correspondence is always more or less suspicious we have already adverted to the several idolsif we may use bacons metaphorto which geologists unconsciously sacrifice when interpreting the structures of unexplored regions carrying with them the classification of strata existing in europe and assuming that groups of strata in other parts of the world must answer to some of the groups of strata known here they are necessarily prone to assert parallelism on insufficient evidence they scarcely entertain the previous question whether the formations they are examining have or have not any european equivalents but the question iswith which of the european series shall they be classedwith which do they most agreefrom which do they differ least and this being the mode of inquiry there is apt to result great laxity of interpretation how lax the interpretation really is may be readily shown when strata are discontinuous as between europe and america no evidence can be derived from the order of superposition apart from mineral characters and organic remains for unless strata can be continuously traced mineral characters and organic remains afford the only means of classing them as such or such as to the test of mineral characters we have seen that it is almost worthless and no modern geologist would dare to say it should be relied on if the old red sandstone series in midengland differs wholly in lithological aspect from the equivalent series in south devon it is clear that similarities of texture and composition cannot justify us in classing a system of strata in another quarter of the globe with some european system the test of fossils is the only one that remains and with how little strictness this test is applied one case will show of fortysix species of british devonian corals only six occur in america and this notwithstanding the wide range which the anthozoa are known to have similarly of the mollusca and crinoidea it appears that while there are sundry genera found in america which are found here there are scarcely any of the same species and sir charles lyell admits that the difficulty of deciding on the exact parallelism of the new york subdivisions as above enumerated with the members of the european devonian is very great so few are the species in common yet it is on the strength of community of fossils that the whole devonian series of the united states is assumed to be contemporaneous with the whole devonian series of england and it is partly on the ground that the devonian of the united states corresponds in time with our own devonian that sir charles lyell concludes the superjacent coalmeasures of the two countries to be of the same age is it not then as we said that the evidence in these cases is very suspicious should it be replied as it may fairly be that this correspondence from which the synchronism of distant formations is inferred is not a correspondence between particular species or particular genera but between the general characters of the contained assemblages of fossilsbetween the facies of the two faunas the rejoinder is that though such correspondence is a stronger evidence of synchronism it is still an insufficient one to infer synchronism from such correspondence involves the postulate that throughout each geologic era there has habitually existed a recognizable similarity between the groups of organic forms inhabiting all the different parts of the earth and that the causes which have in one part of the earth changed the organic forms into those which characterize the next era have simultaneously acted in all other parts of the earth in such ways as to produce parallel changes of their organic forms now this is not only a large assumption to make but it is an assumption contrary to probability the probability is that the causes which have changed faunas have been local rather than universal that hence while the faunas of some regions have been rapidly changing those of others have been almost quiescent and that when those of others have been changed it has been not in such ways as to maintain parallelism but in such ways as to produce divergence  even supposing however that districts some hundreds of miles apart furnished groups of strata which completely agreed in their order of superposition their mineral characters and their fossils we should still have inadequate proof of contemporaneity for there are conditions very likely to occur under which such groups might differ widely in age if there be a continent of which the strata crop out on the surface obliquely to the line of coastrunning say westnorthwest while the coast runs east and westit is clear that each group of strata will crop out on the beach at a particular part of the coast that further west the next group of strata will crop out on the beach and so continuously as the localization of marine plants and animals is in a considerable degree determined by the natures of the rocks and their detritus it follows that each part of this coast will have its more or less distinct flora and fauna what now must result from the action of the waves in the course of a geologic epoch as the sea makes slow inroads on the land the place at which each group of strata crops out on the beach will gradually move towards the west its distinctive fish mollusks crustaceans and seaweeds migrating with it further the detritus of each of these groups of strata will as the point of outcrop moves westwards be deposited over the detritus of the group in advance of it and the consequence of these actions carried on for one of those enormous periods which a geologic change takes will be that corresponding to each eastern stratum there will arise a stratum far to the west which though occupying the same position relatively to other beds formed of like materials and containing like fossils will yet be perhaps a million years later in date                                       but the illegitimacy or at any rate the great doubtfulness of many current geological inferences is best seen when we contemplate terrestrial changes now going on and ask how far such inferences are countenanced by them if we carry out rigorously the modern method of interpreting geological phenomena which sir charles lyell has done so much to establishthat of referring them to causes like those at present in actionwe cannot fail to see how improbable are sundry of the received conclusions  along each shore which is being worn away by the waves there are being formed mud sand and pebbles this detritus has in each locality a more or less special character determined by the nature of the strata destroyed in the english channel it is not the same as in the irish channel on the east coast of ireland it is not the same as on the west coast and so throughout at the mouth of each great river there is being deposited sediment differing more or less from that deposited at the mouths of other rivers in colour and quality forming strata which are here red there yellow and elsewhere brown grey or dirty white besides which various formations going on in deltas and along shores there are some much wider and still more strongly contrasted formations at the bottom of the Ægean sea there is accumulating a bed of pteropod shells which will eventually no doubt become a calcareous rock for some hundreds of thousands of square miles the oceanbed between great britain and north america is being covered with a stratum of chalk and over large areas in the pacific there are going on deposits of coralline limestone thus there are at this moment being produced in different places multitudinous strata differing from one another in lithological characters name at random any part of the seabottom and ask whether the deposit there taking place is like the deposit taking place at some distant part of the seabottom and the almostcertainly correct answer will beno the chances are not in favour of similarity but against itmany to one against it  in the order of superposition of strata there is being established a like variety each region of the earths surface has its special history of elevations subsidences periods of rest and this history in no case fits chronologically with the history of any other portion river deltas are now being thrown down on formations of different ages some very ancient some quite modern while here there has been deposited a series of beds many hundreds of feet thick there has elsewhere been deposited but a single bed of fine mud while one region of the earths crust continuing for a vast epoch above the surface of the ocean bears record of no changes save those resulting from denudation another region of the earths crust gives proof of sundry changes of level with their several resulting masses of stratified detritus if anything is to be judged from current processes we must infer not only that everywhere the succession of sedimentary formations differs more or less from the succession elsewhere but also that in each place there exist groups of strata to which many other places have no equivalents  with respect to the organic bodies imbedded in formations now in progress a like truth is equally manifest if not more manifest even along the same coast within moderate distances the forms of life differ very considerably and they differ much more on coasts that are remote from one another again dissimilar creatures which are living together near the same shore do not leave their remains in the same beds of sediment for instance at the bottom of the adriatic where the prevailing currents cause the deposits to be here of mud and there of calcareous matter it is proved that different species of coexisting shells are being buried in these respective formations on our own coasts the marine remains found a few miles from shore in banks where fish congregate are different from those found close to the shore where littoral species flourish a large proportion of aquatic creatures have structures which do not admit of fossilization while of the rest the great majority are destroyed when dead by various kinds of scavengers so that no one deposit near our shores can contain anything like a true representation of the fauna of the surrounding sea much less of the coexisting faunas of other seas in the same latitude and still less of the faunas of seas in distant latitudes were it not that the assertion seems needful it would be almost absurd to say that the organic remains now being buried in the dogger bank can tell us next to nothing about the fish crustaceans mollusks and corals which are being buried in the bay of bengal still stronger is the argument in the case of terrestrial life with more numerous and greater contrasts between the types inhabiting one continent and those inhabiting another there is a far more imperfect registry of them schouw marks out on the earth more than twenty botanical regions occupied by groups of forms so distinct that if fossilized geologists would scarcely be disposed to refer them all to the same period of faunas the arctic differs from the temperate the temperate from the tropical and the south temperate from the north temperate nay in the south temperate zone itself the two regions of south africa and south america are unlike in their mammals birds reptiles fishes mollusks insects the shells and bones now lying at the bottoms of lakes and estuaries in these several regions have certainly not that similarity which is usually looked for in those of contemporaneous strata and the recent forms exhumed in any one of these regions would very untruly represent the present flora and fauna of the earth in conformity with the current style of geological reasoning an exhaustive examination of deposits in the arctic circle might be held to prove that though at this period there were sundry mammals existing there were no reptiles while the absence of mammals in the deposits of the galapagos archipelago where there are plenty of reptiles might be held to prove the reverse and at the same time from the formations extending for two thousand miles along the great barrierreef of australiaformations in which are imbedded nothing but corals echinoderms mollusks crustaceans and fish along with an occasional turtle or bird or cetaceanit might be inferred that there lived in our epoch neither terrestrial reptiles nor terrestrial mammals the mention of australia indeed suggests an illustration which even alone would amply prove our case the fauna of this region differs widely from any that is found elsewhere on land all the indigenous mammals except bats belong to the lowest or implacental division and the insects are singularly different from those found elsewhere the surrounding seas contain numerous forms which are more or less strange and among the fish there exists a species of shark which is the only living representative of a genus that flourished in early geologic epochs if now the modern fossiliferous deposits of australia were to be examined by one ignorant of the existing australian fauna and if he were to reason in the usual manner he would be very unlikely to class these deposits with those of the present time how then can we place confidence in the tacit assumption that certain formations in remote parts of the earth are referable to the same period because the organic remains contained in them display a certain community of character or that certain others are referable to different periods because the facies of their faunas are different  but it will be replied in past eras the same or similar organic forms were more widely distributed than now it may be so but the evidence adduced by no means proves it the argument by which this conclusion is reached runs a risk of being quoted as an example of reasoning in a circle as already pointed out between formations in remote regions the accepted test of equivalence is community of fossils if then the contemporaneity of remote formations is concluded from the likeness of their fossils how can it be said that similar plants and animals were once more widely distributed because they are found in contemporaneous strata in remote regions is not the fallacy manifest even supposing there were no such fatal objection as this the evidence commonly assigned would still be insufficient for we must bear in mind that the community of organic remains usually thought sufficient proof of correspondence in time is a very imperfect community when the compared sedimentary beds are far apart it is scarcely expected that there will be many species common to the two it is enough if there be discovered a considerable number of common genera now had it been proved that throughout geologic time each genus lived but for a short perioda period measured by a single group of stratasomething might be inferred but what if we learn that many of the same genera continued to exist throughout enormous epochs measured by several vast systems of strata among molluscs the genera avicula modiola terebratula lingula and orbicula are found from the silurian rocks upwards to the present day if then between the lowest fossiliferous formations and the most recent there exists this degree of community must we not infer that there will probably often exist a great degree of community between strata that are far from contemporaneous  thus the reasoning from which it is concluded that similar organic forms were once more widely spread than now is doubly fallacious and consequently the classifications of foreign strata based on the conclusion are untrustworthy judging from the present distribution of life we cannot expect to find similar remains in geographically remote strata of the same age and where between the fossils of geographically remote strata we do find much similarity it is probably due rather to likeness of conditions than to contemporaneity if from causes and effects such as we now witness we reason back to the causes and effects of past epochs we discover inadequate warrant for sundry of the received doctrines seeing as we do that in large areas of the pacific this is a period characterized by abundance of corals that in the north atlantic it is a period in which a great chalkdeposit is being formed and that in the valley of the mississippi it is a period of new coalbasinsseeing also as we do that in one extensive continent this is peculiarly an era of implacental mammals and that in another extensive continent it is peculiarly an era of placental mammals we have good reason to hesitate before accepting these sweeping generalizations which are based on a cursory examination of strata occupying but a tenth part of the earths surface                                       at the outset this article was to have been a review of the works of hugh miller but it has grown into something much more general nevertheless the remaining two doctrines which we propose to criticize may conveniently be treated in connexion with his name as that of one who fully committed himself to them and first a few words respecting his position  that he was a man whose life was one of meritorious achievement every one knows that he was a diligent and successful working geologist scarcely needs saying that with indomitable perseverance he struggled up from obscurity to a place in the world of literature and science shows him to have been highly endowed in character and intelligence and that he had a remarkable power of presenting his facts and arguments in an attractive form a glance at any of his books will quickly prove by all means let us respect him as a man of activity and sagacity joined with a large amount of poetry but while saying this we must add that his reputation stands by no means so high in the scientific world as in the world at large partly from the fact that our scotch neighbours are in the habit of blowing the trumpet rather loudly before their notabilitiespartly because the charming style in which his books are written has gained him a large circle of readerspartly perhaps through a praiseworthy sympathy with him as a selfmade man hugh miller has met with an amount of applause which little as we wish to diminish it must not be allowed to blind the public to his defects as a man of science the truth is he was so far committed to a foregone conclusion that he could not become a philosophical geologist he might be aptly described as a theologian studying geology the dominant idea with which he wrote may be seen in the titles of two of his booksfootprints of the creatorthe testimony of the rocks regarding geological facts as evidence for or against certain religious conclusions it was scarcely possible for him to deal with geological facts impartially his ruling aim was to disprove the development hypothesis the assumed implications of which were repugnant to him and in proportion to the strength of his feeling was the onesidedness of his reasoning he admitted that god might as certainly have originated the species by a law of development as he maintains it by a law of developmentthe existence of a first great cause is as perfectly compatible with the one scheme as with the other nevertheless he considered the hypothesis at variance with christianity and therefore combated with it he apparently overlooked the fact that the doctrines of geology in general as held by himself had been rejected by many on similar grounds and that he had himself been repeatedly attacked for his antichristian teachings he seems not to have perceived that just as his antagonists were wrong in condemning as irreligious theories which he saw were not irreligious so might he be wrong in condemning on like grounds the theory of evolution in brief he fell short of that highest faith which knows that all truths must harmonize and which is therefore content trustfully to follow the evidence whithersoever it leads  of course it is impossible to criticize his works without entering on this great question to which he chiefly devoted himself the two remaining doctrines to be here discussed bear directly on this question and as above said we propose to treat them in connexion with hugh millers name because throughout his reasonings he assumes their truth let it not be supposed however that we shall aim to prove what he has aimed to disprove while we purpose showing that his geological arguments against the development hypothesis are based on invalid assumptions we do not purpose showing that the geological arguments urged in support of it are based on valid assumptions we hope to make it apparent that the geological evidence at present obtained is insufficient for either side further that there seems little probability that sufficient evidence will ever be obtained and that if the question is eventually decided it must be decided on other than geological grounds                                       the first of the current doctrines to which we have just referred is that there occur in the serial records of former life on our planet two great blanks whence it is inferred that on at least two occasions the previously existing inhabitants of the earth were almost wholly destroyed and a different class of inhabitants created comparing the general life on the earth to a thread hugh miller says       it is continuous from the present time up to the commencement of      the tertiary period and then so abrupt a break occurs that with      the exception of the microscopic diatomaceæ to which i last      evening referred and of one shell and one coral not a single      species crossed the gap on its farther or remoter side however      where the secondary division closes the intermingling of species      again begins and runs on till the commencement of this great      secondary division and then just where the palæozoic division      closes we find another abrupt break crossed if crossed at      allfor there still exists some doubt on the subjectby but two      species of plant  these breaks are supposed to imply actual new creations on the surface of our planetsupposed not by hugh miller only but by the majority of geologists and the terms palæozoic mesozoic and cainozoic are used to indicate these three successive systems of life it is true that some accept this belief with caution knowing how geologic research has been all along tending to fill up what were once thought wide gaps sir charles lyell points out that the hiatus which exists in great britain between the fossils of the lias and those of the magnesian limestone is supplied in germany by the rich fauna and flora of the muschelkalk keuper and bunter sandstein which we know to be of a date precisely intermediate again he remarks that until lately the fossils of the coalmeasures were separated from those of the antecedent silurian group by a very abrupt and decided line of demarcation but recent discoveries have brought to light in devonshire belgium the eifel and westphalia the remains of a fauna of an intervening period and once more he says we have also in like manner had some success of late years in diminishing the hiatus which still separates the cretaceous and eocene periods in europe to which let us add that since hugh miller penned the passage above quoted the second of the great gaps he refers to has been very considerably narrowed by the discovery of strata containing palæozoic genera and mesozoic genera intermingled nevertheless the occurrence of two great revolutions in the earths flora and fauna appears still to be held by many and geologic nomenclature habitually assumes it  before seeking a solution of the problem thus raised let us glance at the several minor causes which produce breaks in the geological succession of organic forms taking first the more general ones which modify climate and therefore the distribution of life among these may be noted one which has not we believe been named by writers on the subject we mean that resulting from a certain slow astronomic rhythm by which the northern and southern hemispheres are alternately subject to greater extremes of temperature in consequence of the slight ellipticity of its orbit the earths distance from the sun varies to the extent of some 3000000 of miles at present the aphelion occurs at the time of our northern summer and the perihelion during the summer of the southern hemisphere in consequence however of that slow movement of the earths axis which produces the precession of the equinoxes this state of things will in time be reversed the earth will be nearest to the sun during the summer of the northern hemisphere and furthest from it during the southern summer or northern winter the period required to complete the slow movement producing these changes is nearly 26000 years and were there no modifying process the two hemispheres would alternately experience this coincidence of summer with relative nearness to the sun during a period of 13000 years but there is also a still slower change in the direction of the axis major of the earths orbit from which it results that the alternation we have described is completed in about 21000 years that is to say if at a given time the earth is nearest to the sun at our midsummer and furthest from the sun at our midwinter then in 10500 years afterwards it will be furthest from the sun at our midsummer and nearest at our midwinter now the difference between the distances from the sun at the two extremes of this alternation amounts to onethirtieth and hence the difference between the quantities of heat received from the sun on a summers day under these opposite conditions amounts to onefifteenth estimating this not with reference to the zero of our thermometers but with reference to the temperature of the celestial spaces sir john herschel calculates 23° fahrenheit as the least variation of temperature under such circumstances which can reasonably be attributed to the actual variation of the suns distance thus then each hemisphere has at a certain epoch a short summer of extreme heat followed by a long and very cold winter through the slow change in the direction of the earths axis these extremes are gradually mitigated and at the end of 10500 years there is reached the opposite statea long and moderate summer with a short and mild winter at present in consequence of the predominance of sea in the southern hemisphere the extremes to which its astronomical conditions subject it are much ameliorated while the great proportion of land in the northern hemisphere tends to exaggerate such contrast as now exists in it between winter and summer whence it results that the climates of the two hemispheres are not widely unlike but 10000 years hence the northern hemisphere will undergo annual variations of temperature far more marked than now  in the last edition of his outlines of astronomy sir john herschel recognizes this as an element in geological processes regarding it as possibly a partcause of those climatic changes indicated by the records of the earths past that it has had much to do with those larger changes of climate of which we have evidence seems unlikely since there is reason to think that these have been far slower and more lasting but that it must have entailed a rhythmical exaggeration and mitigation of the climates otherwise produced seems beyond question and it seems also beyond question that there must have been a consequent rhythmical change in the distribution of organismsa rhythmical change to which we here wish to draw attention as one cause of minor breaks in the succession of fossil remains each species of plant and animal has certain limits of heat and cold within which only it can exist and these limits in a great degree determine its geographical position it will not spread north of a certain latitude because it cannot bear a more northern winter nor south of a certain latitude because the summer heat is too great or else it is indirectly restrained from spreading further by the effect of temperature on the humidity of the air or on the distribution of the organisms it lives upon but now what will result from a slow alteration of climate produced as above described supposing the period we set out from is that in which the contrast of seasons is least marked it is manifest that during the progress towards the period of most violent contrast each species of plant and animal will gradually change its limits of distributionwill be driven back here by the winters increasing cold and there by the summers increasing heatwill retire into those localities that are still fit for it thus during 10000 years each species will ebb away from certain regions it was inhabiting and during the succeeding 10000 years will flow back into those regions from the strata there forming its remains will disappear they will be absent from some of the superposed strata and will be found in strata higher up but in what shapes will they reappear exposed during the 21000 years of their slow recession and their slow return to changing conditions of life they are likely to have undergone modifications and will probably reappear with slight differences of constitution and perhaps of formwill be new varieties or perhaps new subspecies  to this cause of minor breaks in the succession of organic formsa cause on which we have dwelt because it has not been taken into accountwe must add sundry others besides these periodicallyrecurring changes of climate there are the irregular ones produced by redistributions of land and sea and these sometimes less sometimes greater in degree than the rhythmical changes must like them cause in each region emigrations and immigrations of species and consequent breaks small or large as the case may be in the paleontological series other and more special geological changes must produce other and more local blanks in the succession by some inland elevation the natural drainage of a continent is modified and instead of the sediment previously brought down to the sea by it a great river brings down sediment unfavourable to various plants and animals living in its delta whereupon these disappear from the locality perhaps to reappear in a changed form after a long epoch upheavals or subsidences of shores or seabottoms involving deviations of marine currents remove the habitats of many species to which such currents are salutary or injurious and further this redistribution of currents alters the places of sedimentary deposits and thus stops the burying of organic remains in some localities while commencing it in others had we space many more such causes of blanks in our paleontological records might be added but it is needless here to enumerate them they are admirably explained and illustrated in sir charles lyells principles of geology  now if these minor changes of the earths surface produce minor breaks in the series of fossilized remains must not great changes produce great breaks if a local upheaval or subsidence causes throughout its small area the absence of some links in the chain of fossil forms does it not follow that an upheaval or subsidence extending over a large part of the earths surface must cause the absence of a great number of such links throughout a very wide area  when during a long epoch a continent slowly sinking gives place to a farspreading ocean some miles in depth at the bottom of which no deposits from rivers or abraded shores can be thrown down and when after some enormous period this oceanbottom is gradually elevated and becomes the site for new strata it is clear that the fossils contained in these new strata are likely to have but little in common with the fossils of the strata below them take in illustration the case of the north atlantic we have already named the fact that between this country and the united states the oceanbottom is being covered with a deposit of chalka deposit which has been forming probably ever since there occurred that great depression of the earths crust from which the atlantic resulted in remote geologic times this chalk consists of the minute shells of foraminifera sprinkled with remains of small entomostraca and probably a few pteropodshells though the sounding lines have not yet brought up any of these last thus in so far as all high forms of life are concerned this new chalkformation must be a blank at rare intervals perhaps a polar bear drifted on an iceberg may have its bones scattered over the bed or a dead decaying whale may similarly leave traces but such remains must be so rare that this new chalkformation if accessible might be examined for a century before any of them were disclosed if now some millions of years hence the atlanticbed should be raised and estuary deposits or shore deposits laid upon it these would contain remains of a flora and a fauna so distinct from everything below them as to appear like a new creation  thus along with continuity of life on the earths surface there not only may be but there must be great gaps in the series of fossils and hence these gaps are no evidence against the doctrine of evolution                                       one other current assumption remains to be criticized and it is the one on which more than on any other depends the view taken respecting the question of development  from the beginning of the controversy the arguments for and against have turned upon the evidence of progression in organic forms found in the ascending series of our sedimentary formations on the one hand those who contend that higher organisms have been evolved out of lower joined with those who contend that successively higher organisms have been created at successively later periods appeal for proof to the facts of paleontology which they say countenance their views on the other hand the uniformitarians who not only reject the hypothesis of development but deny that the modern forms of life are higher than the ancient ones reply that the paleontological evidence is at present very incomplete that though we have not yet found remains of highlyorganized creatures in strata of the greatest antiquity we must not assume that no such creatures existed when those strata were deposited and that probably search will eventually disclose them  it must be admitted that thus far the evidence has gone in favour of the latter party geological discovery has year after year shown the small value of negative facts the conviction that there are no traces of higher organisms in earlier strata has resulted not from the absence of such traces but from incomplete examination at p 460 of his manual of elementary geology sir charles lyell gives a list in illustration of this it appears that in 1709 fishes were not known lower than the permian system in 1793 they were found in the subjacent carboniferous system in 1828 in the devonian in 1840 in the upper silurian of reptiles we read that in 1710 the lowest known were in the permian in 1844 they were detected in the carboniferous and in 1852 in the upper devonian while of the mammalia the list shows that in 1798 none had been discovered below the middle eocene but that in 1818 they were discovered in the lower oolite and in 1847 in the upper trias  the fact is however that both parties set out with an inadmissible postulate of the uniformitarians not only such writers as hugh miller but also such as sir charles lyell27 reason as though we had found the earliest or something like the earliest strata their antagonists whether defenders of the development hypothesis or simply progressionists almost uniformly do the like sir r murchison who is a progressionist calls the lowest fossiliferous strata protozoic prof ansted uses the same term whether avowedly or not all the disputants stand on this assumption as their common ground  yet is this assumption indefensible as some who make it very well know facts may be cited against it which show that it is a more than questionable onethat it is a highly improbable one while the evidence assigned in its favour will not bear criticism  because in bohemia great britain and portions of north america the lowest unmetamorphosed strata yet discovered contain but slight traces of life sir r murchison conceives that they were formed while yet few if any plants or animals had been created and therefore classes them as azoic his own pages however show the illegitimacy of the conclusion that there existed at that period no considerable amount of life such traces of life as have been found in the longmynd rocks for many years considered unfossiliferous have been found in some of the lowest beds and the twenty thousand feet of superposed beds still yield no organic remains if now these superposed strata throughout a depth of four miles are without fossils though the strata over which they lie prove that life had commenced what becomes of sir r murchisons inference at page 189 of siluria a still more conclusive fact will be found the glengariff grits and other accompanying strata there described as 13500 feet thick contain no signs of contemporaneous life yet sir r murchison refers them to the devonian perioda period which had a large and varied marine fauna how then from the absence of fossils in the longmynd beds and their equivalents can we conclude that the earth was azoic when they were formed  but it may be asked if living creatures then existed why do we not find fossiliferous strata of that age or an earlier age one reply is that the nonexistence of such strata is but a negative factwe have not found them and considering how little we know even of the twofifths of the earths surface now above the sea and how absolutely ignorant we are of the threefifths below the sea it is rash to say that no such strata exist but the chief reply is that these records of the earths earlier history have been in great part destroyed by agencies which are ever tending to destroy such records  it is an established geological doctrine that sedimentary strata are liable to be changed more or less profoundly by igneous action the rocks originally classed as transition because they were intermediate in character between the igneous rocks found below them and the sedimentary strata found above them are now known to be nothing else than sedimentary strata altered in texture and appearance by the intense heat of adjacent molten matter and hence are renamed metamorphic rocks modern researches have shown too that these metamorphic rocks are not as was once supposed all of the same age besides primary and secondary strata which have been transformed by igneous action there are similarlychanged deposits of tertiary origindeposits changed even as far as a quarter of a mile from the point of contact with neighbouring granite by this process fossils are of course destroyed in some cases says sir charles lyell dark limestones replete with shells and corals have been turned into white statuary marble and hard clays containing vegetable or other remains into slates called micaschist or hornblendeschist every vestige of the organic bodies having been obliterated again it is fast becoming an acknowledged truth that igneous rock of whatever kind is the product of sedimentary strata which have been completely melted granite and gneiss which are of like chemical composition have been shown in various cases to pass one into the other as at valorsine near mont blanc where the two in contact are observed to both undergo a modification of mineral character the granite still remaining unstratified becomes charged with green particles and the talcose gneiss assumes a granitiform structure without losing its stratification in the aberdeengranite lumps of unmelted gneiss are abundant and we can ourselves bear witness that the granite on the banks of loch sunart yields proofs that when molten it contained incompletelyfused clots of sedimentary strata nor is this all fifty years ago it was thought that all granitic rocks were primitive or existed before any sedimentary strata but it is now no easy task to point out a single mass of granite demonstrably more ancient than all the known fossiliferous deposits in brief accumulated evidence shows that by contact with or proximity to the molten matter of the earths nucleus all beds of sediment are liable to be actually melted or partially fused or so heated as to agglutinate their particles and that according to the temperature they have been raised to and the circumstances under which they cool they assume the forms of granite porphyry trap gneiss or rock otherwise altered further it is manifest that though strata of various ages have been thus changed yet the most ancient strata have been so changed to the greatest extent both because they have been nearer to the centre of igneous agency and because they have been for longer periods liable to be affected by it whence it follows that sedimentary strata passing a certain antiquity are unlikely to be found in an unmetamorphosed state and that strata much earlier than these are certain to have been melted up thus if throughout a past of indefinite duration there had been at work those aqueous and igneous agencies which we see still at work the state of the earths crust might be just what we find it we have no evidence which puts a limit to the period throughout which this formation and destruction of strata has been going on for aught the facts prove it may have been going on for ten times the period measured by our whole series of sedimentary deposits  besides having in the present appearances of the earths crust no data for fixing a commencement to these processesbesides finding that the evidence permits us to assume such commencement to have been inconceivably remote as compared even with the vast eras of geology we are not without positive grounds for inferring the inconceivable remoteness of such commencement modern geology has established truths which are irreconcilable with the belief that the formation and destruction of strata began when the cambrian rocks were formed or at anything like so recent a time one fact from siluria will suffice sir r murchison estimates the vertical thickness of silurian strata in wales at from 26000 to 27000 feet or about five miles and if to this we add the vertical depth of the cambrian strata on which the silurians lie conformably there results on the lowest computation a total depth of some seven miles now it is held by geologists that this vast series of formations must have been deposited in an area of gradual subsidence these beds could not have been thus laid one on another in regular order unless the earths crust had been at that place sinking either continuously or by small steps such an immense subsidence however must have been impossible without a crust of great thickness the earths molten nucleus tends ever with enormous force to assume the form of a regular oblate spheroid any depression of its crust below the surface of equilibrium and any elevation of its crust above that surface have to withstand immense resistances it follows inevitably that with a thin crust nothing but small elevations and subsidences would have been possible and that conversely a subsidence of seven miles implies a crust of great strength or in other words of great thickness indeed if we compare this inferred subsidence in the silurian period with such elevations and depressions as our existing continents and oceans display we see no evidence that the earths crust was appreciably thinner then than now what are the implications if as geologists generally admit the earths crust has resulted from that slow cooling which is even still going onif we see no sign that at the time when the earliest cambrian strata were formed this crust was appreciably thinner than now we are forced to conclude that the era during which it acquired that great thickness possessed in the cambrian period was enormous as compared with the interval between the cambrian period and our own but during the incalculable series of epochs thus implied there existed an ocean tides winds waves rain rivers the agencies by which the denudation of continents and filling up of seas have all along been carried on were as active then as now endless successions of strata must have been formed and when we askwhere are they natures obvious reply isthey have been destroyed by that igneous action to which so great a part of our oldestknown strata owe their fusion or metamorphosis  only the last chapter of the earths history has come down to us the many previous chapters stretching back to a time immeasurably remote have been burnt and with them all the records of life we may presume they contained the greater part of the evidence which might have served to settle the developmentcontroversy is for ever lost and on neither side can the arguments derived from geology be conclusive  but how happen there to be such evidences of progression as exist it may be asked how happens it that in ascending from the most ancient strata to the most recent strata we do find a succession of organic forms which however irregularly carries us from lower to higher this question seems difficult to answer nevertheless there is reason for thinking that nothing can be safely inferred from the apparent progression here cited and the illustration which shows as much will we believe also show how little trust is to be placed in certain geological generalizations that appear to be well established with this somewhat elaborate illustration to which we now pass our criticisms may fitly conclude                                       let us suppose that in a region now covered by wide ocean there begins one of those great and gradual upheavals by which new continents are formed to be precise let us say that in the south pacific midway between new zealand and patagonia the seabottom has been little by little thrust up toward the surface and is about to emerge what will be the successive phenomena geological and biological which are likely to occur before this emerging seabottom has become another europe or asia in the first place such portions of the incipient land as are raised to the level of the waves will be rapidly denuded by them their soft substance will be torn up by the breakers carried away by the local currents and deposited in neighbouring deeper water successive small upheavals will bring new and larger areas within reach of the waves fresh portions will each time be removed from the surfaces previously denuded and further some of the newlyformed strata being elevated nearly to the level of the water will be washed away and redeposited in course of time the harder formations of the upraised seabottom will be uncovered these being less easily destroyed will remain permanently above the surface and at their margins will arise the usual breaking down of rocks into beachsand and pebbles while in the slow course of this elevation going on at the rate of perhaps two or three feet in a century most of the sedimentary deposits produced will be again and again destroyed and reformed there will in those adjacent areas of subsidence which accompany areas of elevation be more or less continuous successions of sedimentary deposits lying on the preexisting ocean bed and now what will be the character of these strata old and new they will contain scarcely any traces of life the deposits that had previously been slowly formed at the bottom of this wide ocean would be sprinkled with fossils of but few species the oceanic fauna is not a rich one its hydrozoa do not admit of preservation and the hard parts of its few kinds of molluscs and crustaceans and insects are mostly fragile hence when the oceanbed was here and there raised to the surfacewhen its strata of sediment with their contained organic fragments were torn up and long washed about by the breakers before being redepositedwhen the redeposits were again and again subject to this violent abrading action by subsequent small elevations as they would mostly be what few fragile organic remains they contained would be in nearly all cases destroyed thus such of the firstformed strata as survived the repeated changes of level would be practically azoic like the cambrian of our geologists when by the washing away of the soft deposits the hard substrata had been exposed in the shape of rocky islets and a footing had thus been furnished the pioneers of a new life might be expected to make their appearance what would they be not any of the surrounding oceanic species for these are not fitted for a littoral life but species flourishing on some of the fardistant shores of the pacific of such the first to establish themselves would be seaweeds and zoophytes because the most readily conveyed on floating wood c and because when conveyed they would find fit food it is true that cirrhipeds and lamellibranchs subsisting on the minute creatures which everywhere people the sea would also find fit food but the chances of early colonization are in favour of species which multiplying by agamogenesis can people a whole shore from a single germ and against species which multiplying only by gamogenesis must be introduced in considerable numbers that some may propagate thus we infer that the earliest traces of life left in the sedimentary deposits near these new shores will be traces of life as humble as that indicated in the most ancient rocks of great britain and ireland imagine now that the processes above indicated continuethat the emerging lands become wider in extent and fringed by higher and more varied shores and that there still go on those oceancurrents which at long intervals convey from far distant shores immigrant forms of life what will result lapse of time will of course favour the introduction of such new forms admitting as it must of those combinations of fit conditions which can occur only after long intervals moreover the increasing area of the islands individually and as a group implies increasing length of coast and therefore a longer line of contact with the streams and waves which bring drifting masses bearing germs of fresh life and once more the comparativelyvaried shores presenting physical conditions which change from mile to mile will furnish suitable habitats for more numerous species so that as the elevation proceeds three causes conspire to introduce additional marine plants and animals to what classes will the increasing fauna be for a long period confined of course to classes of which individuals or their germs are most liable to be carried far away from their native shores by floating seaweed or driftwood to classes which are also least likely to perish in transit or from change of climate and to those which can best subsist around coasts comparatively bare of life evidently then corals annelids inferior molluscs and crustaceans of low grade will chiefly constitute the early fauna the large predatory members of these classes will be later in establishing themselves both because the new shores must first become well peopled by the creatures they prey on and because being more complex they or their ova must be less likely to survive the journey and the change of conditions we may infer then that the strata deposited next after the almost azoic strata would contain the remains of invertebrata allied to those found near the shores of australia and south america of such invertebrate remains the lower beds would furnish comparatively few genera and those of relatively low types while in the upper beds the number of genera would be greater and the types higher just as among the fossils of our silurian system as this great geologic change slowly advanced through its long history of earthquakes volcanic disturbances minor upheavals and subsidencesas the extent of the archipelago became greater and its smaller islands coalesced into larger ones while its coastline grew still longer and more varied and the neighbouring sea more thickly inhabited by inferior forms of life the lowest division of the vertebrata would begin to be represented in order of time fish would naturally come later than the lower invertebrata both as being less likely to have their ova transported across the waste of waters and as requiring for their subsistence a preexisting fauna of some development they might be expected to make their appearance along with the predaceous crustaceans as they do in the uppermost silurian rocks and here too let us remark that as during this long epoch we have been describing the sea would have made great inroads on some of the newlyraised lands which had remained stationary and would probably in some places have reached masses of igneous or metamorphic rocks there might in course of time arise by the decomposition and denudation of such rocks local deposits coloured with oxide of iron like our old red sandstone and in these deposits might be buried the remains of the fish then peopling the neighbouring sea  meanwhile how would the surfaces of the upheaved masses be occupied at first their deserts of naked rocks would bear only the humblest forms of vegetal life such as we find in grey and orange patches on our own rugged mountain sides for these alone could flourish on such surfaces and their spores would be the most readily transported when by the decay of such protophytes and that decomposition of rock effected by them there had resulted a fit habitat for mosses these of which the germs might be conveyed in drifted trees would begin to spread a soil having been eventually thus produced it would become possible for plants of higher organization to find roothold and as the archipelago and its constituent islands grew larger and had more multiplied relations with winds and waters such higher plants might be expected ultimately to have their seeds transferred from the nearest lands after something like a flora had thus colonized the surface it would become possible for insects to exist and of airbreathing creatures insects would manifestly be among the first to find their way from elsewhere as however terrestrial organisms both vegetal and animal are less likely than marine organisms to survive the accidents of transport from distant shores it is inferable that long after the sea surrounding these new lands had acquired a varied flora and fauna the lands themselves would still be comparatively bare and thus that the early strata like our silurians would afford no traces of terrestrial life by the time that large areas had been raised above the ocean we may fairly suppose a luxuriant vegetation to have been acquired under what circumstances are we likely to find this vegetation fossilized large surfaces of land imply large rivers with their accompanying deltas and are liable to have lakes and swamps these as we know from extant cases are favourable to rank vegetation and afford the conditions needful for preserving it in coalbeds observe then that while in the early history of such a continent a carboniferous period could not occur the occurrence of a carboniferous period would become probable after longcontinued upheavals had uncovered large areas as in our own sedimentary series coalbeds would make their appearance only after there had been enormous accumulations of earlier strata charged with marine fossils  let us ask next in what order the higher forms of animal life would make their appearance we have seen how in the succession of marine forms there would be something like a progress from the lower to the higher bringing us in the end to predaceous molluscs crustaceans and fish what are likely to succeed fish after marine creatures those which would have the greatest chance of surviving the voyage would be amphibious reptiles both because they are more tenacious of life than higher animals and because they would be less completely out of their element such reptiles as can live in both fresh and salt water like alligators and such as are drifted out of the mouths of great rivers on floating trees as humboldt says the orinoco alligators are might be early colonists it is manifest too that reptiles of other kinds would be among the first vertebrata to people the new continent if we consider what will occur on one of those natural rafts of trees soil and matted vegetable matter sometimes swept out to sea by such currents as the mississippi with a miscellaneous living cargo we shall see that while the active hotblooded highlyorganized creatures will soon die of starvation and exposure the inert coldblooded ones which can go long without food will live perhaps for weeks and so out of the chances from time to time occurring during long periods reptiles will be the first to get safely landed on foreign shores as indeed they are even now known sometimes to be the transport of mammalia being comparatively precarious must in the order of probability be longer postponed and would indeed be unlikely to occur until by the enlargement of the new continent the distances of its shores from adjacent lands had been greatly diminished or the formation of intervening islands had increased the chances of survival assuming however that the facilities for immigration had become adequate which would be the first mammals to arrive and live not large herbivores for they would be soon drowned if by any accident carried out to sea not the carnivora for these would lack appropriate food even if they outlived the voyage small quadrupeds frequenting trees and feeding on insects would be those most likely both to be drifted away from their native lands and to find fit food in a new one insectivorous mammals like in size to those found in the trias and the stonesfield slate might naturally be looked for as the pioneers of the higher vertebrata and if we suppose the facilities of communication to be again increased either by a further shallowing of the intervening sea and a consequent multiplication of islands or by an actual junction of the new continent with an old one through continued upheavals we should finally have an influx of the larger and more perfect mammals  now rude as is this sketch of a process that would be extremely elaborate and involved and open as some of its propositions are to criticisms which there is no space here to meet no one will deny that it represents something like the biologic history of the supposed new continent details apart it is manifest that simple organisms able to flourish under simple conditions of life would be the first successful immigrants and that more complex organisms needing for their existence the fulfilment of more complex conditions would afterwards establish themselves in something like an ascending succession at the one extreme we see every facility the new individuals can be conveyed in the shape of minute germs immense numbers of these are perpetually being carried in all directions to great distances by oceancurrentseither detached or attached to floating bodies they can find nutriment wherever they arrive and the resulting organisms can multiply asexually with great rapidity at the other extreme we see every difficulty the new individuals must be conveyed in their adult forms their numbers are in comparison utterly insignificant they live on land and are very unlikely to be carried out to sea when so carried the chances are immense against their escape from drowning starvation or death by cold if they survive the transit they must have a preexisting flora or fauna to supply their special food they require also the fulfilment of various other physical conditions and unless at least two individuals of different sexes are safely landed the race cannot be established manifestly then the immigration of each successively higher order of organisms having from one or other additional condition to be fulfilled an enormouslyincreased probability against it would naturally be separated from the immigration of a lower order by some period like a geologic epoch and thus the successive sedimentary deposits formed while this new continent was undergoing gradual elevation would seem to furnish clear evidence of a general progress in the forms of life that lands thus raised up in the midst of a wide ocean would first give origin to unfossiliferous strata next to strata containing only the lowest marine forms next to strata containing only the higher marine forms ascending finally to fish and that the strata above these would contain reptiles then small mammals then great mammals seems to us demonstrable and if the succession of fossils presented by the strata of this supposed new continent would thus simulate the succession presented by our own sedimentary series must we not conclude that our own sedimentary series very possibly records nothing more than the phenomena accompanying one of these great upheavals the probability of this conclusion being admitted it must be admitted that the facts of paleontology can never suffice either to prove or disprove the development hypothesis but that the most they can do is to show whether the last few pages of the earths biologic history are or are not in harmony with this hypothesiswhether the existing flora and fauna can or can not be affiliated upon the flora and fauna of the most recent geologic times  footnote  footnote 27 sir charles lyell is no longer to be classed among uniformitarians with rare and admirable candour he has since this was written yielded to the arguments of mr darwin     bain on the emotions and the will      first published in the medicochirurgical review for january     1860   after the controversy between the neptunists and the vulcanists had been long carried on without definite results there came a reaction against all speculative geology reasoning without adequate data having led to nothing inquirers went into the opposite extreme and confining themselves wholly to collecting data relinquished reasoning the geological society of london was formed with the express object of accumulating evidence for many years hypotheses were forbidden at its meetings and only of late have attempts to organize the mass of observations into consistent theory been tolerated  this reaction and subsequent rereaction well illustrate the recent history of english thought in general the time was when our countrymen speculated certainly to as great an extent as any other people on all those high questions which present themselves to the human intellect and indeed a glance at the systems of philosophy that are or have been current on the continent suffices to show how much other nations owe to the discoveries of our ancestors for a generation or two however these more abstract subjects have fallen into neglect and among those who plume themselves on being practical even into contempt partly perhaps a natural accompaniment of our rapid material growth this intellectual phase has been in great measure due to the exhaustion of argument and the necessity for better data not so much with a conscious recognition of the end to be subserved as from an unconscious subordination to that rhythm traceable in social changes as in other things an era of theorizing without observing has been followed by an era of observing without theorizing during this longcontinued devotion to concrete science an immense quantity of raw material for abstract science has been accumulated and now there is obviously commencing a period in which this accumulated raw material will be organized into consistent theory on all sidesequally in the inorganic sciences in the science of life and in the science of societywe may note the tendency to pass from the superficial and empirical to the more profound and rational  in psychology this change is conspicuous the facts brought to light by anatomists and physiologists during the last fifty years are at length being used towards the interpretation of this highest class of biological phenomena and already there is promise of a great advance the work of mr alexander bain of which the second volume has been recently issued may be regarded as especially characteristic of the transition it gives us in orderly arrangement the great mass of evidence supplied by modern science towards the buildingup of a coherent system of mental philosophy it is not in itself a system of mental philosophy properly so called but a classified collection of materials for such a system presented with that method and insight which scientific discipline generates and accompanied with occasional passages of an analytical character it is indeed that which it in the main professes to bea natural history of the mind were we to say that the researches of the naturalist who collects and dissects and describes species bear the same relation to the researches of the comparative anatomist tracing out the laws of organization which mr bains labours bear to the labours of the abstract psychologist we should be going somewhat too far for mr bains work is not wholly descriptive still however such an analogy conveys the best general conception of what he has done and serves most clearly to indicate its needfulness for as before there can be made anything like true generalizations respecting the classification of organisms and the laws of organization there must be an extensive accumulation of the facts presented in numerous organic bodies so without a tolerablycomplete delineation of mental phenomena of all orders there can scarcely arise any adequate theory of mind until recently mental science has been pursued much as physical science was pursued by the ancients not by drawing conclusions from observations and experiments but by drawing them from arbitrary a priori assumptions this course long since abandoned in the one case with immense advantage is gradually being abandoned in the other and the treatment of psychology as a division of natural history shows that the abandonment will soon be complete  estimated as a means to higher results mr bains work is of great value of its kind it is the most scientific in conception the most catholic in spirit and the most complete in execution besides delineating the various classes of mental phenomena as seen under that stronger light thrown on them by modern science it includes in the picture much which previous writers had omittedpartly from prejudice partly from ignorance we refer more especially to the participation of bodily organs in mental changes and the addition to the primary mental changes of those many secondary ones which the actions of the bodily organs generate mr bain has we believe been the first to appreciate the importance of this element in our states of consciousness and it is one of his merits that he shows how constant and large an element it is further the relations of voluntary and involuntary movements are elucidated in a way that was not possible to writers unacquainted with the modern doctrine of reflex action and beyond this some of the analytical passages that here and there occur contain important ideas  valuable however as is mr bains work we regard it as essentially transitional it presents in a digested form the results of a period of observation adds to these results many welldelineated facts collected by himself arranges new and old materials with that more scientific method which the discipline of our times has fostered and so prepares the way for better generalizations but almost of necessity its classifications and conclusions are provisional in the growth of each science not only is correct observation needful for the formation of true theory but true theory is needful as a preliminary to correct observation of course we do not intend this assertion to be taken literally but as a strong expression of the fact that the two must advance hand in hand the first crude theory or rough classification based on very slight knowledge of the phenomena is requisite as a means of reducing the phenomena to some kind of order and as supplying a conception with which fresh phenomena may be compared and their agreement or disagreement noted incongruities being by and by made manifest by wider examination of cases there comes such modification of the theory as brings it into a nearer correspondence with the evidence this reacts to the further advance of observation more extensive and complete observation brings additional corrections of theory and so on till the truth is reached in mental science the systematic collection of facts having but recently commenced it is not to be expected that the results can be at once rightly formulated all that may be looked for are approximate generalizations which will presently serve for the better directing of inquiry hence even were it not now possible to say in what way it does so we might be tolerably certain that mr bains work bears the stamp of the inchoate state of psychology  we think however that it will not be difficult to find in what respects its organization is provisional and at the same time to show what must be the nature of a more complete organization we propose here to attempt this illustrating our positions from his recentlyissued second volume                                       is it possible to make a true classification without the aid of analysis or must there not be an analytical basis to every true classification can the real relations of things be determined by the obvious characteristics of the things or does it not commonly happen that certain hidden characteristics on which the obvious ones depend are the truly significant ones this is the preliminary question which a glance at mr bains scheme of the emotions suggests  though not avowedly yet by implication mr bain assumes that a right conception of the nature the order and the relations of the emotions may be arrived at by contemplating their conspicuous objective and subjective characters as displayed in the adult after pointing out that we lack those means of classification which serve in the case of the sensations he says       in these circumstances we must turn our attention to the manner      of diffusion of the different passions and emotions in order to      obtain a basis of classification analogous to the arrangement of      the sensations if what we have already advanced on that subject be      at all well founded this is the genuine turning point of the      method to be chosen for the same mode of diffusion will always be      accompanied by the same mental experience and each of the two      aspects would identify and would be evidence of the other there      is therefore nothing so thoroughly characteristic of any state of      feeling as the nature of the diffusive wave that embodies it or      the various organs specially roused into action by it together      with the manner of the action the only drawback is our comparative      ignorance and our inability to discern the precise character of      the diffusive currents in every case a radical imperfection in the      science of mind as constituted at present       our own consciousness formerly reckoned the only medium of      knowledge to the mental philosopher must therefore be still      referred to as a principal means of discriminating the varieties of      human feeling we have the power of noting agreement and difference      among our conscious states and on this we can raise a structure of      classification we recognise such generalities as pleasure pain      love anger through the property of mental or intellectual      discrimination that accompanies in our mind the fact of emotion a      certain degree of precision is attainable by this mode of mental      comparison and analysis the farther we can carry such precision      the better but that is no reason why it should stand alone to the      neglect of the corporeal embodiments through which one mind reveals      itself to others the companionship of inward feeling with bodily      manifestation is a fact of the human constitution and deserves to      be studied as such and it would be difficult to find a place more      appropriate than a treatise on the mind for setting forth the      conjunctions and sequences traceable in this department of nature      i shall make no scruple in conjoining with the description of the      mental phenomena the physical appearances in so far as i am able      to ascertain them       there is still one other quarter to be referred to in settling a      complete arrangement of the emotions namely the varieties of      human conduct and the machinery created in subservience to our      common susceptibilities for example the vast superstructure of      fine art has its foundations in human feeling and in rendering an      account of this we are led to recognise the interesting group of      artistic or æsthetic emotions the same outward reference to      conduct and creations brings to light the socalled moral sense in      man whose foundations in the mental system have accordingly to be      examined       combining together these various indications or sources of      discriminationoutward objects diffusive mode or expression      inward consciousness resulting conduct and institutionsi adopt      the following arrangement of the families or natural orders of      emotion  here then are confessedly adopted as bases of classification the most manifest characters of the emotions as discerned subjectively and objectively the mode of diffusion of an emotion is one of its outside aspects the institutions it generates form another of its outside aspects and though the peculiarities of the emotion as a state of consciousness seem to express its intrinsic and ultimate nature yet such peculiarities as are perceptible by simple introspection must also be classed as superficial peculiarities it is a familiar fact that various intellectual states of consciousness turn out when analyzed to have natures widely unlike those which at first appear and we believe the like will prove true of emotional states of consciousness just as our concept of space which is apt to be thought a simple undecomposable concept is yet resolvable into experiences quite different from that state of consciousness which we call space so probably the sentiment of affection or reverence is compounded of elements that are severally distinct from the whole which they make up and much as a classification of our ideas which dealt with the idea of space as though it were ultimate would be a classification of ideas by their externals so a classification of our emotions which regarding them as simple describes their aspects in ordinary consciousness is a classification of emotions by their externals  thus then mr bains grouping is throughout determined by the most manifest attributesthose objectively displayed in the natural language of the emotions and in the social phenomena that result from them and those subjectively displayed in the aspects the emotions assume in an analytical consciousness and the question iscan they be correctly grouped after this method  we think not and had mr bain carried farther an idea with which he has set out he would probably have seen that they cannot as already said he avowedly adopts the naturalhistorymethod not only referring to it in his preface but in his first chapter giving examples of botanical and zoological classifications as illustrating the mode in which he proposes to deal with the emotions this we conceive to be a philosophical conception and we have only to regret that mr bain has overlooked some of its most important implications for in what has essentially consisted the progress of naturalhistoryclassification in the abandonment of grouping by external conspicuous characters and in the making of certain internal but allessential characters the bases of groups whales are not now ranged along with fish because in their general forms and habits of life they resemble fish but they are ranged with mammals because the type of their organization as ascertained by dissection corresponds with that of mammals no longer considered as seaweeds in virtue of their forms and modes of growth polyzoa are now shown by examination of their economy to belong to the animal kingdom it is found then that the discovery of real relationships involves analysis it has turned out that the earlier classifications guided by general resemblances though containing much truth and though very useful provisionally were yet in many cases radically wrong and that the true affinities of organisms and the true homologies of their parts are to be made out only by examining their hidden structures another fact of great significance in the history of classification is also to be noted very frequently the kinship of an organism cannot be made out even by exhaustive analysis if that analysis is confined to the adult structure in many cases it is needful to examine the structure in its earlier stages and even in its embryonic stage so difficult was it for instance to determine the true position of the cirrhipedia among animals by examining mature individuals only that cuvier erroneously classed them with mollusca even after dissecting them and not until their early forms were discovered were they clearly proved to belong to the crustacea so important indeed is the study of development as a means to classification that the first zoologists now hold it to be the only absolute criterion  here then in the advance of naturalhistoryclassification are two fundamental facts which should be borne in mind when classifying the emotions if as mr bain rightly assumes the emotions are to be grouped after the naturalhistorymethod then it should be the naturalhistorymethod in its complete form and not in its rude form mr bain will doubtless agree in the belief that a correct account of the emotions in their natures and relations must correspond with a correct account of the nervous systemmust form another side of the same ultimate facts structure and function must necessarily harmonize structures which have with each other certain ultimate connexions must have functions which have answering connexions structures which have arisen in certain ways must have functions which have arisen in parallel ways and hence if analysis and development are needful for the right interpretation of structures they must be needful for the right interpretation of functions just as a scientific description of the digestive organs must include not only their obvious forms and connexions but their microscopic characters and also the ways in which they severally result by differentiation from the primitive mucous membrane so must a scientific account of the nervous system include its general arrangements its minute structure and its mode of evolution and so must a scientific account of nervous actions include the answering three elements alike in classing separate organisms and in classing the parts of the same organism the complete naturalhistorymethod involves ultimate analysis aided by development and mr bain in not basing his classification of the emotions on characters reached through these aids has fallen short of the conception with which he set out  but it will perhaps be asked how are the emotions to be analyzed and their modes of evolution to be ascertained different animals and different organs of the same animal may readily be compared in their internal structures and microscopic structures as also in their developments but functions and especially such functions as the emotions do not admit of like comparisons  it must be admitted that the application of these methods is here by no means so easy though we can note differences and similarities between the internal formations of two animals it is difficult to contrast the mental states of two animals though the true morphological relations of organs may be made out by observation of embryos yet where such organs are inactive before birth we cannot completely trace the history of their actions obviously too pursuance of inquiries of the kind indicated raises questions which science is not yet prepared to answer as for instancewhether all nervous functions in common with all other functions arise by gradual differentiations as their organs do whether the emotions are therefore to be regarded as divergent modes of action that have become unlike by successive modifications whether as two organs which originally budded out of the same membrane have not only become different as they developed but have also severally become compound internally though externally simple so two emotions simple and near akin in their roots may not only have grown unlike but may also have grown involved in their natures though seeming homogeneous to consciousness and here indeed in the inability of existing science to answer these questions which underlie a true psychological classification we see how purely provisional any present classification is likely to be  nevertheless even now classification may be aided by development and ultimate analysis to a considerable extent and the defect in mr bains work is that he has not systematically availed himself of them as far as possible thus we may in the first place study the evolution of the emotions up through the various grades of the animal kingdom observing which of them are earliest and exist with the lowest organization and intelligence in what order the others accompany higher endowments and how they are severally related to the conditions of life in the second place we may note the emotional differences between the lower and the higher human racesmay regard as earlier and simpler those feelings which are common to both and as later and more compound those which are characteristic of the most civilized in the third place we may observe the order in which the emotions unfold during the progress from infancy to maturity and lastly comparing these three kinds of emotional development displayed in the ascending grades of the animal kingdom in the advance of the civilized races and in individual history we may see in what respects they harmonize and what are the implied general truths  having gathered together and generalized these several classes of facts analysis of the emotions would be made easier setting out with the assumption that every new form of emotion making its appearance in the individual or the race is a modification of some preexisting emotion or a compound of several preexisting emotions we should be greatly aided by knowing what always are the preexisting emotions when for example we find that very few of the lower animals show any love of accumulation and that this feeling is absent in infancywhen we see that an infant in arms exhibits anger fear wonder while yet it manifests no desire of permanent possession and that a brute which has no acquisitiveness can nevertheless feel attachment jealousy love of approbation we may suspect that the feeling which property satisfies is compounded out of simpler and deeper feelings we may conclude that as when a dog hides a bone there must exist in him a prospective gratification of hunger so there must similarly at first in all cases where anything is secured or taken possession of exist an ideal excitement of the feeling which that thing will gratify we may further conclude that when the intelligence is such that a variety of objects come to be utilized for different purposeswhen as among savages divers wants are satisfied through the articles appropriated for weapons shelter clothing ornament the act of appropriating comes to be one constantly involving agreeable associations and one which is therefore pleasurable irrespective of the end subserved and when as in civilized life the property acquired is of a kind not conducing to one order of gratification in particular but is capable of administering to all gratifications the pleasure of acquiring property grows more distinct from each of the various pleasures subservedis more completely differentiated into a separate emotion  this illustration roughly as it is sketched will show what we mean by the use of comparative psychology in aid of classification ascertaining by induction the actual order of evolution of the emotions we are led to suspect this to be their order of successive dependence and are so led to recognize their order of ascending complexity and by consequence their true groupings  thus in the very process of arranging the emotions into grades beginning with those involved in the lowest forms of conscious activity and ending with those peculiar to the adult civilized man the way is opened for that ultimate analysis which alone can lead us to the true science of the matter for when we find both that there exist in a man feelings which do not exist in a child and that the european is characterized by some sentiments which are wholly or in great part absent from the savagewhen we see that besides the new emotions which arise spontaneously as the individual becomes completely organized there are new emotions making their appearance in the more advanced divisions of our race we are led to askhow are new emotions generated the lowest savages have not even the ideas of justice or mercy they have neither words for them nor can they be made to conceive them and the manifestation of them by europeans they ascribe to fear or cunning there are æsthetic emotions common among ourselves which are scarcely in any degree experienced by some inferior races as for instance those produced by music to which instances may be added the less marked but more numerous contrasts that exist between civilized races in the degrees of their several emotions and if it is manifest both that all the emotions are capable of being permanently modified in the course of successive generations and that what must be classed as new emotions may be brought into existence then it follows that nothing like a true conception of the emotions is to be obtained until we understand how they are evolved  comparative psychology while it raises this inquiry prepares the way for answering it when observing the differences between races we can scarcely fail to observe also how these differences correspond with differences between their conditions of existence and consequent activities among the lowest races of men love of property stimulates to the obtainment only of such things as satisfy immediate desires or desires of the immediate future improvidence is the rule there is little effort to meet remote contingencies but the growth of established societies having gradually given security of possession there has been an increasing tendency to provide for coming years there has been a constant exercise of the feeling which is satisfied by a provision for the future and there has been a growth of this feeling so great that it now prompts accumulation to an extent beyond what is needful note again that under the discipline of social lifeunder a comparative abstinence from aggressive actions and a performance of those naturallyserviceable actions implied by the division of labourthere has been a development of those gentle emotions of which inferior races exhibit but the rudiments savages delight in giving pain rather than pleasureare almost devoid of sympathy while among ourselves philanthropy organizes itself in laws establishes numerous institutions and dictates countless private benefactions  from which and other like facts does it not seem an unavoidable inference that new emotions are developed by new experiencesnew habits of life all are familiar with the truth that in the individual each feeling may be strengthened by performing those actions which it prompts and to say that the feeling is strengthened is to say that it is in part made by these actions we know further that not unfrequently individuals by persistence in special courses of conduct acquire special likings for such courses disagreeable as these may be to others and these whims or morbid tastes imply incipient emotions corresponding to these special activities we know that emotional characteristics in common with all others are hereditary and the differences between civilized nations descended from the same stock show us the cumulative results of small modifications hereditarily transmitted and when we see that between savage and civilized races which diverged from one another in the remote past and have for a hundred generations followed modes of life becoming ever more unlike there exist still greater emotional contrasts may we not infer that the more or less distinct emotions which characterize civilized races are the organized results of certain dailyrepeated combinations of mental states which social life involves must we not say that habits not only modify emotions in the individual and not only beget tendencies to like habits and accompanying emotions in descendants but that when the conditions of the race make the habits persistent this progressive modification may go on to the extent of producing emotions so far distinct as to seem new and if so we may suspect that such new emotions and by implication all emotions analytically considered consist of aggregated and consolidated groups of those simpler feelings which habitually occur together in experience when in the circumstances of any race some one kind of action or set of actions sensation or set of sensations is usually followed or accompanied by various other sets of actions or sensations and so entails a large mass of pleasurable or painful states of consciousness these by frequent repetition become so connected together that the initial action or sensation brings the ideas of all the rest crowding into consciousness producing in some degree the pleasures or pains that have before been felt in reality and when this relation besides being frequently repeated in the individual occurs in successive generations all the many nervous actions involved tend to grow organically connected they become incipiently reflex and on the occurrence of the appropriate stimulus the whole nervous apparatus which in past generations was brought into activity by this stimulus becomes nascently excited even while yet there have been no individual experiences a vague feeling of pleasure or pain is produced constituting what we may call the body of the emotion and when the experiences of past generations come to be repeated in the individual the emotion gains both strength and definiteness and is accompanied by the appropriate specific ideas  this view of the matter which we believe the established truths of physiology and psychology unite in indicating and which is the view that generalizes the phenomena of habit of national characteristics of civilization in its moral aspects at the same time that it gives us a conception of emotion in its origin and ultimate nature may be illustrated from the mental modifications undergone by animals on newlydiscovered lands not inhabited by man birds are so devoid of fear as to allow themselves to be knocked over with sticks but in the course of generations they acquire such a dread of man as to fly on his approach and this dread is manifested by young as well as by old now unless this change be ascribed to the killingoff of the less fearful and the preservation and multiplication of the more fearful which considering the comparatively small number killed by man is an inadequate cause it must be ascribed to accumulated experiences and each experience must be held to have a share in producing it we must conclude that in each bird which escapes with injuries inflicted by man or is alarmed by the outcries of other members of the flock gregarious creatures of any intelligence being necessarily more or less sympathetic there is established an association of ideas between the human aspect and the pains direct and indirect suffered from human agency and we must further conclude that the state of consciousness which impels the bird to take flight is at first nothing more than an ideal reproduction of those painful impressions which before followed mans approach that such ideal reproduction becomes more vivid and more massive as the painful experiences direct or sympathetic increase and that thus the emotion in its incipient state is nothing else than an aggregation of the revived pains before experienced as in the course of generations the young birds of this race begin to display a fear of man before yet they have been injured by him it is an unavoidable inference that the nervous system of the race has been organically modified by these experiences we have no choice but to conclude that when a young bird is thus led to fly it is because the impression produced on its senses by the approaching man entails through an incipientlyreflex action a partial excitement of all those nerves which in its ancestors had been excited under the like conditions that this partial excitement has its accompanying painful consciousness and that the vague painful consciousness thus arising constitutes emotion properemotion undecomposable into specific experiences and therefore seemingly homogeneous  if such be the explanation of the fact in this case then it is in all cases if emotion is so generated here then it is so generated throughout we must perforce conclude that the emotional modifications displayed by different nations and those higher emotions by which civilized are distinguished from savage are to be accounted for on the same principle and concluding this we are led strongly to suspect that the emotions in general have severally thus originated  perhaps we have now made sufficiently clear what we mean by the study of the emotions through analysis and development we have aimed to justify the positions that without analysis aided by development there cannot be a true natural history of the emotions and that a natural history of the emotions based on external characters can be but provisional we think that mr bain in confining himself to an account of the emotions as they exist in the adult civilized man has neglected those classes of facts out of which the science of the matter must chiefly be built it is true that he has treated of habits as modifying emotions in the individual but he has not recognized the fact that where conditions render habits persistent in successive generations such modifications are cumulative he has not hinted that the modifications produced by habit are emotions in the making it is true also that he occasionally refers to the characteristics of children but he does not systematically trace the changes through which childhood passes into manhood as throwing light on the order and genesis of the emotions it is further true that he here and there refers to national traits in illustration of his subject but these stand as isolated facts having no general significance there is no hint of any relation between them and the national circumstances while all those many moral contrasts between lower and higher races which throw great light on classification are passed over and once more it is true that many passages of his work and sometimes indeed whole sections of it are analytical but his analyses are incidentalthey do not underlie his entire scheme but are here and there added to it in brief he has written a descriptive psychology which does not appeal to comparative psychology and analytical psychology for its leading ideas and in doing this he has omitted much that should be included in a natural history of the mind while to that part of the subject with which he has dealt he has given a necessarilyimperfect organization                                       even leaving out of view the absence of those methods and criteria on which we have been insisting it appears to us that meritorious as is mr bains book in its details it is defective in some of its leading ideas the first paragraphs of his first chapter quite startled us by the strangeness of their definitionsa strangeness which can scarcely be ascribed to laxity of expression the paragraphs run thus       mind is comprised under three headsemotion volition and      intellect       emotion is the name here used to comprehend all that is understood      by feelings states of feeling pleasures pains passions      sentiments affections consciousness and conscious states also      for the most part denote modes of emotion although there is such a      thing as the intellectual consciousness       volition on the other hand indicates the great fact that our      pleasures and pains which are not the whole of our emotions      prompt to action or stimulate the active machinery of the living      framework to perform such operations as procure the first and abate      the last to withdraw from a scalding heat and cling to a gentle      warmth are exercises of volition  the last of these definitions which we may most conveniently take first seems to us very faulty we cannot but feel astonished that mr bain familiar as he is with the phenomena of reflex action should have so expressed himself as to include a great part of them along with the phenomena of volition he seems to be ignoring the discriminations of modern science and returning to the vague conceptions of the pastnay more he is comprehending under volition what even the popular speech would hardly bring under it if you were to blame any one for snatching his foot from the scalding water into which he had inadvertently put it he would tell you that he could not help it and his reply would be indorsed by the general experience that the withdrawal of a limb from contact with something extremely hot is quite involuntarythat it takes place not only without volition but in defiance of an effort of will to maintain the contact how then can that be instanced as an example of volition which occurs even when volition is antagonistic we are quite aware that it is impossible to draw any absolute line of demarcation between automatic actions and actions which are not automatic doubtless we may pass gradually from the purely reflex through the consensual to the voluntary taking the case mr bain cites it is manifest that from a heat of such moderate degree that the withdrawal from it is wholly voluntary we may advance by infinitesimal steps to a heat which compels involuntary withdrawal and that there is a stage at which the voluntary and involuntary actions are mixed but the difficulty of absolute discrimination is no reason for neglecting the broad general contrast any more than it is for confounding light with darkness if we are to include as examples of volition all cases in which pleasures and pains stimulate the active machinery of the living framework to perform such operations as procure the first and abate the last then we must consider sneezing and coughing as examples of volition and mr bain surely cannot mean this indeed we must confess ourselves at a loss on the one hand if he does not mean it his expression is lax to a degree that surprises us in so careful a writer on the other hand if he does mean it we cannot understand his point of view  a parallel criticism applies to his definition of emotion here too he has departed from the ordinary acceptation of the word and as we think in the wrong direction whatever may be the interpretation that is justified by its derivation the word emotion has come generally to mean that kind of feeling which is not a direct result of any action on the organism but is either an indirect result of such action or arises quite apart from such action it is used to indicate those sentient states which are independently generated in consciousness as distinguished from those generated in our corporeal framework and known as sensations now this distinction tacitly made in common speech is one which psychology cannot well reject but one which it must adopt and to which it must give scientific precision mr bain however appears to ignore any such distinction under the term emotion he includes not only passions sentiments affections but all feelings states of feeling pleasures painsthat is all sensations this does not appear to be a mere lapse of expression for when in the opening sentence he asserts that mind is comprised under the three headsemotion volition and intellect he of necessity implies that sensation is included under one of these heads and as it cannot be included under volition or intellect it must be classed with emotion as it clearly is in the next sentence  we cannot but think this a retrograde step though distinctions which have been established in popular thought and language are not unfrequently merged in the higher generalizations of science as for instance when crabs and worms are grouped together in the subkingdom annulosa yet science very generally recognizes the validity of these distinctions as real though not fundamental and so in the present case such community as analysis discloses between sensation and emotion must not shut out the broad contrast that exists between them if there needs a wider word as there does to signify any sentient state whatever then we may fitly adopt for this purpose the word currently so used namely feeling and considering as feelings all that great division of mental states which we do not class as cognitions we may then separate this great division into the two orders sensations and emotions                                       and here we may before concluding briefly indicate the leading outlines of a classification which reduces this distinction to a scientific form and develops it somewhat furthera classification which while suggested by certain fundamental traits reached without a very lengthened inquiry is yet we believe in harmony with that disclosed by detailed analysis  leaving out of view the will which is a simple homogeneous mental state forming the link between feeling and action and not admitting of subdivisions our states of consciousness fall into two great classescognitions and feelings  cognitions or those modes of mind in which we are occupied with the relations that subsist among our feelings are divisible into four great subclasses  presentative cognitions or those in which consciousness is occupied in localizing a sensation impressed on the organismoccupied that is with the relation between this presented mental state and those other presented mental states which make up our consciousness of the part affected as when we cut ourselves  presentativerepresentative cognitions or those in which consciousness is occupied with the relation between a sensation or group of sensations and the representations of those various other sensations that accompany it in experience this is what we commonly call perceptionan act in which along with certain impressions presented to consciousness there arise in consciousness the ideas of certain other impressions ordinarily connected with the presented ones as when its visible form and colour lead us to mentally endow an orange with all its other attributes  representative cognitions or those in which consciousness is occupied with the relations among ideas or represented sensations as in all acts of recollection  rerepresentative cognitions or those in which the occupation of consciousness is not by representation of special relations that have before been presented to consciousness but those in which such represented special relations are thought of merely as comprehended in a general relationthose in which the concrete relations once experienced in so far as they become objects of consciousness at all are incidentally represented along with the abstract relation which formulates them the ideas resulting from this abstraction do not themselves represent actual experiences but are symbols which stand for groups of such actual experiencesrepresent aggregates of representations and thus they may be called rerepresentative cognitions it is clear that the process of rerepresentation is carried to higher stages as the thought becomes more abstract  feelings or those modes of mind in which we are occupied not with the relations subsisting between our sentient states but with the sentient states themselves are divisible into four parallel subclasses  presentative feelings ordinarily called sensations are those mental states in which instead of regarding a corporeal impression as of this or that kind or as located here or there we contemplate it in itself as pleasure or pain as when eating  presentativerepresentative feelings embracing a great part of what we commonly call emotions are those in which a sensation or group of sensations or group of sensations and ideas arouses a vast aggregation of represented sensations partly of individual experience but chiefly deeper than individual experience and consequently indefinite the emotion of terror may serve as an example along with certain impressions made on the eyes or ears or both are recalled in consciousness many of the pains to which such impressions have before been the antecedents and when the relation between such impressions and such pains has been habitual in the race the definite ideas of such pains which individual experience has given are accompanied by the indefinite pains that result from inherited effects of experiencesvague feelings which we may call organic representations in an infant crying at a strange sight or sound while yet in the nurses arms we see these organic representations called into existence in the shape of dim discomfort to which individual experience has yet given no specific outlines  representative feelings comprehending the ideas of the feelings above classed when they are called up apart from the appropriate external excitements as instances of these may be named the feelings with which the descriptive poet writes and which are aroused in the minds of his readers  rerepresentative feelings under which head are included those more complex sentient states that are less the direct results of external excitements than the indirect or reflex results of them the love of property is a feeling of this kind it is awakened not by the presence of any special object but by ownable objects at large and it is not from the mere presence of such object but from a certain ideal relation to them that it arises as before shown p 253 it consists not of the represented advantages of possessing this or that but of the represented advantages of possession in generalis not made up of certain concrete representations but of the abstracts of many concrete representations and so is rerepresentative the higher sentiments as that of justice are still more completely of this nature here the sentient state is compounded out of sentient states that are themselves wholly or almost wholly rerepresentative it involves representations of those lower emotions which are produced by the possession of property by freedom of action etc and thus is rerepresentative in a higher degree  this classification here roughly indicated and capable of further expansion will be found in harmony with the results of detailed analysis aided by development whether we trace mental progression through the grades of the animal kingdom through the grades of mankind or through the stages of individual growth it is obvious that the advance alike in cognitions and feelings is and must be from the presentative to the more and more remotely representative it is undeniable that intelligence ascends from those simple perceptions in which consciousness is occupied in localizing and classifying sensations to perceptions more and more compound to simple reasoning to reasoning more and more complex and abstractmore and more remote from sensation and in the evolution of feelings there is a parallel series of steps simple sensations sensations combined together sensations combined with represented sensations represented sensations organized into groups in which their separate characters are very much merged representations of these representative groups in which the original components have become still more vague in both cases the progress has necessarily been from the simple and concrete to the complex and abstract and as with the cognitions so with the feelings this must be the basis of classification  the space here occupied with criticisms on mr bains work we might have filled with exposition and eulogy had we thought this the more important though we have freely pointed out what we conceive to be its defects let it not be inferred that we question its great merits we repeat that as a natural history of the mind we believe it to be the best yet produced it is a most valuable collection of carefullyelaborated materials perhaps we cannot better express our sense of its worth than by saying that to those who hereafter give to this branch of psychology a thoroughly scientific organization mr bains book will be indispensable     the social organism      first published in the westminster review for january 1860   sir james macintosh got great credit for the saying that constitutions are not made but grow in our day the most significant thing about this saying is that it was ever thought so significant as from the surprise displayed by a man at some familiar fact you may judge of his general culture so from the admiration which an age accords to a new thought its average degree of enlightenment may be inferred that this apophthegm of macintosh should have been quoted and requoted as it has shows how profound has been the ignorance of social science a small ray of truth has seemed brilliant as a distant rushlight looks like a star in the surrounding darkness  such a conception could not indeed fail to be startling when let fall in the midst of a system of thought to which it was utterly alien universally in macintoshs day things were explained on the hypothesis of manufacture rather than that of growth as indeed they are by the majority in our own day it was held that the planets were severally projected round the sun from the creators hand with just the velocity required to balance the suns attraction the formation of the earth the separation of sea from land the production of animals were mechanical works from which god rested as a labourer rests man was supposed to be moulded after a manner somewhat akin to that in which a modeller makes a clayfigure and of course in harmony with such ideas societies were tacitly assumed to be arranged thus or thus by direct interposition of providence or by the regulations of lawmakers or by both  yet that societies are not artificially put together is a truth so manifest that it seems wonderful men should ever have overlooked it perhaps nothing more clearly shows the small value of historical studies as they have been commonly pursued you need but to look at the changes going on around or observe social organization in its leading traits to see that these are neither supernatural nor are determined by the wills of individual men as by implication the older historians teach but are consequent on general natural causes the one case of the division of labour suffices to prove this it has not been by command of any ruler that some men have become manufacturers while others have remained cultivators of the soil in lancashire millions have devoted themselves to the making of cottonfabrics in yorkshire another million lives by producing woollens and the pottery of staffordshire the cutlery of sheffield the hardware of birmingham severally occupy their hundreds of thousands these are large facts in the structure of english society but we can ascribe them neither to miracle nor to legislation it is not by the hero as king any more than by collective wisdom that men have been segregated into producers wholesale distributors and retail distributors our industrial organization from its main outlines down to its minutest details has become what it is not simply without legislative guidance but to a considerable extent in spite of legislative hindrances it has arisen under the pressure of human wants and resulting activities while each citizen has been pursuing his individual welfare and none taking thought about division of labour or conscious of the need of it division of labour has yet been ever becoming more complete it has been doing this slowly and silently few having observed it until quite modern times by steps so small that year after year the industrial arrangements have seemed just what they were beforeby changes as insensible as those through which a seed passes into a tree society has become the complex body of mutuallydependent workers which we now see and this economic organization mark is the allessential organization through the combination thus spontaneously evolved every citizen is supplied with daily necessaries while he yields some product or aid to others that we are severally alive today we owe to the regular working of this combination during the past week and could it be suddenly abolished multitudes would be dead before another week ended if these most conspicuous and vital arrangements of our social structure have arisen not by the devising of any one but through the individual efforts of citizens to satisfy their own wants we may be tolerably certain that the less important arrangements have similarly arisen  but surely it will be said the social changes directly produced by law cannot be classed as spontaneous growths when parliaments or kings order this or that thing to be done and appoint officials to do it the process is clearly artificial and society to this extent becomes a manufacture rather than a growth no not even these changes are exceptions if they be real and permanent changes the true sources of such changes lie deeper than the acts of legislators to take first the simplest instance we all know that the enactments of representative governments ultimately depend on the national will they may for a time be out of harmony with it but eventually they must conform to it and to say that the national will finally determines them is to say that they result from the average of individual desires or in other wordsfrom the average of individual natures a law so initiated therefore really grows out of the popular character in the case of a government representing a dominant class the same thing holds though not so manifestly for the very existence of a class monopolizing all power is due to certain sentiments in the commonalty without the feeling of loyalty on the part of retainers a feudal system could not exist we see in the protest of the highlanders against the abolition of heritable jurisdictions that they preferred that kind of local rule and if to the popular nature must be ascribed the growth of an irresponsible ruling class then to the popular nature must be ascribed the social arrangements which that class creates in the pursuit of its own ends even where the government is despotic the doctrine still holds the character of the people is as before the original source of this political form and as we have abundant proof other forms suddenly created will not act but rapidly retrograde to the old form moreover such regulations as a despot makes if really operative are so because of their fitness to the social state his acts being very much swayed by general opinionby precedent by the feeling of his nobles his priesthood his armyare in part immediate results of the national character and when they are out of harmony with the national character they are soon practically abrogated the failure of cromwell permanently to establish a new social condition and the rapid revival of suppressed institutions and practices after his death show how powerless is a monarch to change the type of the society he governs he may disturb he may retard or he may aid the natural process of organization but the general course of this process is beyond his control nay more than this is true those who regard the histories of societies as the histories of their great men and think that these great men shape the fates of their societies overlook the truth that such great men are the products of their societies without certain antecedentswithout a certain average national character they neither could have been generated nor could have had the culture which formed them if their society is to some extent remoulded by them they were both before and after birth moulded by their societywere the results of all those influences which fostered the ancestral character they inherited and gave their own early bias their creed morals knowledge aspirations so that such social changes as are immediately traceable to individuals of unusual power are still remotely traceable to the social causes which produced these individuals and hence from the highest point of view such social changes also are parts of the general developmental process  thus that which is so obviously true of the industrial structure of society is true of its whole structure the fact that constitutions are not made but grow is simply a fragment of the much larger fact that under all its aspects and through all its ramifications society is a growth and not a manufacture                                       a perception that there exists some analogy between the body politic and a living individual body was early reached and has from time to time reappeared in literature but this perception was necessarily vague and more or less fanciful in the absence of physiological science and especially of those comprehensive generalizations which it has but lately reached it was impossible to discern the real parallelisms  the central idea of platos model republic is the correspondence between the parts of a society and the faculties of the human mind classifying these faculties under the heads of reason will and passion he classifies the members of his ideal society under what he regards as three analogous headscouncillors who are to exercise government military or executive who are to fulfil their behests and the commonalty bent on gain and selfish gratification in other words the ruler the warrior and the craftsman are according to him the analogues of our reflective volitional and emotional powers now even were there truth in the implied assumption of a parallelism between the structure of a society and that of a man this classification would be indefensible it might more truly be contended that as the military power obeys the commands of the government it is the government which answers to the will while the military power is simply an agency set in motion by it or again it might be contended that whereas the will is a product of predominant desires to which the reason serves merely as an eye it is the craftsmen who according to the alleged analogy ought to be the moving power of the warriors  hobbes sought to establish a still more definite parallelism not however between a society and the human mind but between a society and the human body in the introduction to the work in which he develops this conception he says       for by art is created that great leviathan called a commonwealth      or state in latin civitas which is but an artificial man though      of greater stature and strength than the natural for whose      protection and defence it was intended and in which the      sovereignty is an artificial soul as giving life and motion to      the whole body the magistrates and other officers of      judicature and execution artificial joints reward and      punishment by which fastened to the seat of the sovereignty      every joint and member is moved to perform his duty are the      nerves that do the same in the body natural the wealth and      riches of all the particular members are the strength salus      populi the peoples safety its business counsellors by      whom all things needful for it to know are suggested unto it are      the memory equity and laws an artificial reason and      will concord health sedition sickness and civil      war death  and hobbes carries this comparison so far as actually to give a drawing of the leviathana vast humanshaped figure whose body and limbs are made up of multitudes of men just noting that these different analogies asserted by plato and hobbes serve to cancel each other being as they are so completely at variance we may say that on the whole those of hobbes are the more plausible but they are full of inconsistencies if the sovereignty is the soul of the bodypolitic how can it be that magistrates who are a kind of deputysovereigns should be comparable to joints or again how can the three mental functions memory reason and will be severally analogous the first to counsellors who are a class of public officers and the other two to equity and laws which are not classes of officers but abstractions or once more if magistrates are the artificial joints of society how can reward and punishment be its nerves its nerves must surely be some class of persons reward and punishment must in societies as in individuals be conditions of the nerves and not the nerves themselves  but the chief errors of these comparisons made by plato and hobbes lie much deeper both thinkers assume that the organization of a society is comparable not simply to the organization of a living body in general but to the organization of the human body in particular there is no warrant whatever for assuming this it is in no way implied by the evidence and is simply one of those fancies which we commonly find mixed up with the truths of early speculation still more erroneous are the two conceptions in this that they construe a society as an artificial structure platos model republichis ideal of a healthful bodypoliticis to be consciously put together by men just as a watch might be and plato manifestly thinks of societies in general as thus originated quite specifically does hobbes express a like view for by art he says is created that great leviathan called a commonwealth and he even goes so far as to compare the supposed social contract from which a society suddenly originates to the creation of a man by the divine fiat thus they both fall into the extreme inconsistency of considering a community as similar in structure to a human being and yet as produced in the same way as an artificial mechanismin nature an organism in history a machine  notwithstanding errors however these speculations have considerable significance that such likenesses crudely as they are thought out should have been alleged by plato and hobbes and others is a reason for suspecting that some analogy exists the untenableness of the particular parallelisms above instanced is no ground for denying an essential parallelism since early ideas are usually but vague adumbrations of the truth lacking the great generalizations of biology it was as we have said impossible to trace out the real relations of social organizations to organizations of another order we propose here to show what are the analogies which modern science discloses                                       let us set out by succinctly stating the points of similarity and the points of difference societies agree with individual organisms in four conspicuous peculiarities  1 that commencing as small aggregations they insensibly augment in mass some of them eventually reaching ten thousand times what they originally were  2 that while at first so simple in structure as to be considered structureless they assume in the course of their growth a continuallyincreasing complexity of structure  3 that though in their early undeveloped states there exists in them scarcely any mutual dependence of parts their parts gradually acquire a mutual dependence which becomes at last so great that the activity and life of each part is made possible only by the activity and life of the rest  4 that the life of a society is independent of and far more prolonged than the lives of any of its component units who are severally born grow work reproduce and die while the bodypolitic composed of them survives generation after generation increasing in mass in completeness of structure and in functional activity  these four parallelisms will appear the more significant the more we contemplate them while the points specified are points in which societies agree with individual organisms they are also points in which individual organisms agree with one another and disagree with all things else in the course of its existence every plant and animal increases in mass in a way not paralleled by inorganic objects even such inorganic objects as crystals which arise by growth show us no such definite relation between growth and existence as organisms do the orderly progress from simplicity to complexity displayed by bodiespolitic in common with living bodies is a characteristic which distinguishes living bodies from the inanimate bodies amid which they move that functional dependence of parts which is scarcely more manifest in animals than in nations has no counterpart elsewhere and in no aggregate except an organic or a social one is there a perpetual removal and replacement of parts joined with a continued integrity of the whole moreover societies and organisms are not only alike in these peculiarities in which they are unlike all other things but the highest societies like the highest organisms exhibit them in the greatest degree we see that the lowest animals do not increase to anything like the sizes of the higher ones and similarly we see that aboriginal societies are comparatively limited in their growths in complexity our large civilized nations as much exceed primitive savage tribes as a mammal does a zoophyte simple communities like simple creatures have so little mutual dependence of parts that mutilation or subdivision causes but little inconvenience but from complex communities as from complex creatures you cannot remove any considerable organ without producing great disturbance or death of the rest and in societies of low type as in inferior animals the life of the aggregate often cut short by division or dissolution exceeds in length the lives of the component units very far less than in civilized communities and superior animals which outlive many generations of their component units  on the other hand the leading differences between societies and individual organisms are these  1 that societies have no specific external forms this however is a point of contrast which loses much of its importance when we remember that throughout the vegetal kingdom as well as in some lower divisions of the animal kingdom the forms are often very indefinitedefiniteness being rather the exception than the rule and that they are manifestly in part determined by surrounding physical circumstances as the forms of societies are if too it should eventually be shown as we believe it will that the form of every species of organism has resulted from the average play of the external forces to which it has been subject during its evolution as a species then that the external forms of societies should depend as they do on surrounding conditions will be a further point of community  2 that though the living tissue whereof an individual organism consists forms a continuous mass the living elements of a society do not form a continuous mass but are more or less widely dispersed over some portion of the earths surface this which at first sight appears to be an absolute distinction is one which yet to a great extent fades when we contemplate all the facts for in the lower divisions of the animal and vegetal kingdoms there are types of organization much more nearly allied in this respect to the organization of a society than might be supposedtypes in which the living units essentially composing the mass are dispersed through an inert substance that can scarcely be called living in the full sense of the word it is thus with some of the protococci and with the nostoceæ which exist as cells imbedded in a viscid matter it is so too with the thalassicollæbodies made up of differentiated parts dispersed through an undifferentiated jelly and throughout considerable portions of their bodies some of the acalephæ exhibit more or less this type of structure now this is very much the case with a society for we must remember that though the men who make up a society are physically separate and even scattered yet the surface over which they are scattered is not one devoid of life but is covered by life of a lower order which ministers to their life the vegetation which clothes a country makes possible the animal life in that country and only through its animal and vegetal products can such a country support a society hence the members of the bodypolitic are not to be regarded as separated by intervals of dead space but as diffused through a space occupied by life of a lower order in our conception of a social organism we must include all that lower organic existence on which human existence and therefore social existence depend and when we do this we see that the citizens who make up a community may be considered as highly vitalized units surrounded by substances of lower vitality from which they draw their nutriment much as in the cases above instanced  3 the third difference is that while the ultimate living elements of an individual organism are mostly fixed in their relative positions those of the social organism are capable of moving from place to place but here too the disagreement is much less than would be supposed for while citizens are locomotive in their private capacities they are fixed in their public capacities as farmers manufacturers or traders men carry on their businesses at the same spots often throughout their whole lives and if they go away occasionally they leave behind others to discharge their functions in their absence each great centre of production each manufacturing town or district continues always in the same place and many of the firms in such town or district are for generations carried on either by the descendants or successors of those who founded them just as in a living body the cells that make up some important organ severally perform their functions for a time and then disappear leaving others to supply their places so in each part of a society the organ remains though the persons who compose it change thus in social life as in the life of an animal the units as well as the larger agencies formed of them are in the main stationary as respects the places where they discharge their duties and obtain their sustenance and hence the power of individual locomotion does not practically affect the analogy  4 the last and perhaps the most important distinction is that while in the body of an animal only a special tissue is endowed with feeling in a society all the members are endowed with feeling even this distinction however is not a complete one for in some of the lowest animals characterized by the absence of a nervous system such sensitiveness as exists is possessed by all parts it is only in the more organized forms that feeling is monopolized by one class of the vital elements and we must remember that societies too are not without a certain differentiation of this kind though the units of a community are all sensitive they are so in unequal degrees the classes engaged in laborious occupations are less susceptible intellectually and emotionally than the rest and especially less so than the classes of highest mental culture still we have here a tolerably decided contrast between bodiespolitic and individual bodies and it is one which we should keep constantly in view for it reminds us that while in individual bodies the welfare of all other parts is rightly subservient to the welfare of the nervous system whose pleasurable or painful activities make up the good or ill of life in bodiespolitic the same thing does not hold or holds to but a very slight extent it is well that the lives of all parts of an animal should be merged in the life of the whole because the whole has a corporate consciousness capable of happiness or misery but it is not so with a society since its living units do not and cannot lose individual consciousness and since the community as a whole has no corporate consciousness this is an everlasting reason why the welfares of citizens cannot rightly be sacrificed to some supposed benefit of the state and why on the other hand the state is to be maintained solely for the benefit of citizens the corporate life must here be subservient to the lives of the parts instead of the lives of the parts being subservient to the corporate life  such then are the points of analogy and the points of difference may we not say that the points of difference serve but to bring into clearer light the points of analogy while comparison makes definite the obvious contrasts between organisms commonly so called and the social organism it shows that even these contrasts are not so decided as was to be expected the indefiniteness of form the discontinuity of the parts and the universal sensitiveness are not only peculiarities of the social organism which have to be stated with considerable qualifications but they are peculiarities to which the inferior classes of animals present approximations thus we find but little to conflict with the allimportant analogies societies slowly augment in mass they progress in complexity of structure at the same time their parts become more mutually dependent their living units are removed and replaced without destroying their integrity and the extents to which they display these peculiarities are proportionate to their vital activities these are traits that societies have in common with organic bodies and these traits in which they agree with organic bodies and disagree with all other things entirely subordinate the minor distinctions such distinctions being scarcely greater than those which separate one half of the organic kingdom from the other the principles of organization are the same and the differences are simply differences of application  here ending this general survey of the facts which justify the comparison of a society with a living body let us look at them in detail we shall find that the parallelism becomes the more marked the more closely it is examined                                       the lowest animal and vegetal formsprotozoa and protophytaare chiefly inhabitants of the water they are minute bodies most of which are made individually visible only by the microscope all of them are extremely simple in structure and some of them as the rhizopods almost structureless multiplying as they ordinarily do by the spontaneous division of their bodies they produce halves which may either become quite separate and move away in different directions or may continue attached by the repetition of this process of fission aggregations of various sizes and kinds are formed among the protophyta we have some classes as the diatomaceæ and the yeastplant in which the individuals may be either separate or attached in groups of two three four or more other classes in which a considerable number of cells are united into a thread conferva monilia others in which they form a network hydrodictyon others in which they form plates ulva and others in which they form masses laminaria agaricus all which vegetal forms having no distinction of root stem or leaf are called thallogens among the protozoa we find parallel facts immense numbers of amoebalike creatures massed together in a framework of horny fibres constitute sponge in the foraminifera we see smaller groups of such creatures arranged into more definite shapes not only do these almost structureless protozoa unite into regular or irregular aggregations of various sizes but among some of the more organized ones as the vorticellæ there are also produced clusters of individuals united to a common stem but these little societies of monads or cells or whatever else we may call them are societies only in the lowest sense there is no subordination of parts among themno organization each of the component units lives by and for itself neither giving nor receiving aid the only mutual dependence is that consequent on mechanical union  do we not here discern analogies to the first stages of human societies among the lowest races as the bushmen we find but incipient aggregation sometimes single families sometimes two or three families wandering about together the number of associated units is small and variable and their union inconstant no division of labour exists except between the sexes and the only kind of mutual aid is that of joint attack or defence we see an undifferentiated group of individuals forming the germ of a society just as in the homogeneous groups of cells above described we see the initial stage of animal and vegetal organization  the comparison may now be carried a step higher in the vegetal kingdom we pass from the thallogens consisting of mere masses of similar cells to the acrogens in which the cells are not similar throughout the whole mass but are here aggregated into a structure serving as leaf and there into a structure serving as root thus forming a whole in which there is a certain subdivision of functions among the units and therefore a certain mutual dependence in the animal kingdom we find analogous progress from mere unorganized groups of cells or celllike bodies we ascend to groups of such cells arranged into parts that have different duties the common polype from the substance of which may be separated cells that exhibit when detached appearances and movements like those of a solitary amoeba illustrates this stage the component units though still showing great community of character assume somewhat diverse functions in the skin in the internal surface and in the tentacles there is a certain amount of physiological division of labour  turning to societies we find these stages paralleled in most aboriginal tribes when instead of such small variable groups as are formed by bushmen we come to the larger and more permanent groups formed by savages not quite so low we find traces of social structure though industrial organization scarcely shows itself except in the different occupations of the sexes yet there is more or less of governmental organization while all the men are warriors and hunters only a part of them are included in the council of chiefs and in this council of chiefs some one has commonly supreme authority there is thus a certain distinction of classes and powers and through this slight specialization of functions is effected a rude cooperation among the increasing mass of individuals whenever the society has to act in its corporate capacity beyond this analogy in the slight extent to which organization is carried there is analogy in the indefiniteness of the organization in the hydra the respective parts of the creatures substance have many functions in common they are all contractile omitting the tentacles the whole of the external surface can give origin to young hydræ and when turned inside out stomach performs the duties of skin and skin the duties of stomach in aboriginal societies such differentiations as exist are similarly imperfect notwithstanding distinctions of rank all persons maintain themselves by their own exertions not only do the head men of the tribe in common with the rest build their own huts make their own weapons kill their own food but the chief does the like moreover such governmental organization as exists is inconstant it is frequently changed by violence or treachery and the function of ruling assumed by some other warrior thus between the rudest societies and some of the lowest forms of animal life there is analogy alike in the slight extent to which organization is carried in the indefiniteness of this organization and in its want of fixity  a further complication of the analogy is at hand from the aggregation of units into organized groups we pass to the multiplication of such groups and their coalescence into compound groups the hydra when it has reached a certain bulk puts forth from its surface a bud which growing and gradually assuming the form of the parent finally becomes detached and by this process of gemmation the creature peoples the adjacent water with others like itself a parallel process is seen in the multiplication of those lowlyorganized tribes above described when one of them has increased to a size that is either too great for coordination under so rude a structure or else that is greater than the surrounding country can supply with game and other wild food there arises a tendency to divide and as in such communities there often occur quarrels jealousies and other causes of division there soon comes an occasion on which a part of the tribe separates under the leadership of some subordinate chief and migrates this process being from time to time repeated an extensive region is at length occupied by numerous tribes descended from a common ancestry the analogy by no means ends here though in the common hydra the young ones that bud out from the parent soon become detached and independent yet throughout the rest of the class hydrozoa to which this creature belongs the like does not generally happen the successive individuals thus developed continue attached give origin to other such individuals which also continue attached and so there results a compound animal as in the hydra itself we find an aggregation of units which considered separately are akin to the lowest protozoa so here in a zoophyte we find an aggregation of such aggregations the like is also seen throughout the extensive family of polyzoa or molluscoida the ascidian mollusks too in their many forms show us the same thing exhibiting at the same time various degrees of union among the component individuals for while in the salpæ the component individuals adhere so slightly that a blow on the vessel of water in which they are floating will separate them in the botryllidæ there exist vascular connexions among them and a common circulation now in these different stages of aggregation may we not see paralleled the union of groups of connate tribes into nations though in regions where circumstances permit the tribes descended from some original tribe migrate in all directions and become far removed and quite separate yet where the territory presents barriers to distant migration this does not happen the small kindred communities are held in closer contact and eventually become more or less united into a nation the contrast between the tribes of american indians and the scottish clans illustrates this and a glance at our own early history or the early histories of continental nations shows this fusion of small simple communities taking place in various ways and to various extents as says m guizot in his history of the origin of representative government       by degrees in the midst of the chaos of the rising society small      aggregations are formed which feel the want of alliance and union      with each other soon inequality of strength is displayed among      neighbouring aggregations the strong tend to subjugate the weak      and usurp at first the rights of taxation and military service      thus political authority leaves the aggregations which first      instituted it to take a wider range  that is to say the small tribes clans or feudal groups sprung mostly from a common stock and long held in contact as occupants of adjacent lands gradually get united in other ways than by kinship and proximity  a further series of changes begins now to take place to which as before we find analogies in individual organisms returning to the hydrozoa we observe that in the simplest of the compound forms the connected individuals are alike in structure and perform like functions with the exception that here and there a bud instead of developing into a stomach mouth and tentacles becomes an eggsac but with the oceanic hydrozoa this is by no means the case in the calycophoridæ some of the polypes growing from the common germ become developed and modified into large long sacklike bodies which by their rhythmical contractions move through the water dragging the community of polypes after them in the physophoridæ a variety of organs similarly arise by transformation of the budding polypes so that in creatures like the physalia commonly known as the portuguese manofwar instead of that treelike group of similar individuals forming the original type we have a complex mass of unlike parts fulfilling unlike duties as an individual hydra may be regarded as a group of protozoa which have become partially metamorphosed into different organs so a physalia is morphologically considered a group of hydræ of which the individuals have been variously transformed to fit them for various functions  this differentiation upon differentiation is just what takes place during the evolution of a civilized society we observed how in the small communities first formed there arises a simple political organization there is a partial separation of classes having different duties and now we have to observe how in a nation formed by the fusion of such small communities the several sections at first alike in structures and modes of activity grow unlike in bothgradually become mutuallydependent parts diverse in their natures and functions                                       the doctrine of the progressive division of labour to which we are here introduced is familiar to all readers and further the analogy between the economical division of labour and the physiological division of labour is so striking as long since to have drawn the attention of scientific naturalists so striking indeed that the expression physiological division of labour has been suggested by it it is not needful therefore to treat this part of the subject in great detail we shall content ourselves with noting a few general and significant facts not manifest on a first inspection  throughout the whole animal kingdom from the coelenterata upwards the first stage of evolution is the same equally in the germ of a polype and in the human ovum the aggregated mass of cells out of which the creature is to arise gives origin to a peripheral layer of cells slightly differing from the rest which they include and this layer subsequently divides into twothe inner lying in contact with the included yelk being called the mucous layer and the outer exposed to surrounding agencies being called the serous layer or in the terms used by prof huxley in describing the development of the hydrozoathe endoderm and ectoderm this primary division marks out a fundamental contrast of parts in the future organism from the mucous layer or endoderm is developed the apparatus of nutrition while from the serous layer or ectoderm is developed the apparatus of external action out of the one arise the organs by which food is prepared and absorbed oxygen imbibed and blood purified while out of the other arise the nervous muscular and osseous systems by the combined actions of which the movements of the body as a whole are effected though this is not a rigorouslycorrect distinction seeing that some organs involve both of these primitive membranes yet high authorities agree in stating it as a broad general distinction well in the evolution of a society we see a primary differentiation of analogous kind which similarly underlies the whole future structure as already pointed out the only manifest contrast of parts in primitive societies is that between the governing and the governed in the least organized tribes the council of chiefs may be a body of men distinguished simply by greater courage or experience in more organized tribes the chiefclass is definitely separated from the lower class and often regarded as different in naturesometimes as goddescended and later we find these two becoming respectively freemen and slaves or nobles and serfs a glance at their respective functions makes it obvious that the great divisions thus early formed stand to each other in a relation similar to that in which the primary divisions of the embryo stand to each other for from its first appearance the warriorclass headed by chiefs is that by which the external acts of the society are carried on alike in war in negotiation and in migration afterwards while this upper class grows distinct from the lower and at the same time becomes more and more exclusively regulative and defensive in its functions alike in the persons of kings and subordinate rulers priests and soldiers the inferior class becomes more and more exclusively occupied in providing the necessaries of life for the community at large from the soil with which it comes in most direct contact the mass of the people takes up and prepares for use the food and such rude articles of manufacture as are known while the overlying mass of superior men maintained by the working population deals with circumstances external to the communitycircumstances with which by position it is more immediately concerned ceasing byandby to have any knowledge of or power over the concerns of the society as a whole the serfclass becomes devoted to the processes of alimentation while the noble class ceasing to take any part in the processes of alimentation becomes devoted to the coordinated movements of the entire bodypolitic  equally remarkable is a further analogy of like kind after the mucous and serous layers of the embryo have separated there presently arises between the two a third known to physiologists as the vascular layera layer out of which are developed the chief bloodvessels the mucous layer absorbs nutriment from the mass of yelk it encloses this nutriment has to be transferred to the overlying serous layer out of which the nervomuscular system is being developed and between the two arises a vascular system by which the transfer is effecteda system of vessels which continues ever after to be the transferrer of nutriment from the places where it is absorbed and prepared to the places where it is needed for growth and repair well may we not trace a parallel step in social progress between the governing and the governed there at first exists no intermediate class and even in some societies that have reached considerable sizes there are scarcely any but the nobles and their kindred on the one hand and the serfs on the other the social structure being such that transfer of commodities takes place directly from slaves to their masters but in societies of a higher type there grows up between these two primitive classes anotherthe trading or middle class equally at first as now we may see that speaking generally this middle class is the analogue of the middle layer in the embryo for all traders are essentially distributors whether they be wholesale dealers who collect into large masses the commodities of various producers or whether they be retailers who divide out to those who want them the masses of commodities thus collected together all mercantile men are agents of transfer from the places where things are produced to the places where they are consumed thus the distributing apparatus in a society answers to the distributing apparatus in a living body not only in its functions but in its intermediate origin and subsequent position and in the time of its appearance  without enumerating the minor differentiations which these three great classes afterwards undergo we will merely note that throughout they follow the same general law with the differentiations of an individual organism in a society as in a rudimentary animal we have seen that the most general and broadly contrasted divisions are the first to make their appearance and of the subdivisions it continues true in both cases that they arise in the order of decreasing generality  let us observe next that in the one case as in the other the specializations are at first very incomplete and approach completeness as organization progresses we saw that in primitive tribes as in the simplest animals there remains much community of function between the parts which are nominally differentthat for instance the class of chiefs long remains industrially the same as the inferior class just as in a hydra the property of contractility is possessed by the units of the endoderm as well as by those of the ectoderm we noted also how as the society advanced the two great primitive classes partook less and less of each others functions and we have here to remark that all subsequent specializations are at first vague and gradually become distinct in the infancy of society says m guizot everything is confused and uncertain there is as yet no fixed and precise line of demarcation between the different powers in a state originally kings lived like other landowners on the incomes derived from their own private estates nobles were petty kings and kings only the most powerful nobles bishops were feudal lords and military leaders the right of coining money was possessed by powerful subjects and by the church as well as by the king every leading man exercised alike the functions of landowner farmer soldier statesman judge retainers were now soldiers and now labourers as the day required but by degrees the church has lost all civil jurisdiction the state has exercised less and less control over religious teaching the military class has grown a distinct one handicrafts have concentrated in towns and the spinningwheels of scattered farmhouses have disappeared before the machinery of manufacturing districts not only is all progress from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous but at the same time it is from the indefinite to the definite  another fact which should not be passed over is that in the evolution of a large society out of a cluster of small ones there is a gradual obliteration of the original lines of separationa change to which also we may see analogies in living bodies the subkingdom annulosa furnishes good illustrations among the lower types the body consists of numerous segments that are alike in nearly every particular each has its external ring its pair of legs if the creature has legs its equal portion of intestine or else its separate stomach its equal portion of the great bloodvessel or in some cases its separate heart its equal portion of the nervous cord and perhaps its separate pair of ganglia but in the highest types as in the large crustacea many of the segments are completely fused together and the internal organs are no longer uniformly repeated in all the segments now the segments of which nations at first consist lose their separate external and internal structures in a similar manner in feudal times the minor communities governed by feudal lords were severally organized in the same rude way and were held together only by the fealty of their respective rulers to a suzerain but along with the growth of a central power the demarcations of these local communities become relatively unimportant and their separate organizations merge into the general organization the like is seen on a larger scale in the fusion of england wales scotland and ireland and on the continent in the coalescence of provinces into kingdoms even in the disappearance of lawmade divisions the process is analogous among the anglosaxons england was divided into tithings hundreds and counties there were countycourts courts of hundred and courts of tithing the courts of tithing disappeared first then the courts of hundred which have however left traces while the countyjurisdiction still exists chiefly however it is to be noted that there eventually grows up an organization which has no reference to these original divisions but traverses them in various directions as is the case in creatures belonging to the subkingdom just named and further that in both cases it is the sustaining organization which thus traverses old boundaries while in both cases it is the governmental or coordinating organization in which the original boundaries continue traceable thus in the highest annulosa the exoskeleton and the muscular system never lose all traces of their primitive segmentation but throughout a great part of the body the contained viscera do not in the least conform to the external divisions similarly with a nation we see that while for governmental purposes such divisions as counties and parishes still exist the structure developed for carrying on the nutrition of society wholly ignores these boundaries our great cottonmanufacture spreads out of lancashire into north derbyshire leicestershire and nottinghamshire have long divided the stockingtrade between them one great centre for the production of iron and irongoods includes parts of warwickshire staffordshire and worcestershire and those various specializations of agriculture which have made different parts of england noted for different products show no more respect to countyboundaries than do our growing towns to the boundaries of parishes  if after contemplating these analogies of structure we inquire whether there are any such analogies between the processes of organic change the answer isyes the causes which lead to increase of bulk in any part of the bodypolitic are of like nature with those which lead to increase of bulk in any part of an individual body in both cases the antecedent is greater functional activity consequent on greater demand each limb viscus gland or other member of an animal is developed by exerciseby actively discharging the duties which the body at large requires of it and similarly any class of labourers or artisans any manufacturing centre or any official agency begins to enlarge when the community devolves on it more work in each case too growth has its conditions and its limits that any organ in a living being may grow by exercise there needs a due supply of blood all action implies waste blood brings the materials for repair and before there can be growth the quantity of blood supplied must be more than is requisite for repair in a society it is the same if to some district which elaborates for the community particular commoditiessay the woollens of yorkshirethere comes an augmented demand and if in fulfilment of this demand a certain expenditure and wear of the manufacturing organization are incurred and if in payment for the extra quantity of woollens sent away there comes back only such quantity of commodities as replaces the expenditure and makes good the waste of life and machinery there can clearly be no growth that there may be growth the commodities obtained in return must be more than sufficient for these ends and just in proportion as the surplus is great will the growth be rapid whence it is manifest that what in commercial affairs we call profit answers to the excess of nutrition over waste in a living body moreover in both cases when the functional activity is high and the nutrition defective there results not growth but decay if in an animal any organ is worked so hard that the channels which bring blood cannot furnish enough for repair the organ dwindles atrophy is set up and if in the bodypolitic some part has been stimulated into great productivity and cannot afterwards get paid for all its produce certain of its members become bankrupt and it decreases in size  one more parallelism to be here noted is that the different parts of a social organism like the different parts of an individual organism compete for nutriment and severally obtain more or less of it according as they are discharging more or less duty if a mans brain be overexcited it abstracts blood from his viscera and stops digestion or digestion actively going on so affects the circulation through the brain as to cause drowsiness or great muscular exertion determines such a quantity of blood to the limbs as to arrest digestion or cerebral action as the case may be so likewise in a society great activity in some one direction causes partial arrests of activity elsewhere by abstracting capital that is commodities as instance the way in which the sudden development of our railwaysystem hampered commercial operations or the way in which the raising of a large military force temporarily stops the growth of leading industries                                       the last few paragraphs introduce the next division of our subject almost unawares we have come upon the analogy which exists between the blood of a living body and the circulating mass of commodities in the bodypolitic we have now to trace out this analogy from its simplest to its most complex manifestations  in the lowest animals there exists no blood properly so called through the small assemblage of cells which make up a hydra permeate the juices absorbed from the food there is no apparatus for elaborating a concentrated and purified nutriment and distributing it among the component units but these component units directly imbibe the unprepared nutriment either from the digestive cavity or from one another may we not say that this is what takes place in an aboriginal tribe all its members severally obtain for themselves the necessaries of life in their crude states and severally prepare them for their own uses as well as they can when there arises a decided differentiation between the governing and the governed some amount of transfer begins between those inferior individuals who as workers come directly in contact with the products of the earth and those superior ones who exercise the higher functionsa transfer parallel to that which accompanies the differentiation of the ectoderm from the endoderm in the one case as in the other however it is a transfer of products that are little if at all prepared and takes place directly from the unit which obtains to the unit which consumes without entering into any general current  passing to larger organismsindividual and socialwe meet the first advance on this arrangement where as among the compound hydrozoa there is a union of many such primitive groups as form hydræ or where as in a medusa one of these groups has become of great size there exist rude channels running throughout the substance of the body not however channels for the conveyance of prepared nutriment but mere prolongations of the digestive cavity through which the crude chyleaqueous fluid reaches the remoter parts and is moved backwards and forwards by the creatures contractions do we not find in some of the more advanced primitive communities an analogous condition when the men partially or fully united into one society become numerouswhen as usually happens they cover a surface of country not everywhere alike in its productswhen more especially there arise considerable classes which are not industrial some process of exchange and distribution inevitably arises traversing here and there the earths surface covered by that vegetation on which human life depends and in which as we say the units of a society are imbedded there are formed indefinite paths along which some of the necessaries of life occasionally pass to be bartered for others which presently come back along the same channels note however that at first little else but crude commodities are thus transferredfruits fish pigs or cattle skins etc there are few if any manufactured products or articles prepared for consumption and note also that such distribution of these unprepared necessaries of life as takes place is but occasionalgoes on with a certain slow irregular rhythm  further progress in the elaboration and distribution of nutriment or of commodities is a necessary accompaniment of further differentiation of functions in the individual body or in the bodypolitic as fast as each organ of a living animal becomes confined to a special action it must become dependent on the rest for those materials which its position and duty do not permit it to obtain for itself in the same way that as fast as each particular class of a community becomes exclusively occupied in producing its own commodity it must become dependent on the rest for the other commodities it needs and simultaneously a more perfectlyelaborated blood will result from a highly specialized group of nutritive organs severally adapted to prepare its different elements in the same way that the stream of commodities circulating throughout a society will be of superior quality in proportion to the greater division of labour among the workers observe also that in either case the circulating mass of nutritive materials besides coming gradually to consist of better ingredients also grows more complex an increase in the number of the unlike organs which add to the blood their waste matters and demand from it the different materials they severally need implies a blood more heterogeneous in compositionan a priori conclusion which according to dr williams is inductively confirmed by examination of the blood throughout the various grades of the animal kingdom and similarly it is manifest that as fast as the division of labour among the classes of a community becomes greater there must be an increasing heterogeneity in the currents of merchandize flowing throughout that community  the circulating mass of nutritive materials in individual organisms and in social organisms becoming at once better in the quality of its ingredients and more heterogeneous in composition as the type of structure becomes higher eventually has added to it in both cases another element which is not itself nutritive but facilitates the processes of nutrition we refer in the case of the individual organism to the blooddiscs and in the case of the social organism to money this analogy has been observed by liebig who in his familiar letters on chemistry says       silver and gold have to perform in the organism of the state the      same function as the bloodcorpuscles in the human organism as      these round discs without themselves taking an immediate share in      the nutritive process are the medium the essential condition of      the change of matter of the production of the heat and of the      force by which the temperature of the body is kept up and the      motions of the blood and all the juices are determined so has gold      become the medium of all activity in the life of the state  and bloodcorpuscles being like coin in their functions and in the fact that they are not consumed in nutrition he further points out that the number of them which in a considerable interval flows through the great centres is enormous when compared with their absolute number just as the quantity of money which annually passes through the great mercantile centres is enormous when compared with the quantity of money in the kingdom nor is this all liebig has omitted the significant circumstance that only at a certain stage of organization does this element of the circulation make its appearance throughout extensive divisions of the lower animals the blood contains no corpuscles and in societies of low civilization there is no money  thus far we have considered the analogy between the blood in a living body and the consumable and circulating commodities in the bodypolitic let us now compare the appliances by which they are respectively distributed we shall find in the developments of these appliances parallelisms not less remarkable than those above set forth already we have shown that as classes wholesale and retail distributors discharge in a society the office which the vascular system discharges in an individual creature that they come into existence later than the other two great classes as the vascular layer appears later than the mucous and serous layers and that they occupy a like intermediate position here however it remains to be pointed out that a complete conception of the circulating system in a society includes not only the active human agents who propel the currents of commodities and regulate their distribution but includes also the channels of communication it is the formation and arrangement of these to which we now direct attention  going back once more to those lower animals in which there is found nothing but a partial diffusion not of blood but only of crude nutritive fluids it is to be remarked that the channels through which the diffusion takes place are mere excavations through the halforganized substance of the body they have no lining membranes but are mere lacunæ traversing a rude tissue now countries in which civilization is but commencing display a like condition there are no roads properly so called but the wilderness of vegetal life covering the earths surface is pierced by tracks through which the distribution of crude commodities takes place and while in both cases the acts of distribution occur only at long intervals the currents after a pause now setting towards a general centre and now away from it the transfer is in both cases slow and difficult but among other accompaniments of progress common to animals and societies comes the formation of more definite and complete channels of communication bloodvessels acquire distinct walls roads are fenced and gravelled this advance is first seen in those roads or vessels that are nearest to the chief centres of distribution while the peripheral roads and peripheral vessels long continue in their primitive states at a yet later stage of development where comparative finish of structure is found throughout the system as well as near the chief centres there remains in both cases the difference that the main channels are comparatively broad and straight while the subordinate ones are narrow and tortuous in proportion to their remoteness lastly it is to be remarked that there ultimately arise in the higher social organisms as in the higher individual organisms main channels of distribution still more distinguished by their perfect structures their comparative straightness and the absence of those small branches which the minor channels perpetually give off and in railways we also see for the first time in the social organism a system of double channels conveying currents in opposite directions as do the arteries and veins of a welldeveloped animal  these parallelisms in the evolutions and structures of the circulating systems introduce us to others in the kinds and rates of the movements going on through them through the lowest societies as through the lowest creatures the distribution of crude nutriment is by slow gurgitations and regurgitations in creatures that have rude vascular systems just as in societies that are beginning to have roads there is no regular circulation along definite courses but instead periodical changes of the currentsnow towards this point and now towards that through each part of an inferior mollusks body the blood flows for a while in one direction then stops and flows in the opposite direction just as through a rudelyorganized society the distribution of merchandize is slowly carried on by great fairs occurring in different localities to and from which the currents periodically set only animals of tolerably complete organizations like advanced communities are permeated by constant currents that are definitely directed in living bodies the local and variable currents disappear when there grow up great centres of circulation generating more powerful currents by a rhythm which ends in a quick regular pulsation and when in social bodies there arise great centres of commercial activity producing and exchanging large quantities of commodities the rapid and continuous streams drawn in and emitted by these centres subdue all minor and local circulations the slow rhythm of fairs merges into the faster one of weekly markets and in the chief centres of distribution weekly markets merge into daily markets while in place of the languid transfer from place to place taking place at first weekly then twice or thrice a week we byandby get daily transfer and finally transfer many times a daythe original sluggish irregular rhythm becomes a rapid equable pulse mark too that in both cases the increased activity like the greater perfection of structure is much less conspicuous at the periphery of the vascular system on main lines of railway we have perhaps a score trains in each direction daily going at from thirty to fifty miles an hour as through the great arteries the blood moves rapidly in successive gushes along high roads there go vehicles conveying men and commodities with much less though still considerable speed and with a much less decided rhythm as in the smaller arteries the speed of the blood is greatly diminished and the pulse less conspicuous in parishroads narrower less complete and more tortuous the rate of movement is further decreased and the rhythm scarcely traceable as in the ultimate arteries in those still more imperfect byroads which lead from these parishroads to scattered farmhouses and cottages the motion is yet slower and very irregular just as we find it in the capillaries while along the fieldroads which in their unformed unfenced state are typical of lacunæ the movement is the slowest the most irregular and the most infrequent as it is not only in the primitive lacunæ of animals and societies but as it is also in those lacunæ in which the vascular system ends among extensive families of inferior creatures  thus then we find between the distributing systems of living bodies and the distributing systems of bodiespolitic wonderfully close parallelisms in the lowest forms of individual and social organisms there exist neither prepared nutritive matters nor distributing appliances and in both these arising as necessary accompaniments of the differentiation of parts approach perfection as this differentiation approaches completeness in animals as in societies the distributing agencies begin to show themselves at the same relative periods and in the same relative positions in the one as in the other the nutritive materials circulated are at first crude and simple gradually become better elaborated and more heterogeneous and have eventually added to them a new element facilitating the nutritive processes the channels of communication pass through similar phases of development which bring them to analogous forms and the directions rhythms and rates of circulation progress by like steps to like final conditions                                       we come at length to the nervous system having noticed the primary differentiation of societies into the governing and governed classes and observed its analogy to the differentiation of the two primary tissues which respectively develop into organs of external action and organs of alimentation having noticed some of the leading analogies between the development of industrial arrangements and that of the alimentary apparatus and having above more fully traced the analogies between the distributing systems social and individual we have now to compare the appliances by which a society as a whole is regulated with those by which the movements of an individual creature are regulated we shall find here parallelisms equally striking with those already detailed  the class out of which governmental organization originates is as we have said analogous in its relations to the ectoderm of the lowest animals and of embryonic forms and as this primitive membrane out of which the nervomuscular system is evolved must even in the first stage of its differentiation be slightly distinguished from the rest by that greater impressibility and contractility characterizing the organs to which it gives rise so in that superior class which is eventually transformed into the directoexecutive system of a society its legislative and defensive appliances does there exist in the beginning a larger endowment of the capacities required for these higher social functions always in rude assemblages of men the strongest most courageous and most sagacious become rulers and leaders and in a tribe of some standing this results in the establishment of a dominant class characterized on the average by those mental and bodily qualities which fit them for deliberation and vigorous combined action thus that greater impressibility and contractility which in the rudest animal types characterize the units of the ectoderm characterize also the units of the primitive social stratum which controls and fights since impressibility and contractility are the respective roots of intelligence and strength  again in the unmodified ectoderm as we see it in the hydra the units are all endowed both with impressibility and contractility but as we ascend to higher types of organization the ectoderm differentiates into classes of units which divide those two functions between them some becoming exclusively impressible cease to be contractile while some becoming exclusively contractile cease to be impressible similarly with societies in an aboriginal tribe the directive and executive functions are diffused in a mingled form throughout the whole governing class each minor chief commands those under him and if need be himself coerces them into obedience the council of chiefs itself carries out on the battlefield its own decisions the head chief not only makes laws but administers justice with his own hands in larger and more settled communities however the directive and executive agencies begin to grow distinct from each other as fast as his duties accumulate the head chief or king confines himself more and more to directing public affairs and leaves the execution of his will to others he deputes others to enforce submission to inflict punishments or to carry out minor acts of offence and defence and only on occasions when perhaps the safety of the society and his own supremacy are at stake does he begin to act as well as direct as this differentiation establishes itself the characteristics of the ruler begin to change no longer as in an aboriginal tribe the strongest and most daring man the tendency is for him to become the man of greatest cunning foresight and skill in the management of others for in societies that have advanced beyond the first stage it is chiefly such qualities that insure success in gaining supreme power and holding it against internal and external enemies thus that member of the governing class who comes to be the chief directing agent and so plays the same part that a rudimentary nervous centre does in an unfolding organism is usually one endowed with some superiorities of nervous organization  in those larger and more complex communities possessing perhaps a separate military class a priesthood and dispersed masses of population requiring local control there grow up subordinate governing agents who as their duties accumulate severally become more directive and less executive in their characters and when as commonly happens the king begins to collect round himself advisers who aid him by communicating information preparing subjects for his judgment and issuing his orders we may say that the form of organization is comparable to one very general among inferior types of animals in which there exists a chief ganglion with a few dispersed minor ganglia under its control  the analogies between the evolution of governmental structures in societies and the evolution of governmental structures in living bodies are however more strikingly displayed during the formation of nations by coalescence of tribesa process already shown to be in several respects parallel to the development of creatures that primarily consist of many like segments among other points of community between the successive rings which make up the body in the lower annulosa is the possession of similar pairs of ganglia these pairs of ganglia though connected by nerves are very incompletely dependent on any general controlling power hence it results that when the body is cut in two the hinder part continues to move forward under the propulsion of its numerous legs and that when the chain of ganglia has been divided without severing the body the hind limbs may be seen trying to propel the body in one direction while the fore limbs are trying to propel it in another but in the higher annulosa called articulata sundry of the anterior pairs of ganglia besides growing larger unite in one mass and this great cephalic ganglion having become the coordinator of all the creatures movements there no longer exists much local independence now may we not in the growth of a consolidated kingdom out of petty sovereignties or baronies observe analogous changes like the chiefs and primitive rulers above described feudal lords exercising supreme power over their respective groups of retainers discharge functions analogous to those of rudimentary nervous centres among these local governing centres there is in early feudal times very little subordination they are in frequent antagonism they are individually restrained chiefly by the influence of parties in their own class and they are but irregularly subject to that most powerful member of their order who has gained the position of headsuzerain or king as the growth and organization of the society progresses these local directive centres fall more and more under the control of a chief directive centre closer commercial union between the several segments is accompanied by closer governmental union and these minor rulers end in being little more than agents who administer in their several localities the laws made by the supreme ruler just as the local ganglia above described eventually become agents which enforce in their respective segments the orders of the cephalic ganglion the parallelism holds still further we remarked above when speaking of the rise of aboriginal kings that in proportion as their territories increase they are obliged not only to perform their executive functions by deputy but also to gather round themselves advisers to aid in their directive functions and that thus in place of a solitary governing unit there grows up a group of governing units comparable to a ganglion consisting of many cells let us here add that the advisers and chief officers who thus form the rudiment of a ministry tend from the beginning to exercise some control over the ruler by the information they give and the opinions they express they sway his judgment and affect his commands to this extent he is made a channel through which are communicated the directions originating with them and in course of time when the advice of ministers becomes the acknowledged source of his actions the king assumes the character of an automatic centre reflecting the impressions made on him from without  beyond this complication of governmental structure many societies do not progress but in some a further development takes place our own case best illustrates this further development and its further analogies to kings and their ministries have been added in england other great directive centres exercising a control which at first small has been gradually becoming predominant as with the great governing ganglia which especially distinguish the highest classes of living beings strange as the assertion will be thought our houses of parliament discharge in the social economy functions which are in sundry respects comparable to those discharged by the cerebral masses in a vertebrate animal as it is in the nature of a single ganglion to be affected only by special stimuli from particular parts of the body so it is in the nature of a single ruler to be swayed in his acts by exclusive personal or class interests as it is in the nature of a cluster of ganglia connected with the primary one to convey to it a greater variety of influences from more numerous organs and thus to make its acts conform to more numerous requirements so it is in the nature of the subsidiary controlling powers surrounding a king to adapt his rule to a greater number of public exigencies and as it is in the nature of those great and latestdeveloped ganglia which distinguish the higher animals to interpret and combine the multiplied and varied impressions conveyed to them from all parts of the system and to regulate the actions in such way as duly to regard them all so it is in the nature of those great and latestdeveloped legislative bodies which distinguish the most advanced societies to interpret and combine the wishes of all classes and localities and to make laws in harmony with the general wants we may describe the office of the brain as that of averaging the interests of life physical intellectual moral and a good brain is one in which the desires answering to these respective interests are so balanced that the conduct they jointly dictate sacrifices none of them similarly we may describe the office of a parliament as that of averaging the interests of the various classes in a community and a good parliament is one in which the parties answering to these respective interests are so balanced that their united legislation allows to each class as much as consists with the claims of the rest besides being comparable in their duties these great directive centres social and individual are comparable in the processes by which their duties are discharged the cerebrum is not occupied with direct impressions from without but with the ideas of such impressions instead of the actual sensations produced in the body and directly appreciated by the sensory ganglia or primitive nervous centres the cerebrum receives only the representations of these sensations and its consciousness is called representative consciousness to distinguish it from the original or presentative consciousness is it not significant that we have hit on the same word to distinguish the function of our house of commons we call it a representative body because the interests with which it deals are not directly presented to it but represented to it by its various members and a debate is a conflict of representations of the results likely to follow from a proposed coursea description which applies with equal truth to a debate in the individual consciousness in both cases too these great governing masses take no part in the executive functions as after a conflict in the cerebrum those desires which finally predominate act on the subjacent ganglia and through their instrumentality determine the bodily actions so the parties which after a parliamentary struggle gain the victory do not themselves carry out their wishes but get them carried out by the executive divisions of the government the fulfilment of all legislative decisions still devolves on the original directive centres the impulse passing from the parliament to the ministers and from the ministers to the king in whose name everything is done just as those smaller firstdeveloped ganglia which in the lowest vertebrata are the chief controlling agents are still in the brains of the higher vertebrata the agents through which the dictates of the cerebrum are worked out moreover in both cases these original centres become increasingly automatic in the developed vertebrate animal they have little function beyond that of conveying impressions to and executing the determinations of the larger centres in our highly organized government the monarch has long been lapsing into a passive agent of parliament and now ministries are rapidly falling into the same position nay between the two cases there is a parallelism even in respect of the exceptions to this automatic action for in the individual creature it happens that under circumstances of sudden alarm as from a loud sound close at hand an unexpected object starting up in front or a slip from insecure footing the danger is guarded against by some quick involuntary jump or adjustment of the limbs which occurs before there is time to consider the impending evil and take deliberate measures to avoid it the rationale of which is that these violent impressions produced on the senses are reflected from the sensory ganglia to the spinal cord and muscles without as in ordinary cases first passing through the cerebrum in like manner on national emergencies calling for prompt action the king and ministry not having time to lay the matter before the great deliberative bodies themselves issue commands for the requisite movements or precautions the primitive and now almost automatic directive centres resume for a moment their original uncontrolled power and then strangest of all observe that in either case there is an afterprocess of approval or disapproval the individual on recovering from his automatic start at once contemplates the cause of his fright and according to the case concludes that it was well he moved as he did or condemns himself for his groundless alarm in like manner the deliberative powers of the state discuss as soon as may be the unauthorized acts of the executive powers and deciding that the reasons were or were not sufficient grant or withhold a bill of indemnity28  thus far in comparing the governmental organization of the bodypolitic with that of an individual body we have considered only the respective coordinating centres we have yet to consider the channels through which these coordinating centres receive information and convey commands in the simplest societies as in the simplest organisms there is no internuncial apparatus as hunter styled the nervous system consequently impressions can be but slowly propagated from unit to unit throughout the whole mass the same progress however which in animalorganization shows itself in the establishment of ganglia or directive centres shows itself also in the establishment of nervethreads through which the ganglia receive and convey impressions and so control remote organs and in societies the like eventually takes place after a long period during which the directive centres communicate with various parts of the society through other means there at last comes into existence an internuncial apparatus analogous to that found in individual bodies the comparison of telegraphwires to nerves is familiar to all it applies however to an extent not commonly supposed thus throughout the vertebrate subkingdom the great nervebundles diverge from the vertebrate axis side by side with the great arteries and similarly our groups of telegraphwires are carried along the sides of our railways the most striking parallelism however remains into each great bundle of nerves as it leaves the axis of the body along with an artery there enters a branch of the sympathetic nerve which branch accompanying the artery throughout its ramifications has the function of regulating its diameter and otherwise controlling the flow of blood through it according to local requirements analogously in the group of telegraphwires running alongside each railway there is a wire for the purpose of regulating the trafficfor retarding or expediting the flow of passengers and commodities as the local conditions demand probably when our now rudimentary telegraphsystem is fully developed other analogies will be traceable  such then is a general outline of the evidence which justifies the comparison of societies to living organisms that they gradually increase in mass that they become little by little more complex that at the same time their parts grow more mutually dependent and that they continue to live and grow as wholes while successive generations of their units appear and disappear are broad peculiarities which bodiespolitic display in common with all living bodies and in which they and living bodies differ from everything else and on carrying out the comparison in detail we find that these major analogies involve many minor analogies far closer than might have been expected others might be added we had hoped to say something respecting the different types of social organization and something also on social metamorphoses but we have reached our assigned limits  footnote  footnote 28 it may be well to warn the reader against an error fallen into by one who criticised this essay on its first publicationthe error of supposing that the analogy here intended to be drawn is a specific analogy between the organization of society in england and the human organization as said at the outset no such specific analogy exists the above parallel is one between the mostdeveloped systems of governmental organization individual and social and the vertebrate type is instanced merely as exhibiting this mostdeveloped system if any specific comparison were made which it cannot rationally be it would be made with some much lower vertebrate form than the human     the origin of animal worship      first published in the fortnightly review for may 1870   mr mclennans recent essays on the worship of animals and plants have done much to elucidate a very obscure subject by pursuing in this case as before in another case the truly scientific method of comparing the phenomena presented by existing uncivilized races with those which the traditions of civilized races present he has rendered both of them more comprehensible than they were before  it seems to me however that mr mclennan gives but an indefinite answer to the essential questionhow did the worship of animals and plants arise indeed in his concluding paper he expressly leaves this problem unsolved saying that his is not an hypothesis explanatory of the origin of totemism be it remembered but an hypothesis explanatory of the animal and plant worship of the ancient nations so that we have still to askwhy have savage tribes so generally taken animals and plants and other things as totems what can have induced this tribe to ascribe special sacredness to one creature and that tribe to another and if to these questions the reply is that each tribe considers itself to be descended from the object of its reverence then there presses for answer the further questionhow came so strange a notion into existence if this notion occurred in one case only we might set it down to some whim of thought or some illusive occurrence but appealing as it does with multitudinous variations among so many uncivilized races in different parts of the world and having left numerous marks in the superstitions of extinct civilized races we cannot assume any special or exceptional cause moreover the general cause whatever it may be must be such as does not negative an aboriginal intelligence like in nature to our own after studying the grotesque beliefs of savages we are apt to suppose that their reason is not as our reason but this supposition is inadmissible given the amount of knowledge which primitive men possess and given the imperfect verbal symbols used by them in speech and thought and the conclusions they habitually reach will be those that are relatively the most rational this must be our postulate and setting out with this postulate we have to ask how primitive men came so generally if not universally to believe themselves the progeny of animals or plants or inanimate bodies there is i believe a satisfactory answer                                       the proposition with which mr mclennan sets out that totemworship preceded the worship of anthropomorphic gods is one to which i can yield but a qualified assent it is true in a sense but not wholly true if the words gods and worship carry with them their ordinary definite meanings the statement is true but if their meanings are widened so as to comprehend those earliest vague notions out of which the definite ideas of gods and worship are evolved i think it is not true the rudimentary form of all religion is the propitiation of dead ancestors who are supposed to be still existing and to be capable of working good or evil to their descendants as a preparation for dealing hereafter with the principles of sociology i have for some years past directed much attention to the modes of thought current in the simpler human societies and evidence of many kinds furnished by all varieties of uncivilized men has forced on me a conclusion harmonizing with that lately expressed in this review by prof huxleynamely that the savage conceiving a corpse to be deserted by the active personality who dwelt in it conceives this active personality to be still existing and that his feelings and ideas concerning it form the basis of his superstitions everywhere we find expressed or implied the belief that each person is double and that when he dies his other self whether remaining near at hand or gone far away may return and continues capable of injuring his enemies and aiding his friends29  but how out of the desire to propitiate this second personality of a deceased man the words ghost and spirit are somewhat misleading since the savage believes that the second personality reappears in a form equally tangible with the first does there grow up the worship of animals plants and inanimate objects very simply savages habitually distinguish individuals by names that are either directly suggestive of some personal trait or fact of personal history or else express an observed community of character with some wellknown object such a genesis of individual names before surnames have arisen is inevitable and how easily it arises we shall see on remembering that it still goes on in its original form even when no longer needful i do not refer only to the significant fact that in some parts of england as in the nailmaking districts nicknames are general and surnames little recognized but i refer to a common usage among both children and adults the rude man is apt to be known as a bear a sly fellow as an old fox a hypocrite as the crocodile names of plants too are used as when the redhaired boy is called carrots by his schoolfellows nor do we lack nicknames derived from inorganic objects and agents instance that given by mr carlyle to the elder sterlingcaptain whirlwind now in the earliest savage state this metaphorical naming will in most cases commence afresh in each generationmust do so indeed until surnames of some kind have been established i say in most cases because there will occur exceptions in the cases of men who have distinguished themselves if the wolf proving famous in fight becomes a terror to neighbouring tribes and a dominant man in his own his sons proud of their parentage will not let fall the fact that they descended from the wolf nor will this fact be forgotten by the rest of the tribe who hold the wolf in awe and see reason to dread his sons in proportion to the power and celebrity of the wolf will this pride and this fear conspire to maintain among his grandchildren and greatgrandchildren as well as among those over whom they dominate the remembrance of the fact that their ancestor was the wolf and if as will occasionally happen this dominant family becomes the root of a new tribe the members of this tribe will become known to themselves and others as the wolves  we need not rest satisfied with the inference that this inheritance of nicknames will take place there is proof that it does take place as nicknaming after animals plants and other objects still goes on among ourselves so among ourselves does there go on the descent of nicknames an instance has come under my own notice on an estate in the west highlands belonging to some friends with whom i frequently have the pleasure of spending a few weeks in the autumn take a young croshek has more than once been the reply of my host to the inquiry who should go with me when i was setting out salmonfishing the elder croshek i knew well and supposed that this name borne by him and by all belonging to him was the family surname years passed before i learned that the real surname was cameron that the father was called croshek after the name of his cottage to distinguish him from other camerons employed about the premises and that his children had come to be similarly distinguished though here as very generally in scotland the nickname was derived from the place of residence yet had it been derived from an animal the process would have been the same inheritance of it would have occurred just as naturally not even for this small link in the argument however need we depend on inference there is fact to bear us out mr bates in his naturalist on the river amazons 2d ed p 376 describing three halfcastes who accompanied him on a hunting trip saystwo of them were brothers namely joão john and zephyrino jabutí jabutí or tortoise being a nickname which their father had earned for his slow gait and which as is usual in this country had descended as the surname of the family let me add the statement made by mr wallace respecting this same region that one of the tribes on the river isánna is called jurupari devils another is called ducks a third stars a fourth mandiocca putting these two statements together can there be any doubt about the genesis of these tribal names let the tortoise become sufficiently distinguished not necessarily by superioritygreat inferiority may occasionally suffice and the tradition of descent from him preserved by his descendants themselves if he was superior and by their contemptuous neighbours if he was inferior may become a tribal name30  but this it will be said does not amount to an explanation of animalworship true a third factor remains to be specified given a belief in the stillexisting other self of the deceased ancestor who must be propitiated given this survival of his metaphorical name among his grandchildren greatgrandchildren etc and the further requisite is that the distinction between metaphor and reality shall be forgotten let tradition fail to keep clearly in view the fact that the ancestor was a man called the wolflet him be habitually spoken of as the wolf just as when alive and the natural mistake of taking the name literally will bring with it firstly a belief in descent from an actual wolf and secondly a treatment of the wolf in a manner likely to propitiate hima manner appropriate to one who may be the other self of the dead ancestor or one of the kindred and therefore a friend  that a misunderstanding of this kind is likely to grow up becomes obvious when we bear in mind the great indefiniteness of primitive language as prof max müller says respecting certain misinterpretations of an opposite kind these metaphors  would become mere names handed down in the conversation of a family understood perhaps by the grandfather familiar to the father but strange to the son and misunderstood by the grandson we have ample reason then for supposing such misinterpretations nay we may go further we are justified in saying that they are certain to occur for undeveloped languages contain no words capable of indicating the distinction to be kept in view in the tongues of existing inferior races only concrete objects and acts are expressible the australians have a name for each kind of tree but no name for tree irrespective of kind and though some witnesses allege that their vocabulary is not absolutely destitute of generic names its extreme poverty in such is unquestionable similarly with the tasmanians dr milligan says they had acquired very limited powers of abstraction or generalization they possessed no words representing abstract ideas for each variety of gumtree and wattletree etc etc they had a name but they had no equivalent for the expression a tree neither could they express abstract qualities such as hard soft warm cold long short round etc for hard they would say like a stone for tall they would say long legs etc and for round they said like a ball like the moon and so on usually suiting the action to the word and confirming by some sign the meaning to be understood31 now even making allowance for overstatement here which seems needful since the word long said to be inexpressible in the abstract subsequently occurs as qualifying a concrete in the expression long legs it is manifest that so imperfect a language must fail to convey the idea of a name as something separate from a thing and that still less can it be capable of indicating the act of naming familiar use of such partiallyabstract words as are applicable to all objects of a class is needful before there can be reached the conception of a namea word symbolizing the symbolic character of other words and the conception of a name with its answering abstract term must be long current before the verb to name can arise hence men with speech so rude cannot transmit the tradition of an ancestor named the wolf as distinguished from the actual wolf the children and grandchildren who saw him will not be led into error but in later generations descent from the wolf will inevitably come to mean descent from the animal known by that name and the ideas and sentiments which as above shown naturally grow up round the belief that the dead parents and grandparents are still alive and ready if propitiated to befriend their descendants will be extended to the wolf species  before passing to other developments of this general view let me point out how not simply animalworship is thus accounted for but also the conception so variously illustrated in ancient legends that animals are capable of displaying human powers of speech and thought and action mythologies are full of stories of beasts and birds and fishes that have played intelligent parts in human affairscreatures that have befriended particular persons by giving them information by guiding them by yielding them help or else that have deceived them verbally or otherwise evidently all these traditions as well as those about abductions of women by animals and fostering of children by them fall naturally into their places as results of the habitual misinterpretation i have described                                       the probability of the hypothesis will appear still greater when we observe how readily it applies to the worship of other orders of objects belief in actual descent from an animal strange as we may think it is one by no means incongruous with the unanalyzed experiences of the savage for there come under his notice many metamorphoses vegetal and animal which are apparently of like character but how could he possibly arrive at so grotesque a conception as that the progenitor of his tribe was the sun or the moon or a particular star no observation of surrounding phenomena affords the slightest suggestion of any such possibility but by the inheritance of nicknames that are eventually mistaken for the names of the objects from which they were derived the belief readily arisesis sure to arise that the names of heavenly bodies will furnish metaphorical names to the uncivilized is manifest do we not ourselves call a distinguished singer or actor a star and have we not in poems numerous comparisons of men and women to the sun and moon as in loves labours lost where the princess is called a gracious moon and as in henry vii where we readthose suns of glory those two lights of men clearly primitive peoples will be not unlikely thus to speak of the chief hero of a successful battle when we remember how the arrival of a triumphant warrior must affect the feelings of his tribe dissipating clouds of anxiety and brightening all faces with joy we shall see that the comparison of him to the sun is quite natural and in early speech this comparison can be made only by calling him the sun as before then it will happen that through a confounding of the metaphorical name with the actual name his progeny after a few generations will be regarded by themselves and others as descendants of the sun and as a consequence partly of actual inheritance of the ancestral character and partly of maintenance of the traditions respecting the ancestors achievements it will also naturally happen that the solar race will be considered a superior race as we find it habitually is  the origin of other totems equally strange if not even stranger is similarly accounted for though otherwise unaccountable one of the newzealand chiefs claimed as his progenitor the neighbouring great mountain tongariro this seeminglywhimsical belief becomes intelligible when we observe how easily it may have arisen from a nickname do we not ourselves sometimes speak figuratively of a tall fat man as a mountain of flesh and among a people prone to speak in still more concrete terms would it not happen that a chief remarkable for his great bulk would be nicknamed after the highest mountain within sight because he towered above other men as this did above surrounding hills such an occurrence is not simply possible but probable and if so the confusion of metaphor with fact would originate this surprising genealogy a notion perhaps yet more grotesque thus receives a satisfactory interpretation what could have put it into the imagination of any one that he was descended from the dawn given the extremest credulity joined with the wildest fancy it would still seem requisite that the ancestor should be conceived as an entity and the dawn is entirely without that definiteness and comparative constancy which enter into the conception of an entity but when we remember that the dawn is a natural complimentary name for a beautiful girl opening into womanhood the genesis of the idea becomes on the above hypothesis quite obvious32                                       another indirect verification is that we thus get a clear conception of fetichism in general under the fetichistic mode of thought surrounding objects and agents are regarded as having powers more or less definitely personal in their natures and the current interpretation is that human intelligence in its early stages is obliged to conceive of their powers under this form i have myself hitherto accepted this interpretation though always with a sense of dissatisfaction this dissatisfaction was i think well grounded the theory is scarcely a theory properly socalled but rather a restatement in other words uncivilized men do habitually form anthropomorphic conceptions of surrounding things and this observed general fact is transformed into the theory that at first they must so conceive thema theory for which the psychological justification attempted seems to me inadequate from our present standpoint it becomes manifest that fetichism is not primary but secondary what has been said above almost of itself shows this let us however follow out the steps of its genesis respecting the tasmanians dr milligan saysthe names of men and women were taken from natural objects and occurrences around as for instance a kangaroo a gum tree snow hail thunder the wind flowers in blossom etc surrounding objects then giving origin to names of persons and being in the way shown eventually mistaken for the actual progenitors of those who descend from persons nicknamed after them it results that these surrounding objects come to be regarded as in some manner possessed of personalities like the human he whose family tradition is that his ancestor was the crab will conceive the crab as having a disguised inner power like his own an alleged descent from the palmtree will entail belief in some kind of consciousness dwelling in the palmtree hence in proportion as the animals plants and inanimate objects or agents that originate names of persons become numerous which they will do in proportion as a tribe becomes large and the number of persons to be distinguished from one another increases multitudinous things around will acquire imaginary personalities and so it will happen that as mr mclennan says of the feejeeans vegetables and stones nay even tools and weapons pots and canoes have souls that are immortal and that like the souls of men pass on at last to mbulu the abode of departed spirits setting out then with a belief in the stillliving other self of the dead ancestor the alleged general cause of misapprehension affords us an intelligible origin of the fetichistic conception and we are enabled to see how it tends to become a general if not a universal conception                                       other apparently inexplicable phenomena are at the same time divested of their strangeness i refer to the beliefs in and worship of compound monstersimpossible hybrid animals and forms that are half human half brutal the theory of a primordial fetichism supposing it otherwise adequate yields no feasible solutions of these grant the alleged original tendency to think of all natural agencies as in some way personal grant too that hence may arise a worship of animals plants and even inanimate bodies still the obvious implication is that the worship so derived will be limited to things that are or have been perceived why should this mode of thought lead the savage to imagine a combination of bird and mammal and not only to imagine it but to worship it as a god if even we admit that some illusion may have suggested the belief in a creature half man half fish we cannot thus explain the prevalence among eastern races of idols representing birdheaded men and men having their legs replaced by the legs of a cock and men with the heads of elephants  carrying with us the inferences above drawn however it is a corollary that ideas and practices of these kinds will arise when tradition preserves both lines of ancestrywhen a chief nicknamed the wolf carries away from an adjacent tribe a wife who is remembered either under the animal name of her tribe or as a woman it will happen that if a son distinguishes himself the remembrance of him among his descendants will be that he was born of a wolf and some other animal or of a wolf and a woman misinterpretation arising in the way described from defects of language will entail belief in a creature uniting the attributes of the two and if the tribe grows into a society representations of such a creature will become objects of worship one of the cases cited by mr mclennan may here be repeated in illustration the story of the origin of the dikokamenni kirgheez they say from a red greyhound and a certain queen and her forty handmaidens is of ancient date now if the red greyhound was the nickname of a man extremely swift of foot celebrated runners have been nicknamed greyhound among ourselves a story of this kind would naturally arise and if the metaphorical name was mistaken for the actual name there might result as the idol of the race a compound form appropriate to the story we need not be surprised then at finding among the egyptians the goddess pasht represented as a woman with a lions head and the god harhat as a man with the head of a hawk the babylonian godsone having the form of a man with an eagles tail and another uniting a human bust to a fishs bodyno longer appear such unaccountable conceptions we get feasible explanations too of sculptures representing sphinxes winged humanheaded bulls etc as well as of the stories about centaurs satyrs and the rest                                       ancient myths in general thus acquire meanings considerably different from those ascribed to them by comparative mythologists though these last may be in part correct yet if the foregoing argument is valid they can scarcely be correct in their main outlines indeed if we read the facts the other way upward regarding as secondary or additional the elements that are said to be primary while we regard as primary certain elements which are considered as accretions of later times we shall i think be nearer the truth  the current theory of the myth is that it has grown out of the habit of symbolizing natural agents and processes in terms of human personalities and actions now it may in the first place be remarked that though symbolization of this kind is common among civilized races it is not common among races that are the most uncivilized by existing savages surrounding objects motions and changes are habitually used to convey ideas respecting human transactions it needs but to read the speech of an indian chief to see that just as primitive men name one another metaphorically after surrounding objects so do they metaphorically describe one anothers doings as though they were the doings of natural objects but assuming a contrary habit of thought to be the dominant one ancient myths are explained as results of the primitive tendency to symbolize inanimate things and their changes by human beings and their doings  a kindred difficulty must be added the change of verbal meaning from which the myth is said to arise is a change opposite in kind to that which prevails in the earlier stages of linguistic development it implies a derivation of the concrete from the abstract whereas at first abstracts are derived only from concretes the concrete of abstracts being a subsequent process in the words of prof max müller there are dialects spoken at the present day which have no abstract nouns and the more we go back in the history of languages the smaller we find the number of these useful expressions chips vol ii p 54 or as he says more recentlyancient words and ancient thoughts for both go together have not yet arrived at that stage of abstraction in which for instance active powers whether natural or supernatural can be represented in any but a personal and more or less human form frasers magazine april 1870 here the concrete is represented as original and the abstract as derivative immediately afterward however prof max müller having given as examples of abstract nouns day and night spring and winter dawn and twilight storm and thunder goes on to argue that as long as people thought in language it was simply impossible to speak of morning or evening of spring and winter without giving to these conceptions something of an individual active sexual and at last personal character chips vol ii p 55 here the concrete is derived from the abstractthe personal conception is represented as coming after the impersonal conception and through such transformation of the impersonal into the personal prof max müller considers ancient myths to have arisen how are these propositions reconcilable one of two things must be saidif originally there were none of these abstract nouns then the earliest statements respecting the daily course of nature were made in concrete termsthe personal elements of the myth were the primitive elements and the impersonal expressions which are their equivalents came later if this is not admitted then it must be held that until after there arose these abstract nouns there were no current statements at all respecting these most conspicuous objects and changes which the heavens and the earth present and that the abstract nouns having been somehow formed and rightly formed and used without personal meanings afterward became personalizeda process the reverse of that which characterizes early linguistic progress  no such contradictions occur if we interpret myths after the manner that has been indicated nay besides escaping contradictions we meet with unexpected solutions the moment we try it the key unlocks for us with ease what seems a quite inexplicable fact which the current hypothesis takes as one of its postulates speaking of such words as sky and earth dew and rain rivers and mountains as well as of the abstract nouns above named prof max müller saysnow in ancient languages every one of these words had necessarily a termination expressive of gender and this naturally produced in the mind the corresponding idea of sex so that these names received not only an individual but a sexual character there was no substantive which was not either masculine or feminine neuters being of later growth and distinguishable chiefly in the nominative chips vol ii p 55 and this alleged necessity for a masculine or feminine implication is assigned as a part of the reason why these abstract nouns and collective nouns became personalized but should not a true theory of these first steps in the evolution of thought and language show us how it happened that men acquired the seeminglystrange habit of so framing their words for sky earth dew rain etc as to make them indicative of sex or at any rate must it not be admitted that an interpretation which instead of assuming this habit to be necessary shows us how it results thereby acquires an additional claim to acceptance the interpretation i have indicated does this if men and women are habitually nicknamed and if defects of language lead their descendants to regard themselves as descendants of the things from which the names were taken then masculine or feminine genders will be ascribed to these things according as the ancestors named after them were men or women if a beautiful maiden known metaphorically as the dawn afterwards becomes the mother of some distinguished chief called the north wind it will result that when in course of time the two have been mistaken for the actual dawn and the actual north wind these will by implication be respectively considered as male and female  looking now at the ancient myths in general their seemingly most inexplicable trait is the habitual combination of alleged human ancestry and adventures with the possession of personalities otherwise figuring in the heavens and on the earth with totally nonhuman attributes this enormous incongruity not the exception but the rule the current theory fails to explain suppose it to be granted that the great terrestrial and celestial objects and agents naturally become personalized it does not follow that each of them shall have a specific human biography to say of some star that he was the son of this king or that hero was born in a particular place and when grown up carried off the wife of a neighbouring chief is a gratuitous multiplication of incongruities already sufficiently great and is not accounted for by the alleged necessary personalization of abstract and collective nouns as looked at from our present standpoint however such traditions become quite naturalnay it is clear that they will necessarily arise when a nickname has become a tribal name it thereby ceases to be individually distinctive and as already said the process of nicknaming inevitably continues it commences afresh with each child and the nickname of each child is both an individual name and a potential tribal name which may become an actual tribal name if the individual is sufficiently celebrated usually then there is a double set of distinctions under one of which the individual is known by his ancestral name and under the other of which he is known by a name suggestive of something peculiar to himself just as we have seen happens among the scotch clans consider now what will result when language has reached a stage of development such that it can convey the notion of naming and is able therefore to preserve traditions of human ancestry it will result that the individual will be known both as the son of such and such a man by a mother whose name was so and so and also as the crab or the bear or the whirlwindsupposing one of these to be his nickname such joint use of nicknames and proper names occurs in every school now clearly in advancing from the early state in which ancestors become identified with the objects they are nicknamed after to the state in which there are proper names that have lost their metaphorical meanings there must be passed through a state in which proper names partially settled only may or may not be preserved and in which the new nicknames are still liable to be mistaken for actual names under such conditions there will arise especially in the case of a distinguished man this seeminglyimpossible combination of human parentage with the possession of the nonhuman or superhuman attributes of the thing which gave the nickname another anomaly simultaneously disappears the warrior may have and often will have a variety of complimentary nicknamesthe powerful one the destroyer etc supposing his leading nickname has been the sun then when he comes to be identified by tradition with the sun it will happen that the sun will acquire his alternative descriptive titlesthe swift one the lion the wolftitles not obviously appropriate to the sun but quite appropriate to the warrior then there comes too an explanation of the remaining trait of such myths when this identification of conspicuous persons male and female with conspicuous natural agents has become settled there will in due course arise interpretations of the actions of these agents in anthropomorphic terms suppose for instance that endymion and selene metaphorically named the one after the setting sun the other after the moon have had their human individualities merged in those of the sun and moon through misinterpretation of metaphors what will happen the legend of their loves having to be reconciled with their celestial appearances and motions these will be spoken of as results of feeling and will so that when the sun is going down in the west while the moon in midheaven is following him the fact will be expressed by saying selene loves and watches endymion thus we obtain a consistent explanation of the myth without distorting it and without assuming that it contains gratuitous fictions we are enabled to accept the biographical part of it if not as literal fact still as having had fact for its root we are helped to see how by an inevitable misinterpretation there grew out of a more or less true tradition this strange identification of its personages with objects and powers totally nonhuman in their aspects and then we are shown how from the attempt to reconcile in thought these contradictory elements of the myth there arose the habit of ascribing the actions of these nonhuman things to human motives  one further verification may be drawn from facts which are obstacles to the converse hypothesis these objects and powers celestial and terrestrial which force themselves most on mens attention have some of them several proper names identified with those of different individuals born at different places and having different sets of adventures thus we have the sun variously known as apollo endymion helios tithonos etcpersonages having irreconcilable genealogies such anomalies prof max müller apparently ascribes to the untrustworthiness of traditions which are careless about contradictions or ready to solve them sometimes by the most atrocious expedients chips vol ii p 84 but if the evolution of the myth has been that above indicated there exists no anomalies to be got rid of these diverse genealogies become parts of the evidence for we have abundant proof that the same objects furnish metaphorical names of men in different tribes there are duck tribes in australia in south america in north america the eagle is still a totem among the north americans as mr mclennan shows reason to conclude that it was among the egyptians among the jews and among the romans obviously for reasons already assigned it naturally happened in the early stages of the ancient races that complimentary comparisons of their heroes to the sun were frequently made what resulted the sun having furnished names for sundry chiefs and early founders of tribes and local traditions having severally identified them with the sun these tribes when they grew spread conquered or came otherwise into partial union originated a combined mythology which necessarily contained conflicting stories about the sungod as about its other leading personages if the northamerican tribes among several of which there are traditions of a sungod had developed a combined civilization there would similarly have arisen among them a mythology which ascribed to the sun several different proper names and genealogies                                       let me briefly set down the leading characters of this hypothesis which give it probability  true interpretations of all the natural processes organic and inorganic that have gone on in past times habitually trace them to causes still in action it is thus in geology it is thus in biology it is thus in philology here we find this characteristic repeated nicknaming the inheritance of nicknames and to some extent the misinterpretation of nicknames go on among us still and were surnames absent language imperfect and knowledge as rudimentary as of old it is tolerably manifest that results would arise like those we have contemplated  a further characteristic of a true cause is that it accounts not only for the particular group of phenomena to be interpreted but also for other groups the cause here alleged does this it equally well explains the worship of animals of plants of mountains of winds of celestial bodies and even of appearances too vague to be considered entities it gives us an intelligible genesis of fetichistic conceptions in general it furnishes us with a reason for the practice otherwise so unaccountable of moulding the words applied to inanimate objects in such ways as to imply masculine and feminine genders it shows us how there naturally arose the worship of compound animals and of monsters half man half brute and it shows us why the worship of purely anthropomorphic deities came later when language had so far developed that it could preserve in tradition the distinction between proper names and nicknames  a further verification of this view is that it conforms to the general law of evolution showing us how out of one simple vague aboriginal form of belief there have arisen by continuous differentiations the many heterogeneous forms of belief which have existed and do exist the desire to propitiate the other self of the dead ancestor displayed among savage tribes dominantly manifested by the early historic races by the peruvians and mexicans by the chinese at the present time and to a considerable degree by ourselves for what else is the wish to do that which a latelydeceased parent was known to have desired has been the universal first form of religious belief and from it have grown up the many divergent beliefs which have been referred to  let me add as a further reason for adopting this view that it immensely diminishes the apparentlygreat contrast between early modes of thought and our own mode of thought doubtless the aboriginal man differs considerably from us both in intellect and feeling but such an interpretation of the facts as helps us to bridge over the gap derives additional likelihood from doing this the hypothesis i have sketched out enables us to see that primitive ideas are not so gratuitously absurd as we suppose and also enables us to rehabilitate the ancient myth with far less distortion than at first sight appears possible  these views i hope to develop in the first part of the principles of sociology the large mass of evidence which i shall be able to give in support of the hypothesis joined with the solutions it will be shown to yield of many minor problems which i have passed over will i think then give to it a still greater probability than it seems now to have  footnotes  footnote 29 a critical reader may raise an objection if animalworship is to be rationally interpreted how can the interpretation set out by assuming a belief in the spirits of dead ancestorsa belief which just as much requires explanation doubtless there is here a wide gap in the argument i hope eventually to fill it up here out of many experiences which conspire to generate this belief i can but briefly indicate the leading ones 1 it is not impossible that his shadow following him everywhere and moving as he moves may have some small share in giving to the savage a vague idea of his duality it needs but to watch a childs interest in the movements of its shadow and to remember that at first a shadow cannot be interpreted as a negation of light but is looked upon as an entity to perceive that the savage may very possibly consider it as a specific something which forms part of him 2 a much more decided suggestion of the same kind is likely to result from the reflection of his face and figure in water imitating him as it does in his form colours motions grimaces when we remember that not unfrequently a savage objects to have his portrait taken because he thinks whoever carries away a representation of him carries away some part of his being we see how probable it is that he thinks his double in the water is a reality in some way belonging to him 3 echoes must greatly tend to confirm the idea of duality otherwise arrived at incapable as he is of understanding their natural origin the primitive man necessarily ascribes them to living beingsbeings who mock him and elude his search 4 the suggestions resulting from these and other physical phenomena are however secondary in importance the root of this belief in another self lies in the experience of dreams the distinction so easily made by us between our life in dreams and our real life is one which the savage recognizes in but a vague way and he cannot express even that distinction which he perceives when he awakes and to those who have seen him lying quietly asleep describes where he has been and what he has done his rude language fails to state the difference between seeing and dreaming that he saw doing and dreaming that he did from this inadequacy of his language it not only results that he cannot truly represent this difference to others but also that he cannot truly represent it to himself hence in the absence of an alternative interpretation his belief and that of those to whom he tells his adventures is that his other self has been away and came back when he awoke and this belief which we find among various existing savage tribes we equally find in the traditions of the early civilized races 5 the conception of another self capable of going away and returning receives what to the savage must seem conclusive verifications from the abnormal suspensions of consciousness and derangements of consciousness that occasionally occur in members of his tribe one who has fainted and cannot be immediately brought back to himself note the significance of our own phrases returning to himself etc as a sleeper can shows him a state in which the other self has been away for a time beyond recall still more is this prolonged absence of the other self shown him in cases of apoplexy catalepsy and other forms of suspended animation here for hours the other self persists in remaining away and on returning refuses to say where he has been further verification is afforded by every epileptic subject into whose body during the absence of the other self some enemy has entered for how else does it happen that the other self on returning denies all knowledge of what his body has been doing and this supposition that the body has been possessed by some other being is confirmed by the phenomena of somnambulism and insanity 6 what then is the interpretation inevitably put upon death the other self has habitually returned after sleep which simulates death it has returned too after fainting which simulates death much more it has even returned after the rigid state of catalepsy which simulates death very greatly will it not return also after this still more prolonged quiescence and rigidity clearly it is quite possiblequite probable even the dead mans other self is gone away for a long time but it still exists somewhere far or near and may at any moment come back to do all he said he would do hence the various burialritesthe placing of weapons and valuables along with the body the daily bringing of food to it etc i hope hereafter to show that with such knowledge of the facts as he has this interpretation is the most reasonable the savage can arrive at let me here however by way of showing how clearly the facts bear out this view give one illustration out of many the ceremonies with which they the veddahs invoke them the shades of the dead are few as they are simple the most common is the following an arrow is fixed upright in the ground and the veddah dances slowly round it chanting this invocation which is almost musical in its rhythm       mâ miya mâ miy mâ deyâ      topang koyihetti mittigan yandâh     my departed one my departed one my god    where art thou wandering  this invocation appears to be used on all occasions when the intervention of the guardian spirits is required in sickness preparatory to hunting etc sometimes in the latter case a portion of the flesh of the game is promised as a votive offering in the event of the chase being successful and they believe that the spirits will appear to them in dreams and tell them where to hunt sometimes they cook food and place it in the dry bed of a river or some other secluded spot and then call on their deceased ancestors by name come and partake of this give us maintenance as you did when living come wheresoever you may be on a tree on a rock in the forest come and they dance round the food half chanting half shouting the invocationbailey in transactions of the ethnological society london n s ii p 3012  footnote 30 since the foregoing pages were written my attention has been drawn by sir john lubbock to a passage in the appendix to the second edition of prehistoric times in which he has indicated this derivation of tribal names he says in endeavouring to account for the worship of animals we must remember that names are very frequently taken from them the children and followers of a man called the bear or the lion would make that a tribal name hence the animal itself would be first respected at last worshipped of the genesis of this worship however sir john lubbock does not give any specific explanation apparently he inclines to the belief tacitly adopted also by mr mclennan that animalworship is derived from an original fetichism of which it is a more developed form as will shortly be seen i take a different view of its origin  footnote 31 proceedings of the royal society of tasmania iii p 28081  footnote 32 i have since found however that the name dawn which occurs in various places seems more frequently a birthname given because the birth took place at dawn     morals and moral sentiments      first published in the fortnightly review for april 1871   if a writer who discusses unsettled questions takes up every gauntlet thrown down to him polemical writing will absorb much of his energy having a power of work which unfortunately does not suffice for executing with anything like due rapidity the task i have undertaken i have made it a policy to avoid controversy as much as possible even at the cost of being seriously misunderstood hence it resulted that when in macmillans magazine for july 1869 mr richard hutton published under the title a questionable parentage for morals a criticism on a doctrine of mine i decided to let his misrepresentations pass unnoticed until in the course of my work i arrived at the stage where by a full exposition of this doctrine they would be set aside it did not occur to me that in the meantime these erroneous statements accepted as true statements would be repeated by other writers and my views commented upon as untenable this however has happened in more periodicals than one i have seen it asserted that mr hutton has effectually disposed of my hypothesis supposing that this hypothesis has been rightly expressed by mr hutton sir john lubbock in his origin of civilisation c has been led to express a partial dissent which i think he would not have expressed had my own exposition been before him mr mivart too in his recent genesis of species has been similarly betrayed into misapprehensions and now sir alexander grant following the same lead has conveyed to the readers of the fortnightly review another of these conceptions which is but very partially true thus i find myself compelled to say as much as will serve to prevent further spread of the mischief                                       if a general doctrine concerning a highlyinvolved class of phenomena could be adequately presented in a single paragraph of a letter the writing of books would be superfluous in the brief exposition of certain ethical doctrines held by me which is given in professor bains mental and moral science it is stated that they are       as yet nowhere fully expressed they form part of the more      general doctrine of evolution which he is engaged in working out      and they are at present to be gathered only from scattered      passages it is true that in his first work social statics he      presented what he then regarded as a tolerably complete view of one      division of morals but without abandoning this view he now      regards it as inadequatemore especially in respect of its basis  mr hutton however taking the bare enunciation of one part of this basis deals with it critically and in the absence of any exposition by me sets forth what he supposes to be my grounds for it and proceeds to show that they are unsatisfactory  if in his anxiety to suppress what he doubtless regards as a pernicious doctrine mr hutton could not wait until i had explained myself it might have been expected that he would use whatever information was to be had concerning it so far from seeking out such information however he has in a way for which i cannot account ignored the information immediately before him  the title which mr hutton has chosen for his criticism is a questionable parentage for morals now he has ample means of knowing that i allege a primary basis of morals quite independent of that which he describes and rejects i do not refer merely to the fact that having when he reviewed social statics33 expressed his very decided dissent from this primary basis he must have been aware that i alleged it for he may say that in the many years which have since elapsed he had forgotten all about it but i refer to the distinct enunciation of this primary basis in that letter to mr mill from which he quotes in a preceding paragraph of the letter i have explained that while i accept utilitarianism in the abstract i do not accept that current utilitarianism which recognizes for the guidance of conduct nothing beyond empirical generalizations and i have contended that       morality properly socalledthe science of right conducthas      for its object to determine how and why certain modes of      conduct are detrimental and certain other modes beneficial these      good and bad results cannot be accidental but must be necessary      consequences of the constitution of things and i conceive it to be      the business of moral science to deduce from the laws of life and      the conditions of existence what kinds of action necessarily tend      to produce happiness and what kinds to produce unhappiness having      done this its deductions are to be recognised as laws of conduct      and are to be conformed to irrespective of a direct estimation of      happiness or misery  nor is this the only enunciation of what i conceive to be the primary basis of morals contained in this same letter a subsequent paragraph separated by four lines only from that which mr hutton extracts commences thus      progressing civilization which is of necessity a succession of     compromises between old and new requires a perpetual readjustment     of the compromise between the ideal and the practicable in social     arrangements to which end both elements of the compromise must be     kept in view if it is true that pure rectitude prescribes a system     of things far too good for men as they are it is not less true that     mere expediency does not of itself tend to establish a system of     things any better than that which exists while absolute morality     owes to expediency the checks which prevent it from rushing into     utopian absurdities expediency is indebted to absolute morality for     all stimulus to improvement granted that we are chiefly interested     in ascertaining what is relatively right it still follows that we      must first consider what is absolutely right since the one     conception presupposes the other  i do not see how there could well be a more emphatic assertion that there exists a primary basis of morals independent of and in a sense antecedent to that which is furnished by experiences of utility and consequently independent of and in a sense antecedent to those moral sentiments which i conceive to be generated by such experiences yet no one could gather from mr huttons article that i assert this or would even find reasons for a faint suspicion that i do so from the reference made to my further views he would infer my acceptance of that empirical utilitarianism which i have expressly repudiated and the title which mr hutton gives to his paper clearly asserts by implication that i recognize no parentage for morals beyond that of the accumulation and organization of the effects of experience i cannot believe that mr hutton intended to convey this erroneous impression he was i suppose too much absorbed in contemplating the proposition he combats to observe or at least to attach any weight to the propositions which accompany it but i am sorry he did not perceive the mischief he was likely to do me by spreading this onesided statement                                       i pass now to the particular question at issuenot the parentage for morals but the parentage of moral sentiments in describing my view on this more special doctrine mr hutton has similarly i regret to say neglected the data which would have helped him to draw an approximately true outline of it it cannot well be that the existence of such data was unknown to him they are contained in the principles of psychology and mr hutton reviewed that work when it was first published34 in a chapter on the feelings which occurs near the end of it there is sketched out a process of evolution by no means like that which mr hutton indicates and had he turned to that chapter he would have seen that his description of the genesis of moral sentiments out of organized experiences is not such a one as i should have given let me quote a passage from that chapter       not only are those emotions which form the immediate stimuli to      actions thus explicable but the like explanation applies to the      emotions that leave the subject of them comparatively passive as      for instance the emotion produced by beautiful scenery the      gradually increasing complexity in the groups of sensations and      ideas coordinated ends in the coordination of those vast      aggregations of them which a grand landscape excites and suggests      the infant taken into the midst of mountains is totally unaffected      by them but is delighted with the small group of attributes and      relations presented in a toy the child can appreciate and be      pleased with the more complicated relations of household objects      and localities the garden the field and the street but it is      only in youth and mature age when individual things and small      assemblages of them have become familiar and automatically      cognizable that those immense assemblages which landscapes present      can be adequately grasped and the highly aggregated states of      consciousness produced by them experienced then however the      various minor groups of states that have been in earlier days      severally produced by trees by fields by streams by cascades by      rocks by precipices by mountains by clouds are aroused      together along with the sensations immediately received there are      partially excited the myriads of sensations that have been in times      past received from objects such as those presented further there      are partially excited the various incidental feelings that were      experienced on all these countless past occasions and there are      probably also excited certain deeper but now vague combinations of      states that were organized in the race during barbarous times      when its pleasurable activities were chiefly among the woods and      waters and out of all these excitations some of them actual but      most of them nascent is composed the emotion which a fine      landscape produces in us  it is i think amply manifest that the processes here indicated are not to be taken as intellectual processesnot as processes in which recognized relations between pleasures and their antecedents or intelligent adaptations of means to ends form the dominant elements the state of mind produced by an aggregate of picturesque objects is not one resolvable into propositions the sentiment does not contain within itself any consciousness of causes and consequences of happiness the vague recollections of other beautiful scenes and other delightful days which it dimly rouses are not aroused because of any rational coordinations of ideas that have been formed in bygone years mr hutton however assumes that in speaking of the genesis of moral feelings as due to inherited experiences of the pleasures and pains caused by certain modes of conduct i am speaking of reasonedout experiencesexperiences consciously accumulated and generalized he overlooks the fact that the genesis of emotions is distinguished from the genesis of ideas in this that whereas the ideas are composed of elements that are simple definitely related and in the case of general ideas constantly related emotions are composed of enormously complex aggregates of elements that are never twice alike and which stand in relations that are never twice alike the difference in the resulting modes of consciousness is thisin the genesis of an idea the successive experiences be they of sounds colours touches tastes or be they of the special objects which combine many of these into groups have so much in common that each when it occurs can be definitely thought of as like those which preceded it but in the genesis of an emotion the successive experiences so far differ that each of them when it occurs suggests past experiences which are not specifically similar but have only a general similarity and at the same time it suggests benefits or evils in past experience which likewise are various in their special natures though they have a certain community in general nature hence it results that the consciousness aroused is a multitudinous confused consciousness in which along with a certain kind of combination among the impressions received from without there is a vague cloud of ideal combinations akin to them and a vague mass of ideal feelings of pleasure or pain which were associated with these we have abundant proof that feelings grow up without reference to recognized causes and consequences and without the possessor of them being able to say why they have grown up though analysis nevertheless shows that they have been formed out of connected experiences the familiar fact that a kind of jam which was during childhood repeatedly taken after medicine may become by simple association of sensations so nauseous that it cannot be tolerated in afterlife illustrates clearly the way in which repugnances may be established by habitual association of feelings without any belief in causal connexion or rather in spite of the knowledge that there is no causal connexion similarly with pleasurable emotions the cawing of rooks is not in itself an agreeable sound musically considered it is very much the contrary yet the cawing of rooks usually produces in people feelings of a grateful kindfeelings which most of them suppose to result from the quality of the sound itself only the few who are given to selfanalysis are aware that the cawing of rooks is agreeable to them because it has been connected with countless of their greatest gratificationswith the gathering of wild flowers in childhood with saturdayafternoon excursions in schoolboy days with midsummer holidays in the country when books were thrown aside and lessons were replaced by games and adventures in the fields with fresh sunny mornings in afteryears when a walking excursion was an immense relief from toil as it is this sound though not causally related to all these multitudinous and varied past delights but only often associated with them can no more be heard without rousing a dim consciousness of these delights than the voice of an old friend unexpectedly coming into the house can be heard without suddenly raising a wave of that feeling that has resulted from the pleasures of past companionship if we are to understand the genesis of emotions either in the individual or in the race we must take account of this allimportant process mr hutton however apparently overlooking it and not having reminded himself by referring to the principles of psychology that i insist upon it represents my hypothesis to be that a certain sentiment results from the consolidation of intellectual conclusions he speaks of me as believing that what seems to us now the necessary intuitions and a priori assumptions of human nature are likely to prove when scientifically analysed nothing but a similar conglomeration of our ancestors best observations and most useful empirical rules he supposes me to think that men having in past times come to see that truthfulness was useful the habit of approving truthspeaking and fidelity to engagements which was first based on this ground of utility became so rooted that the utilitarian ground of it was forgotten and we find ourselves springing to the belief in truthspeaking and fidelity to engagements from an inherited tendency similarly throughout mr hutton has so used the word utility and so interpreted it on my behalf as to make me appear to mean that moral sentiment is formed out of conscious generalizations respecting what is beneficial and what detrimental were such my hypothesis his criticisms would be very much to the point but as such is not my hypothesis they fall to the ground the experiences of utility i refer to are those which become registered not as distinctly recognized connexions between certain kinds of acts and certain kinds of remote results but those which become registered in the shape of associations between groups of feelings that have often recurred together though the relation between them has not been consciously generalizedassociations the origin of which may be as little perceived as is the origin of the pleasure given by the sounds of a rookery but which nevertheless have arisen in the course of daily converse with things and serve as incentives or deterrents  in the paragraph which mr hutton has extracted from my letter to mr mill i have indicated an analogy between those effects of emotional experiences out of which i believe moral sentiments have been developed and those effects of intellectual experiences out of which i believe spaceintuitions have been developed rightly considering that the first of these hypotheses cannot stand if the last is disproved mr hutton has directed part of his attack against this last but would it not have been well if he had referred to the principles of psychology where this last hypothesis is set forth at length before criticising it would it not have been well to give an abstract of my own description of the process instead of substituting what he supposes my description must be any one who turns to the principles of psychology first edition pp 218245 and reads the two chapters the perception of body as presenting statical attributes and the perception of space will find that mr huttons account of my view on this matter has given him no notion of the view as it is expressed by me and will perhaps be less inclined to smile than he was when he read mr huttons account i cannot here do more than thus imply the invalidity of such part of mr huttons argument as proceeds upon this incorrect representation the pages which would be required for properly explaining the doctrine that spaceintuitions result from organized experiences may be better used for explaining this analogous doctrine at present before us this i will now endeavour to do not indirectly by correcting misapprehensions but directly by an exposition which shall be as brief as the extremely involved nature of the process allows  an infant in arms when old enough to gaze at objects around with some vague recognition smiles in response to the laughing face and soft caressing voice of its mother let there come some one who with an angry face speaks to it in loud harsh tones the smile disappears the features contract into an expression of pain and beginning to cry it turns away its head and makes such movements of escape as are possible what is the meaning of these facts why does not the frown make it smile and the mothers laugh make it weep there is but one answer already in its developing brain there is coming into play the structure through which one cluster of visual and auditory impressions excites pleasurable feelings and the structure through which another cluster of visual and auditory impressions excites painful feelings the infant knows no more about the relation existing between a ferocious expression of face and the evils which may follow perception of it than the young bird just out of its nest knows of the possible pain and death which may be inflicted by a man coming towards it and as certainly in the one case as in the other the alarm felt is due to a partiallyestablished nervous structure why does this partiallyestablished nervous structure betray its presence thus early in the human being simply because in the past experiences of the human race smiles and gentle tones in those around have been the habitual accompaniments of pleasurable feelings while pains of many kinds immediate and more or less remote have been continually associated with the impressions received from knit brows and set teeth and grating voice much deeper down than the history of the human race must we go to find the beginnings of these connexions the appearances and sounds which excite in the infant a vague dread indicate danger and do so because they are the physiological accompaniments of destructive actionsome of them common to man and inferior mammals and consequently understood by inferior mammals as every puppy shows us what we call the natural language of anger is due to a partial contraction of those muscles which actual combat would call into play and all marks of irritation down to that passing shade over the brow which accompanies slight annoyance are incipient stages of these same contractions conversely with the natural language of pleasure and of that state of mind which we call amicable feeling this too has a physiological interpretation35  let us pass now from the infant in arms to the children in the nursery what have the experiences of each been doing in aid of the emotional development we are considering while its limbs have been growing more agile by exercise its manipulative skill increasing by practice its perceptions of objects growing by use quicker more accurate more comprehensive the associations between these two sets of impressions received from those around and the pleasures and pains received along with them or after them have been by frequent repetition made stronger and their adjustments better the dim sense of pain and the vague glow of delight which the infant felt have in the urchin severally taken shapes that are more definite the angry voice of a nursemaid no longer arouses only a formless feeling of dread but also a specific idea of the slap that may follow the frown on the face of a bigger brother along with the primitive indefinable sense of ill brings the ideas of ills that are definable as kicks and cuffs and pullings of hair and losses of toys the faces of parents looking now sunny now gloomy have grown to be respectively associated with multitudinous forms of gratification and multitudinous forms of discomfort or privation hence these appearances and sounds which imply amity or enmity in those around become symbolic of happiness and misery so that eventually perception of the one set or the other can scarcely occur without raising a wave of pleasurable feeling or of painful feeling the body of this wave is still substantially of the same nature as it was at first for though in each of these multitudinous experiences a special set of facial and vocal signs has been connected with a special set of pleasures or pains yet since these pleasures or pains have been immensely varied in their kinds and combinations and since the signs that preceded them were in no two cases quite alike it results that even to the end the consciousness produced remains as vague as it is voluminous the thousands of partiallyaroused ideas resulting from past experiences are massed together and superposed so as to form an aggregate in which nothing is distinct but which has the character of being pleasurable or painful according to the nature of its original components the chief difference between this developed feeling and the feeling aroused in the infant being that on bright or dark background forming the body of it may now be sketched out in thought the particular pleasures or pains which the particular circumstances suggest as likely  what must be the working of this process under the conditions of aboriginal life the emotions given to the young savage by the natural language of love and hate in the members of his tribe gain first a partial definiteness in respect to his intercourse with his family and playmates and he learns by experience the utility in so far as his own ends are concerned of avoiding courses which call from others manifestations of anger and taking courses which call from them manifestations of pleasure not that he consciously generalizes he does not at that age probably not at any age formulate his experiences in the general principle that it is well for him to do things which bring smiles and to avoid doing things which bring frowns what happens is that having in the way shown inherited this connexion between the perception of anger in others and the feeling of dread and having discovered that certain acts of his bring on this anger he cannot subsequently think of committing one of these acts without thinking of the resulting anger and feeling more or less of the resulting dread he has no thought of the utility or inutility of the act itself the deterrent is the mainly vague but partially definite fear of evil that may follow so understood the deterring emotion is one which has grown out of experiences of utility using that word in its ethical sense and if we ask why this dreaded anger is called forth from others we shall habitually find that it is because the forbidden act entails pain somewhereis negatived by utility on passing from domestic injunctions to injunctions current in the tribe we see no less clearly how these emotions produced by approbation and reprobation come to be connected in experience with actions which are beneficial to the tribe and actions which are detrimental to the tribe and how there consequently grow up incentives to the one class of actions and prejudices against the other class from early boyhood the young savage hears recounted the daring deeds of his chiefhears them in words of praise and sees all faces glowing with admiration from time to time also he listens while some ones cowardice is described in tones of scorn and with contemptuous metaphors and sees him meet with derision and insult whenever he appears that is to say one of the things that come to be associated in his mind with smiling faces which are symbolical of pleasures in general is courage and one of the things that come to be associated in his mind with frowns and other marks of enmity which form his symbol of unhappiness is cowardice these feelings are not formed in him because he has reasoned his way to the truth that courage is useful to the tribe and by implication to himself or to the truth that cowardice is a cause of evil in adult life he may perhaps see this but he certainly does not see it at the time when bravery is thus joined in his consciousness with all that is good and cowardice with all that is bad similarly there are produced in him feelings of inclination or repugnance towards other lines of conduct that have become established or interdicted because they are beneficial or injurious to the tribe though neither the young nor the adults know why they have become established or interdicted instance the praiseworthiness of wifestealing and the viciousness of marrying within the tribe  we may now ascend a stage to an order of incentives and restraints derived from these the primitive belief is that every dead man becomes a demon who is often somewhere at hand may at any moment return may give aid or do mischief and has to be continually propitiated hence among other agents whose approbation or reprobation are contemplated by the savage as consequences of his conduct are the spirits of his ancestors when a child he is told of their deeds now in triumphant tones now in whispers of horror and the instilled belief that they may inflict some vaguelyimagined but fearful evil or give some great help becomes a powerful incentive or deterrent especially does this happen when the story is of a chief distinguished for his strength his ferocity his persistence in that revenge on enemies which the experiences of the savage make him regard as beneficial and virtuous the consciousness that such a chief dreaded by neighbouring tribes and dreaded too by members of his own tribe may reappear and punish those who have disregarded his injunctions becomes a powerful motive but it is clear in the first place that the imagined anger and the imagined satisfaction of this deified chief are simply transfigured forms of the anger and satisfaction displayed by those around and that the feelings accompanying such imaginations have the same original root in the experiences which have associated an average of painful results with the manifestation of anothers anger and an average of pleasurable results with the manifestation of anothers satisfaction and it is clear in the second place that the actions thus forbidden and encouraged must be mostly actions that are respectively detrimental and beneficial to the tribe since the successful chief is usually a better judge than the rest and has the preservation of the tribe at heart hence experiences of utility consciously or unconsciously organized underlie his injunctions and the sentiments which prompt obedience are though very indirectly and without the knowledge of those who feel them referable to experiences of utility  this transfigured form of restraint differing at first but little from the original form admits of immense development accumulating traditions growing in grandeur as they are repeated from generation to generation make more and more superhuman the earlyrecorded hero of the race his powers of inflicting punishment and giving happiness become ever greater more multitudinous and more varied so that the dread of divine displeasure and the desire to obtain divine approbation acquire a certain largeness and generality still the conceptions remain anthropomorphic the revengeful deity continues to be thought of in terms of human emotions and continues to be represented as displaying these emotions in human ways moreover the sentiments of right and duty so far as they have become developed refer mainly to divine commands and interdicts and have little reference to the natures of the acts commanded or interdicted in the intended offeringup of isaac in the sacrifice of jephthahs daughter and in the hewing to pieces of agag as much as in the countless atrocities committed from religious motives by various early historic races as by some existing savage races we see that the morality and immorality of actions as we understand them are at first little recognized and that the feelings chiefly of dread which serve in place of them are feelings felt towards the unseen beings supposed to issue the commands and interdicts  here it will be said that as just admitted these are not the moral sentiments properly so called they are simply sentiments that precede and make possible those highest sentiments which do not refer either to personal benefits or evils to be expected from men or to more remote rewards and punishments several comments are however called forth by this criticism one is that if we glance back at past beliefs and their correlative feelings as shown in dantes poem in the mysteryplays of the middle ages in st bartholomew massacres in burnings for heresy we get proof that in comparatively modern times right and wrong meant little else than subordination or insubordinationto a divine ruler primarily and under him to a human ruler another is that down to our own day this conception largely prevails and is even embodied in elaborate ethical worksinstance the essays on the principles of morality by jonathan dymond which recognizes no ground of moral obligation save the will of god as expressed in the current creed and yet a further is that while in sermons the torments of the damned and the joys of the blessed are set forth as the dominant deterrents and incentives and while we have prepared for us printed instructions how to make the best of both worlds it cannot be denied that the feelings which impel and restrain men are still largely composed of elements like those operative on the savage the dread partly vague partly specific associated with the idea of reprobation human and divine and the sense of satisfaction partly vague partly specific associated with the idea of approbation human and divine  but during the growth of that civilization which has been made possible by these egoaltruistic sentiments there have been slowly evolving the altruistic sentiments development of these has gone on only as fast as society has advanced to a state in which the activities are mainly peaceful the root of all the altruistic sentiments is sympathy and sympathy could become dominant only when the mode of life instead of being one that habitually inflicted direct pain became one which conferred direct and indirect benefits the pains inflicted being mainly incidental and indirect adam smith made a large step towards this truth when he recognized sympathy as giving rise to these superior controlling emotions his theory of moral sentiments however requires to be supplemented in two ways the natural process by which sympathy becomes developed into a more and more important element of human nature has to be explained and there has also to be explained the process by which sympathy produces the highest and most complex of the altruistic sentimentsthat of justice respecting the first process i can here do no more than say that sympathy may be proved both inductively and deductively to be the concomitant of gregariousness the two having all alongincreased by reciprocal aid multiplication has ever tended to force into an association more or less close all creatures having kinds of food and supplies of food that permit association and established psychological laws warrant the inference that some sympathy will inevitably result from habitual manifestations of feelings in presence of one another and that the gregariousness being augmented by the increase of sympathy further facilitates the development of sympathy but there are negative and positive checks upon this developmentnegative because sympathy cannot advance faster than intelligence advances since it presupposes the power of interpreting the natural language of the various feelings and of mentally representing those feelings positive because the immediate needs of selfpreservation are often at variance with its promptings as for example during the predatory stages of human progress for explanations of the second process i must refer to the principles of psychology § 202 first edition and § 215 second edition and to social statics part ii chapter v36 asking that in default of space these explanations may be taken for granted let me here point out in what sense even sympathy and the sentiments that result from it are due to experiences of utility if we suppose all thought of rewards or punishments immediate or remote to be left out of consideration it is clear that any one who hesitates to inflict a pain because of the vivid representation of that pain which rises in his consciousness is restrained not by any sense of obligation or by any formulated doctrine of utility but by the painful association established in him and it is clear that if after repeated experiences of the moral discomfort he has felt from witnessing the unhappiness indirectly caused by some of his acts he is led to check himself when again tempted to those acts the restraint is of like nature conversely with the pleasuregiving acts repetitions of kind deeds and experiences of the sympathetic gratifications that follow tend continually to make stronger the association between such deeds and feelings of happiness  eventually these experiences may be consciously generalized and there may result a deliberate pursuit of sympathetic gratifications there may also come to be distinctly recognized the truths that the remoter results kind and unkind conduct are respectively beneficial and detrimentalthat due regard for others is conducive to ultimate personal welfare and disregard of others to ultimate personal disaster and then there may become current such summations of experience as honesty is the best policy but so far from regarding these intellectual recognitions of utility as preceding and causing the moral sentiment i regard the moral sentiment as preceding such recognitions of utility and making them possible the pleasures and pains directly resulting in experience from sympathetic and unsympathetic actions had first to be slowly associated with such actions and the resulting incentives and deterrents frequently obeyed before there could arise the perceptions that sympathetic and unsympathetic actions are remotely beneficial or detrimental to the actor and they had to be obeyed still longer and more generally before there could arise the perceptions that they are socially beneficial or detrimental when however the remote effects personal and social have gained general recognition are expressed in current maxims and lead to injunctions having the religious sanction the sentiments that prompt sympathetic actions and check unsympathetic ones are immensely strengthened by their alliances approbation and reprobation divine and human come to be associated in thought with the sympathetic and unsympathetic actions respectively the commands of the creed the legal penalties and the code of social conduct unitedly enforce them and every child as it grows up daily has impressed on it by the words and faces and voices of those around the authority of these highest principles of conduct and now we may see why there arises a belief in the special sacredness of these highest principles and a sense of the supreme authority of the altruistic sentiments answering to them many of the actions which in early social states received the religious sanction and gained public approbation had the drawback that such sympathies as existed were outraged and there was hence an imperfect satisfaction whereas these altruistic actions while similarly having the religious sanction and gaining public approbation bring a sympathetic consciousness of pleasure given or of pain prevented and beyond this bring a sympathetic consciousness of human welfare at large as being furthered by making altruistic actions habitual both this special and this general sympathetic consciousness become stronger and wider in proportion as the power of mental representation increases and the imagination of consequences immediate and remote grows more vivid and comprehensive until at length these altruistic sentiments begin to call in question the authority of those egoaltruistic sentiments which once ruled unchallenged they prompt resistance to laws that do not fulfil the conception of justice encourage men to brave the frowns of their fellows by pursuing a course at variance with customs that are perceived to be socially injurious and even cause dissent from the current religion either to the extent of disbelief in those alleged divine attributes and acts not approved by this supreme moral arbiter or to the extent of entire rejection of a creed which ascribes such attributes and acts  much that is required to make this hypothesis complete must stand over until at the close of the second volume of the principles of psychology i have space for a full exposition what i have said will make it sufficiently clear that two fundamental errors have been made in the interpretation put upon it both utility and experience have been construed in senses much too narrow utility convenient a word as it is from its comprehensiveness has very inconvenient and misleading implications it vividly suggests uses and means and proximate ends but very faintly suggests the pleasures positive or negative which are the ultimate ends and which in the ethical meaning of the word are alone considered and further it implies conscious recognition of means and endsimplies the deliberate taking of some course to gain a perceived benefit experience too in its ordinary acceptation connotes definite perceptions of causes and consequences as standing in observed relations and is not taken to include the connexions formed in consciousness between states that recur together when the relation between them causal or other is not perceived it is in their widest senses however that i habitually use these words as will be manifest to every one who reads the principles of psychology and it is in their widest senses that i have used them in the letter to mr mill i think i have shown above that when they are so understood the hypothesis briefly set forth in that letter is by no means so indefensible as is supposed at any rate i have shownwhat seemed for the present needful to showthat mr huttons versions of my views must not be accepted as correct  footnotes  footnote 33 see prospective review for january 1852  footnote 34 his criticism will be found in the national review for january 1856 under the title atheism  footnote 35 hereafter i hope to elucidate at length these phenomena of expression for the present i can refer only to such further indications as are contained in two essays on the physiology of laughter and the origin and function of music  footnote 36 i may add that in social statics chap xxx i have indicated in a general way the causes of the development of sympathy and the restraints upon its developmentconfining the discussion however to the case of the human race my subject limiting me to that the accompanying teleology i now disclaim     the comparative psychology of man      originally read before the anthropological institute and     afterwards published in mind for january 1876   while discussing with two members of the anthropological institute the work to be undertaken by its psychological section i made certain suggestions which they requested me to put in writing when reminded some months after of the promise i had made to do this i failed to recall the particular suggestions referred to but in the endeavour to remember them i was led to glance over the whole subject of comparative human psychology hence resulted the following paper  that making a general survey is useful as a preliminary to deliberate study either of a whole or of any part scarcely needs showing vagueness of thought accompanies the wandering about in a region without known bounds or landmarks attention devoted to some portion of a subject in ignorance of its connexion with the rest leads to untrue conceptions the whole cannot be rightly conceived without some knowledge of the parts and no part can be rightly conceived out of relation to the whole  to map out the comparative psychology of man must also conduce to the more methodic carrying on of inquiries in this as in other things division of labour will facilitate progress and that there may be division of labour the work itself must be systematically divided  we may conveniently separate the entire subject into three main divisions and may arrange them in the order of increasing speciality  the first division will treat of the degrees of mental evolution of different human types generally considered taking account of both the mass of mental manifestation and the complexity of mental manifestation this division will include the relations of these characters to physical charactersthe bodily mass and structure and the cerebral mass and structure it will also include inquiries concerning the time taken in completing mental evolution and the time during which adult mental power lasts as well as certain most general traits of mental action such as the greater or less persistence of emotions and of intellectual processes the connexion between the general mental type and the general social type should also be here dealt with  in the second division may be conveniently placed apart inquiries concerning the relative mental natures of the sexes in each race under it will come such questions as thesewhat differences of mental mass and mental complexity if any existing between males and females are common to all races do such differences vary in degree or in kind or in both are there reasons for thinking that they are liable to change by increase or decrease what relations do they bear in each case to the habits of life the domestic arrangements and the social arrangements this division should also include in its scope the sentiments of the sexes towards one another considered as varying quantitatively and qualitatively as well as their respective sentiments towards offspring similarly varying  for the third division of inquiries may be reserved the more special mental traits distinguishing different types of men one class of such specialities results from differences of proportion among faculties possessed in common and another class results from the presence in some races of faculties that are almost or quite absent from others each difference in each of these groups when established by comparison has to be studied in connexion with the stage of mental evolution reached and has to be studied in connexion with the habits of life and the social development regarding it as related to these both as cause and as consequence  such being the outlines of these several divisions let us now consider in detail the subdivisions contained within each                                       iunder the head of general mental evolution we may begin with the trait of  1 mental massdaily experiences show us that human beings differ in volume of mental manifestation some there are whose intelligence high though it may be produces little impression on those around while there are some who when uttering even commonplaces do it so as to affect listeners in a disproportionate degree comparison of two such makes it manifest that generally the difference is due to the natural language of the emotions behind the intellectual quickness of the one there is not felt any power of character while the other betrays a momentum capable of bearing down oppositiona potentiality of emotion that has something formidable about it obviously the varieties of mankind differ much in respect of this trait apart from kind of feeling they are unlike in amount of feeling the dominant races overrun the inferior races mainly in virtue of the greater quantity of energy in which this greater mental mass shows itself hence a series of inquiries of which these are somea what is the relation between mental mass and bodily mass manifestly the small races are deficient in it but it also appears that races much upon a par in sizeas for instance an englishman and a damara differ considerably in mental mass b what is its relation to mass of brain and bearing in mind the general law that in the same species size of brain increases with size of body though not in the same proportion how far can we connect the extra mental mass of the higher races with an extra mass of brain beyond that which is proper to their greater bodily mass c what relation if any is there between mental mass and the physiological state expressed in vigour of circulation and richness of blood as severally determined by mode of life and general nutrition d what are the relations of this trait to the social state as nomadic or settled predatory or industrial  2 mental complexityhow races differ in respect of the more or less involved structures of their minds will best be understood on recalling the unlikeness between the juvenile mind and the adult mind among ourselves in the child we see absorption in special facts generalities even of a low order are scarcely recognized and there is no recognition of high generalities we see interest in individuals in personal adventures in domestic affairs but no interest in political or social matters we see vanity about clothes and small achievements but little sense of justice witness the forcible appropriation of one anothers toys while there have come into play many of the simpler mental powers there has not yet been reached that complication of mind which results from the addition of powers evolved out of these simpler ones kindred differences of complexity exist between the minds of lower and higher races and comparisons should be made to ascertain their kinds and amounts here too there may be a subdivision of the inquiries a what is the relation between mental complexity and mental mass do not the two habitually vary together b what is the relation to the social state as more or less complex that is to saydo not mental complexity and social complexity act and react on each other  3 rate of mental developmentin conformity with the biological law that the higher the organisms the longer they take to evolve members of the inferior human races may be expected to complete their mental evolution sooner than members of the superior races and we have evidence that they do this travellers from many regions comment now on the great precocity of children among savage and semicivilized peoples and now on the early arrest of their mental progress though we scarcely need more proofs that this general contrast exists there remains to be asked the question whether it is consistently maintained throughout all groups of races from the lowest to the highestwhether say the australian differs in this respect from the hindu as much as the hindu does from the european of secondary inquiries coming under this subhead may be named several a is this more rapid evolution and earlier arrest always unequally shown by the two sexes or in other words are there in lower types proportional differences in rate and degree of development such as higher types show us b is there in many cases as there appears to be in some cases a traceable relation between the period of arrest and the period of puberty c is mental decay early in proportion as mental evolution is rapid d can we in other respects assert that where the type is low the entire cycle of mental changes between birth and deathascending uniform descendingcomes within a shorter interval  4 relative plasticityis there any relation between the degree of mental modifiability which remains in adult life and the character of the mental evolution in respect of mass complexity and rapidity the animal kingdom at large yields reasons for associating an inferior and more rapidlycompleted mental structure with a relatively automatic nature lowly organized creatures guided almost entirely by reflex actions are in but small degrees changeable by individual experiences as the nervous structure complicates its actions become less rigorously confined within preestablished limits and as we approach the highest creatures individual experiences take larger and larger shares in moulding the conduct there is an increasing ability to take in new impressions and to profit by the acquisitions inferior and superior human races are contrasted in this respect many travellers comment on the unchangeable habits of savages the semicivilized nations of the east past and present were or are characterized by a greater rigidity of custom than characterizes the more civilized nations of the west the histories of the most civilized nations show us that in their earlier times the modifiability of ideas and habits was less than it is at present and if we contrast classes or individuals around us we see that the most developed in mind are the most plastic to inquiries respecting this trait of comparative plasticity in its relations to precocity and early completion of mental development may fitly be added inquiries respecting its relations to the social state which it helps to determine and which reacts upon it  5 variabilityto say of a mind that its actions are extremely inconstant and at the same time to say that it is of relatively unchangeable nature apparently implies a contradiction when however the inconstancy is understood as referring to the manifestations which follow one another from minute to minute and the unchangeableness to the average manifestations extending over long periods the apparent contradiction disappears and it becomes comprehensible that the two traits may and ordinarily do coexist an infant quickly wearied with each kind of perception wanting ever a new object which it soon abandons for something else and alternating a score times a day between smiles and tears shows us a very small persistence in each kind of mental action all its states intellectual and emotional are transient yet at the same time its mind cannot be easily changed in character true it changes spontaneously in due course but it long remains incapable of receiving ideas or emotions beyond those of simple orders the child exhibits less rapid variations intellectual and emotional while its educability is greater inferior human races show us this combination great rigidity of general character with great irregularity in its passing manifestations speaking broadly while they resist permanent modification they lack intellectual persistence and they lack emotional persistence of various low types we read that they cannot keep the attention fixed beyond a few minutes on anything requiring thought even of a simple kind similarly with their feelings these are less enduring than those of civilized men there are however qualifications to be made in this statement and comparisons are needed to ascertain how far these qualifications go the savage shows great persistence in the action of the lower intellectual faculties he is untiring in minute observation he is untiring also in that kind of perceptive activity which accompanies the making of his weapons and ornaments often persevering for immense periods in carving stones c emotionally too he shows persistence not only in the motives prompting these small industries but also in certain of his passionsespecially in that of revenge hence in studying the degrees of mental variability shown us in the daily lives of the different races we must ask how far variability characterizes the whole mind and how far it holds only of parts of the mind  6 impulsivenessthis trait is closely allied with the last unenduring emotions are emotions which sway the conduct now this way and now that without any consistency the trait of impulsiveness may however be fitly dealt with separately because it has other implications than mere lack of persistence comparisons of the lower human races with the higher appear generally to show that along with brevity of the passions there goes violence the sudden gusts of feeling which men of inferior types display are excessive in degree as they are short in duration and there is probably a connexion between these two traits intensity sooner producing exhaustion observing that the passions of childhood illustrate this connexion let us turn to certain interesting questions concerning the decrease of impulsiveness which accompanies advance in evolution the nervous processes of an impulsive being are less remote from reflex actions than are those of an unimpulsive being in reflex actions we see a simple stimulus passing suddenly into movement little or no control being exercised by other parts of the nervous system as we ascend to higher actions guided by more and more complicated combinations of stimuli there is not the same instantaneous discharge in simple motions but there is a comparatively deliberate and more variable adjustment of compound motions duly restrained and proportioned it is thus with the passions and sentiments in the less developed natures and in the more developed natures where there is but little emotional complexity an emotion when excited by some occurrence explodes in action before the other emotions have been called into play and each of these from time to time does the like but the more complex emotional structure is one in which these simpler emotions are so coordinated that they do not act independently before excitement of any one has had time to cause action some excitement has been communicated to othersoften antagonistic ones and the conduct becomes modified in adjustment to the combined dictates hence results a decreased impulsiveness and also a greater persistence the conduct pursued being prompted by several emotions cooperating in degrees which do not exhaust them acquires a greater continuity and while spasmodic force becomes less conspicuous there is an increase in the total energy examining the facts from this point of view there are sundry questions of interest to be put respecting the different races of men a to what other traits than degree of mental evolution is impulsiveness related apart from difference in elevation of type the newworld races seem to be less impulsive than the oldworld races is this due to constitutional apathy can there be traced other things equal a relation between physical vivacity and mental impulsiveness b what connexion is there between this trait and the social state clearly a very explosive naturesuch as that of the bushmanis unfit for social union and commonly social union when by any means established checks impulsiveness c what respective shares in checking impulsiveness are taken by the feelings which the social state fosterssuch as the fear of surrounding individuals the instinct of sociality the desire to accumulate property the sympathetic feelings the sentiment of justice these which require a social environment for their development all of them involve imaginations of consequences more or less distant and thus imply checks upon the promptings of the simpler passions hence arise the questionsin what order in what degrees and in what combinations do they come into play  7 one further general inquiry of a different kind may be added what effect is produced on mental nature by mixture of races there is reason for believing that throughout the animal kingdom the union of varieties which have become widely divergent is physically injurious while the union of slightly divergent varieties is physically beneficial does the like hold with the mental nature some facts seem to show that mixture of human races extremely unlike produces a worthless type of minda mind fitted neither for the kind of life led by the higher of the two races nor for that led by the lowera mind out of adjustment to all conditions of life contrariwise we find that peoples of the same stock slightly differentiated by lives carried on in unlike circumstances for many generations produce by mixture a mental type having certain superiorities in his work on the huguenots mr smiles points out how large a number of distinguished men among us have descended from flemish and french refugees and m alphonse de candolle in his histoire des sciences et des savants depuis deux siècles shows that the descendants of french refugees in switzerland have produced an unusually great proportion of scientific men though in part this result may be ascribed to the original natures of such refugees who must have had that independence which is a chief factor in originality yet it is probably in part due to mixtures of races for thinking this we have evidence which is not open to two interpretations prof morley draws attention to the fact that during seven hundred years of our early history the best genius of england sprang up on the line of country in which celts and anglosaxons came together in like manner mr galton in his english men of science shows that in recent days these have mostly come from an inland region running generally from north to south which we may reasonably presume contains more mixed blood than do the regions east and west of it such a result seems probable a priori two natures respectively adapted to slightly unlike sets of social conditions may be expected by their union to produce a nature somewhat more plastic than eithera nature more impressible by the new circumstances of advancing social life and therefore more likely to originate new ideas and display modified sentiments the comparative psychology of man may then fitly include the mental effects of mixture and among derivative inquiries we may askhow far the conquest of race by race has been instrumental in advancing civilization by aiding mixture as well as in other ways   iithe second of the three leading divisions named at the outset is less extensive still concerning the relative mental natures of the sexes in each race questions of much interest and importance may be raised  1 degree of difference between the sexesit is an established fact that physically considered the contrast between males and females is not equally great in all types of mankind the bearded races for instance show us a greater unlikeness between the two than do the beardless races among south american tribes men and women have a greater general resemblance in form c than is usual elsewhere the question then suggests itselfdo the mental natures of the sexes differ in a constant or in a variable degree the difference is unlikely to be a constant one and looking for variation we may ask what is its amount and under what conditions does it occur  2 difference in mass and in complexitythe comparisons between the sexes of course admit of subdivisions parallel to those made in the comparisons between races relative mental mass and relative mental complexity have chiefly to be observed assuming that the great inequality in the cost of reproduction to the two sexes is the cause of unlikeness in mental mass as in physical mass this difference may be studied in connexion with reproductive differences presented by the various races in respect of the ages at which reproduction commences and the periods over which it lasts an allied inquiry may be joined with this namely how far the mental developments of the two sexes are affected by their relative habits in respect to food and physical exertion in many of the lower races the women treated with great brutality are physically much inferior to the men excess of labour and defect of nutrition being apparently the combined causes is any arrest of mental development simultaneously caused  3 variation of the differencesif the unlikeness physical and mental of the sexes is not constant then supposing all races have diverged from one original stock it follows that there must have been transmission of accumulated differences to those of the same sex in posterity if for instance the prehistoric type of man was beardless then the production of a bearded variety implies that within that variety the males continued to transmit an increasing amount of beard to descendants of the same sex this limitation of heredity by sex shown us in multitudinous ways throughout the animal kingdom probably applies to the cerebral structures as much as to other structures hence the questiondo not the mental natures of the sexes in alien types of man diverge in unlike ways and degrees  4 causes of the differencesare any relations to be traced between these variable differences and the variable parts the sexes play in the business of life assuming the cumulative effects of habit on function and structure as well as the limitation of heredity by sex it is to be expected that if in any society the activities of one sex generation after generation differ from those of the other there will arise sexual adaptations of mind some instances in illustration may be named among the africans of loango and other districts as also among some of the indian hilltribes the men and women are strongly contrasted as respectively inert and energetic the industry of the women having apparently become so natural to them that no coercion is needed of course such facts suggest an extensive series of questions limitation of heredity by sex may account both for those sexual differences of mind which distinguish men and women in all races and for those which distinguish them in each race or each society an interesting subordinate inquiry may be how far such mental differences are inverted in cases where there is inversion of social and domestic relations as among those khasi hilltribes whose women have so far the upper hand that they turn off their husbands in a summary way if they displease them  5 mental modifiability in the two sexesalong with comparisons of races in respect of mental plasticity may go parallel comparisons of the sexes in each race is it true always as it appears to be generally true that women are less modifiable than men the relative conservatism of womentheir greater adhesion to established ideas and practicesis manifest in many civilized and semicivilized societies is it so among the uncivilized a curious instance of stronger attachment to custom in women than in men is given by dalton as occurring among the juangs one of the lowest wild tribes of bengal until recently the only dress of both sexes was something less than that which the hebrew legend gives to adam and eve years ago the men were led to adopt a cloth bandage round the loins in place of the bunch of leaves but the women adhered to the aboriginal habit a conservatism shown where it might have been least expected  6 the sexual sentimentresults of value may be looked for from comparisons of races made to determine the amounts and characters of the higher feelings to which the relation of the sexes gives rise the lowest varieties of mankind have but small endowments of these feelings among varieties of higher types such as the malayopolynesians these feelings seem considerably developed the dyaks for instance sometimes display them in great strength speaking generally they appear to become stronger with the advance of civilization several subordinate inquiries may be named a how far is development of the sexual sentiment dependent upon intellectual advanceupon growth of imaginative power b how far is it related to emotional advance and especially to evolution of those emotions which originate from sympathy what are its relations to polyandry and polygyny c does it not tend towards and is it not fostered by monogamy d what connexion has it with maintenance of the family bond and the consequent better rearing of children   iiiunder the third head to which we may now pass come the more special traits of the different races  1 imitativenessone of the characteristics in which the lower types of men show us a smaller departure from reflex action than do the higher types is their strong tendency to mimic the motions and sounds made by othersan almost involuntary habit which travellers find it difficult to check this meaningless repetition which seems to imply that the idea of an observed action cannot be framed in the mind of the observer without tending forthwith to discharge itself in the action conceived and every ideal action is a nascent form of the consciousness accompanying performance of such action evidently diverges but little from the automatic and decrease of it is to be expected along with increase of selfregulating power this trait of automatic mimicry is evidently allied with that less automatic mimicry which shows itself in greater persistence of customs for customs adopted by each generation from the last without thought or inquiry imply a tendency to imitate which overmasters critical and sceptical tendencies so maintaining habits for which no reasons can be given the decrease of this irrational mimicry strongest in the lowest savage and feeblest in the highest of the civilized should be studied along with the successively higher stages of social life as being at once an aid and a hindrance to civilization an aid in so far as it gives that fixity to the social organization without which a society cannot survive a hindrance in so far as it offers resistance to changes of social organization that have become desirable  2 incuriosityprojecting our own natures into the circumstances of the savage we imagine ourselves as marvelling greatly on first seeing the products and appliances of civilized life but we err in supposing that the savage has feelings such as we should have in his place want of rational curiosity respecting these incomprehensible novelties is a trait remarked of the lowest races wherever found and the partiallycivilized races are distinguished from them as exhibiting rational curiosity the relation of this trait to the intellectual nature to the emotional nature and to the social state should be studied  3 quality of thoughtunder this vague head may be placed many sets of inquiries each of them extensivea the degree of generality of the ideas b the degree of abstractness of the ideas c the degree of definiteness of the ideas d the degree of coherence of the ideas e the extent to which there have been developed such notions as those of class of cause of uniformity of law of truth many conceptions which have become so familiar to us that we assume them to be the common property of all minds are no more possessed by the lowest savages than they are by our own children and comparisons of types should be so made as to elucidate the processes by which such conceptions are reached the development under each head has to be observeda independently in its successive stages b in connexion with the cooperative intellectual conceptions c in connexion with the progress of language of the arts and of social organization already linguistic phenomena have been used in aid of such inquiries and more systematic use of them should be made not only the number of general words and the number of abstract words in a peoples vocabulary should be taken as evidence but also their degrees of generality and abstractness for there are generalities of the first second third c orders and abstractions similarly ascending blue is an abstraction referring to one class of impressions derived from visible objects colour is a higher abstraction referring to many such classes of visual impressions property is a still higher abstraction referring to classes of impressions received not through the eyes alone but through other senseorgans if generalities and abstractions were arranged in the order of their extensiveness and in the order of their grades tests would be obtained which applied to the vocabularies of the uncivilized would yield definite evidence of the intellectual stages reached  4 peculiar aptitudesto such specialities of intelligence as mark different degrees of evolution have to be added minor ones related to modes of life the kinds and degrees of faculty which have become organized in adaptation to daily habitsskill in the use of weapons powers of tracking quick discrimination of individual objects and under this head may fitly come inquiries concerning some racepeculiarities of the æsthetic class not at present explicable while the remains from the dordogne caves show us that their inhabitants low as we must suppose them to have been could represent animals both by drawing and carving with some degree of fidelity there are existing races probably higher in other respects who seem scarcely capable of recognizing pictorial representations similarly with the musical faculty almost or quite wanting in some inferior races we find it in other races not of high grade developed to an unexpected degree instance the negroes some of whom are so innately musical that as i have been told by a missionary among them the children in native schools when taught european psalmtunes spontaneously sing seconds to them whether any causes can be discovered for race peculiarities of this kind is a question of interest  5 specialities of emotional naturethese are worthy of careful study as being intimately related to social phenomenato the possibility of social progress and to the nature of the social structure among others to be noted there area gregariousness or socialitya trait in the strength of which races differ widely some as the mantras being almost indifferent to social intercourse some being unable to dispense with it obviously the degree of this desire for the presence of fellowmen affects greatly the formation of social groups and consequently influences social progress b intolerance of restraint men of some inferior types as the mapuché are ungovernable while those of other types no higher in grade not only submit to restraint but admire the persons exercising it these contrasted natures have to be observed in connexion with social evolution to the early stages of which they are respectively antagonistic and favourable c the desire for praise is a trait which common to all races high and low varies considerably in degree there are quite inferior races as some of those in the pacific states whose members sacrifice without stint to gain the applause which lavish generosity brings while elsewhere applause is sought with less eagerness notice should be taken of the connexion between this love of approbation and the social restraints since it plays an important part in the maintenance of them d the acquisitive propensity this too is a character the degrees of which and the relations of which to the social state have to be especially noted the desire for property grows along with the possibility of gratifying it and this extremely small among the lowest men increases as social development goes on with the advance from tribal property to family property and individual property the notion of private right of possession gains definiteness and the love of acquisition strengthens each step towards an orderly social state makes larger accumulations possible and the pleasures achievable by them more sure while the resulting encouragement to accumulate leads to increase of capital and to further progress this action and reaction of the sentiment and the social state should be in every case observed  6 the altruistic sentimentscoming last these are also highest the evolution of them in the course of civilization shows us clearly the reciprocal influences of the social unit and the social organism on the one hand there can be no sympathy nor any of the sentiments which sympathy generates unless there are fellowbeings around on the other hand maintenance of union with fellowbeings depends in part on the presence of sympathy and the resulting restraints on conduct gregariousness or sociality favours the growth of sympathy increased sympathy conduces to closer sociality and a more stable social state and so continuously each increment of the one makes possible a further increment of the other comparisons of the altruistic sentiments resulting from sympathy as exhibited in different types of men and different social states may be conveniently arranged under three headsa pity which should be observed as displayed towards offspring towards the sick and aged and towards enemies b generosity duly discriminated from the love of display as shown in giving as shown in the relinquishment of pleasures for the sake of others as shown by active efforts on others behalf the manifestations of this sentiment too are to be noted in respect of their rangewhether they are limited to relatives whether they extend only to those of the same society whether they extend to those of other societies and they are also to be noted in connexion with the degree of providencewhether they result from sudden impulses obeyed without counting the cost or go along with clear foresight of the future sacrifices entailed c justice this most abstract of the altruistic sentiments is to be considered under aspects like those just named as well as under many other aspectshow far it is shown in regard to the lives of others how far in regard to their freedom how far in regard to their property how far in regard to their various minor claims and comparisons concerning this highest sentiment should beyond all others be carried on along with comparisons of the accompanying social states which it largely determinesthe forms and actions of governments the characters of laws the relations of classes                                       such stated as briefly as consists with clearness are the leading divisions and subdivisions under which the comparative psychology of man may be arranged in going rapidly over so wide a field i have doubtless overlooked much that should be included doubtless too various of the inquiries named will branch out into subordinate inquiries well worth pursuing even as it is however the programme is extensive enough to occupy numerous investigators who may with advantage take separate divisions  though after occupying themselves with primitive arts and products anthropologists have devoted their attention mainly to the physical characters of the human races it must i think be admitted that the study of these yields in importance to the study of their psychical characters the general conclusions to which the first set of inquiries may lead cannot so much affect our views respecting the highest classes of phenomena as can the general conclusions to which the second set may lead a true theory of the human mind vitally concerns us and systematic comparisons of human minds differing in their kinds and grades will help us in forming a true theory knowledge of the reciprocal relations between the characters of men and the characters of the societies they form must influence profoundly our ideas of political arrangements when the interdependence of individual natures and social structures is understood our conceptions of the changes now taking place and hereafter to take place will be rectified a comprehension of mental development as a process of adaptation to social conditions which are continually remoulding the mind and are again remoulded by it will conduce to a salutary consciousness of the remoter effects produced by institutions upon character and will check the grave mischiefs which ignorant legislation now causes lastly a right theory of mental evolution as exhibited by humanity at large giving a key as it does to the evolution of the individual mind must help to rationalize our perverse methods of education and so to raise intellectual power and moral nature     mr martineau on evolution      first published in the contemporary review for june 1872   the article by mr martineau in the april number of the contemporary review on the place of mind in nature and intuition of man recalled to me a partiallyformed intention to deal with the chief criticisms which have from time to time been made on the general doctrine set forth in first principles since though not avowedly directed against propositions asserted or implied in that work mr martineaus reasoning tells against them by implication the fulfilment of this intention i should however have continued to postpone had i not learned that the arguments of mr martineau are supposed by many to be conclusive and that in the absence of replies it will be assumed that no replies can be made it seems desirable therefore to notice these arguments at onceespecially as the essential ones may i think be effectually dealt with in a comparatively small space                                       the first definite objection which mr martineau raises is that the hypothesis of general evolution is powerless to account even for the simpler orders of facts in the absence of numerous different substances he argues that were matter all of one kind no such phenomena as chemical changes would be possible and that in order to start the world on its chemical career you must enlarge its capital and present it with an outfit of heterogeneous constituents try therefore the effect of such a gift fling into the preexisting cauldron the whole list of recognized elementary substances and give leave to their affinities to work the intended implication obviously is that there must exist the separatelycreated elements before evolution can begin  here however mr martineau makes an assumption which few if any chemists will commit themselves to and which many will distinctly deny there are no recognized elementary substances if the expression means substances known to be elementary what chemists for convenience call elementary substances are merely substances which they have thus far failed to decompose but bearing in mind past experiences they do not dare to say that they are absolutely undecomposable water was taken to be an element for more than two thousand years and then was proved to be a compound and until davy brought a galvanic current to bear upon them the alkalies and the earths were supposed to be elements so little true is it that recognized elementary substances are supposed to be absolutely elementary that there has been much speculation among chemists respecting the process of compounding and recompounding by which they have been formed out of some ultimate substancesome chemists having supposed the atom of hydrogen to be the unit of composition but others having contended that the atomic weights of the socalled elements are not thus interpretable if i remember rightly sir john herschel was one among others who some fiveandtwenty years ago threw out suggestions respecting a system of compounding that might explain these relations of the atomic weights  what was at that time a suspicion has now become practically a certainty spectrumanalysis yields results wholly irreconcilable with the assumption that the conventionallynamed simple substances are really simple each yields a spectrum having lines varying in number from two to eighty or more every one of which implies the intercepting of ethereal undulations of a certain order by something oscillating in unison or in harmony with them were iron absolutely elementary it is not conceivable that its atom could intercept ethereal undulations of eighty different orders though it does not follow that its molecule contains as many separate atoms as there are lines in its spectrum it must clearly be a complex molecule the evidence thus gained points to the conclusion that out of some primordial units the socalled elements arise by compounding and recompounding just as by the compounding and recompounding of socalled elements there arise oxides and acids and salts  and this hypothesis is entirely in harmony with the phenomena of allotropy various substances conventionally distinguished as simple have several forms under which they present quite different properties the semitransparent colourless extremely active substance called phosphorus may be so changed as to become opaque dark red and inert like changes are known to occur in some gaseous nonmetallic elements as oxygen and also in metallic elements as antimony these total changes of properties brought about without any changes to be called chemical are interpretable only as due to molecular rearrangements and by showing that difference of property is producible by difference of arrangement they support the inference otherwise to be drawn that the properties of different elements result from differences of arrangement arising by the compounding and recompounding of ultimate homogeneous units  thus mr martineaus objection which at best would imply a turning of our ignorance of the nature of elements into positive knowledge that they are simple is in fact to be met by two sets of evidences which imply that they are compound                                       mr martineau next alleges that a fatal difficulty is put in the way of the general doctrine of evolution by the existence of a chasm between the living and the notliving he saysbut with all your enlargement of data turn them as you will at the end of every passage which they explore the door of life is closed against them still here again our ignorance is employed to play the part of knowledge the fact that we do not know distinctly how an alleged transition has taken place is transformed into the assumption that no transition has taken place we have in a more general shape the argument which until lately was thought conclusivethe argument that because the genesis of each species of creature had not been explained therefore each species must have been separately created  merely noting this however i go on to remark that scientific discovery is day by day narrowing the chasm or to vary mr martineaus metaphor opening the door not many years since it was held as certain that the chemical compounds distinguished as organic could not be formed artificially now more than a thousand organic compounds have been formed artificially chemists have discovered the art of building them up from the simpler to the more complex and do not doubt that they will eventually produce the most complex moreover the phenomena attending isomeric change give a clue to those movements which are the only indications we have of life in its lowest forms in various colloidal substances including the albuminoid isomeric change is accompanied by contraction or expansion and consequent motion and in such primordial types as the protogenes of haeckel which do not differ in appearance from minute portions of albumen the observed motions are comprehensible as accompanying isomeric changes caused by variations in surrounding physical actions the probability of this interpretation will be seen on remembering the evidence we have that in the higher organisms many functions are essentially effected by isomeric changes from one to another of the multitudinous forms which protein assumes  thus the reply to this objection is first that there is going on from both sides a narrowing of the chasm supposed to be impassable and secondly that even were the chasm not in course of being filled up we should no more be justified in therefore assuming a supernatural commencement of life than kepler was justified in assuming that there were guidingspirits to keep the planets in their orbits because he could not see how else they were to be kept in their orbits                                       the third definite objection made by mr martineau is of kindred nature the hypothesis of evolution is he thinks met by the insurmountable difficulty that plant life and animal life are absolutely distinct you cannot he says take a single step toward the deduction of sensation and thought neither at the upper limit do the highest plants the exogens transcend themselves and overbalance into animal existence nor at the lower grope as you may among the seaweeds and sponges can you persuade the sporules of the one to develop into the other  this is an extremely unfortunate objection to raise for though there are no transitions from vegetal to animal life at the places mr martineau names where indeed no biologist would look for them yet the connexion between the two great kingdoms of living things is so complete that separation is now regarded as impossible for a long time naturalists endeavored to frame definitions such as would the one include all plants and exclude all animals and the other include all animals and exclude all plants but they have been so repeatedly foiled in the attempt that they have given it up there is no chemical distinction which holds there is no structural distinction which holds there is no functional distinction which holds there is no distinction as to mode of existence which holds large groups of the simpler animals contain chlorophyll and decompose carbonic acid under the influence of light as plants do large groups of the simpler plants as you may observe in the diatoms from any stagnant pool are no less actively locomotive than the minute creatures classed as animals seen along with them nay among these lowest types of living things it is common for the life to be now predominantly animal and presently to become predominantly vegetal the very name zoospores given to germs of algæ which for a while swim about actively by means of cilia and presently settling down grow into plantforms is given because of this conspicuous community of nature so complete is this community of nature that for some time past many naturalists have wished to establish for these lowest types a subkingdom intermediate between the animal and the vegetal the reason against this course being however that the difficulty crops up afresh at any assumed places where this intermediate subkingdom may be supposed to join the other two  thus the assumption on which mr martineau proceeds is diametrically opposed to the conviction of naturalists in general                                       though i do not perceive that it is specifically stated there appears to be tacitly implied a fourth difficulty of allied kindthe difficulty that there is no possibility of transition from life of the simplest kind to mind mr martineau says indeed that there can be with only vital resources as in the vegetable world no beginning of mind apparently leaving it to be inferred that in the animal world the resources are such as to make the beginning of mind comprehensible if however instead of leaving it a latent inference he had distinctly asserted a chasm between mind and bodily life for which there is certainly quite as much reason as for asserting a chasm between animal life and vegetal life the difficulties in his way would have been no less insuperable  for those lowest forms of irritability in the animal kingdom which i suppose mr martineau refers to as the beginning of mind are not distinguishable from the irritability which plants display they in no greater degree imply consciousness if the sudden folding of a sensitiveplants leaf when touched or the spreading out of the stamens in a wildcistus when gently brushed is to be considered a vital action of a purely physical kind then so too must be considered the equally slow contraction of a polypes tentacles and yet from this simple motion of an animal of low type we may pass by insensible stages through evercomplicating forms of actions with their accompanying signs of feeling and intelligence until we reach the highest  even apart from the evidence derived from the ascending grades of animals up from zoophytes as they are significantly named it needs only to observe the evolution of a single animal to see that there does not exist any break or chasm between the life which shows no mind and the life which shows mind the yelk of an egg which the cook has just broken not only yields no sign of mind but yields no sign of life it does not respond to a stimulus as much even as many plants do had the egg instead of being broken by the cook been left under the hen for a certain time the yelk would have passed by infinitesimal gradations through a series of forms ending in the chick and by similarly infinitesimal gradations would have arisen those functions which end in the chick breaking its shell and which when it gets out show themselves in running about distinguishing and picking up food and squeaking if hurt when did the feeling begin and how did there come into existence that power of perception which the chicks actions show should it be objected that the chicks actions are mainly automatic i will not dwell on the fact that though they are largely so the chick manifestly has feeling and therefore consciousness but i will accept the objection and propose that instead we take the human being the course of development before birth is just of the same general kind and similarly at a certain stage begins to be accompanied by reflex movements at birth there is displayed an amount of mind certainly not greater than that of the chick there is no power of running from dangerno power of distinguishing and picking up food if we say the chick is unintelligent we must certainly say the infant is unintelligent and yet from the unintelligence of the infant to the intelligence of the adult there is an advance by steps so small that on no day is the amount of mind shown appreciably different from that shown on preceding and succeeding days  thus the tacit assumption that there exists a break is not simply gratuitous but is negatived by the most obvious facts                                       certain of the words and phrases used in explaining that particular part of the doctrine of evolution which deals with the origin of species are commented upon by mr martineau as having implications justifying his view let us consider his comments  he says that competition is not an original power which can of itself do anything further that it cannot act except in the presence of some possibility of a better or worse and that this possibility of a better or worse implies a world prearranged for progress a directing will intent upon the good had mr martineau looked more closely into the matter he would have found that though the words and phrases he quotes are used for convenience the conceptions they imply are not at all essential to the doctrine under its rigorouslyscientific form the doctrine is expressible in purelyphysical terms which neither imply competition nor imply better and worse37  beyond this indirect mistake there is a direct mistake mr martineau speaks of the survivorship of the better as though that were the statement of the law and then adds that the alleged result cannot be inferred except on the assumption that whatever is better is stronger too but the words he here uses are his own words not the words of those he opposes the law is the survival of the fittest probably in substituting better for fittest mr martineau did not suppose that he was changing the meaning though i dare say he perceived that the meaning of the word fittest did not suit his argument so well had he examined the facts he would have found that the law is not the survival of the better or the stronger if we give to those words any thing like their ordinary meanings it is the survival of those which are constitutionally fittest to thrive under the conditions in which they are placed and very often that which humanly speaking is inferiority causes the survival superiority whether in size strength activity or sagacity is other things equal at the cost of diminished fertility and where the life led by a species does not demand these higher attributes the species profits by decrease of them and accompanying increase of fertility this is the reason why there occur so many cases of retrograde metamorphosisthis is the reason why parasites internal and external are so commonly degraded forms of higher types survival of the better does not cover these cases though survival of the fittest does and as i am responsible for the phrase i suppose i am competent to say that the word fittest was chosen for this reason when it is remembered that these cases outnumber all othersthat there are more species of parasites than there are species of all other animals put togetherit will be seen that the expression survivorship of the better is wholly inappropriate and the argument mr martineau bases upon it quite untenable indeed if in place of those adjustments of the human senseorgans which he so eloquently describes as implying prearrangement mr martineau had described the countless elaborate appliances which enable parasites to torture animals immeasurably superior to them and which from his point of view no less imply prearrangement i think the notes of admiration which end his descriptions would not have seemed to him so appropriate  one more word there is from the intrinsic meaning of which mr martineau deduces what appears a powerful argumentthe word evolution itself he says       it means to unfold from within and it is taken from the history      of the seed or embryo of living natures and what is the seed but a      casket of prearranged futurities with its whole contents      prospective settled to be what they are by reference to ends      still in the distance  now this criticism would have been very much to the point did the word evolution truly express the process it names if this process as scientifically defined really involved that conception which the word evolution was originally designed to convey the implications would be those mr martineau alleges but unfortunately for him the word having been in possession of the field before the process was understood has been adopted merely because displacing it by another word seemed impracticable and this adoption of it has been joined with a caution against misunderstandings arising from its unfitness here is a part of the cautionevolution has other meanings some of which are incongruous with and some even directly opposed to the meaning here given to it the antithetical word involution would much more truly express the nature of the process and would indeed describe better the secondary characters of the process which we shall have to deal with presently38 so that the meanings which the word involves and which mr martineau regards as fatal to the hypothesis are already repudiated as not belonging to the hypothesis                                       and now having dealt with the essential objections raised by mr martineau to the hypothesis of evolution as it is presented under that purely scientific form which generalizes the process of things firstly as observed and secondly as inferred from certain ultimate principles let me go on to examine that form of the hypothesis which he propoundsevolution as determined by mind and willevolution as prearranged by a divine actor for mr martineau apparently abandons the primitive theory of creation by fiat of almighty will and also the theory of creation by manufactureby a contriving and adapting power and seems to believe in evolution requiring only that an originating mind shall be taken as its antecedent let us ask first in what relation mr martineau conceives the originating mind to stand to the evolving universe from some passages it is inferable that he considers the presence of mind to be everywhere needful he says       it is impossible to work the theory of evolution upwards from the      bottom if all force is to be conceived as one its type must be      looked for in the highest and allcomprehending term and mind must      be conceived as there and as divesting itself of some speciality      at each step of its descent to a lower stratum of law till      represented at the base under the guise of simple dynamics  this seems to be an unmistakable assertion that wherever evolution is going on mind is then and there behind it at the close of the argument however a quite different conception is implied mr martineau says      if the divine idea will not retire at the bidding of our     speculative science but retains its place it is natural to ask     what is its relation to  the series of socalled forces in the     world but the question is too large and deep to be answered here     let it suffice to say that there need not be any overruling of     these forces by the will of god so that the supernatural should     disturb the natural or any supplementing of them so that he     should fill up their deficiencies rather is his thought related to     them as in man the mental force is related to all below it  it would take too much space to deal fully with the various questions which this last passage raises there is the questionwhence come these forces spoken of as separate from the will of goddid they preexist then what becomes of the divine power do they exist by the divine will then what kind of nature is that by which they act apart from the divine will again there is the questionhow do these deputyforces cooperate in each particular phenomenon if the presiding will is not there present to control them either an organ which develops into fitness for its function develops by the cooperation of these forces under the direction of mind then present or it so develops in the absence of mind if it develops in the absence of mind the hypothesis is given up and if the originating mind is required to be then and there present we must suppose a particular providence to be present in each particular organ of each particular creature throughout the universe once more there is the questionif his thought is related to them these forces as in man the mental force is related to all below it how can his thought be regarded as the cause of evolution in man the mental force is related to the forces below it neither as a creator of them nor as a regulator of them save in a very limited way the greater part of the forces present in man both structural and functional defy the mental force absolutely nay more it needs but to injure a nerve to see that the power of the mental force over the physical forces is dependent on conditions which are themselves physical and one who takes morphia in mistake for magnesia discovers that the power of the physical forces over the mental is unconditioned by any thing mental  not dwelling on these questions however i will merely draw attention to the entire incongruity of this conception with the previous conception which i have quoted assuming that when the choice is pressed on him mr martineau will choose the first which alone has any thing like defensibility let us go on to ask how far evolution is made more comprehensible by postulating mind universally immanent as its cause  in metaphysical controversy many of the propositions propounded and accepted as quite believable are absolutely inconceivable there is a perpetual confusing of actual ideas with what are nothing but pseudideas no distinction is made between propositions that contain real thoughts and propositions that are only the forms of thoughts a thinkable proposition is one of which the two terms can be brought together in consciousness under the relation said to exist between them but very often when the subject of a proposition has been thought of as something known and when the predicate has been thought of as something known and when the relation alleged between them has been thought of as a known relation it is supposed that the proposition itself has been thought the thinking separately of the elements of a proposition is mistaken for the thinking of them in the combination which the proposition affirms and hence it continually happens that propositions which cannot be rendered into thought at all are supposed to be not only thought but believed the proposition that evolution is caused by mind is one of this nature the two terms are separately intelligible but they can be regarded in the relation of effect and cause only so long as no attempt is made to put them together in this relation  the only thing which any one knows as mind is the series of his own states of consciousness and if he thinks of any mind other than his own he can think of it only in terms derived from his own if i am asked to frame a notion of mind divested of all those structural traits under which alone i am conscious of mind in myself i cannot do it i know nothing of thought save as carried on in ideas originally traceable to the effects wrought by objects and forces on me a mental act is an unintelligible phrase if i am not to regard it as an act in which states of consciousness are severally known as like other states in the series that has gone by and in which the relations between them are severally known as like past relations in the series if then i have to conceive evolution as caused by an originating mind i must conceive this mind as having attributes akin to those of the only mind i know and without which i cannot conceive mind at all  i will not dwell on the many incongruities hence resulting by asking how the originating mind is to be thought of as having states produced by things objective to it as discriminating among these states and classing them as like and unlike and as preferring one objective result to another i will simply askwhat happens if we ascribe to the originating mind the character absolutely essential to the conception of mind that it consists of a series of states of consciousness put a series of states of consciousness as cause and the evolving universe as effect and then endeavor to see the last as flowing from the first i find it possible to imagine in some dim way a series of states of consciousness serving as antecedent to any one of the movements i see going on for my own states of consciousness are often indirectly the antecedents to such movements but how if i attempt to think of such a series as antecedent to all actions throughout the universeto the motions of the multitudinous stars through space to the revolutions of all their planets round them to the gyrations of all these planets on their axes to the infinitelymultiplied physical processes going on in each of these suns and planets i cannot think of a single series of states of consciousness as causing even the relatively small group of actions going on over the earths surface i cannot think of it even as antecedent to all the various winds and the dissolving clouds they bear to the currents of all the rivers and the grinding actions of all the glaciers still less can i think of it as antecedent to the infinity of processes simultaneously going on in all the plants that cover the globe from scattered polar lichens to crowded tropical palms and in all the millions of quadrupeds that roam among them and the millions of millions of insects that buzz about them even to a single small set of these multitudinous terrestrial changes i cannot conceive as antecedent a single series of states of consciousnesscannot for instance think of it as causing the hundred thousand breakers that are at this instant curling over on the shores of england how then is it possible for me to conceive an originating mind which i must represent to myself as a single series of states of consciousness working the infinitelymultiplied sets of changes simultaneously going on in worlds too numerous to count dispersed throughout a space that baffles imagination  if to account for this infinitude of physical changes everywhere going on mind must be conceived as there under the guise of simple dynamics then the reply is that to be so conceived mind must be divested of all attributes by which it is distinguished and that when thus divested of its distinguishing attributes the conception disappearsthe word mind stands for a blank if mr martineau takes refuge in the entirely different and as it seems to me incongruous hypothesis of something like a plurality of mindsif he accepts as he seems to do the doctrine that you cannot explain evolution unless among your primordial elements you scatter already the germs of mind as well as the inferior elementsif the insuperable difficulties i have just pointed out are to be met by assuming a local series of states of consciousness for each phenomenon then we are obviously carried back to something like the alleged fetichistic notion with the difference only that the assumed spiritual agencies are indefinitely multiplied  clearly therefore the proposition that an originating mind is the cause of evolution is a proposition that can be entertained so long only as no attempt is made to unite in thought its two terms in the alleged relation that it should be accepted as a matter of faith may be a defensible position provided good cause is shown why it should be so accepted but that it should be accepted as a matter of understandingas a statement making the order of the universe comprehensibleis a quite indefensible position                                       here let me guard myself against a misinterpretation very likely to be put upon the foregoing arguments especially by those who have read the essay to which they reply the statements of that essay carry the implication that all who adhere to the hypothesis it combats imagine they have solved the mystery of things when they have shown the processes of evolution to be naturally caused mr martineau tacitly represents them as believing that when every thing has been interpreted in terms of matter and motion nothing remains to be explained this however is by no means the fact the doctrine of evolution under its purely scientific form does not involve materialism though its opponents persistently represent it as doing so indeed among adherents of it who are friends of mine there are those who speak of the materialism of buechner and his school with a contempt certainly not less than that felt by mr martineau to show how antimaterialistic my own view is i may perhaps without impropriety quote some out of many passages which i have written on the question elsewhere       hence though of the two it seems easier to translate socalled      matter into socalled spirit than to translate socalled spirit      into socalled matter which latter is indeed wholly      impossible yet no translation can carry us beyond our      symbols39  and again       see then our predicament we can think of matter only in terms of      mind we can think of mind only in terms of matter when we have      pushed our explorations of the first to the uttermost limit we are      referred to the second for a final answer and when we have got      the final answer of the second we are referred back to the first      for an interpretation of it we find the value of x in terms of      y then we find the value of y in terms of x and so on we      may continue forever without coming nearer to a solution the      antithesis of subject and object never to be transcended while      consciousness lasts renders impossible all knowledge of that      ultimate reality in which subject and object are united40  it is thus i think manifest that the difference between mr martineaus view and the view he opposes is by no means so wide as he makes it appear and further it seems to me that such difference as exists is rather the reverse of that indicated by his exposition briefly expressed the difference is that where he thinks there is no mystery the doctrine he combats recognizes a mystery speaking for myself only i may say that agreeing entirely with mr martineau in repudiating the materialistic interpretation as utterly futile i differ from him simply in this that while he says he has found another interpretation i confess that i cannot find any interpretation while he holds that he can understand the power which is manifested in things i feel obliged to admit after many failures that i cannot understand it so that in presence of the transcendent problem which the universe presents mr martineau regards the human intellect as capable and i as incapable this contrast does not appear to me of the kind which his essay tacitly asserts if there is such a thing as the pride of science it is obviously exceeded by the pride of theology i fail to perceive humility in the belief that the human mind is able to comprehend that which is behind appearances and i do not see how piety is especially exemplified in the assertion that the universe contains no mode of existence higher in nature than that which is present to us in consciousness on the contrary i think it quite a defensible proposition that humility is better shown by a confession of incompetence to grasp in thought the cause of all things and that the religious sentiment may find its highest sphere in the belief that the ultimate power is no more representable in terms of human consciousness than human consciousness is representable in terms of a plants

272     the factors of organic evolution      first published in the nineteenth century for april and may     1886   i  within the recollection of men now in middle life opinion concerning the derivation of animals and plants was in a chaotic state among the unthinking there was tacit belief in creation by miracle which formed an essential part of the creed of christendom and among the thinking there were two parties each of which held an indefensible hypothesis immensely the larger of these parties including nearly all whose scientific culture gave weight to their judgments though not accepting literally the theologicallyorthodox doctrine made a compromise between that doctrine and the doctrines which geologists had established while opposed to them were some mostly having no authority in science who held a doctrine which was heterodox both theologically and scientifically professor huxley in his lecture on the coming of age of the origin of species remarks concerning the first of these parties as follows       oneandtwenty years ago in spite of the work commenced by hutton      and continued with rare skill and patience by lyell the dominant      view of the past history of the earth was catastrophic great and      sudden physical revolutions wholesale creations and extinctions of      living beings were the ordinary machinery of the geological epic      brought into fashion by the misapplied genius of cuvier it was      gravely maintained and taught that the end of every geological      epoch was signalised by a cataclysm by which every living being on      the globe was swept away to be replaced by a brandnew creation      when the world returned to quiescence a scheme of nature which      appeared to be modelled on the likeness of a succession of rubbers      of whist at the end of each of which the players upset the table      and called for a new pack did not seem to shock anybody       i may be wrong but i doubt if at the present time there is a      single responsible representative of these opinions left the      progress of scientific geology has elevated the fundament principle      of uniformitarianism that the explanation of the past is to be      sought in the study of the present into the position of an axiom      and the wild speculations of the catastrophists to which we all      listened with respect a quarter of a century ago would hardly find      a single patient hearer at the present day  of the party above referred to as not satisfied with this conception described by professor huxley there were two classes the great majority were admirers of the vestiges of the natural history of creationa work which while it sought to show that organic evolution has taken place contended that the cause of organic evolution is an impulse supernaturally imparted to the forms of life advancing them  through grades of organization being nearly all very inadequately acquainted with the facts those who accepted the view set forth in the vestiges were ridiculed by the wellinstructed for being satisfied with evidence much of which was either invalid or easily cancelled by counterevidence and at the same time they exposed themselves to the ridicule of the more philosophical for being content with a supposed explanation which was in reality no explanation the alleged impulse to advance giving us no more help in understanding the facts than does natures alleged abhorrence of a vacuum help us to understand the ascent of water in a pump the remnant forming the second of these classes was very small while rejecting this mere verbal solution which both dr erasmus darwin and lamarck had shadowed forth in other language there were some few who rejecting also the hypothesis indicated by both dr darwin and lamarck that the promptings of desires or wants produced growths of the parts subserving them accepted the single vera causa assigned by these writersthe modification of structures resulting from modification of functions they recognized as the sole process in organic development the adaptation of parts and powers consequent on the effects of use and disusethat continual moulding and remoulding of organisms to suit their circumstances which is brought about by direct converse with such circumstances  but while this cause accepted by these few is a true cause since unquestionably during the life of the individual organism changes of function produce changes of structure and while it is a tenable hypothesis that changes of structure so produced are inheritable yet it was manifest to those not prepossessed that this cause cannot with reason be assigned for the greater part of the facts though in plants there are some characters which may not irrationally be ascribed to the direct effects of modified functions consequent on modified circumstances yet the majority of the traits presented by plants are not to be thus explained it is impossible that the thorns by which a briar is in large measure defended against browsing animals can have been developed and moulded by the continuous exercise of their protective actions for in the first place the great majority of the thorns are never touched at all and in the second place we have no ground whatever for supposing that those which are touched are thereby made to grow and to take those shapes which render them efficient plants which are rendered uneatable by the thick woolly coatings of their leaves cannot have had these coatings produced by any process of reaction against the action of enemies for there is no imaginable reason why if one part of a plant is eaten the rest should thereafter begin to develop the hairs on its surface by what direct effect of function on structure can the shell of a nut have been evolved or how can those seeds which contain essential oils rendering them unpalatable to birds have been made to secrete such essential oils by these actions of birds which they restrain or how can the delicate plumes borne by some seeds and giving the wind power to waft them to new stations be due to any immediate influences of surrounding conditions clearly in these and in countless other cases change of structure cannot have been directly caused by change of function so is it with animals to a large extent if not to the same extent though we have proof that by rough usage the dermal layer may be so excited as to produce a greatly thickened epidermal layer sometimes quite horny and though it is a feasible hypothesis that an effect of this kind persistently produced may be inherited yet no such cause can explain the carapace of the turtle the armour of the armadillo or the imbricated covering of the manis the skins of these animals are no more exposed to habitual hard usage than are those of animals covered by hair the strange excrescences which distinguish the heads of the hornbills cannot possibly have arisen from any reaction against the action of surrounding forces for even were they clearly protective there is no reason to suppose that the heads of these birds need protection more than the heads of other birds if led by the evidence that in animals the amount of covering is in some cases affected by the degree of exposure it were admitted as imaginable that the development of feathers from preceding dermal growths had resulted from that extra nutrition caused by extra superficial circulation we should still be without explanation of the structure of a feather nor should we have any clue to the specialities of feathersthe crests of various birds the tails sometimes so enormous the curiously placed plumes of the bird of paradise c c still more obviously impossible is it to explain as due to use or disuse the colours of animals no direct adaptation to function could have produced the blue protuberances on a mandrils face or the striped hide of a tiger or the gorgeous plumage of a kingfisher or the eyes in a peacocks tail or the multitudinous patterns of insects wings one single case that of a deers horns might alone have sufficed to show how insufficient was the assigned cause during their growth a deers horns are not used at all and when having been cleared of the dead skin and driedup bloodvessels covering them they are ready for use they are nerveless and nonvascular and hence are incapable of undergoing any changes of structure consequent on changes of function  of these few then who rejected the belief described by professor huxley and who espousing the belief in a continuous evolution had to account for this evolution it must be said that though the cause assigned was a true cause yet even admitting that it operated through successive generations it left unexplained the greater part of the facts having been myself one of these few i look back with surprise at the way in which the facts which were congruous with the espoused view monopolized consciousness and kept out the facts which were incongruous with itconspicuous though many of them were the misjudgment was not unnatural finding it impossible to accept any doctrine which implied a breach in the uniform course of natural causation and by implication accepting as unquestionable the origin and development of all organic forms by accumulated modifications naturally caused that which appeared to explain certain classes of these modifications was supposed to be capable of explaining the rest the tendency being to assume that these would eventually be similarly accounted for though it was not clear how  returning from this parenthetic remark we are concerned here chiefly to remember that as said at the outset there existed thirty years ago no tenable theory about the genesis of living things of the two alternative beliefs neither would bear critical examination                                       out of this dead lock we were releasedin large measure though not i believe entirelyby the origin of species that work brought into view a further factor or rather such factor recognized as in operation by here and there an observer as pointed out by mr darwin in his introduction to the second edition was by him for the first time seen to have played so immense a part in the genesis of plants and animals  though laying myself open to the charge of telling a thricetold tale i feel obliged here to indicate briefly the several great classes of facts which mr darwins hypothesis explains because otherwise that which follows would scarcely be understood and i feel the less hesitation in doing this because the hypothesis which it replaced not very widely known at any time has of late so completely dropped into the background that the majority of readers are scarcely aware of its existence and do not therefore understand the relation between mr darwins successful interpretation and the preceding unsuccessful attempt at interpretation of these classes of facts four chief ones may be here distinguished  in the first place such adjustments as those exemplified above are made comprehensible though it is inconceivable that a structure like that of the pitcherplant could have been produced by accumulated effects of function on structure yet it is conceivable that successive selections of favourable variations might have produced it and the like holds of the no less remarkable appliance of the venuss flytrap or the still more astonishing one of that waterplant by which infantfish are captured though it is impossible to imagine how by direct influence of increased use such dermal appendages as a porcupines quills could have been developed yet profiting as the members of a species otherwise defenceless might do by the stiffness of their hairs rendering them unpleasant morsels to eat it is a feasible supposition that from successive survivals of individuals thus defended in the greatest degrees and the consequent growth in successive generations of hairs into bristles bristles into spines spines into quills for all these are homologous this change could have arisen in like manner the odd inflatable bag of the bladdernosed seal the curious fishingrod with its wormlike appendage carried on the head of the lophius or angler the spurs on the wings of certain birds the weapons of the swordfish and sawfish the wattles of fowls and numberless such peculiar structures though by no possibility explicable as due to effects of use or disuse are explicable as resulting from natural selection operating in one or other way  in the second place while showing us how there have arisen countless modifications in the forms structures and colours of each part mr darwin has shown us how by the establishment of favourable variations there may arise new parts though the first step in the production of horns on the heads of various herbivorous animals may have been the growth of callosities consequent on the habit of buttingsuch callosities thus functionally initiated being afterwards developed in the most advantageous ways by selection yet no explanation can be thus given of the sudden appearance of a duplicate set of horns as occasionally happens in sheep an addition which where it proved beneficial might readily be made a permanent trait by natural selection again the modifications which follow use and disuse can by no possibility account for changes in the numbers of vertebræ but after recognizing spontaneous or rather fortuitous variation as a factor we can see that where an additional vertebra hence resulting as in some pigeons proves beneficial survival of the fittest may make it a constant character and there may by further like additions be produced extremely long strings of vertebræ such as snakes show us similarly with the mammary glands it is not an unreasonable supposition that by the effects of greater or less function inherited through successive generations these may be enlarged or diminished in size but it is out of the question to allege such a cause for changes in their numbers there is no imaginable explanation of these save the establishment by inheritance of spontaneous variations such as are known to occur in the human race  so too in the third place with certain alterations in the connexions of parts according to the greater or smaller demands made on this or that limb the muscles moving it may be augmented or diminished in bulk and if there is inheritance of changes so wrought the limb may in course of generations be rendered larger or smaller but changes in the arrangements or attachments of muscles cannot be thus accounted for it is found especially at the extremities that the relations of tendons to bones and to one another are not always the same variations in their modes of connexion may occasionally prove advantageous and may thus become established here again then we have a class of structural changes to which mr darwins hypothesis gives us the key and to which there is no other key  once more there are the phenomena of mimicry perhaps in a more striking way than any others these show how traits which seem inexplicable are explicable as due to the more frequent survival of individuals that have varied in favourable ways we are enabled to understand such marvellous simulations as those of the leafinsect those of beetles which resemble glittering dewdrops upon the leaves those of caterpillars which when asleep stretch themselves out so as to look like twigs and we are shown how there have arisen still more astonishing imitationsthose of one insect by another as mr bates has proved there are cases in which a species of butterfly rendered so unpalatable to insectivorous birds by its disagreeable taste that they will not catch it is simulated in its colours and markings by a species which is structurally quite differentso simulated that even a practised entomologist is liable to be deceived the explanation being that an original slight resemblance leading to occasional mistakes on the part of birds was increased generation after generation by the more frequent escape of the mostlike individuals until the likeness became thus great  but now recognizing in full this process brought into clear view by mr darwin and traced out by him with so much care and skill can we conclude that taken alone it accounts for organic evolution has the natural selection of favourable variations been the sole factor on critically examining the evidence we shall find reason to think that it by no means explains all that has to be explained omitting for the present any consideration of a factor which may be distinguished as primordial it may be contended that the abovenamed factor alleged by dr erasmus darwin and by lamarck must be recognized as a cooperator utterly inadequate to explain the major part of the facts as is the hypothesis of the inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications yet there is a minor part of the facts very extensive though less which must be ascribed to this cause                                       when discussing the question more than twenty years ago principles of biology § 166 i instanced the decreased size of the jaws in the civilized races of mankind as a change not accounted for by the natural selection of favourable variations since no one of the decrements by which in thousands of years this reduction has been effected could have given to an individual in which it occurred such advantage as would cause his survival either through diminished cost of local nutrition or diminished weight to be carried i did not then exclude as i might have done two other imaginable causes it may be said that there is some organic correlation between increased size of brain and decreased size of jaw campers doctrine of the facial angle being referred to in proof but this argument may be met by pointing to the many examples of smalljawed people who are also smallbrained and by citing not infrequent cases of individuals remarkable for their mental powers and at the same time distinguished by jaws not less than the average but greater again if sexual selection be named as a possible cause there is the reply that even supposing such slight diminution of jaw as took place in a single generation to have been an attraction yet the other incentives to choice on the part of men have been too many and great to allow this one to weigh in an adequate degree while during the greater portion of the period choice on the part of women has scarcely operated in earlier times they were stolen or bought and in later times mostly coerced by parents thus reconsideration of the facts does not show me the invalidity of the conclusion drawn that this decrease in size of jaw can have had no other cause than continued inheritance of those diminutions consequent on diminutions of function implied by the use of selected and wellprepared food here however my chief purpose is to add an instance showing even more clearly the connexion between change of function and change of structure this instance allied in nature to the other is presented by those varieties or rather subvarieties of dogs which having been household pets and habitually fed on soft food have not been called on to use their jaws in tearing and crunching and have been but rarely allowed to use them in catching prey and in fighting no inference can be drawn from the sizes of the jaws themselves which in these dogs have probably been shortened mainly by selection to get direct proof of the decrease of the muscles concerned in closing the jaws or biting would require a series of observations very difficult to make but it is not difficult to get indirect proof of this decrease by looking at the bony structures with which these muscles are connected examination of the skulls of sundry indoor dogs contained in the museum of the college of surgeons proves the relative smallness of such parts the only pugdogs skull is that of an individual not perfectly adult and though its traits are quite to the point they cannot with safety be taken as evidence the skull of a toyterrier has much restricted areas of insertion for the temporal muscles has weak zygomatic arches and has extremely small attachments for the masseter muscles still more significant is the evidence furnished by the skull of a king charless spaniel which if we allow three years to a generation and bear in mind that the variety must have existed before charles the seconds reign we may assume belongs to something approaching to the hundredth generation of these household pets the relative breadth between the outer surfaces of the zygomatic arches is conspicuously small the narrowness of the temporal fossæ is also striking the zygomata are very slender the temporal muscles have left no marks whatever either by limiting lines or by the character of the surfaces covered and the places of attachment for the masseter muscles are very feebly developed at the museum of natural history among skulls of dogs there is one which though unnamed is shown by its small size and by its teeth to have belonged to one variety or other of lapdogs and which has the same traits in an equal degree with the skull just described here then we have two if not three kinds of dogs which similarly leading protected and pampered lives show that in the course of generations the parts concerned in clenching the jaws have dwindled to what cause must this decrease be ascribed certainly not to artificial selection for most of the modifications named make no appreciable external signs the width across the zygomata could alone be perceived neither can natural selection have had anything to do with it for even were there any struggle for existence among such dogs it cannot be contended that any advantage in the struggle could be gained by an individual in which a decrease took place economy of nutrition too is excluded abundantly fed as such dogs are the constitutional tendency is to find places where excess of absorbed nutriment may be conveniently deposited rather than to find places where some cutting down of the supplies is practicable nor again can there be alleged a possible correlation between these diminutions and that shortening of the jaws which has probably resulted from selection for in the bulldog which has also relatively short jaws these structures concerned in closing them are unusually large thus there remains as the only conceivable cause the diminution of size which results from diminished use the dwindling of a littleexercised part has by inheritance been made more and more marked in successive generations                                       difficulties of another class may next be exemplifiedthose which present themselves when we ask how there can be effected by the selection of favourable variations such changes of structure as adapt an organism to some useful action in which many different parts cooperate none can fail to see how a simple part may in course of generations be greatly enlarged if each enlargement furthers in some decided way maintenance of the species it is easy to understand too how a complex part as an entire limb may be increased as a whole by the simultaneous due increase of its cooperative parts since if while it is growing the channels of supply bring to the limb an unusual quantity of blood there will naturally result a proportionately greater size of all its componentsbones muscles arteries veins c but though in cases like this the cooperative parts forming some large complex part may be expected to vary together nothing implies that they necessarily do so and we have proof that in various cases even when closely united they do not do so an example is furnished by those blind crabs named in the origin of species which inhabit certain dark caves of kentucky and which though they have lost their eyes have not lost the footstalks which carried their eyes in describing the varieties which have been produced by pigeonfanciers mr darwin notes the fact that along with changes in length of beak produced by selection there have not gone proportionate changes in length of tongue take again the case of teeth and jaws in mankind these have not varied together during civilization the jaws have decreased but the teeth have not decreased in proportion and hence that prevalent crowding of them often remedied in childhood by extraction of some and in other cases causing that imperfect development which is followed by early decay but the absence of proportionate variation in cooperative parts that are close together and are even bound up in the same mass is best seen in those varieties of dogs named above as illustrating the inherited effects of disuse we see in them as we see in the human race that diminution in the jaws has not been accompanied by corresponding diminution in the teeth in the catalogue of the college of surgeons museum there is appended to the entry which identifies a blenheim spaniels skull the wordsthe teeth are closely crowded together and to the entry concerning the skull of a king charless spaniel the wordsthe teeth are closely packed p 3 is placed quite transversely to the axis of the skull it is further noteworthy that in a case where there is no diminished use of the jaws but where they have been shortened by selection a like want of concomitant variation is manifested the case being that of the bulldog in the upper jaw of which also the premolars  are excessively crowded and placed obliquely or even transversely to the long axis of the skull41  if then in cases where we can test it we find no concomitant variation in cooperative parts that are near togetherif we do not find it in parts which though belonging to different tissues are so closely united as teeth and jawsif we do not find it even when the cooperative parts are not only closely united but are formed out of the same tissue like the crabs eye and its peduncle what shall we say of cooperative parts which besides being composed of different tissues are remote from one another not only are we forbidden to assume that they vary together but we are warranted in asserting that they can have no tendency to vary together and what are the implications in cases where increase of a structure can be of no service unless there is concomitant increase in many distant structures which have to join it in performing the action for which it is useful  as far back as 1864 principles of biology § 166 i named in illustration an animal carrying heavy hornsthe extinct irish elk and indicated the many changes in bones muscles bloodvessels nerves composing the forepart of the body which would be required to make an increment of size in such horns advantageous here let me take another instancethat of the giraffe an instance which i take partly because in the sixth edition of the origin of species issued in 1872 mr darwin has referred to this animal when effectually disposing of certain arguments urged against his hypothesis he there says       in order that an animal should acquire some structure specially      and largely developed it is almost indispensable that several      other parts should be modified and coadapted although every part      of the body varies slightly it does not follow that the necessary      parts should always vary in the right direction and to the right      degree p 179  and in the summary of the chapter he remarks concerning the adjustments in the same quadruped that the prolonged use of all the parts together with inheritance will have aided in an important manner in their coordination p 199 a remark probably having reference chiefly to the increased massiveness of the lower part of the neck the increased size and strength of the thorax required to bear the additional burden and the increased strength of the forelegs required to carry the greater weight of both but now i think that further consideration suggests the belief that the entailed modifications are much more numerous and remote than at first appears and that the greater part of these are such as cannot be ascribed in any degree to the selection of favourable variations but must be ascribed exclusively to the inherited effects of changed functions whoever has seen a giraffe gallop will long remember the sight as a ludicrous one the reason for the strangeness of the motions is obvious though the fore limbs and the hind limbs differ so much in length yet in galloping they have to keep pacemust take equal strides the result is that at each stride the angle which the hind limbs describe round their centre of motion is much larger than the angle described by the fore limbs and beyond this as an aid in equalizing the strides the hind part of the back is at each stride bent very much downwards and forwards hence the hindquarters appear to be doing nearly all the work now a moments observation shows that the bones and muscles composing the hindquarters of the giraffe perform actions differing in one or other way and degree from the actions performed by the homologous bones and muscles in a mammal of ordinary proportions and from those in the ancestral mammal which gave origin to the giraffe each further stage of that growth which produced the large forequarters and neck entailed some adapted change in sundry of the numerous parts composing the hindquarters since any failure in the adjustment of their respective strengths would entail some defect in speed and consequent loss of life when chased it needs but to remember how when continuing to walk with a blistered foot the taking of steps in such a modified way as to diminish pressure on the sore point soon produces aching of muscles which are called into unusual action to see that overstraining of any one of the muscles of the giraffes hindquarters might quickly incapacitate the animal when putting out all its powers to escape and to be a few yards behind others would cause death hence if we are debarred from assuming that cooperative parts vary together even when adjacent and closely unitedif we are still more debarred from assuming that with increased length of forelegs or of neck there will go an appropriate change in any one muscle or bone in the hindquarters how entirely out of the question it is to assume that there will simultaneously take place the appropriate changes in all those many components of the hindquarters which severally require readjustment it is useless to reply that an increment of length in the forelegs or neck might be retained and transmitted to posterity waiting an appropriate variation in a particular bone or muscle in the hindquarters which being made would allow of a further increment for besides the fact that until this secondary variation occurred the primary variation would be a disadvantage often fatal and besides the fact that before such an appropriate secondary variation might be expected in the course of generations to occur the primary variation would have died out there is the fact that the appropriate variation of one bone or muscle in the hindquarters would be useless without appropriate variations of all the restsome in this way and some in thata number of appropriate variations which it is impossible to suppose  nor is this all far more numerous appropriate variations would be indirectly necessitated the immense change in the ratio of forequarters to hindquarters would make requisite a corresponding change of ratio in the appliances carrying on the nutrition of the two the entire vascular system arterial and veinous would have to undergo successive unbuildings and rebuildings to make its channels everywhere adequate to the local requirements since any want of adjustment in the bloodsupply in this or that set of muscles would entail incapacity failure of speed and loss of life moreover the nerves supplying the various sets of muscles would have to be proportionately changed as well as the central nervous tracts from which they issued can we suppose that all these appropriate changes too would be step by step simultaneously made by fortunate spontaneous variations occurring along with all the other fortunate spontaneous variations considering how immense must be the number of these required changes added to the changes above enumerated the chances against any adequate readjustments fortuitously arising must be infinity to one  if the effects of use and disuse of parts are inheritable then any change in the fore parts of the giraffe which affects the action of the hind limbs and back will simultaneously cause by the greater or less exercise of it a remoulding of each component in the hind limbs and back in a way adapted to the new demands and generation after generation the entire structure of the hindquarters will be progressively fitted to the changed structure of the forequarters all the appliances for nutrition and innervation being at the same time progressively fitted to both but in the absence of this inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications there is no seeing how the required readjustments can be made                                       yet a third class of difficulties stands in the way of the belief that the natural selection of useful variations is the sole factor of organic evolution this class of difficulties already pointed out in § 166 of the principles of biology i cannot more clearly set forth than in the words there used hence i may perhaps be excused for here quoting them       where the life is comparatively simple or where surrounding      circumstances render some one function supremely important the      survival of the fittest may readily bring about the appropriate      structural change without any aid from the transmission of      functionallyacquired modifications but in proportion as the life      grows complexin proportion as a healthy existence cannot be      secured by a large endowment of some one power but demands many      powers in the same proportion do there arise obstacles to the      increase of any particular power by the preservation of favoured      races in the struggle for life as fast as the faculties are      multiplied so fast does it become possible for the several members      of a species to have various kinds of superiorities over one      another while one saves its life by higher speed another does the      like by clearer vision another by keener scent another by quicker      hearing another by greater strength another by unusual power of      enduring cold or hunger another by special sagacity another by      special timidity another by special courage and others by other      bodily and mental attributes now it is unquestionably true that      other things equal each of these attributes giving its possessor      an extra chance of life is likely to be transmitted to posterity      but there seems no reason to suppose that it will be increased in      subsequent generations by natural selection that it may be thus      increased the individuals not possessing more than average      endowments of it must be more frequently killed off than      individuals highly endowed with it and this can happen only when      the attribute is one of greater importance for the time being      than most of the other attributes if those members of the species      which have but ordinary shares of it nevertheless survive by      virtue of other superiorities which they severally possess then it      is not easy to see how this particular attribute can be developed      by natural selection in subsequent generations the probability      seems rather to be that by gamogenesis this extra endowment will      on the average be diminished in posterityjust serving in the      long run to compensate the deficient endowments of other      individuals whose special powers lie in other directions and so      to keep up the normal structure of the species the working out of      the process is here somewhat difficult to follow but it appears to      me that as fast as the number of bodily and mental faculties      increases and as fast as the maintenance of life comes to depend      less on the amount of any one and more on the combined action of      all so fast does the production of specialities of character by      natural selection alone become difficult particularly does this      seem to be so with a species so multitudinous in its powers as      mankind and above all does it seem to be so with such of the human      powers as have but minor shares in aiding the struggle for      lifethe æsthetic faculties for example  dwelling for a moment on this last illustration of the class of difficulties described let us ask how we are to interpret the development of the musical faculty i will not enlarge on the family antecedents of the great composers i will merely suggest the inquiry whether the greater powers possessed by beethoven and mozart by weber and rossini than by their fathers were not due in larger measure to the inherited effects of daily exercise of the musical faculty by their fathers than to inheritance with increase of spontaneous variations and whether the diffused musical powers of the bach clan culminating in those of johann sebastian did not result in part from constant practice but i will raise the more general questionhow came there that endowment of musical faculty which characterizes modern europeans at large as compared with their remote ancestors the monotonous chants of low savages cannot be said to show any melodic inspiration and it is not evident that an individual savage who had a little more musical perception than the rest would derive any such advantage in the maintenance of life as would secure the spread of his superiority by inheritance of the variation and then what are we to say of harmony we cannot suppose that the appreciation of this which is relatively modern can have arisen by descent from the men in whom successive variations increased the appreciation of itthe composers and musical performers for on the whole these have been men whose worldly prosperity was not such as enabled them to rear many children inheriting their special traits even if we count the illegitimate ones the survivors of these added to the survivors of the legitimate ones can hardly be held to have yielded more than average numbers of descendants and those who inherited their special traits have not often been thereby so aided in the struggle for existence as to further the spread of such traits rather the tendency seems to have been the reverse  since the above passage was written i have found in the second volume of animals and plants under domestication a remark made by mr darwin practically implying that among creatures which depend for their lives on the efficiency of numerous powers the increase of any one by the natural selection of a variation is necessarily difficult here it is       finally as indefinite and almost illimitable variability is the      usual result of domestication and cultivation with the same part      or organ varying in different individuals in different or even in      directly opposite ways and as the same variation if strongly      pronounced usually recurs only after long intervals of time any      particular variation would generally be lost by crossing      reversion and the accidental destruction of the varying      individuals unless carefully preserved by manvol ii 292  remembering that mankind subject as they are to this domestication and cultivation are not like domesticated animals under an agency which picks out and preserves particular variations it results that there must usually be among them under the influence of natural selection alone a continual disappearance of any useful variations of particular faculties which may arise only in cases of variations which are specially preservative as for example great cunning during a relatively barbarous state can we expect increase from natural selection alone we cannot suppose that minor traits exemplified among others by the æsthetic perceptions can have been evolved by natural selection but if there is inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications of structure evolution of such minor traits is no longer inexplicable                                       two remarks made by mr darwin have implications from which the same general conclusion must i think be drawn speaking of the variability of animals and plants under domestication he says       changes of any kind in the conditions of life even extremely      slight changes often suffice to cause variability animals and      plants continue to be variable for an immense period after their      first domestication  in the course of time they can be      habituated to certain changes so as to become less variable       there is good evidence that the power of changed conditions      accumulates so that two three or more generations must be      exposed to new conditions before any effect is visible some      variations are induced by the direct action of the surrounding      conditions on the whole organization or on certain parts alone      and other variations are induced indirectly through the      reproductive system being affected in the same manner as is so      common with organic beings when removed from their natural      conditionsanimals and plants under domestication vol ii      270  there are to be recognized two modes of this effect produced by changed conditions on the reproductive system and consequently on offspring simple arrest of development is one but beyond the variations of offspring arising from imperfectly developed reproductive systems in parentsvariations which must be ordinarily in the nature of imperfectionsthere are others due to a changed balance of functions caused by changed conditions the fact noted by mr darwin in the above passage that the power of changed conditions accumulates so that two three or more generations must be exposed to new conditions before any effect is visible implies that during these generations there is going on some change of constitution consequent on the changed proportions and relations of the functions i will not dwell on the implication which seems tolerably clear that this change must consist of such modifications of organs as adapt them to their changed functions and that if the influence of changed conditions accumulates it must be through the inheritance of such modifications nor will i press the questionwhat is the nature of the effect registered in the reproductive elements and which is subsequently manifested by variationsis it an effect entirely irrelevant to the new requirements of the varietyor is it an effect which makes the variety less fit for the new requirementsor is it an effect which makes it more fit for the new requirements but not pressing these questions it suffices to point out the necessary implication that changed functions of organs do in some way or other register themselves in changed proclivities of the reproductive elements in face of these facts it cannot be denied that the modified action of a part produces an inheritable effectbe the nature of that effect what it may  the second of the remarks above adverted to as made by mr darwin is contained in his sections dealing with correlated variations in the origin of species p 114 he says       the whole organization is so tied together during its growth and      development that when slight variations in any one part occur and      are accumulated through natural selection other parts become      modified  and a parallel statement contained in animals and plants under domestication vol ii p 320 runs thus       correlated variation is an important subject for us for when one      part is modified through continued selection either by man or      under nature other parts of the organization will be unavoidably      modified from this correlation it apparently follows that with      our domesticated animals and plants varieties rarely or never      differ from each other by some single character alone  by what process does a changed part modify other parts by modifying their functions in some way or degree seems the necessary answer it is indeed imaginable that where the part changed is some dermal appendage which becoming larger has abstracted more of the needful material from the general stock the effect may consist simply in diminishing the amount of this material available for other dermal appendages leading to diminution of some or all of them and may fail to affect in appreciable ways the rest of the organism save perhaps the bloodvessels near the enlarged appendage but where the part is an active onea limb or viscus or any organ which constantly demands blood produces waste matter secretes or absorbsthen all the other active organs become implicated in the change the functions performed by them have to constitute a moving equilibrium and the function of one cannot by alteration of the structure performing it be modified in degree or kind without modifying the functions of the restsome appreciably and others inappreciably according to the directness or indirectness of their relations of such interdependent changes the normal ones are naturally inconspicuous but those which are partially or completely abnormal sufficiently carry home the general truth thus unusual cerebral excitement affects the excretion through the kidneys in quantity or quality or both strong emotions of disagreeable kinds check or arrest the flow of bile a considerable obstacle to the circulation offered by some important structure in a diseased or disordered state throwing more strain upon the heart causes hypertrophy of its muscular walls and this change which is so far as concerns the primary evil a remedial one often entails mischiefs in other organs apoplexy and palsy in a scarcely credible number of cases are directly dependent on hypertrophic enlargement of the heart and in other cases asthma dropsy and epilepsy are caused now if a result of this interdependence as seen in the individual organism is that a local modification of one part produces by changing their functions correlative modifications of other parts then the question here to be put isare these correlative modifications when of a kind falling within normal limits inheritable or not if they are inheritable then the fact stated by mr darwin that when one part is modified through continued selection other parts of the organization will be unavoidably modified is perfectly intelligible these entailed secondary modifications are transmitted pari passu with the successive modifications produced by selection but what if they are not inheritable then these secondary modifications caused in the individual not being transmitted to descendants the descendants must commence life with organizations out of balance and with each increment of change in the part affected by selection their organizations must get more out of balancemust have a larger and larger amounts of reorganization to be made during their lives hence the constitution of the variety must become more and more unworkable  the only imaginable alternative is that the readjustments are effected in course of time by natural selection but in the first place as we find no proof of concomitant variation among directly cooperative parts which are closely united there cannot be assumed any concomitant variation among parts which are both indirectly cooperative and far from one another and in the second place before all the many required readjustments could be made the variety would die out from defective constitution even were there no such difficulty we should still have to entertain a strange group of propositions which would stand as follows1 change in one part entails by reaction on the organism changes in other parts the functions of which are necessarily changed 2 such changes worked in the individual affect in some way the reproductive elements these being found to evolve unusual structures when the constitutional balance has been continuously disturbed 3 but the changes in the reproductive elements thus caused are not such as represent these functionallyproduced changes the modifications conveyed to offspring are irrelevant to these various modifications functionally produced in the organs of the parents 4 nevertheless while the balance of functions cannot be reestablished through inheritance of the effects of disturbed functions on structures wrought throughout the individual organism it can be reestablished by the inheritance of fortuitous variations which occur in all the affected organs without reference to these changes of function  now without saying that acceptance of this group of propositions is impossible we may certainly say that it is not easy                                       but where are the direct proofs that inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications takes place is a question which will be put by those who have committed themselves to the current exclusive interpretation grant that there are difficulties still before the transmitted effects of use and disuse can be legitimately assigned in explanation of them we must have good evidence that the effects of use and disuse are transmitted  before dealing directly with this demurrer let me deal with it indirectly by pointing out that the lack of recognized evidence may be accounted for without assuming that there is not plenty of it inattention and reluctant attention lead to the ignoring of facts which really exist in abundance as is well illustrated in the case of prehistoric implements biassed by the current belief that no traces of man were to be found on the earths surface save in certain superficial formations of very recent date geologists and anthropologists not only neglected to seek such traces but for a long time continued to poohpooh those who said they had found them when m boucher de perthes at length succeeded in drawing the eyes of scientific men to the flint implements discovered by him in the quarternary deposits of the somme valley and when geologists and anthropologists had thus been convinced that evidences of human existence were to be found in formations of considerable age and thereafter began to search for them they found plenty of them all over the world or again to take an instance closely germane to the matter we may recall the fact that the contemptuous attitude towards the hypothesis of organic evolution which naturalists in general maintained before the publication of mr darwins work prevented them from seeing the multitudinous facts by which it is supported similarly it is very possible that their alienation from the belief that there is a transmission of those changes of structure which are produced by changes of action makes naturalists slight the evidence which supports that belief and refuse to occupy themselves in seeking further evidence  if it be asked how it happens that there have been recorded multitudinous instances of variations fortuitously arising and reappearing in offspring while there have not been recorded instances of the transmission of changes functionally produced there are three replies the first is that changes of the one class are many of them conspicuous while those of the other class are nearly all inconspicuous if a child is born with six fingers the anomaly is not simply obvious but so startling as to attract much notice and if this child growing up has sixfingered descendents everybody in the locality hears of it a pigeon with speciallycoloured feathers or one distinguished by a broadened and upraised tail or by a protuberance of the neck draws attention by its oddness and if in its young the trait is repeated occasionally with increase the fact is remarked and there follows the thought of establishing the peculiarity by selection a lamb disabled from leaping by the shortness of its legs could not fail to be observed and the fact that its offspring were similarly shortlegged and had a consequent inability to get over fences would inevitably become widely known similarly with plants that this flower had an extra number of petals that that was unusually symmetrical and that another differed considerably in colour from the average of its kind would be easily seen by an observant gardener and the suspicion that such anomalies are inheritable having arisen experiments leading to further proofs that they are so would frequently be made but it is not thus with functionallyproduced modifications the seats of these are in nearly all cases the muscular osseous and nervous systems and the visceraparts which are either entirely hidden or greatly obscured modification in a nervous centre is inaccessible to vision bones may be considerably altered in size or shape without attention being drawn to them and covered with thick coats as are most of the animals open to continuous observation the increases or decreases in muscles must be great before they become externally perceptible  a further important difference between the two inquiries is that to ascertain whether a fortuitous variation is inheritable needs merely a little attention to the selection of individuals and the observation of offspring while to ascertain whether there is inheritance of a functionallyproduced modification it is requisite to make arrangements which demand the greater or smaller exercise of some part or parts and it is difficult in many cases to find such arrangements troublesome to maintain them even for one generation and still more through successive generations  nor is this all there exist stimuli to inquiry in the one case which do not exist in the other the moneyinterest and the interest of the fancier acting now separately and now together have prompted multitudinous individuals to make experiments which have brought out clear evidence that fortuitous variations are inherited the cattlebreeders who profit by producing certain shapes and qualities the keepers of pet animals who take pride in the perfections of those they have bred the florists professional and amateur who obtain new varieties and take prizes form a body of men who furnish naturalists with countless of the required proofs but there is no such body of men led either by pecuniary interest or the interest of a hobby to ascertain by experiments whether the effects of use and disuse are inheritable  thus then there are amply sufficient reasons why there is a great deal of direct evidence in the one case and but little in the other such little being that which comes out incidentally let us look at what there is of it                                       considerable weight attaches to a fact which brownséquard discovered quite by accident in the course of his researches he found that certain artificiallyproduced lesions of the nervous system so small even as a section of the sciatic nerve left after healing an increasing excitability which ended in liability to epilepsy and there afterwards came out the unlookedfor result that the offspring of guineapigs which had thus acquired an epileptic habit such that a pinch on the neck would produce a fit inherited an epileptic habit of like kind it has indeed been since alleged that guinea pigs tend to epilepsy and that phenomena of the kind described occur where there have been no antecedents like those in brownséquards case but considering the improbability that the phenomena observed by him happened to be nothing more than phenomena which occasionally arise naturally we may until there is good proof to the contrary assign some value to his results  evidence not of this directly experimental kind but nevertheless of considerable weight is furnished by other nervous disorders there is proof enough that insanity admits of being induced by circumstances which in one or other way derange the nervous functionsexcesses of this or that kind and no one questions the accepted belief that insanity is inheritable is it alleged that the insanity which is inheritable is that which spontaneously arises and that the insanity which follows some chronic perversion of functions is not inheritable this does not seem a very reasonable allegation and until some warrant for it is forthcoming we may fairly assume that there is here a further support for belief in the transmission of functionallyproduced changes  moreover i find among physicians the belief that nervous disorders of a less severe kind are inheritable men who have prostrated their nervous systems by prolonged overwork or in some other way have children more or less prone to nervousness it matters not what may be the form of inheritancewhether it be of a brain in some way imperfect or of a deficient bloodsupply it is in any case the inheritance of functionallymodified structures  verification of the reasons above given for the paucity of this direct evidence is yielded by contemplation of it for it is observable that the cases named are cases which from one or other cause have thrust themselves on observation they justify the suspicion that it is not because such cases are rare that many of them cannot be cited but simply because they are mostly unobtrusive and to be found only by that deliberate search which nobody makes i say nobody but i am wrong successful search has been made by one whose competence as an observer is beyond question and whose testimony is less liable than that of all others to any bias towards the conclusion that such inheritance takes place i refer to the author of the origin of species                                       nowadays most naturalists are more darwinian than mr darwin himself i do not mean that their beliefs in organic evolution are more decided though i shall be supposed to mean this by the mass of readers who identify mr darwins great contribution to the theory of organic evolution with the theory of organic evolution itself and even with the theory of evolution at large but i mean that the particular factor which he first recognized as having played so immense a part in organic evolution has come to be regarded by his followers as the sole factor though it was not so regarded by him it is true that he apparently rejected altogether the causal agencies alleged by earlier inquirers in the historical sketch prefixed to the later editions of his origin of species p xiv note he writesit is curious how largely my grandfather dr erasmus darwin anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of lamarck in his zoonomia vol i pp 500510 published in 1794 and since among the views thus referred to was the view that changes of structure in organisms arise by the inheritance of functionallyproduced changes mr darwin seems by the above sentence to have implied his disbelief in such inheritance but he did not mean to imply this for his belief in it as a cause of evolution if not an important cause is proved by many passages in his works in the first chapter of the origin of species p 8 of the sixth edition he says respecting the inherited effects of habit that with animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked influence and he gives as instances the changed relative weights of the wing bones and leg bones of the wild duck and the domestic duck the great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats and the drooping ears of various domestic animals here are other passages taken from the latest edition of the work       i think there can be no doubt that use in our domestic animals has      strengthened and enlarged certain parts and disuse diminished      them and that such modifications are inherited p 108 and on      the following pages he gives five further examples of such      effects habit in producing constitutional peculiarities and use      in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs      appear in many cases to have been potent in their effects p      131 when discussing special cases mr mivart passes over the      effects of the increased use and disuse of parts which i have      always maintained to be highly important and have treated in my      variation under domestication at greater length than as i      believe any other writer p 176 disuse on the other hand      will account for the less developed condition of the whole inferior      half of the body including the lateral fins p 188 i may give      another instance of a structure which apparently owes its origin      exclusively to use or habit p 188 it appears probable that      disuse has been the main agent in rendering organs rudimentary      pp 400401 on the whole we may conclude that habit or use      and disuse have in some cases played a considerable part in the      modification of the constitution and structure but that the      effects have often been largely combined with and sometimes      overmastered by the natural selection of innate variations p      114  in his subsequent work the variation of animals and plants under domestication where he goes into full detail mr darwin gives more numerous illustrations of the inherited effects of use and disuse the following are some of the cases quoted from volume i of the first edition       treating of domesticated rabbits he saysthe want of exercise      has apparently modified the proportional length of the limbs in      comparison with the body p 116 we thus see that the most      important and complicated organ the brain in the whole      organization is subject to the law of decrease in size from disuse      p 129 he remarks that in birds of the oceanic islands not      persecuted by any enemies the reduction of their wings has      probably been caused by gradual disuse after comparing one of      these the waterhen of tristan dacunha with the european      waterhen and showing that all the bones concerned in flight are      smaller he addshence in the skeleton of this natural species      nearly the same changes have occurred only carried a little      further as with our domestic ducks and in this latter case i      presume no one will dispute that they have resulted from the      lessened use of the wings and the increased use of the legs pp      2867 as with other longdomesticated animals the instincts of      the silkmoth have suffered the caterpillars when placed on a      mulberrytree often commit the strange mistake of devouring the      base of the leaf on which they are feeding and consequently fall      down but they are capable according to m robinet of again      crawling up the trunk even this capacity sometimes fails for m      martins placed some caterpillars on a tree and those which fell      were not able to remount and perished of hunger they were even      incapable of passing from leaf to leaf p 304  here are some instances of like meaning from volume ii       in many cases there is reason to believe that the lessened use of      various organs has affected the corresponding parts in the      offspring but there is no good evidence that this ever follows in      the course of a single generation our domestic fowls ducks      and geese have almost lost not only in the individual but in the      race their power of flight for we do not see a chicken when      frightened take flight like a young pheasant with domestic      pigeons the length of the sternum the prominence of its crest      the length of the scapulæ and furcula the length of the wings as      measured from tip to tip of the radius are all reduced relatively      to the same parts in the wild pigeon after detailing kindred      diminutions in fowls and ducks mr darwin adds the decreased      weight and size of the bones in the foregoing cases is probably      the indirect result of the reaction of the weakened muscles on the      bones pp 2978 nathusius has shown that with the improved      races of the pig the shortened legs and snout the form of the      articular condyles of the occiput and the position of the jaws      with the upper canine teeth projecting in a most anomalous manner      in front of the lower canines may be attributed to these parts not      having been fully exercised these modifications of structure      which are all strictly inherited characterise several improved      breeds so that they cannot have been derived from any single      domestic or wild stock with respect to cattle professor tanner      has remarked that the lungs and liver in the improved breeds are      found to be considerably reduced in size when compared with those      possessed by animals having perfect liberty  the cause of the      reduced lungs in highlybred animals which take little exercise is      obvious pp 299300 and on pp 301 302 and 303 he gives      facts showing the effects of use and disuse in changing among      domestic animals the characters of the ears the lengths of the      intestines and in various ways the natures of the instincts  but mr darwins admission or rather his assertion that the inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications has been a factor in organic evolution is made clear not by these passages alone and by kindred ones it is made clearer still by a passage in the preface to the second edition of his descent of man he there protests against that current version of his views in which this factor makes no appearance the passage is as follows       i may take this opportunity of remarking that my critics      frequently assume that i attribute all changes of corporeal      structure and mental power exclusively to the natural selection of      such variations as are often called spontaneous whereas even in      the first edition of the origin of species i distinctly stated      that great weight must be attributed to the inherited effects of      use and disuse with respect both to the body and mind  nor is this all there is evidence that mr darwins belief in the efficiency of this factor became stronger as he grew older and accumulated more evidence the first of the extracts above given taken from the sixth edition of the origin of species runs thus       i think there can be no doubt that use in our domestic animals has      strengthened and enlarged certain parts and disuse diminished      them and that such modifications are inherited  now on turning to the first edition p 134 it will be found that instead of the wordsi think there can be no doubt the words originally used werei think there can be little doubt that this deliberate erasure of a qualifying word and substitution of a word implying unqualified belief was due to a more decided recognition of a factor originally underestimated is clearly implied by the wording of the abovequoted passage from the preface to the descent of man where he says that even in the first edition of the origin of species c the implication being that much more in subsequent editions and subsequent works had he insisted on this factor the change thus indicated is especially significant as having occurred at a time of life when the natural tendency is towards fixity of opinion  during that earlier period when he was discovering the multitudinous cases in which his own hypothesis afforded solutions and simultaneously observing how utterly futile in these multitudinous cases was the hypothesis propounded by his grandfather and lamarck mr darwin was not unnaturally almost betrayed into the belief that the one is allsufficient and the other inoperative but in the mind of one so candid and ever open to more evidence there naturally came a reaction the inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications which judging by the passage quoted above concerning the views of these earlier enquirers would seem to have been at one time denied but which as we have seen was always to some extent recognized came to be recognized more and more and deliberately included as a factor of importance                                       of this reaction displayed in the later writings of mr darwin let us now askhas it not to be carried further was the share in organic evolution which mr darwin latterly assigned to the transmission of modifications caused by use and disuse its due share consideration of the groups of evidences given above will i think lead us to believe that its share has been much larger than he supposed even in his later days  there is first the implication yielded by extensive classes of phenomena which remain inexplicable in the absence of this factor if as we see cooperative parts do not vary together even when few and close together and may not therefore be assumed to do so when many and remote we cannot account for those innumerable changes in organization which are implied when for advantageous use of some modified part many other parts which join it in action have to be modified  further as increasing complexity of structure accompanying increasing complexity of life implies increasing number of faculties of which each one conduces to preservation of self or descendants and as the various individuals of a species severally requiring something like the normal amounts of all these may individually profit here by an unusual amount of one and there by an unusual amount of another it follows that as the number of faculties becomes greater it becomes more difficult for any one to be further developed by natural selection only where increase of some one is predominantly advantageous does the means seem adequate to the end especially in the case of powers which do not subserve selfpreservation in appreciable degrees does development by natural selection appear impracticable  it is a fact recognized by mr darwin that where by selection through successive generations a part has been increased or decreased its reaction upon other parts entails changes in them this reaction is effected through the changes of function involved if the changes of structure produced by such changes of function are inheritable then the readjustment of parts throughout the organism taking place generation after generation maintains an approximate balance but if not then generation after generation the organism must get more and more out of gear and tend to become unworkable  further as it is proved that change in the balance of functions registers its effects on the reproductive elements we have to choose between the alternatives that the registered effects are irrelevant to the particular modifications which the organism has undergone or that they are such as tend to produce repetitions of these modifications the last of these alternatives makes the facts comprehensible but the first of them not only leaves us with several unsolved problems but is incongruous with the general truth that by reproduction ancestral traits down to minute details are transmitted  though in the absence of pecuniary interests and the interests in hobbies no such special experiments as those which have established the inheritance of fortuitous variations have been made to ascertain whether functionallyproduced modifications are inherited yet certain apparent instances of such inheritance have forced themselves on observation without being sought for in addition to other indications of a less conspicuous kind is the one i have given abovethe fact that the apparatus for tearing and mastication has decreased with decrease of its function alike in civilized man and in some varieties of dogs which lead protected and pampered lives of the numerous cases named by mr darwin it is observable that they are yielded not by one class of parts only but by most if not all classesby the dermal system the muscular system the osseous system the nervous system the viscera and that among parts liable to be functionally modified the most numerous observed cases of inheritance are furnished by those which admit of preservation and easy comparisonthe bones these cases moreover being specially significant as showing how in sundry unallied species parallel changes of structure have occurred along with parallel changes of habit  what then shall we say of the general implication are we to stop short with the admission that inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications takes place only in cases in which there is evidence of it may we properly assume that these many instances of changes of structure caused by changes of function occurring in various tissues and various organs are merely special and exceptional instances having no general significance shall we suppose that though the evidence which already exists has come to light without aid from a body of inquirers there would be no great increase were due attention devoted to the collection of evidence this is i think not a reasonable supposition to me the ensemble of the facts suggests the belief scarcely to be resisted that the inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications takes place universally looking at physiological phenomena as conforming to physical principles it is difficult to conceive that a changed play of organic forces which in many cases of different kinds produces an inherited change of structure does not do this in all cases the implication very strong i think is that the action of every organ produces on it a reaction which usually not altering its rate of nutrition sometimes leaves it with diminished nutrition consequent on diminished action and at other times increases its nutrition in proportion to its increased action that while generating a modified consensus of functions and of structures the activities are at the same time impressing this modified consensus on the spermcells and germcells whence future individuals are to be produced and that in ways mostly too small to be identified but occasionally in more conspicuous ways and in the course of generations the resulting modifications of one or other kind show themselves further it seems to me that as there are certain extensive classes of phenomena which are inexplicable if we assume the inheritance of fortuitous variations to be the sole factor but which become at once explicable if we admit the inheritance of functionallyproduced changes we are justified in concluding that this inheritance of functionallyproduced changes has been not simply a cooperating factor in organic evolution but has been a cooperating factor without which organic evolution in its higher forms at any rate could never have taken place  be this or be it not a warrantable conclusion there is i think good reason for a provisional acceptance of the hypothesis that the effects of use and disuse are inheritable and for a methodic pursuit of inquiries with the view of either establishing it or disproving it it seems scarcely reasonable to accept without clear demonstration the belief that while a trivial difference of structure arising spontaneously is transmissible a massive difference of structure maintained generation after generation by change of function leaves no trace in posterity considering that unquestionably the modification of structure by function is a vera causa in so far as concerns the individual and considering the number of facts which so competent an observer as mr darwin regarded as evidence that transmission of such modifications takes place in particular cases the hypothesis that such transmission takes place in conformity with a general law holding of all active structures should i think be regarded as at least a good working hypothesis                                       but now supposing the broad conclusion above drawn to be grantedsupposing all to agree that from the beginning along with inheritance of useful variations fortuitously arising there has been inheritance of effects produced by use and disuse do there remain no classes of organic phenomena unaccounted for to this question i think it must be replied that there do remain classes of organic phenomena unaccounted for it may i believe be shown that certain cardinal traits of animals and plants at large are still unexplained and that a further factor must be recognized to show this however will require another paper   ii  ask a plumber who is repairing your pump how the water is raised in it and he repliesby suction recalling the ability which he has to suck up water into his mouth through a tube he is certain that he understands the pumps action to inquire what he means by suction seems to him absurd he says you know as well as he does what he means and he cannot see that there is any need for asking how it happens that the water rises in the tube when he strains his mouth in a particular way to the question why the pump acting by suction will not make the water rise above 32 feet and practically not so much he can give no answer but this does not shake his confidence in his explanation  on the other hand an inquirer who insists on knowing what suction is may obtain from the physicist answers which give him clear ideas not only about it but about many other things he learns that on ourselves and all things around there is an atmospheric pressure amounting to about 15 pounds on the square inch 15 pounds being the average weight of a column of air having a square inch for its base and extending upwards from the sealevel to the limit of the earths atmosphere he is made to observe that when he puts one end of a tube into water and the other end into his mouth and then draws back his tongue so leaving a vacant space two things happen one is that the pressure of air outside his cheeks no longer balanced by an equal pressure of air inside thrusts his cheeks inwards and the other is that the pressure of air on the surface of the water no longer balanced by an equal pressure of air within the tube and his mouth into which part of the air from the tube has gone the water is forced up the tube in consequence of the unequal pressure once understanding thus the nature of the socalled suction he sees how it happens that when the plunger of the pump is raised and relieves from atmospheric pressure the water below it the atmospheric pressure on the water in the well not being balanced by that on the water in the tube forces the water higher up the tube so that it follows the plunger and now he sees why the water cannot be raised beyond the theoretic limit of 32 feet a limit made much lower in practice by imperfections in the apparatus for if simplifying the conception he supposes the tube of the pump to be a square inch in section then the atmospheric pressure of 15 pounds per square inch on the water in the well can raise the water in the tube to such height only that the entire column of it weighs 15 pounds having been thus enlightened about the pumps action the action of a barometer becomes intelligible he perceives how under the conditions established the weight of the column of mercury balances that of an atmospheric column of equal diameter and how as the weight of the atmospheric column varies there is a corresponding variation in the weight of the mercurial columnshown by change of height moreover having previously supposed that he understood the ascent of a balloon when he ascribed it to relative lightness he now sees that he did not truly understand it for he did not recognize it as a result of that upward pressure caused by the difference between the weight of the mass formed by the gas in the balloon plus the cylindrical column of air extending above it to the limit of the atmosphere and the weight of a similar cylindrical column of air extending down to the under surface of the balloon this difference of weight causing an equivalent upward pressure on the under surface  why do i introduce these familiar truths so entirely irrelevant to my subject i do it to show in the first place the contrast between a vague conception of a cause and a distinct conception of it or rather the contrast between that conception of a cause which results when it is simply classed with some other or others which familiarity makes us think we understand and that conception of a cause which results when it is represented in terms of definite physical forces admitting of measurement and i do it to show in the second place that when we insist on resolving a verballyintelligible cause into its actual factors we get not only a clear solution of the problem before us but we find that the way is opened to solutions of sundry other problems while we rest satisfied with unanalyzed causes we may be sure both that we do not rightly comprehend the production of the particular effects ascribed to them and that we overlook other effects which would be revealed to us by contemplation of the causes as analyzed especially must this be so where the causation is complex hence we may infer that the phenomena presented by the development of species are not likely to be truly conceived unless we keep in view the concrete agencies at work let us look closely at the facts to be dealt with                                       the growth of a thing is effected by the joint operation of certain forces on certain materials and when it dwindles there is either a lack of some materials or the forces cooperate in a way different from that which produces growth if a structure has varied the implication is that the processes which built it up were made unlike the parallel processes in other cases by the greater or less amount of some one or more of the matters or actions concerned where there is unusual fertility the play of vital activities is thereby shown to have deviated from the ordinary play of vital activities and conversely if there is infertility if the germs or ova or seed or offspring partially developed survive more or survive less it is either because their molar or molecular structures are unlike the average ones or because they are affected in unlike ways by surrounding agencies when life is prolonged the fact implies that the combination of actions visible and invisible constituting life retains its equilibrium longer than usual in presence of environing forces which tend to destroy its equilibrium that is to say growth variation survival death if they are to be reduced to the forms in which physical science can recognize them must be expressed as effects of agencies definitely conceivedmechanical forces light heat chemical affinity c  this general conclusion brings with it the thought that the phrases employed in discussing organic evolution though convenient and indeed needful are liable to mislead us by veiling the actual agencies that which really goes on in every organism is the working together of component parts in ways conducing to the continuance of their combined actions in presence of things and actions outside some of which tend to subserve and others to destroy the combination the matters and forces in these two groups are the sole causes properly so called the words natural selection do not express a cause in the physical sense they express a mode of cooperation among causesor rather to speak strictly they express an effect of this mode of cooperation the idea they convey seems perfectly intelligible natural selection having been compared with artificial selection and the analogy pointed out there apparently remains no indefiniteness the inconvenience being however that the definiteness is of a wrong kind the tacitly implied nature which selects is not an embodied agency analogous to the man who selects artificially and the selection is not the picking out of an individual fixed on but the overthrowing of many individuals by agencies which one successfully resists and hence continues to live and multiply mr darwin was conscious of these misleading implications in the introduction to his animals and plants under domestication p 6 he says       for brevity sake i sometimes speak of natural selection as an      intelligent power  i have also often personified the word      nature for i have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity but      i mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many      natural lawsand by laws only the ascertained sequence of      events  but while he thus clearly saw and distinctly asserted that the factors of organic evolution are the concrete actions inner and outer to which every organism is subject mr darwin by habitually using the convenient figure of speech was i think prevented from recognizing so fully as he would otherwise have done certain fundamental consequences of these actions  though it does not personalize the cause and does not assimilate its mode of working to a human mode of working kindred objections may be urged against the expression to which i was led when seeking to present the phenomena in literal terms rather than metaphorical termsthe survival of the fittest42 for in a vague way the first word and in a clear way the second word calls up an anthropocentric idea the thought of survival inevitably suggests the human view of certain sets of phenomena rather than that character which they have simply as groups of changes if asking what we really know of a plant we exclude all the ideas associated with the words life and death we find that the sole facts known to us are that there go on in the plant certain interdependent processes in presence of certain aiding and hindering influences outside of it and that in some cases a difference of structure or a favourable set of circumstances allows these interdependent processes to go on for longer periods than in other cases again in the working together of those many actions internal and external which determine the lives or deaths of organisms we see nothing to which the words fitness and unfitness are applicable in the physical sense if a key fits a lock or a glove a hand the relation of the things to one another is presentable to the perceptions no approach to fitness of this kind is made by an organism which continues to live under certain conditions neither the organic structures themselves nor their individual movements nor those combined movements of certain among them which constitute conduct are related in any analogous way to the things and actions in the environment evidently the word fittest as thus used is a figure of speech suggesting the fact that amid surrounding actions an organism characterized by the word has either a greater ability than others of its kind to maintain the equilibrium of its vital activities or else has so much greater a power of multiplication that though not longer lived than they it continues to live in posterity more persistently and indeed as we here see the word fittest has to cover cases in which there may be less ability than usual to survive individually but in which the defect is more than made good by higher degrees of fertility  i have elaborated this criticism with the intention of emphasizing the need for studying the changes which have gone on and are ever going on in organic bodies from an exclusively physical point of view on contemplating the facts from this point of view we become aware that besides those special effects of the cooperating forces which eventuate in the longer survival of one individual than of others and in the consequent increase through generations of some trait which furthered its survival many other effects are being wrought on each and all of the individuals bodies of every class and quality inorganic as well as organic are from instant to instant subject to the influences in their environments are from instant to instant being changed by these in ways that are mostly inconspicuous and are in course of time changed by them in conspicuous ways living things in common with dead things are i say being thus perpetually acted upon and modified and the changes hence resulting constitute an allimportant part of those undergone in the course of organic evolution i do not mean to imply that changes of this class pass entirely unrecognized for as we shall see mr darwin takes cognizance of certain secondary and special ones but the effects which are not taken into account are those primary and universal effects which give certain fundamental characters to all organisms contemplation of an analogy will best prepare the way for appreciation of them and of the relation they bear to those which at present monopolize attention  an observant rambler along shores will here and there note places where the sea has deposited things more or less similar and separated them from dissimilar thingswill see shingle parted from sand larger stones sorted from smaller stones and will occasionally discover deposits of shells more or less worn by being rolled about sometimes the pebbles or boulders composing the shingle at one end of a bay he will find much larger than those at the other intermediate sizes having small average differences occupying the space between the extremes an example occurs if i remember rightly some mile or two to the west of tenby but the most remarkable and wellknown example is that afforded by the chesil bank here along a shore some sixteen miles long there is a gradual increase in the sizes of the stones which being at one end but mere pebbles are at the other end immense boulders in this case then the breakers and the undertow have effected a selectionhave at each place left behind those stones which were too large to be readily moved while taking away others small enough to be moved easily but now if we contemplate exclusively this selective action of the sea we overlook certain important effects which the sea simultaneously works while the stones have been differently acted upon in so far that some have been left here and some carried there they have been similarly acted upon in two allied but distinguishable ways by perpetually rolling them about and knocking them one against another the waves have so broken off their most prominent parts as to produce in all of them more or less rounded forms and then further the mutual friction of the stones simultaneously caused has smoothed their surfaces that is to say in general terms the actions of environing agencies so far as they have operated indiscriminately have produced in the stones a certain unity of character at the same time that they have by their differential effects separated them the larger ones having withstood certain violent actions which the smaller ones could not withstand  similarly with other assemblages of objects which are alike in their primary traits but unlike in their secondary traits when simultaneously exposed to the same set of actions some of these actions rising to a certain intensity may be expected to work on particular members of the assemblage changes which they cannot work in those which are markedly unlike while others of the actions will work in all of them similar changes because of the uniform relations between these actions and certain attributes common to all members of the assemblage hence it is inferable that on living organisms which form an assemblage of this kind and are unceasingly exposed in common to the agencies composing their inorganic environments there must be wrought two such sets of effects there will result a universal likeness among them consequent on the likeness of their respective relations to the matters and forces around and there will result in some cases the differences due to the differential effects of these matters and forces and in other cases the changes which being lifesustaining or lifedestroying eventuate in certain natural selections  i have above made a passing reference to the fact that mr darwin did not fail to take account of some among these effects directly produced on organisms by surrounding inorganic agencies here are extracts from the sixth edition of the origin of species showing this       it is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions such as      of climate food c have acted in a definite manner there is      reason to believe that in the course of time the effects have been      greater than can be proved by clear evidence mr gould believes      that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a      clear atmosphere than when living near the coast or on islands      and wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects the      colours of insects moquintandon gives a list of plants which      when growing near the seashore have their leaves in some degree      fleshy though not elsewhere fleshy pp 1067 some observers      are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair      and that with the hair the horns are correlated p 159  in his subsequent work animals and plants under domestication mr darwin still more clearly recognizes these causes of change in organization a chapter is devoted to the subject after premising that the direct action of the conditions of life whether leading to definite or indefinite results is a totally distinct consideration from the effects of natural selection he goes on to say that changed conditions of life have acted so definitely and powerfully on the organisation of our domesticated productions that they have sufficed to form new subvarieties or races without the aid of selection by man or of natural selection of his examples here are two       i have given in detail in the ninth chapter the most remarkable      case known to me namely that in germany several varieties of      maize brought from the hotter parts of america were transformed in      the course of only two or three generations vol ii p 277      and in this ninth chapter concerning these and other such      instances he says some of the foregoing differences would      certainly be considered of specific value with plants in a state of      nature vol i p 321 mr meehan in a remarkable paper      compares twentynine kinds of american trees belonging to various      orders with their nearest european allies all grown in close      proximity in the same garden and under as nearly as possible the      same conditions and then enumerating six traits in which the      american forms all of them differ in like ways from their allied      european forms mr darwin thinks there is no choice but to      conclude that these have been definitely caused by the      longcontinued action of the different climate of the two      continents on the trees vol ii pp 2812  but the fact we have to note is that while mr darwin thus took account of special effects due to special amounts and combinations of agencies in the environment he did not take account of the far more important effects due to the general and constant operation of these agencies43 if a difference between the quantities of a force which acts on two organisms otherwise alike and otherwise similarly conditioned produces some difference between them then by implication this force produces in both of them effects which they show in common the inequality between two things cannot have a value unless the things themselves have values similarly if in two cases some unlikeness of proportion among the surrounding inorganic agencies to which two plants or two animals are exposed is followed by some unlikeness in the changes wrought on them then it follows that these several agencies taken separately work changes in both of them hence we must infer that organisms have certain structural characters in common which are consequent on the action of the medium in which they exist using the word medium in a comprehensive sense as including all physical forces falling upon them as well as matters bathing them and we may conclude that from the primary characters thus produced there must result secondary characters  before going on to observe those general traits of organisms due to the general action of the inorganic environment upon them i feel tempted to enlarge on the effects produced by each of the several matters and forces constituting the environment i should like to do this not only to give a clear preliminary conception of the ways in which all organisms are affected by these universallypresent agents but also to show that in the first place these agents modify inorganic bodies as well as organic bodies and that in the second place the organic are far more modifiable by them than the inorganic but to avoid undue suspension of the argument i content myself with saying that when the respective effects of gravitation heat light c are studied as well as the respective effects physical and chemical of the matters forming the media water and air it will be found that while more or less operative on all bodies each modifies organic bodies to an extent immensely greater than the extent to which it modifies inorganic bodies                                       here not discriminating among the special effects which these various forces and matters in the environment produce on both classes of bodies let us consider their combined effects and askwhat is the most general trait of such effects  obviously the most general trait is the greater amount of change wrought on the outer surface than on the inner mass in so far as the matters of which the medium is composed come into play the unavoidable implication is that they act more on the parts directly exposed to them than on the parts sheltered from them and in so far as the forces pervading the medium come into play it is manifest that excluding gravity which affects outer and inner parts indiscriminately the outer parts have to bear larger shares of their actions if it is a question of heat then the exterior must lose it or gain it faster than the interior and in a medium which is now warmer and now colder the two must habitually differ in temperature to some extentat least where the size is considerable if it is a question of light then in all but absolutely transparent masses the outer parts must undergo more of any change producible by it than the inner partssupposing other things equal by which i mean supposing the case is not complicated by any such convexities of the outer surface as produce internal concentrations of rays hence then speaking generally the necessity is that the primary and almost universal effect of the converse between the body and its medium is to differentiate its outside from its inside i say almost universal because where the body is both mechanically and chemically stable like for instance a quartz crystal the medium may fail to work either inner or outer change  of illustrations among inorganic bodies a convenient one is supplied by an old cannonball that has been long lying exposed a coating of rust formed of flakes within flakes incloses it and this thickens year by year until perhaps it reaches a stage at which its exterior loses as much by rain and wind as its interior gains by further oxidation of the iron most mineral massespebbles boulders rocksif they show any effect of the environment at all show it only by that disintegration of surface which follows the freezing of absorbed water an effect which though mechanical rather than chemical equally illustrates the general truth occasionally a rockingstone is thus produced there are formed successive layers relatively friable in texture each of which thickest at the most exposed parts and being presently lost by weathering leaves the contained mass in a shape more rounded than before until resting on its convex undersurface it is easily moved but of all instances perhaps the most remarkable is one to be seen on the west bank of the nile at philæ where a ridge of granite 100 feet high has had its outer parts reduced in course of time to a collection of bouldershaped masses varying from say a yard in diameter to six or eight feet each one of which shows in progress an exfoliation of successivelyformed shells of decomposed granite most of the masses having portions of such shells partially detached  if now inorganic masses relatively so stable in composition thus have their outer parts differentiated from their inner parts what must we say of organic masses characterized by such extreme chemical instabilityinstability so great that their essential material is named protein to indicate the readiness with which it passes from one isomeric form to another clearly the necessary inference is that this effect of the medium must be wrought inevitably and promptly wherever the relation of outer and inner has become settled a qualification for which the need will be seen hereafter                                       beginning with the earliest and most minute kinds of living things we necessarily encounter difficulties in getting direct evidence since of the countless species now existing all have been subject during millions upon millions of years to the evolutionary process and have had their primary traits complicated and obscured by those endless secondary traits which the natural selection of favourable variations has produced among protophytes it needs but to think of the multitudinous varieties of diatoms and desmids with their elaboratelyconstructed coverings or of the definite methods of growth and multiplication among such simple algæ as the conjugatæ to see that most of their distinctive characters are due to inherited constitutions which have been slowly moulded by survival of the fittest to this or that mode of life to disentangle such parts of their developmental changes as are due to the action of the medium is therefore hardly possible we can hope only to get a general conception of it by contemplating the totality of the facts  the first cardinal fact is that all protophytes are cellularall show us this contrast between outside and inside supposing the multitudinous specialities of the envelope in different orders and genera of protophytes to be set against one another and mutually cancelled there remains as a trait common to theman envelope unlike that which it envelopes the second cardinal fact is that this simple trait is the earliest trait displayed in germs or spores or other parts from which new individuals are to arise and that consequently this trait must be regarded as having been primordial for it is an established truth of organic evolution that embryos show us in general ways the forms of remote ancestors and that the first changes undergone indicate more or less clearly the first changes which took place in the series of forms through which the existing form has been reached describing in successive groups of plants the early transformations of these primitive units sachs44 says of the lowest algæ that the conjugated protoplasmic body clothes itself with a cellwall p 10 that in the spores of mosses and vascular cryptogams and in the pollen of phanerogams  the protoplasmic body of the mothercell breaks up into four lumps which quickly round themselves off and contract and become enveloped by a cellmembrane only after complete separation p 13 that in the equisetaceæ the young spores when first separated are still naked but they soon become surrounded by a cellmembrane p 14 and that in higher plants as in the pollen of many dicotyledons the contracting daughtercells secrete cellulose even during their separation p 14 here then in whatever way we interpret it the fact is that there quickly arises an outer layer different from the contained matter but the most significant evidence is furnished by the masses of protoplasm that escape into water from the injured sacs of vaucheria which often instantly become rounded into globular bodies and of which the hyaline protoplasm envelopes the whole as a skin p 41 which is denser than the inner and more watery substance p 42 as in this case the protoplasm is but a fragment and as it is removed from the influence of the parentcell this differentiating process can scarcely be regarded as anything more than the effect of physicochemical actions a conclusion which is supported by the statement of sachs that not only every vacuole in a solid protoplasmic body but also every thread of protoplasm which penetrates the sapcavity and finally the inner side of the protoplasmsac which encloses the sapcavity is also bounded by a skin p 42 if then every portion of a protoplasmic body immediately surrounds itself when it becomes isolated with such a skin which is shown in all cases to arise at the surface of contact with sap or water this primary differentiation of outer from inner must be ascribed to the direct action of the medium whether the coating thus initiated is secreted by the protoplasm or whether as seems more likely it results from transformation of it matters not to the argument either way the action of the medium causes its formation and either way the many varied and complex differentiations which developed cellwalls display must be considered as originating from those variations of this physicallygenerated covering which natural selection has taken advantage of  the contained protoplasm of a vegetal cell which has selfmobility and when liberated sometimes performs amoebalike motions for a time may be regarded as an imprisoned amoeba and when we pass from it to a free amoeba which is one of the simplest types of first animals or protozoa we naturally meet with kindred phenomena the general trait which here concerns us is that while its plastic or semifluid sarcode goes on protruding in irregular ways now this and now that part of its periphery and again withdrawing into its interior first one and then another of these temporary processes perhaps with some small portion of food attached there is but an indistinct differentiation of outer from inner a fact shown by the frequent coalescence of the pseudopodia in rhizopods but that when it eventually becomes quiescent the surface becomes differentiated from the contents the passing into an encysted state doubtless in large measure due to inherited proclivity being furthered and having probably been once initiated by the action of the medium the connexion between constancy of relative position among the parts of the sarcode and the rise of a contrast between superficial and central parts is perhaps best shown in the minutest and simplest infusoria the monadinæ the genus monas is described by kent as plastic and unstable in form possessing no distinct cuticular investment  the foodsubstances incepted at all parts of the periphery45 and the genus scytomonas he says differs from monas only in its persistent shape and accompanying greater rigidity of the peripheral or ectoplasmic layer46 describing generally such low forms some of which are said to have neither nucleus nor vacuole he remarks that in types somewhat higher the outer or peripheral border of the protoplasmic mass while not assuming the character of a distinct cellwall or socalled cuticle presents as compared with the inner substance of that mass a slightly more solid type of composition47 and it is added that these forms having so slightly differentiated an exterior while usually exhibiting a more or less characteristic normal outline can revert at will to a pseudamoeboid and repent state48 here then we have several indications of the truth that the permanent externality of a certain part of the substance is followed by transformation of it into a coating unlike the substance it contains indefinite and structureless in the simplest of these forms as instance again the gregarina49 the limiting membrane becomes in higher infusoria definite and often complex showing that the selection of favourable variations has had largely to do with its formation in such types as the foraminifera which almost structureless internally though they are secrete calcareous shells it is clear that the nature of this outer layer is determined by inherited constitution but recognition of this consists with the belief that the action of the medium initiated the outer layer specialized though it now is and that even still contact with the medium excites secretion of it  a remarkable analogy remains to be named when we study the action of the medium in an inorganic mass we are led to see that between the outer changed layer and the inner unchanged mass comes a surface where active change is going on here we have to note that alike in the plantcell and in the animalcell there is a similar relation of parts immediately inside the envelope comes the primordial utricle in the one case and in the other case the layer of active sarcode in either case the living protoplasm placed in the position of a lining to the cuticle of the cell is shielded from the direct action of the medium and yet is not beyond the reach of its influences                                       limited as thus far drawn to a certain common trait of those minute organisms which are mostly below the reach of unaided vision the foregoing conclusion appears trivial enough but it ceases to appear trivial on passing into a wider field and observing the implications direct and indirect as they concern plants and animals of sensible sizes  popular expositions of science have so far familiarized many readers with a certain fundamental trait of living things around that they have ceased to perceive how marvellous a trait it is and until interpreted by the theory of evolution how utterly mysterious in past times the conception of an ordinary plant or animal which prevailed not throughout the world at large only but among the most instructed was that it is a single continuous entity one of these livings things was unhesitatingly regarded as being in all respects a unit parts it might have various in their sizes forms and compositions but these were components of a whole which had been from the beginning in its original nature a whole even to naturalists fifty years ago the assertion that a cabbage or a cow though in one sense a whole is in another sense a vast society of minute individuals severally living in greater or less degrees and some of them maintaining their independent lives unrestrained would have seemed an absurdity but this truth which like so many of the truths established by science is contrary to that common sense in which most people have so much confidence has been gradually growing clear since the days when leeuwenhoeck and his contemporaries began to examine through lenses the minute structures of common plants and animals each improvement in the microscope while it has widened our knowledge of those minute forms of life described above has revealed further evidence of the fact that all the larger forms of life consist of units severally allied in their fundamental traits to these minute forms of life though as formulated by schwann and schleiden the celldoctrine has undergone qualifications of statement yet the qualifications have not been such as to militate against the general proposition that organisms visible to the naked eye are severally compounded of invisible organismsusing that word in its most comprehensive sense and then when the development of any animal is traced it is found that having been primarily a nucleated cell and having afterwards become by spontaneous fission a cluster of nucleated cells it goes on through successive stages to form out of such cells ever multiplying and modifying in various ways the several tissues and organs composing the adult  on the hypothesis of evolution this universal trait has to be accepted not as a fact that is strange but unmeaning it has to be accepted as evidence that all the visible forms of life have arisen by union of the invisible forms which instead of flying apart when they divided remained together various intermediate stages are known among plants those of the volvox type show us the component protophytes so feebly combined that they severally carry on their lives with no appreciable subordination to the life of the group and among animals a parallel relation between the lives of the units and the life of the group is shown us in uroglena and syncrypta from these first stages upwards may be traced through successively higher types an increasing subordination of the units to the aggregate though still a subordination leaving to them conspicuous amounts of individual activity joining which facts with the phenomena presented by the cellmultiplication and aggregation of every unfolding germ naturalists are now accepting the conclusion that by this process of composition from protozoa were formed all classes of the metazoa50as animals formed by this compounding are now called and that in a similar way from protophyta were formed all classes of what i suppose will be called metaphyta though the word does not yet seem to have become current  and now what is the general meaning of these truths taken in connexion with the conclusion reached in the last section it is that this universal trait of the metazoa and metaphyta must be ascribed to the primitive action and reaction between the organism and its medium the operation of those forces which produced the primary differentiation of outer from inner in early minute masses of protoplasm predetermined this universal cellstructure of all embryos plant and animal and the consequent cellcomposition of adult forms arising from them how unavoidable is this implication will be seen on carrying further an illustration already usedthat of the shinglecovered shore the pebbles on which while being in some cases selected have been in all cases rounded and smoothed suppose a bed of such shingle to be as we often see it solidified along with interfused material into a conglomerate what in such case must be considered as the chief trait of such conglomerate or ratherwhat must we regard as the chief cause of its distinctive characters evidently the action of the sea without the breakers no pebbles without the pebbles no conglomerate similarly then in the absence of that action of the medium by which was effected the differentiation of outer from inner in those microscopic portions of protoplasm constituting the earliest and simplest animals and plants there could not have existed this cardinal trait of composition which all the higher animals and plants show us  so that active as has been the part played by natural selection alike in modifying and moulding the original unitslargely as survival of the fittest has been instrumental in furthering and controlling the combination of these units into visible organisms and eventually into large ones yet we must ascribe to the direct effect of the medium on the first forms of life that character of which this everywhereoperative factor has taken advantage                                       let us turn now to another and more obvious attribute of higher organisms for which also there is this same general cause let us observe how on a higher platform there recurs this differentiation of outer from innerhow this primary trait in the living units with which life commences reappears as a primary trait in those aggregates of such units which constitute visible organisms  in its simplest and most unmistakable form we see this in the early changes of an unfolding ovum of primitive type the original fertilized single cell having by spontaneous fission multiplied into a cluster of such cells there begins to show itself a contrast between periphery and centre and presently there is formed a sphere consisting of a superficial layer unlike its contents the first change then is the rise of a difference between that outer part which holds direct converse with the surrounding medium and that inclosed part which does not this primary differentiation in these compound embryos of higher animals parallels the primary differentiation undergone by the simplest living things  leaving for the present succeeding changes of the compound embryo the significance of which we shall have to consider byandby let us pass now to the adult forms of visible plants and animals in them we find cardinal traits which after what we have seen above will further impress us with the importance of the effects wrought on the organism by its medium  from the thallus of a seaweed up to the leaf of a highly developed phænogam we find at all stages a contrast between the inner and outer parts of these flattened masses of tissue in the higher algæ the outermost layers consist of smaller and firmer cells while the inner cells are often very large and sometimes extremely long51 and in the leaves of trees the epidermal layer besides differing in the sizes and shapes of its component cells from the parenchyma forming the inner substance of the leaf is itself differentiated by having a continuous cuticle and by having the outer walls of its cells unlike the inner walls52 especially significant is the structure of such intermediate types as the liverworts beyond the differentiation of the covering cells from the contained cells and the contrast between upper surface and under surface the frond of marchantia polymorpha clearly shows us the direct effect of incident forces and shows us too how it is involved with the effect of inherited proclivities the frond grows from a flat discshaped gemma the two sides of which are alike either side may fall uppermost and then of the developing shoot the side exposed to the light is under all circumstances the upper side which forms stomata the dark side becomes the under side which produces roothairs and leafy processes53 so that while we have undeniable proof that the contrasted influences of the medium on the two sides initiate the differentiation we have also proof that the completion of it is determined by the transmitted structure of the type since it is impossible to ascribe the development of stomata to the direct action of air and light on turning from foliar expansions to stems and roots facts of like meaning meet us speaking generally of epidermal tissue and inner tissue sachs remarks that the contrast of the two is the plainer the more the part of the plant concerned is exposed to air and light54 elsewhere in correspondence with this it is said that in roots the cells of the epidermis though distinguished by bearing hairs are otherwise similar to those of the fundamental tissue which they clothe55 while the cuticular covering is relatively thin whereas in stems the epidermis often further differentiated is composed of layers of cells which are smaller and thickerwalled a stronger contrast of structure corresponding to a stronger contrast of conditions by way of meeting the suggestion that these respective differences are wholly due to the natural selection of favourable variations it will suffice if i draw attention to the unlikeness between imbedded roots and exposed roots while in darkness and surrounded by moist earth the outermost protective coats even of large roots are comparatively thin but when the accidents of growth entail permanent exposure to light and air roots acquire coverings allied in character to the coverings of branches that the action of the medium causes these and converse changes cannot be doubted when we find on the one hand that roots can become directly transformed into leafbearing shoots and on the other hand that in some plants certain apparent roots are only underground shoots and that nevertheless they are similar to true roots in function and in the formation of tissue but have no rootcap and when they come to the light above ground continue to grow in the manner of ordinary leafshoots56 if then in highly developed plants inheriting pronounced structures this differentiating influence of the medium is so marked it must have been allimportant at the outset while types were undetermined  as with plants so with animals we find good reason for inferring that while the specialities of the tegumentary parts must be ascribed to the natural selection of favourable variations their most general traits are due to the direct action of surrounding agencies here we come upon the border of those changes which are ascribable to use and disuse but from this class of changes we may fitly exclude those in which the parts concerned are wholly or mainly passive a corn and a blister will conveniently serve to illustrate the way in which certain outer actions initiate in the superficial tissues effects of very marked kinds which are related neither to the needs of the organism nor to its normal structure they are neither adaptive changes nor changes towards completion of the type after noting them we may pass to allied but still more instructive changes continuous pressure on any portion of the surface causes absorption while intermittent pressure causes growth the one impeding circulation and the passage of plasma from the capillaries into the tissues and the other aiding both there are yet further mechanicallyproduced effects that the general character of the ribbed skin on the under surfaces of the feet and insides of the hands is directly due to friction and intermittent pressure we have the proofsfirst that the tracts most exposed to rough usage are the most ribbed second that the insides of hands subject to unusual amounts of rough usage as those of sailors are strongly ribbed all over and third that in hands which are very little used the parts commonly ribbed become quite smooth these several kinds of evidence however full of meaning as they are i give simply to prepare the way for evidence of a much more conclusive kind  where a wide ulcer has eaten away the deepseated layer out of which the epidermis grows or where this layer has been destroyed by an extensive burn the process of healing is very significant from the subjacent tissues which in the normal order have no concern with outward growth there is produced a new skin or rather a proskin for this substituted outwardgrowing layer contains no hairfollicles or other specialities of the original one nevertheless it is like the original one in so far that it is a continually renewed protective covering doubtless it may be contended that this makeshift skin results from the inherited proclivity of the typethe tendency to complete afresh the structure of the species when injured we cannot however ignore the immediate influence of the medium on recalling the facts above named or on remembering the further fact that an inflamed surface of skin when not sheltered from the air will throw out a film of coagulable lymph but that the direct action of the medium is a chief factor we are clearly shown by another case accident or disease occasionally causes permanent eversion or protrusion of mucous membrane after a period of irritability great at first but decreasing as the change advances this membrane assumes the general character of ordinary skin nor is this all its microscopic structure changes where it is a mucous membrane of the kind covered by cylinderepithelium the cylinders gradually shorten becoming finally flat and there results a squamous epithelium there is a near approach in minute composition to epidermis here a tendency towards completion of the type cannot be alleged for there is contrariwise divergence from the type the effect of the medium is so great that in a short time it overcomes the inherited proclivity and produces a structure of opposite kind to the normal one  with but little break we come here upon a significant analogy parallel to an analogy already described as was pointed out an inorganic body that is modifiable by its medium acquires after a time an outer coat which has already undergone such change as surrounding agencies can effect has a contained mass which is as yet unchanged because unreached and has a surface between the two where change is going ona region of activity and we saw that alike in the vegetal cell and the animal cell there exist analogous distributions of course with the difference that the innermost part is not inert now we have to note that in those aggregates of cells constituting the metaphyta and metazoa analogous distributions also exist in plants they are of course not to be looked for in leaves and other deciduous portions but only in portions of long durationstems and branches naturally too we need not expect them in plants having modes of growth which early produce an outer practically dead part that effectually shields the inner actively living part of the stem from the influence of the mediumlonglived acrogens such as treeferns and longlived endogens such as palms but in the highest plants exogens which have the actively living part of their stems within reach of environing agencies we find this partthe cambium layeris one from which there is a growth inwards forming wood and a growth outwards forming bark there is an increasingly thick covering where it does not scale off of tissue changed by the medium and inside this a film of highest vitality in so far as concerns the present argument it is the same with the metazoa or at least all of them which have developed organizations the outer skin grows up from a limiting plane or layer a little distance below the surfacea place of predominant vital activity here perpetually arise new cells which as they develop are thrust outwards and form the epidermis flattening and drying up as they approach the surface whence having for a time served to shield the parts below they finally scale off and leave younger ones to take their places this still undifferentiated tissue forming the base of the epidermis and existing also as a source of renewal in internal organs is the essentially living substance and facts above given imply that it was the action of the medium on this essentially living substance which during early stages in the organization of the metazoa initiated that protective envelope which presently became an inherited structurea structure which though now mainly inherited still continues to be modifiable by its initiator  fully to perceive the way in which these evidences compel us to recognize the influence of the medium as a primordial factor we need but conceive them as interpreted without it suppose for instance we say that the structure of the epidermis is wholly determined by the natural selection of favourable variations what must be the position taken in presence of the fact above named that when mucous membrane is exposed to the air its cellstructure changes into the cellstructure of skin the position taken must be thisthough mucous membrane in a highlyevolved individual organism thus shows the powerful effect of the medium on its surface yet we must not suppose that the medium had the effect of producing such a cellstructure on the surfaces of primitive forms undifferentiated though they were or if we suppose that such an effect was produced on them we must not suppose that it was inheritable contrariwise we must suppose that such effect of the medium either was not wrought at all or that it was evanescent though repeated through millions upon millions of generations it left no traces and we must conclude that this skinstructure arose only in consequence of spontaneous variations not physically initiated though like those physically initiated which natural selection laid hold of and increased does any one think this a tenable position                                       and now we approach the last and chief series of morphological phenomena which must be ascribed to the direct action of environing matters and forces these are presented to us when we study the early stages in the development of the embryos of the metazoa in general  we will set out with the fact already noted in passing that after repeated spontaneous fissions have changed the original fertilized germcell into that cluster of cells which forms a gemmule or a primitive ovum the first contrast which arises is between the peripheral parts and the central parts where as with lower creatures which do not lay up large stores of nutriment with the germs of their offspring the inner mass is inconsiderable the outer layer of cells which are presently made quite small by repeated subdivisions forms a membrane extending over the whole surfacethe blastoderm the next stage of development which ends in this covering layer becoming double is reached in two waysby invagination and by delamination but which is the original way and which the abridged way is not quite certain of invagination multitudinously exemplified in the lowest types mr balfour sayson purely à priori grounds there is in my opinion more to be said for invagination than for any other view57 and for present purposes it will suffice if we limit ourselves to this making its nature clear to the general reader by a simple illustration  take a small indiarubber ballnot of the inflated kind nor of the solid kind but of the kind about an inch or so in diameter with a small hole through which under pressure the air escapes suppose that instead of consisting of indiarubber its wall consists of small cells made polyhedral in form by mutual pressure and united together this will represent the blastoderm now with the finger thrust in one side of the ball until it touches the other so making a cup this action will stand for the process of invagination imagine that by continuance of it the hemispherical cup becomes very much deepened and the opening narrowed until the cup becomes a sac of which the introverted wall is everywhere in contact with the outer wall this will represent the twolayered gastrulathe simplest ancestral form of the metazoa a form which is permanently represented in some of the lowest types for it needs but tentacles round the mouth of the sac to produce a common hydra here the fact which it chiefly concerns us to remark is that of these two layers the outer called in embryological language the epiblast continues to carry on direct converse with the forces and matters in the environment while the inner called the hypoblast comes in contact with such only of these matters as are put into the foodcavity which it lines we have further to note that in the embryos of metazoa at all advanced in organization there arises between these two layers a thirdthe mesoblast the origin of this is seen in types where the developmental process is not obscured by the presence of a large foodyolk while the abovedescribed introversion is taking place and before the inner surfaces of the resulting epiblast and hypoblast have come into contact cells or amoeboid units equivalent to them are budded off from one or both of these inner surfaces or some part of one or other and these form a layer which eventually lies between the other twoa layer which as this mode of formation implies never has any converse with the surrounding medium and its contents or with the nutritive bodies taken in from it the striking facts to which this description is a necessary introduction may now be stated from the outer layer or epiblast are developed the permanent epidermis and its outgrowths the nervous system and the organs of sense from the introverted layer or hypoblast are developed the alimentary canal and those parts of its appended organs liver pancreas c which are concerned in delivering their secretions into the alimentary canal as well as the linings of those ramifying tubes in the lungs which convey air to the places where gaseous exchange is effected and from the mesoblast originate the bones the muscles the heart and bloodvessels and the lymphatics together with such parts of various internal organs as are most remotely concerned with the outer world minor qualifications being admitted there remain the broad general facts that out of that part of the external layer which remains permanently external are developed all the structures which carry on intercourse with the medium and its contents active and passive out of the introverted part of this external layer are developed the structures which carry on intercourse with the quasiexternal substances that are taken into the interiorsolid food water and air while out of the mesoblast are developed structures which have never had from first to last any intercourse with the environment let us contemplate these general facts  who would have imagined that the nervous system is a modified portion of the primitive epidermis in the absence of proofs furnished by the concurrent testimony of embryologists during the last thirty or forty years who would have believed that the brain arises from an infolded tract of the outer skin which sinking down beneath the surface becomes imbedded in other tissues and eventually surrounded by a bony case yet the human nervous system in common with the nervous systems of lower animals is thus originated in the words of mr balfour early embryological changes imply that       the functions of the central nervous system which were originally      taken by the whole skin became gradually concentrated in a special      part of the skin which was step by step removed from the surface      and has finally become in the higher types a welldefined organ      imbedded in the subdermal tissues the embryological evidence      shows that the ganglioncells of the central part of the nervous      system are originally derived from the simple undifferentiated      epithelial cells of the surface of the body58  less startling perhaps though still startling enough is the fact that the eye is evolved out of a portion of the skin and that while the crystalline lens and its surroundings thus originate the percipient portions of the organs of special sense especially of optic organs are often formed from the same part of the primitive epidermis which forms the central nervous system59 similarly is it with the organs for smelling and hearing these too begin as sacs formed by infoldings of the epidermis and while their parts are developing they are joined from within by nervous structures which were themselves epidermic in origin how are we to interpret these strange transformations observing as we pass how absurd from the point of view of the specialcreationist would appear such a filiation of structures and such a roundabout mode of embryonic development we have here to remark that the process is not one to have been anticipated as a result of natural selection after numbers of spontaneous variations had occurred as the hypothesis implies in useless ways the variation which primarily initiated a nervous centre might reasonably have been expected to occur in some internal part where it would be fitly located its initiation in a dangerous place and subsequent migration to a safe place would be incomprehensible not so if we bear in mind the cardinal truth above set forth that the structures for holding converse with the medium and its contents arise in that completely superficial part which is directly affected by the medium and its contents and if we draw the inference that the external actions themselves initiate the structures these once commenced and furthered by natural selection where favourable to life would form the first term of a series ending in developed sense organs and a developed nervous system60  though it would enforce the argument i must for brevitys sake pass over the analogous evolution of that introverted layer or hypoblast out of which the alimentary canal and attached organs arise it will suffice to emphasize the fact that having been originally external this layer continues in its developed form to have a quasiexternality alike in its digesting part and in its respiratory part since it continues to deal with matters alien to the organism i must also refrain from dwelling at length on the fact already adverted to that the intermediate derived layer or mesoblast which was at the outset completely internal originates those structures which ever remain completely internal and have no communication with the environment save through the structures developed from the other two an antithesis which has great significance  here instead of dwelling on these details it will be better to draw attention to the most general aspect of the facts whatever may be the course of subsequent changes the first change is the formation of a superficial layer or blastoderm and by whatever series of transformations the adult structure is reached it is from the blastoderm that all the organs forming the adult originate why this marvellous fact  meaning is given to it if we go back to the first stage in which protozoa having by repeated fissions formed a cluster then arranged themselves into a hollow sphere as do the protophytes forming a volvox originally alike all over its surface the hollow sphere of ciliated units thus formed would if not quite spherical assume a constant attitude when moving through the water and hence one part of the spheroid would more frequently than the rest come in contact with nutritive matters to be taken in a division of labour resulting from such a variation being advantageous and tending therefore to increase in descendants would end in a differentiation like that shown in the gemmules of various low types of metazoa which ovate in shape are ciliated over one part of the surface only there would arise a form in which the ciliumbearing units effected locomotion and aeration while on the others assuming an amoebalike character devolved the function of absorbing food a primordial specialization variously indicated by evidence61 just noting that an ancestral origin of this kind is implied by the fact that in low types of metazoa a hollow sphere of cells is the form first assumed by the unfolding embryo i draw attention to the point here of chief interest namely that the primary differentiation of this hollow sphere is in such case determined by a difference in the converse of its parts with the medium and its contents and that the subsequent invagination arises by a continuance of this differential converse  even neglecting this first stage and commencing with the next in which a gastrula has been produced by the permanent introversion of one portion of the surface of the hollow sphere it will suffice if we consider what must thereafter have happened that which continued to be the outer surface was the part which from time to time touched quiescent masses and occasionally received the collisions consequent on its own motions or the motions of other things it was the part to receive the soundvibrations occasionally propagated through the water the part to be affected more strongly than any other by those variations in the amounts of light caused by the passing of small bodies close to it and the part which met those diffused molecules constituting odours that is to say from the beginning the surface was the part on which there fell the various influences pervading the environment the part by which there was received those impressions from the environment serving for the guidance of actions and the part which had to bear the mechanical reactions consequent upon such actions necessarily therefore the surface was the part in which were initiated the various instrumentalities for carrying on intercourse with the environment to suppose otherwise is to suppose that such instrumentalities arose internally where they could neither be operated on by surrounding agencies nor operate on themwhere the differentiating forces did not come into play and the differentiated structures had nothing to do and it is to suppose that meanwhile the parts directly exposed to the differentiating forces remained unchanged clearly then organization could not but begin on the surface and having thus begun its subsequent course could not but be determined by its superficial origin and hence these remarkable facts showing us that individual evolution is accomplished by successive infoldings and ingrowings doubtless natural selection soon came into action as for example in the removal of the rudimentary nervous centres from the surface since an individual in which they were a little more deeply seated would be less likely to be incapacitated by injury of them and so in multitudinous other ways but nevertheless as we here see natural selection could operate only under subjection it could do no more than take advantage of those structural changes which the medium and its contents initiated  see then how large has been the part played by this primordial factor had it done no more than give to protozoa and protophyta that cellform which characterizes themhad it done no more than entail the cellular composition which is so remarkable a trait of metazoa and metaphytahad it done no more than cause the repetition in all visible animals and plants of that primary differentiation of outer from inner which it first wrought in animals and plants invisible to the naked eye it would have done much towards giving to organisms of all kinds certain leading traits but it has done more than this by causing the first differentiations of those clusters of units out of which visible animals in general arose it fixed the starting place for organization and therefore determined the course of organization and doing this gave indelible traits to embryonic transformations and to adult structures                                       though mainly carried on after the inductive method the argument at the close of the foregoing section has passed into the deductive here let us follow for a space the deductive method pure and simple doubtless in biology à priori reasoning is dangerous but there can be no danger in considering whether its results coincide with those reached by reasoning à posteriori  biologists in general agree that in the present state of the world no such thing happens as the rise of a living creature out of nonliving matter they do not deny however that at a remote period in the past when the temperature of the earths surface was much higher than at present and other physical conditions were unlike those we know inorganic matter through successive complications gave origin to organic matter so many substances once supposed to belong exclusively to living bodies have now been formed artificially that men of science scarcely question the conclusion that there are conditions under which by yet another step of composition quaternary compounds of lower types pass into those of highest types that there once took place gradual divergence of the organic from the inorganic is indeed a necessary implication of the hypothesis of evolution taken as a whole and if we accept it as a whole we must put to ourselves the questionwhat were the early stages of progress which followed after the most complex form of matter had arisen out of forms of matter a degree less complex  at first protoplasm could have had no proclivities to one or other arrangement of parts unless indeed a purely mechanical proclivity towards a spherical form when suspended in a liquid at the outset it must have been passive in respect of its passivity primitive organic matter must have been like inorganic matter no such thing as spontaneous variation could have occurred in it for variation implies some habitual course of change from which it is a divergence and is therefore excluded where there is no habitual course of change in the absence of that cyclical series of metamorphoses which even the simplest living thing now shows us as a result of its inherited constitution there could be no point dappui for natural selection how then did organic evolution begin  if a primitive mass of organic matter was like a mass of inorganic matter in respect of its passivity and differed only in respect of its greater changeableness then we must infer that its first changes conformed to the same general law as do the changes of an inorganic mass the instability of the homogeneous is a universal principle in all cases the homogeneous tends to pass into the heterogeneous and the less heterogeneous into the more heterogeneous in the primordial units of protoplasm then the step with which evolution commenced must have been the passage from a state of complete likeness throughout the mass to a state in which there existed some unlikeness further the cause of this step in one of these portions of organic matter as in any portion of inorganic matter must have been the different exposure of its parts to incident forces what incident forces those of its medium or environment which were the parts thus differently exposed necessarily the outside and the inside inevitably then alike in the organic aggregate and the inorganic aggregate supposing it to have coherence enough to maintain constant relative positions among its parts the first fall from homogeneity to heterogeneity must always have been the differentiation of the external surface from the internal contents no matter whether the modification was physical or chemical one of composition or of decomposition it comes within the same generalization the direct action of the medium was the primordial factor of organic evolution                                       and now finally let us look at the factors in their ensemble and consider the respective parts they play observing especially the ways in which at successive stages they severally give place one to another in degree of importance  acting alone the primordial factor must have initiated the primary differentiation in all units of protoplasm alike i say alike but i must forthwith qualify the word for since surrounding influences physical and chemical could not be absolutely the same in all places especially when the first rudiments of living things had spread over a considerable area there necessarily arose small contrasts between the degrees and kinds of superficial differentiation effected as soon as these became decided natural selection came into play for inevitably the unlikenesses produced among the units had effects on their lives there was survival of some among the modified forms rather than others utterly in the dark though we are respecting the causes which set up that process of fission everywhere occurring among the minutest forms of life we must infer that when established it furthered the spread of those which were most favourably differentiated by the medium though natural selection must have become increasingly active when once it had got a start yet the differentiating action of the medium never ceased to be a cooperator in the development of these first animals and plants again taking the lead as there arose the composite forms of animals and plants and again losing the lead with that advancing differentiation of these higher types which gave more scope to natural selection it nevertheless continued and must ever continue to be a cause both direct and indirect of modifications in structure  along with that remarkable process which beginning in minute forms with what is called conjugation developed into sexual generation there came into play causes of frequent and marked fortuitous variations the mixtures of constitutional proclivities made more or less unlike by unlikenesses of physical conditions inevitably led to occasional concurrences of forces producing deviations of structure these were of course mostly suppressed but sometimes increased by survival of the fittest when along with the growing multiplication in forms of life conflict and competition became continually more active fortuitous variations of structure of no account in the converse with the medium became of much account in the struggle with enemies and competitors and natural selection of such variations became the predominant factor especially throughout the plantworld its action appears to have been immensely the most important and throughout that large part of the animal world characterized by relative inactivity the survival of individuals that had varied in favourable ways must all along have been the chief cause of the divergence of species and the occasional production of higher ones  but gradually with that increase of activity which we see on ascending to successively higher grades of animals and especially with that increased complexity of life which we also see there came more and more into play as a factor the inheritance of those modifications of structure caused by modifications of function eventually among creatures of high organization this factor became an important one and i think there is reason to conclude that in the case of the highest of creatures civilized men among whom the kinds of variation which affect survival are too multitudinous to permit easy selection of any one and among whom survival of the fittest is greatly interfered with it has become the chief factor such aid as survival of the fittest gives being usually limited to the preservation of those in whom the totality of the faculties has been most favourably moulded by functional changes  of course this sketch of the relations among the factors must be taken as in large measure a speculation we are now too far removed from the beginnings of life to obtain data for anything more than tentative conclusions respecting its earliest stages especially in the absence of any clue to the mode in which multiplication first agamogenetic and then gamogenetic was initiated but it has seemed to me not amiss to present this general conception by way of showing how the deductive interpretation harmonizes with the several inferences reached by induction                                       in his article on evolution in the encyclopædia britannica professor huxley writes as follows       how far natural selection suffices for the production of      species remains to be seen few can doubt that if not the whole      cause it is a very important factor in that operation on the      evidence of palæontology the evolution of many existing forms of      animal life from their predecessors is no longer an hypothesis but      an historical fact it is only the nature of the physiological      factors to which that evolution is due which is still open to      discussion  with these passages i may fitly join a remark made in the admirable address prof huxley delivered before unveiling the statue of mr darwin in the museum at south kensington deprecating the supposition that an authoritative sanction was given by the ceremony to the current ideas concerning organic evolution he said that science commits suicide when it adopts a creed  along with larger motives one motive which has joined in prompting the foregoing articles has been the desire to point out that already among biologists the beliefs concerning the origin of species have assumed too much the character of a creed and that while becoming settled they have been narrowed so far from further broadening that broader view which mr darwin reached as he grew older his followers appear to have retrograded towards a more restricted view than he ever expressed thus there seems occasion for recognizing the warning uttered by prof huxley as not uncalled for  whatever may be thought of the arguments and conclusions set forth in this article and the preceding one they will perhaps serve to show that it is as yet far too soon to close the inquiry concerning the causes of organic evolution   note      the following passages formed part of a preface to the small     volume in which the foregoing essay reappeared i append them here     as they cannot now be conveniently prefixed  though the direct bearings of the arguments contained in this essay are biological the argument contained in its first half has indirect bearings upon psychology ethics and sociology my belief in the profound importance of these indirect bearings was originally a chief prompter to set forth the argument and it now prompts me to reissue it in permanent form  though mental phenomena of many kinds and especially of the simpler kinds are explicable only as resulting from the natural selection of favourable variations yet there are i believe still more numerous mental phenomena including all those of any considerable complexity which cannot be explained otherwise than as results of the inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications what theory of psychological evolution is espoused thus depends on acceptance or rejection of the doctrine that not only in the individual but in the successions of individuals use and disuse of parts produce respectively increase and decrease of them  of course there are involved the conceptions we form of the genesis and nature of our higher emotions and by implication the conceptions we form of our moral intuitions if functionallyproduced modifications are inheritable then the mental associations habitually produced in individuals by experiences of the relations between actions and their consequences pleasurable or painful may in the successions of individuals generate innate tendencies to like or dislike such actions but if not the genesis of such tendencies is as we shall see not satisfactorily explicable  that our sociological beliefs must also be profoundly affected by the conclusions we draw on this point is obvious if a nation is modified en masse by transmission of the effects produced on the natures of its members by those modes of daily activity which its institutions and circumstances involve then we must infer that such institutions and circumstances mould its members far more rapidly and comprehensively than they can do if the solo cause of adaptation to them is the more frequent survival of individuals who happen to have varied in favourable ways  i will add only that considering the width and depth of the effects which acceptance of one or other of these hypotheses must have on our views of life mind morals and politics the questionwhich of them is true demands beyond all other questions whatever the attention of scientific men                                       after the above articles were published i received from dr downes a copy of a paper on the influence of light on protoplasm written by himself and mr tp blunt ma which was communicated to the royal society in 1878 it was a continuation of a preceding paper which referring chiefly to bacteria contended that       light is inimical to and under favourable conditions may wholly      prevent the development of these organisms  this supplementary paper goes on to show that the injurious effect of light upon protoplasm results only in presence of oxygen taking first a comparatively simple type of molecule which enters into the composition of organic matter the authors say after detailing experiments       it was evident therefore that oxygen was the agent of      destruction under the influence of sunlight  and accounts of experiments upon minute organisms are followed by the sentence       it seemed therefore that in absence of an atmosphere light      failed entirely to produce any effect on such organisms as were      able to appear  they sum up the results of their experiments in the paragraph       we conclude therefore both from analogy and from direct      experiment that the observed action on these organisms is not      dependent on light per se but that the presence of free oxygen      is necessary light and oxygen together accomplishing what neither      can do alone and the inference seems irresistible that the effect      produced is a gradual oxidation of the constituent protoplasm of      these organisms and that in this respect protoplasm although      living is not exempt from laws which appear to govern the      relations of light and oxygen to forms of matter less highly      endowed a force which is indirectly absolutely essential to life      as we know it and matter in the absence of which life has not yet      been proved to exist here unite for its destruction  what is the obvious implication if oxygen in presence of light destroys one of these minutest portions of protoplasm what will be its effect on a larger portion of protoplasm it will work an effect on the surface instead of on the whole mass not like the minutest mass made inert all through the larger mass will be made inert only on its outside and indeed the like will happen with the minutest mass if the light or the oxygen is very small in quantity hence there will result an envelope of changed matter inclosing and protecting the unchanged protoplasmthere will result a rudimentary cellwall  footnotes  footnote 41 it is probable that this shortening has resulted not directly but indirectly from the selection of individuals which were noted for tenacity of hold for the bulldogs peculiarity in this respect seems due to relative shortness of the upper jaw giving the underhung structure which involving retreat of the nostrils enables the dog to continue breathing while holding  footnote 42 though mr darwin approved of this expression and occasionally employed it he did not adopt it for general use contending very truly that the expression natural selection is in some cases more convenient see animals and plants under domestication first edition vol i p 6 and origin of species sixth edition p 49  footnote 43 it is true that while not deliberately admitted by mr darwin these effects are not denied by him in his animals and plants under domestication vol ii 281 he refers to certain chapters in the principles of biology in which i have discussed this general interaction of the medium and the organism and ascribed certain most general traits to it but though by his expressions he implies a sympathetic attention to the argument he does not in such way adopt the conclusion as to assign to this factor any share in the genesis of organic structuresmuch less that large share which i believe it has had i did not myself at that time nor indeed until quite recently see how extensive and profound have been the influences on organization which as we shall presently see are traceable to the early results of this fundamental relation between organism and medium i may add that it is in an essay on transcendental physiology first published in 1857 that the line of thought here followed out in its wider bearings

february 1888   while i do not concur in sundry of the statements and conclusions contained in the article entitled a great confession contributed by the duke of argyll to the last number of this review yet i am obliged to him for having raised afresh the question discussed in it though the injunction rest and be thankful is one for which in many spheres much may be saidespecially in the political where undue restlessness is proving very mischievous yet rest and be thankful is an injunction out of place in science unhappily while politicians have not duly regarded it it appears to have been taken to heart too much by naturalists in so far at least as concerns the question of the origin of species  the new biological orthodoxy behaves just as the old biological orthodoxy did in the days before darwin those who occupied themselves with the phenomena of life passed by with unobservant eyes the multitudinous facts which point to an evolutionary origin for plants and animals and they turned deaf ears to those who insisted on the significance of these facts now that they have come to believe in this evolutionary origin and have at the same time accepted the hypothesis that natural selection has been the sole cause of the evolution they are similarly unobservant of the multitudinous facts which cannot rationally be ascribed to that cause and turn deaf ears to those who would draw their attention to them the attitude is the same it is only the creed which has changed  but as above implied though the protest of the duke of argyll against this attitude is quite justifiable it seems to me that many of his statements cannot be sustained some of these concern me personally and others are of impersonal concern i propose to deal with them in the order in which they occur                                       on page 144 the duke of argyll quotes me as omitting for the present any consideration of a factor which may be distinguished as primordial and he represents me as implying by this that darwins ultimate conception of some primordial breathing of the breath of life is a conception which can be omitted only for the present even had there been no other obvious interpretation it would have been a somewhat rash assumption that this was my meaning when referring to an omitted factor and it is surprising that this assumption should have been made after reading the second of the two articles criticised in which this factor omitted from the first is dealt with this omitted third factor being the direct physicochemical action of the medium on the organism such a thought as that which the duke of argyll ascribes to me is so incongruous with the beliefs i have in many places expressed that the ascription of it never occurred to me as possible  lower down on the same page are some other sentences having personal implications which i must dispose of before going into the general question the duke says it is more than doubtful whether any value attaches to the new factor with which he i desires to supplement it natural selection and he thinks it unaccountable that i should make so great a fuss about so small a matter as the effect of use and disuse of particular organs as a separate and a newlyrecognised factor in the development of varieties i do not suppose that the duke of argyll intended to cast upon me the disagreeable imputation that i claim as new that which all who are even slightly acquainted with the facts know to be anything rather than new but his words certainly do this how he should have thus written in spite of the extensive knowledge of the matter which he evidently has and how he should have thus written in presence of the evidence contained in the articles he criticizes i cannot understand naturalists and multitudes besides naturalists know that the hypothesis which i am represented as putting forward as new is much older than the hypothesis of natural selectiongoes back at least as far as dr erasmus darwin my purpose was to bring into the foreground again a factor which has i think been of late years improperly ignored to show that mr darwin recognized this factor in an increasing degree as he grew older by showing which i should have thought i sufficiently excluded the supposition that i brought it forward as new to give further evidence that this factor is in operation to show there are numerous phenomena which cannot be interpreted without it and to argue that if proved operative in any case it may be inferred that it is operative on all structures having active functions  strangely enough this passage in which i am represented as implying novelty in a doctrine which i have merely sought to emphasize and extend is immediately succeeded by a passage in which the duke of argyll himself represents the doctrine as being familiar and well established       that organs thus enfeebled ie by persistent disuse are      transmitted by inheritance to offspring in a like condition of      functional and structural decline is a correlated physiological      doctrine not generally disputed the converse caseof increased      strength and development arising out of the habitual and healthy      use of special organs and of the transmission of these to      offspringis a case illustrated by many examples in the breeding      of domestic animals i do not know to what else we can attribute      the long slender legs and bodies of greyhounds so manifestly      adapted to speed of foot or the delicate powers of smell in      pointers and setters or a dozen cases of modified structure      effected by artificial selection  in none of the assertions contained in this passage can i agree had the inheritance of functional and structural decline been not generally disputed half my argument would have been needless and had the inheritance of increased strength and development caused by use been recognized as illustrated by many examples the other half of my argument would have been needless but both are disputed and if not positively denied are held to be unproved greyhounds and pointers do not yield valid evidence because their peculiarities are more due to artificial selection than to any other cause it may indeed be doubted whether greyhounds use their legs more than other dogs dogs of all kinds are daily in the habit of running about and chasing one another at the top of their speedother dogs more frequently than greyhounds which are not much given to play the occasions on which greyhounds exercise their legs in chasing hares occupy but inconsiderable spaces in their lives and can play but small parts in developing their legs and then how about their long heads and sharp noses are these developed by running the structure of the greyhound is explicable as a result mainly of selection of variations occasionally arising from unknown causes but it is inexplicable otherwise still more obviously invalid is the evidence said to be furnished by pointers and setters how can these be said to exercise their organs of smell more than other dogs do not all dogs occupy themselves in sniffing about here and there all day long tracing animals of their own kind and of other kinds instead of admitting that the olfactory sense is more exercised in pointers and setters than in other dogs it might contrariwise be contended that it is exercised less seeing that during the greater parts of their lives they are shut up in kennels where the varieties of odours on which to practise their noses is but small clearly if breeders of sporting dogs have from early days habitually bred from those puppies of each litter which had the keenest noses and it is undeniable that the puppies of each litter are made different from one another as are the children in each human family by unknown combinations of causes then the existence of such remarkable powers in pointers and setters may be accounted for while it is otherwise unaccountable these instances and many others such i should have gladly used in support of my argument had they been available but unfortunately they are not  on the next page of the duke of argylls article page 145 occurs a passage which i must quote at length before i can deal effectually with its various statements it runs as follows       but if natural selection is a mere phrase vague enough and wide      enough to cover any number of the physical causes concerned in      ordinary generation then the whole of mr spencers laborious      argument in favour of his other factor becomes an argument worse      than superfluous it is wholly fallacious in assuming that this      factor and natural selection are at all exclusive of or even      separate from each other the factor thus assumed to be new is      simply one of the subordinate cases of heredity but heredity is      the central idea of natural selection therefore natural selection      includes and covers all the causes which can possibly operate      through inheritance there is thus no difficulty whatever in      referring it to the same one factor whose solitary dominion mr      spencer has plucked up courage to dispute he will never succeed in      shaking its dictatorship by such a small rebellion his little      contention is like some bit of bumbledom setting up for home      rulesome parochial vestry claiming independence of a universal      empire it pretends to set up for itself in some fragment of an      idea but here is not even a fragment to boast of or to stand up      for his new factor in organic evolution has neither independence      nor novelty mr spencer is able to quote himself as having      mentioned it in his principles of biology published some twenty      years ago and by a careful ransacking of darwin he shows that the      idea was familiar to and admitted by him at least in his last      edition of the origin of species darwin was a man so much      wiser than all his followers c  had there not been the duke of argylls signature to the article i could scarcely have believed that this passage was written by him remembering that on reading his article in the preceding number of this review i was struck by the extent of knowledge clearness of discrimination and power of exposition displayed in it i can scarcely understand how there has come from the same pen a passage in which none of these traits are exhibited even one wholly unacquainted with the subject may see in the last two sentences of the above extract how strangely its propositions are strung together while in the first of them i am represented as bringing forward a new factor i am in the second represented as saying that i mentioned it twenty years ago in the same breath i am described as claiming it as new and asserting it as old so again the uninstructed reader on comparing the first words of the extract with the last will be surprised on seeing in a scientific article statements so manifestly wanting in precision if natural selection is a mere phrase how can mr darwin who thought it explained the origin of species be regarded as wise surely it must be more than a mere phrase if it is the key to so many otherwise inexplicable facts these examples of incongruous thoughts i give to prepare the way and will now go on to examine the chief propositions which the quoted passage contains  the duke of argyll says that heredity is the central idea of natural selection now it would i think be concluded that those who possess the central idea of a thing have some consciousness of the thing yet men have possessed the idea of heredity for any number of generations and have been quite unconscious of natural selection clearly the statement is misleading it might just as truly be said that the occurrence of structural variations in organisms is the central idea of natural selection and it might just as truly be said that the action of external agencies in killing some individuals and fostering others is the central idea of natural selection no such assertions are correct the process has three factorsheredity variation and external actionany one of which being absent the process ceases the conception contains three corresponding ideas and if any one be struck out the conception cannot be framed no one of them is the central idea but they are coessential ideas  from the erroneous belief that heredity is the central idea of natural selection the duke of argyll draws the conclusion consequently erroneous that natural selection includes and covers all the causes which can possibly operate through inheritance had he considered the cases which in the principles of biology i have cited to illustrate the inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications he would have seen that his inference is far from correct i have instanced the decrease of the jaw among civilized men as a change of structure which cannot have been produced by the inheritance of spontaneous or fortuitous variations that changes of structure arising from such variations may be maintained and increased in successive generations it is needful that the individuals in whom they occur shall derive from them advantages in the struggle for existenceadvantages too sufficiently great to aid their survival and multiplication in considerable degrees but a decrease of jaw reducing its weight by even an ounce which would be a large variation cannot by either smaller weight carried or smaller nutrition required have appreciably advantaged any person in the battle of life even supposing such diminution of jaw to be beneficial and in the resulting decay of teeth it entails great evils the benefit can hardly have been such as to increase the relative multiplication of families in which it occurred generation after generation unless it has done this however decreased size of the jaw cannot have been produced by the natural selection of favourable variations how can it then have been produced only by decreased functionby the habitual use of soft food joined probably with disuse of the teeth as tools and now mark that this cause operates on all members of a society which falls into civilized habits generation after generation this decreased function changes its component families simultaneously natural selection does not cover the case at allhas nothing to do with it and the like happens in multitudinous other cases every species spreading into a new habitat coming in contact with new food exposed to a different temperature to a drier or moister air to a more irregular surface to a new soil c c has its members one and all subject to various changed actions which influence its muscular vascular respiratory digestive and other systems of organs if there is inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications then all its members will transmit the structural alterations wrought in them and the species will change as a whole without the supplanting of some stocks by others doubtless in respect of certain changes natural selection will cooperate if the species being a predacious one is brought by migration into the presence of prey of greater speed than before then while all its members will have their limbs strengthened by extra action those in whom this muscular adaptation is greatest will have their multiplication furthered and inheritance of the functionallyincreased structures will be aided in successive generations by survival of the fittest but it cannot be so with the multitudinous minor changes entailed by the modified life the majority of these must be of such relative unimportance that one of them cannot give to the individual in which it becomes most marked advantages which predominate over kindred advantages gained by other individuals from other changes more favourably wrought in them in respect to these the inherited effects of use and disuse must accumulate independently of natural selection  to make clear the relations of these two factors to one another and to heredity let us take a case in which the operations of all three may be severally identified and distinguished  here is one of those persons occasionally met with who has an additional finger on each hand and who we will suppose is a blacksmith he is neither aided nor much hindered by these additional fingers but by constant use he has greatly developed the muscles of his right arm to avoid a perturbing factor we will assume that his wife too exercises her arms in an unusual degree keeps a mangle and has all the custom of the neighbourhood such being the circumstances let us ask what are the established facts and what are the beliefs and disbeliefs of biologists  the first fact is that this sixfingered blacksmith will be likely to transmit his peculiarity to some of his children and some of these again to theirs it is proved that even in the absence of a like peculiarity in the other parent this strange variation of structure which we must ascribe to some fortuitous combination of causes is often inherited for more than one generation now the causes which produce this persistent sixfingeredness are unquestionably causes which operate through inheritance the duke of argyll says that natural selection includes and covers all the causes which can possibly operate through inheritance how does it cover the causes which operate here natural selection never comes into play at all there is no fostering of this peculiarity since it does not help in the struggle for existence and there is no reason to suppose it is such a hindrance in the struggle that those who have it disappear in consequence it simply gets cancelled in the course of generations by the adverse influences of other stocks  while biologists admit or rather assert that the peculiarity in the blacksmiths arm which was born with him is transmissible they deny or rather do not admit that the other peculiarities of his arm induced by daily labourits large muscles and strengthened bonesare transmissible they say that there is no proof the duke of argyll thinks that the inheritance of organs enfeebled by disuse is not generally disputed and he thinks there is clear proof that the converse changeincrease of size consequent on useis also inherited but biologists dispute both of these alleged kinds of inheritance if proof is wanted it will be found in the proceedings at the last meeting of the british association in a paper entitled are acquired characters hereditary by professor ray lankester and in the discussion raised by that paper had this form of inheritance been as the duke of argyll says not generally disputed i should not have written the first of the two articles he criticizes  but supposing it proved as it may hereafter be that such a functionallyproduced change of structure as the blacksmiths arm shows us is transmissible the persistent inheritance is again of a kind with which natural selection has nothing to do if the greatly strengthened arm enabled the blacksmith and his descendants having like strengthened arms to carry on the battle of life in a much more successful way than it was carried on by other men survival of the fittest would ensure the maintenance and increase of this trait in successive generations but the skill of the carpenter enables him to earn quite as much as his stronger neighbour by the various arts he has been taught the plumber gets as large a weekly wage the small shopkeeper by his foresight in buying and prudence in selling the villageschoolmaster by his knowledge the farmbailiff by his diligence and care succeed in the struggle for existence equally well the advantage of a strong arm does not predominate over the advantages which other men gain by their innate or acquired powers of other kinds and therefore natural selection cannot operate so as to increase the trait before it can be increased it is neutralized by the unions of those who have it with those who have other traits to whatever extent therefore inheritance of this functionallyproduced modification operates it operates independently of natural selection  one other point has to be notedthe relative importance of this factor if additional developments of muscles and bones may be transmittedif as mr darwin held there are various other structural modifications caused by use and disuse which imply inheritance of this kindif acquired characters are hereditary as the duke of argyll believes then the area over which this factor of organic evolution operates is enormous not every muscle only but every nerve and nervecentre every bloodvessel every viscus and nearly every bone may be increased or decreased by its influence excepting parts which have passive functions such as dermal appendages and the bones which form the skull the implication is that nearly every organ in the body may be modified in successive generations by the augmented or diminished activity required of it and save in the few cases where the change caused is one which conduces to survival in a preeminent degree it will be thus modified independently of natural selection though this factor can operate but little in the vegetal world and can play but a subordinate part in the lowest animal world yet seeing that all the active organs of all animals are subject to its influence it has an immense sphere the duke of argyll compares the claim made for this factor to some bit of bumbledom setting up for home rulesome parochial vestry claiming independence of a universal empire but far from this the claim made for it is to an empire less indeed than that of natural selection and over a small part of which natural selection exercises concurrent power but of which the independent part has an area that is immense  it seems to me then that the duke of argyll is mistaken in four of the propositions contained in the passages i have quoted the inheritance of acquired characters is disputed by biologists though he thinks it is not it is not true that heredity is the central idea of natural selection the statement that natural selection includes and covers all the causes which can possibly operate through inheritance is quite erroneous and if the inheritance of acquired characters is a factor at all the dominion it rules over is not insignificant but vast                                       here i must break off after dealing with a page and a half of the duke of argylls article a state of health which has prevented me from publishing anything since the factors of organic evolution now nearly two years ago prevents me from carrying the matter further could i have pursued the argument it would i believe have been practicable to show that various other positions taken up by the duke of argyll do not admit of effectual defence but whether or not this is probable the reader must be left to judge for himself on one further point only will i say a word and this chiefly because if i pass it by a mistaken impression of a serious kind may be diffused the duke of argyll represents me as giving up the famous phrase survival of the fittest and wishing to abandon it he does this because i have pointed out that its words have connotations against which we must be on our guard if we would avoid certain distortions of thought with equal propriety he might say that an astronomer abandons the statement that the planets move in elliptic orbits because he warns his readers that in the heavens there exist no such things as orbits but that the planets sweep on through a pathless void in directions perpetually changed by gravitation  i regret that i should have had thus to dissent so entirely from various of the statements made and conclusions drawn by the duke of argyll because as i have already implied i think he has done good service by raising afresh the question he has dealt with though the advantages which he hopes may result from the discussion are widely unlike the advantages which i hope may result from it yet we agree in the belief that advantages may be looked for   end of vol i
