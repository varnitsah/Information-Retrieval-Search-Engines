96497169	stella fregelius  a tale of three destinies   by h rider haggard   first published 1904          felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas      atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum      subjecit pedibus strepitumque acherontis avari     dedication  my dear john berwick  when you read her history in ms you thought well of stella fregelius and urged her introduction to the world therefore i ask you my severe and accomplished critic to accept the burden of a book for which you are to some extent responsible whatever its fate at least it has pleased you and therefore has not been written quite in vain  h rider haggard  ditchingham  25th august 1903     authors note  the author feels that he owes some apology to his readers for his boldness in offering to them a modest story which is in no sense a romance of the character that perhaps they expect from him which has moreover few exciting incidents and no climax of the accustomed order since the end of it only indicates its real beginning  his excuse must be that in the first instance he wrote it purely to please himself and now publishes it in the hope that it may please some others the problem of such a conflict common enough mayhap did we but know it between a departed and a present personality of which the battleground is a bereaved human heart and the prize its complete possession between earthly duty and spiritual desire also was one that had long attracted him finding at length a few months of leisure he treated the difficult theme not indeed as he would have wished to do but as best he could  he may explain further that when he drafted this book now some five years ago instruments of the nature of the aerophone were not so much talked of as they are today in fact this aerophone has little to do with his characters or their history and the main motive of its introduction to his pages was to suggest how powerless are all such material means to bring within mortal reach the transcendental and unearthly ends which with their aid were attempted by morris monk  these as that dreamer learned must be far otherwise obtained whether in truth and spirit or perchance in visions only  1903      stella fregelius    chapter i  morris mary and the aerophone  above the sky seemed one vast arc of solemn blue set here and there with points of tremulous fire below to the shadowy horizon stretched the plain of the soft grey sea while from the fragrances of night and earth floated a breath of sleep and flowers  a man leaned on the low wall that bordered the cliff edge and looked at sea beneath and sky above then he contemplated the horizon and murmured some line heard or learnt in childhood ending where earth and heaven meet  but they only seem to meet he reflected to himself idly if i sailed to that spot they would be as wide apart as ever yes the stars would be as silent and as far away and the sea quite as restless and as salt yet there must be a place where they do meet no morris my friend there is no such place in this world material or moral so stick to facts and leave fancies alone  but that night this speculative man felt in the mood for fancies for presently he was staring at one of the constellations and saying to himself why not well why not granted force can travel through etherwhatever ether iswhy should it stop travelling give it time enough a few seconds or a few minutes or a few years and why should it not reach that star very likely it does only there it wastes itself what would be needed to make it serviceable simply thisthat on the star there should dwell an intelligence armed with one of my instruments when i have perfected them or the secret of them then who knows what might happen and he laughed a little to himself at the vagary  from all of which wandering speculations it may be gathered that morris monk was that rather common yet problematical person an inventor who dreamed dreams  an inventor in truth he was although as yet he had never really invented anything brought up as an electrical engineer after a very brief experience of his profession he had fallen victim to an idea and become a physicist this was his idea or the main point of itfor its details do not in the least concern our history that by means of a certain machine which he had conceived but not as yet perfected it would be possible to complete all existing systems of aerial communication and enormously to simplify their action and enlarge their scope his instruments which were wireless telephonesaerophones he called themwere to be made in pairs twins that should talk only to each other they required no high poles or balloons or any other cumbrous and expensive appliance indeed their size was no larger than that of a rather thick despatch box and he had triumphed the thing was donein all but one or two details  for two long years he had struggled with these and still they eluded him once he had succeededthat was the dreadful thing once for a while the instruments had worked and with a space of several miles between them butthis was the maddening part of ithe had never been able to repeat the exact conditions or rather to discover precisely what they were on that occasion he had entrusted one of his machines to his first cousin mary porson a big girl with her hair still down her back rather idle in disposition but very intelligent when she chose mary for the most part had been brought up at her fathers house close by often too she stayed with her uncle for weeks at a stretch so at that time morris was as intimate with her as a man of eight and twenty usually is with a relative in her teens  the arrangement on this particular occasion was that she should take the machineor aerophone as its inventor had named itto her home the next morning at the appointed hour as morris had often done before he tried to effect communication but without result on the following day at the same hour he tried again when to his astonishment instantly the answer came back yes as distinctly as though she were standing by his side he heard his cousin marys voice  are you there he said quite hopelessly merely as a matter of formof very common formand wellnigh fell to the ground when he received the reply  yes yes but i have just been telegraphed for to go to beaulieu my mother is very ill  what is the matter with her he asked and she replied  inflammation of the lungsbut i must stop i cant speak any more then came some sobs and silence  that same afternoon by marys direction the aerophone was brought back to him in a dogcart and three days later he heard that her mother mrs porson was dead  some months passed and when they met again on her return from the riviera morris found his cousin changed she had parted from him a child and now beneath the shadow of the wings of grief suddenly she had become a woman moreover the best and frankest part of their intimacy seemed to have vanished there was a veil between them mary thought of little and at this time seemed to care for no one except her mother who was dead and morris who had loved the child recoiled somewhat from the newborn woman it may be explained that he was afraid of women still with an eye to business he spoke to her about the aerophone and so far as her memory served her she confirmed all the details of their short conversation across the gulf of empty space  you see he said trembling with excitement i have got it at last  it looks like it she answered wearily her thoughts already far away why shouldnt you there are so many odd things of the sort but one can never be sure it mightnt work next time  will you try again he asked  if you like she answered but i dont believe i shall hear anything now somehowsince that last businesseverything seems different to me  dont be foolish he said you have nothing to do with the hearing it is my new receiver  i daresay she replied but then why couldnt you make it work with other people  morris answered nothing he too wondered why  next morning they made the experiment it failed other experiments followed at intervals most of which were fiascos although some were partially successful thus at times mary could hear what he said but except for a word or two and now and then a sentence he could not hear her whom when she was still a child and his playmate once he had heard so clearly  why is it he said a year or two later dashing his fist upon the table in impotent rage it has been why cant it be  mary turned her large blue eyes up to the ceiling and reflectively rubbed her dimpled chin with a very pretty finger  isnt that the kind of question they used to ask oracles she asked lazilyoh no it was the oracles themselves that were so vague well i suppose because was is as different from is as as is from shall be we are changed cousin thats all  he pointed to his patent receiver and grew angry  oh it isnt the receiver she said smoothing her curling hair its us you dont understand me a bitnot nowand thats why you cant hear me take my advice morrisand she looked at him sharplywhen you find a woman whom you can hear on your patent receiver you had better marry her it will be a good excuse for keeping her at a distance afterwards  then he lost his temper indeed he raved and stormed and nearly smashed the patent receiver in his fury to a scientific man let it be admitted it was nothing short of maddening to be told that the successful working of his instrument to the manufacture of which he had given eight years of toil and study depended upon some preexistent sympathy between the operators of its divided halves if that were so what was the use of his wonderful discovery for who could ensure a sympathetic correspondent and yet the fact remained that when in their playmate days he understood his cousin mary and when her quiet indolent nature had been deeply moved by the shock of the news of her mothers peril the aerophone had worked whereas now when she had become a grownup young lady he did not understand her any longerhe whose heart was wrapped up in his experiments and who by nature feared the adult members of her sex and shrank from them when too her placid calm was no longer stirred work it would not  she laughed at his temper then grew serious and said  dont get angry morris after all there are lots of things that you and i cant understand and it isnt odd that you should have tumbled across one of them if you think of it nobody understands anything they know that certain things happen and how to make them happen but they dont know why they happen or why as in your case when they ought to happen they wont  it is all very well for you to be philosophical he answered turning upon her but cant you see mary that the thing there is my lifes work it is what i have given all my strength and all my brain to make and if it fails in the endwhy then i fail too once and forever and i have made it talk it talked perfectly between this place and seaview and now you stand there and tell me that it wont work any more because i dont understand you then what am i to do  try to understand me if you think it worth while which i dont or go on experimenting she answered try to find some substance which is less exquisitely sensitive something a little grosser more in key with the material world or to discover someone whom you do understand dont lose heart dont be beaten after all these years  no he answered i dont unless i die and he turned to go  morris she said in a softer voice i am lazy i know perhaps that is why i adore people who can work so although you dont think anything of me i will do my honest best to get into sympathy with you again yes and to help in any way i can no its not a joke i would give a great deal to see the thing a success  why do you say i dont think anything of you mary of course it isnt true besides you are my cousin and we have always been good friends since you were a little thing  she laughed yes and i suppose that as you had no brothers or sisters they taught you to pray for your cousin didnt they oh i know all about it it is my unfortunate sex that is to blame while i was a mere tomboy it was different no one can serve two masters can they you have chosen to serve a machine that wont go and i daresay that you are wise yes i think that it is the better partuntil you find someone that will make it goand then you would adore herby aerophone    chapter ii  the colonel and some reflections  presently morris heard a step upon the lawn and turned to see his father sauntering towards him colonel monk cb was an elderly man over sixty indeed but still of an upright and soldierly bearing his record was rather distinguished in his youth he had served in the crimea and in due course was promoted to the command of a regiment of guards after this certain diplomatic abilities caused him to be sent to one of the foreign capitals as military attache and in reward of this service on retiring he was created a companion of the bath in appearance he was handsome also in fact much better looking than his son with his irongrey hair his clearcut features somewhat marred in effect by a certain shiftiness of the mouth and his large dark eyes morris had those dark eyes alsothey redeemed his face from plainness for otherwise it showed no beauty the features being too irregular the brow too prominent and the mouth too large yet it could boast what in the case of a man at any rate is better than beautyspirituality and a certain sympathetic charm it was not the face which was so attractive but rather the intelligence the personality that shone through it as the light shines through the horn panes of some homely massive lantern speculative eyes of the sort that seem to search horizons and gather knowledge there but shrink from the faces of women a head of brown hair short cut but untidy an athletic manlike form to which bizarrely enough a slight stoop the stoop of a student seemed to give distinction and hands slender and shapely as those of an easternsuch were the characteristics of morris monk or at least those of them that the observer was apt to notice  hullo morris are you stargazing there said colonel monk with a yawn i suppose that i must have fallen asleep after dinnerthat comes of stopping too long at once in the country and drinking port i notice you never touch it and a good thing too there my cigar is out nows the time for that new electric lighter of yours which i can never make work  morris fumbled in his pocket and produced the lighter then he said  i am sorry father but i believe i forgot to charge it  ah thats just like you if you will forgive my saying so you take any amount of trouble to invent and perfect a thing but when it comes to making use of it then you forget and with a little gesture of impatience the colonel turned aside to light a match from a box which he had found in the pocket of his cape  i am sorry said morris with a sigh but i am afraid it is true when ones mind is very fully occupied with one thing and he broke off  ah thats it morris thats it said the colonel seating himself upon a garden chair this hobbyhorse of yours is carrying youto the devil and your family with you i dont want to be rough but it is time that i spoke plain lets see how long is it since you left the london firm  nine years this autumn answered morris setting his mouth a little for he knew what was coming the port drunk after claret had upset his fathers digestion and ruffled his temper this meant that to himmorrisfate had appointed a lecture  nine years nine wasted years idled and dreamt away in a village upon the eastern coast it is a large slice out of a mans life my boy by the time that i was your age i had done a good deal said his father meditatively when he meant to be disagreeable it was the colonels custom to become reflective  i cant admit that answered morris in his light quick voicei mean i cant admit that my time has either been idled away or wasted on the contrary father i have worked very hard as i did at college and as i have always done with results which without boasting i may fairly call gloriousyes gloriousfor when they are perfected they will change the methods of communication throughout the whole world as he spoke forgetting the sharp vexation of the moment his face was irradiated with lightlike some evening cloud on which the sun strikes suddenly  watching him out of the corner of his eye even in that low moonlight his father saw those fires of enthusiasm shine and die upon his sons face and the sight vexed him enthusiasm as he conceived perhaps with justice had been the ruin of morris ceasing to be reflective his tone became cruel  do you really think morris that the world wishes to have its methods of communication revolutionised arent there enough telephones and phonograms and aerial telegraphs already it seems to me that you merely wish to add a new terror to existence however there is no need to pursue an academical discussion since this wretched machine of yours on which you have wasted so much time appears to be a miserable failure  now to throw the nonsuccess of his invention into the teeth of the inventor especially when that inventor knows that it is successful really although just at present it does not happen to work is a very deadly insult few indeed could be deadlier except perhaps that of the cruelty which can suggest to a woman that no man will ever look at her because of her plainness and lack of attraction or the coarse taunt which by shameless implication unjustly accuses the soldier of cowardice the diplomat of having betrayed the secrets of his country or the lawyer of having sold his brief all the more therefore was it to morriss credit that he felt the lash sting without a show of temper  i have tried to explain to you father he began struggling to free his clear voice from the note of indignation  of course you have morris dont trouble yourself to repeat that long story but even if you were successfulwhich you are noteri cannot see the commercial use of this invention as a scientific toy it may be very well though personally i should prefer to leave it alone since if you go firing off your thoughts and words into space how do you know who will answer them or who will hear them  well father as you understand all about it it is no use my explaining any further it is pretty late i think i will be turning in  i had hoped replied the colonel in an aggrieved voice that you might have been able to spare me a few minutes conversation for some weeks i have been seeking an opportunity to talk to you but somehow your arduous occupations never seem to leave you free for ordinary social intercourse  certainly replied morris though i dont quite know why you should say that i am always about the place if you want me but in his heart he groaned guessing what was coming  yes but you are ever working at your chemicals and machinery in the old chapel or reading those eternal books or wandering about rapt in contemplation of the heavens so that in short i seldom like to trouble you with my mundane but necessary affairs  morris made no answer he was a very dutiful son and humblespirited those who pit their intelligences against the forces of nature and try to search out her secrets become humble he could not altogether respect his father the gulf between them was too wide and deep but even at his present age of three and thirty he considered it a duty to submit himself to him and his vagaries outside of other reasons his mother had prayed him to do so almost with her last breath and living or dead morris loved his mother  perhaps you are not aware went on colonel monk after a solemn pause that the affairs of this property are approaching a crisis  i know something but no details answered morris i have not liked to interfere he added apologetically  and i have not not liked to trouble you with such sordid matters rejoined his parent with sarcasm i presume however that you are acquainted with the main facts i succeeded to this estate encumbered with a mortgage created by your grandfather an extravagant and unbusinesslike man that mortgage i looked to your mothers fortune to pay off but other calls made this impossible for instance the seawall here had to be built if the abbey was to be saved and half a mile of seawalling costs something also very extensive repairs to the house were necessary and i was forced to take three farms in hand when i retired from the army fifteen years ago this has involved a net loss of about ten thousand pounds while all the time the interest had to be paid and the place kept up in a humble fashion  i thought that my uncle porson took over the mortgage after my mothers death interrupted morris  that is so answered his father wincing a little but a creditor remains a creditor even if he happens to be a relative by marriage i have nothing to say against your uncle john who is an excellent person in his way and wellmeaning of course he has been justified perfectly justified in using his business abilitiesor perhaps i should say instincts for they are hereditaryto his own advantage in fact however directly or indirectly he has done well out of this property and his connection with our familyexceedingly well both financially and socially in a time of stress i was forced to sell him the two miles of seafrontage buildingland between here and northwold for a mere song during the last ten years as you know he has cut this up into over five hundred villa sites which he has sold upon long lease at groundrents that today bring in annually as much as he paid for the whole property  yes father but you might have done the same he advised you to before he bought the land  perhaps i might but i am not a tradesman i do not understand these affairs and morris i must remind you that in such matters i have had no assistance i do not blame you any more than i blame myselfit is not in your line eitherbut i repeat that i have had no assistance  morris did not argue the point well father he asked what is the upshot are we ruined  ruined that is a large word and an ugly one no we are no more ruined than we have been for the last halfdozen years for thank heaven i still have resources andfriends but of course this place is in a way expensive and you yourself would be the last to pretend that our burdens have been lessened byyour having abandoned the very strange profession which you selected and devoted yourself to researches which if interesting must be called abstract  forgive me father interrupted morris with a ring of indignation in his voice but you must remember that i put you to no expense in addition to what i inherited from my mother which of course under the circumstances i do not ask for i have my fellowship out of which i contribute something towards the cost of my living and experiments that by the way i keep as low as possible  of course of course said the colonel who did not wish to pursue this branch of the subject but his son went on  you know also that it was at your express wish that i came to live here at monksland as for the purposes of my work it would have suited me much better to take rooms in london or some other scientific centre  really my dear boy you should control yourself broke in his father that is always the way with recluses they cannot bear the slightest criticism of course as you were going to devote yourself to this line of research it was right and proper that we should live together surely you would not wish at my age that i should be deprived of the comfort of the society of an only child especially now that your mother has left us  certainly not father answered morris softening as was his fashion at the thought of his dead mother  then came a pause and he hoped that the conversation was at end a vain hope as it proved  my real object in troubling you morris continued his father presently was very different to the unnecessary discussions into which we have drifted  his son looked up but said nothing again he knew what was coming and it was worse than anything that had gone before  this place seems very solitary with the two of us living in its great rooms i who am getting an old fellow and you a student and a recluseno dont deny it for nowadays i can barely persuade you to attend even the bench or a lawntennis party well fortunately we have power to add to our numbers or at least you have i wish you would marry morris  his son turned sharply and answered  thank you father but i have no fancy that way  now theres jane rose or that handsome eliza layard went on the colonel taking no notice i have reason to know that you might have either of them for the asking and they are both good women without a breath against them and what in the state of this property is not without importance very well to do jane gets fifty thousand pounds down on the day of her marriage and as much more together with the place upon old lady roses death while miss layardif she is not quite to the manner bornhas the interest in that great colliery and a rather sickly brother lastlyand this is strange enough considering how you treat themthey admire you or at least eliza does for she told me she thought you the most interesting man she had ever met  did she indeed ejaculated morris why i have only spoken three times to her during the last year  no doubt my dear boy that is why she thinks you interesting to her you are a mine of splendid possibilities but i understand that you dont like either of them  no not particularlyespecially eliza layard who isnt a lady and has a vicious tempernor any young woman whom i have ever met  do you mean to tell me candidly morris that at your age you detest women  i dont say that i only say that i never met one to whom i felt much attracted and that i have met a great many by whom i was repelled  decidedly morris in you the strain of the ancestral fish is too predominant it isnt natural it really isnt you ought to have been born three centuries ago when the old monks lived here you would have made a firstclass abbot and might have been canonised by now am i to understand then that you absolutely decline to marry  no father i dont want you to understand anything of the sort if i could meet a lady whom i liked and who wouldnt expect too much and who was foolish enough to wish to take me of course i should marry her as you are so bent upon it  well morris and what sort of a woman would fulfil the conditions to your notion  his son looked about him vaguely as though he expected to find his ideal in some nook of the dim garden  what sort of a woman well somebody like my cousin mary i supposean easygoing person of that kind who always looks pleasant and cool  morris did not see him for he had turned his head away but at the mention of mary porsons name his father started as though someone had pricked him with a pin but colonel monk had not commanded a regiment with some success and been a military attache for nothing having filled diplomatic positions public and private in his time he could keep his countenance and play his part when he chose indeed did his simplerminded son but know it all that evening he had been playing a part  oh thats your style is it he said well at your age i should have preferred something a little different but there is no accounting for tastes and after all mary is a beautiful woman and clever in her own way by jove theres one oclock striking and i promised old charters that i would always be in bed by halfpast eleven good night my boy by the way you remember that your uncle porson is coming to seaview tomorrow from london and that we are engaged to dine with him at eight fancy a man who could build that pretentious monstrosity and call it seaview well it will condemn him to the seventh generation but in this world one must take people as one finds them and their houses too mind you lock the garden door when you come in good night  really thought colonel monk to himself as he took off his dressshoes and with military precision set them side by side beneath a chair it does seem a little hard on me that i should be responsible for a son who is in love with a damned unworkable electrical machine and with his chanceswith his chances why he might have been a second secretary in the diplomatic service by now or anything else to which interest could help him and there he sits hour after hour gabbling down a little trumpet and listening for an answer which never comeshour after hour and month after month and year after year is he a genius or is he an idiot or a moral curiosity or simply useless im hanged if i know but thats a good idea about mary though of course there are things against it curious that i should never have considered the matter seriously beforebecause of the cousinship i suppose would she have him it doesnt seem likely but you can never know what a woman will or will not do and as a child she was very fond of morris at any rate the situation is desperate and if i can i mean to save the old place for his sake and our familys as well as my own  he went to the window and lifting a corner of the blind looked out there he is still staring at the sea and the sky and there i daresay he will be till dawn i bet he has forgotten all about mary now and is thinking of his electrical machine what a curiosity good heavens what a curiosity ah i wonder what they would have made of him in my old mess five and thirty years ago and quite overcome by this reflection the colonel shook his grizzled head put out the candle and retired to rest    his father was right the beautiful september dawn was breaking over the placid sea before morris brushed the night dew from his hair and cloak and went in by the abbots door  what was he thinking of all the time he scarcely knew one by one like little clouds in the summer sky fancies arose in his mind to sail slowly across its depth and vanish upon an inconclusive and shadowy horizon of course he thought about his instruments these were never absent from his heart his instinct flew back to them as an oasis as an island of rest in the wilderness of this fathers thorny and depressing conversation the instruments were disappointing it is true at present but at any rate they did not dwell gloomily upon impending ruin or suggest that it was his duty to get married they remained silent distressingly silent indeed  well as the question of marriage had been started he might as well face it out that is argue it in his mind reduce it to its principles follow it to its issues in a reasonable and scientific manner what were the facts his family which by tradition was reported to be danish in its origin had owned this property for several hundred years though how they came to own it remained a matter of dispute some said the abbey and its lands were granted to a man of the name of monk by henry viii of course for a consideration others held and evidence existed in favour of this view that on the dissolution of the monastery the abbot of the day a shrewd man of easy principles managed to possess himself of the chapter house and further extensive hereditaments of course with the connivance of the commissioners and providing himself with a wife to exchange a spiritual for a temporal dignity at least this remained certain that from the time of elizabeth onwards morriss forefathers had been settled in the old abbey house at monksland that the first of them about whom they really knew anything was named monk and that monk was still the family name  now they were all dead and gone and their history which was undistinguished does not matter to come to the present day his father succeeded to a diminished and encumbered estate indeed had it not been for the fortune of his mother a miss porson and one of a middle class and business but rather wealthy family the property must have been sold years before that fortune however had long ago been absorbedor so he gatheredfor his father a brilliant and fashionable army officer was not the man to stint himself or to nurse a crippled property indeed it was wonderful to morris how without any particular change in their style of living which if unpretentious was not cheap in these bad times they had managed to keep afloat at all  unworldly as morris might be he could easily guess why his father wished that he should marry and marry well it was that he might bolster up the fortunes of a shattered family alsoand this touched him this commanded his sympathyhe was the last of his race if he died without issue the ancient name of monk became extinct a consummation from which his father shrank with something like horror  the colonel was a selfish manmorris could not conceal it even from himselfone who had always thought of his own comfort and convenience first yet either from idleness or pride to advance these he had never stooped to scheme where the welfare of his family was concerned however as his son knew he was a schemer that desire was the one real and substantial thing in a somewhat superficial egotistic and finessing character  morris saw it all as he leaned there upon the railing staring at the mistdraped sea more clearly indeed than he had ever seen it before he understood moreover what an unsatisfactory son he must be to a man like his fatherif it had tried providence could hardly have furnished him with offspring more unsuitable the colonel had wished him to enter the diplomatic service or the army or at least to get himself called to the bar but although a really brilliant university career and his family influence would have given him advantages in any of these professions he had declined them all so following his natural bent he became an electrician and now abandoning the practical side of that modest calling he was an experimental physicist full of deep but unremunerative lore andan unsuccessful inventor certainly he owed something to his family and if his father wished that he should marry well marry he must as a matter of duty if for no other reason after all the thing was not pressing for it it came to the point what woman was likely to accept him all he had done tonight was to settle the general principles in his own mind when it became necessaryif everhe could deal with the details  and yet this sort of marriage which was proposed to him was it not an unholy business he cared little for women having no weakness that way probably because of the energy which other young men gave to the pursuit of them was in his case absorbed by intense and brainexhausting study therefore he was not a man who if left to himself would marry as so many do merely in order to be married indeed the idea to him was almost repulsive had he been a womanhater he might have accepted it more easily for then to him one would have been as the other but the trouble was that he knew and felt that a time might come when in his eyes one woman would be different from all others a being who spoke not to his physical nature only if at all but to the core within him and if that happened what then  look the sun was rising on the eastern sky of a sudden two golden doors had opened in the canopy of night and in and out of them seemed to pass glittering swiftwinged things as souls might tread the gate of heaven look too at the little clouds that in an unending stream floated out of the gloomtravellers pressed onwards by a breath of destiny they were leadenhued all of them black indeed at times until they caught the radiance and for a while became like the pennons of an angels wings then one by one the glory overtook and embraced them and they melted into it to be seen no more  what did the sight suggest to him that it was worth while perhaps to be a mere drift of cloud stormdriven and rainladen in the bitter night of life if the morning of deliverance brought such transformation on its wings that beyond some such gates as these gates that at times greatly daring he longed to tread lay the answer to many a mystery amongst other things perhaps there he would learn the meaning of true marriage and why it is denied to most dwellers of the earth without a union of the spirit was there indeed any marriage as it should be understood and who in this world could hope to find his fellow spirit  see the sun had risen the golden gates were shut he had been dreaming and was chilled to the bone wretchedness mental and bodily took hold of him well often enough such is the fate of those who dream those who turn from their needful daily tasks to shape an angel out of this worlds clay trusting to some unknown god to give it life and spirit    chapter iii  poor porson  upon the morning following his conversation with morris colonel monk spent two hours or more in the library painfully did he wrestle there with balancesheets adding up bank books also other financial documents  phew he said when at length the job was done it is worse than i thought a good deal worse my credit must be excellent or somebody would have been down upon us before now well i must talk things over with porson he understands figures and so he ought considering that he kept the books in his grandfathers shop  then the colonel went to lunch less downcast than might have been expected since he anticipated a not unamusing halfhour with his son as he knew well morris detested business matters and money calculations still reflected his parent it was only right that he should take his share of the family responsibilitiesa fact which he fully intended to explain to him  but in vain is the net spread etc as morris passed the door of the library on his way to the old chapel of the abbey which now served him as a laboratory he had seen his father bending over the desk and guessed his occupation knowing therefore what he must expect at lunch morris determined to dispense with that meal and went out much to the colonels disappointment and indignation i hate he explained to his brotherinlaw porson afterwards yes i hate a fellow who wont face disagreeables and shirks his responsibilities  between monksland and the town of northwold lay some four miles of cliff most of which had been portioned off in building lots for northwold was what is called a rising wateringplace about halfway between the abbey and this town stood mr porsons mansion in fact it was nothing but a dwelling like those about it presenting the familiar seaside gabled roofs of red tiles and stucco walls decorated with sham woodwork with the difference that the house was exceedingly well built and about four times as large as the average villa  great heavens what a place said the colonel to himself as he halted at the private gateway which opened on to the cliff and surveyed it affronting sea and sky in all its naked horror show me the house and i will show you the man he went on to himself but after all one mustnt judge him too hardly poor porson he did not arrange his own upbringing or his ancestors hello there he is  john john john he shouted at a stout little person clad in a black alpaca coat a straw hat and a pair of spectacles who was engaged in sad contemplation of a bed of dying evergreens  at the sound of that wellknown voice the little man jumped as though he had trodden on a pin and turned round slowly muttering to himself  gracious its him an ungrammatical sentence which indicated sufficiently how wide a niche in the temple of his mind was filled with the image of his brotherinlaw colonel monk  john porson was a man of about six or eight and fifty roundfaced bald with large blue eyes not unlike those of a china doll and cleanshaven except for a pair of sandycoloured muttonchop whiskers in expression he was gentle even timid and in figure short and stout at this very moment behind a hundred counters stand a hundred replicas of that goodhearted man and worthy citizen john porson can he be described better or more briefly  how are you colonel he said hurrying forward he had never yet dared to call his brotherinlaw monk and much less by his christian name so he compromised on colonel  pretty well thank you considering my years and botherations and how are you john  not very grand not very grand said the little man my heart has been troubling me and it was so dreadfully hot in london  then why didnt you come away  really i dont know i understood that it had something to do with a party but i think the fact is that mary was too lazy to look after the servants while they packed up  perhaps she had some attraction there suggested the colonel with an anxiety which might have been obvious to a more skilled observer  attraction what do you mean asked porson  mean you old goose why what should i mean a young man of course  oh i see no i am sure it was nothing of that sort mary wont be bothered with young men she is too lazy she just looks over their heads till they get tired and go away i am sure it was the packing or perhaps the party but what are you staring at colonel is there anything wrong  no no only that wonderful window of yoursthe one filled with bottleglasswhich always reminds me of a bullseye lantern standing on a preservedbeef tin or the top of a toy lighthouse  porson peered at the offending window through his spectacles  certainly now you mention it it does look a little odd from here he said naked rather you said so before you remember and i told them to plant the shrubs but while i was away they let every one of the poor things die i will ask my architect jenkins if he cant do anything it might be pulled down perhaps  better leave it alone said the colonel with a sniff if i know anything of jenkins hed only put up something worse i tell you john that where bricks and mortar are concerned that mans a moral monster  i know you dont like his style murmured porson but wont you come in it is so hot out here in the sun  thank you yes but let us go to that place you call your den not to the drawingroom if you can spare it i want halfanhour with you thats why i came over in the afternoon before dinner  certainly certainly murmured porson again as he led the way to the den but to himself he added its those mortgages ill bet oh dear oh dear when shall i see the last of them  presently they were established in the den the colonel very cool and comfortable in mr porsons armchair and porson himself perched upon the edge of a newlooking leather sofa in an attitude of pained expectancy  now i am at your service colonel he said  oh yes well it is just this i want you if you will to look through these figures for me and he produced and handed to him a portentous document headed list of obligations  mr porson glanced at it and instantly his round simple face became clever and alert here he was on his own ground in five minutes he had mastered the thing  yes he said in a quick voice this is quite clear but there is some mistake in the addition making a difference of 87 pounds 3s 10d in your favour well where is the schedule of assets  the schedule of assets my dear john i wish i knew i have my pension and there are the abbey and estates which as things are seem to be mortgaged to their full value thats about all i think unlessunlessand he laughed we throw in morriss patent electrical machine which wont work  it ought to be reckoned perhaps replied mr porson gravely adding in a kind of burst with an air of complete conviction i believe in morriss machine or at least i believe in morris he has the makings of a great manno of a great inventor about him  do you really replied the colonel much interested that is curiousand encouraging for my dear john where business matters are concerned i trust your judgment  but i doubt whether he will make any money out of it went on porson one day the world will benefit probably he will not benefit  the colonels interest faded possibly john but if so perhaps for present purposes we may leave this mysterious discovery out of the question  i think so i think so but what is the point  the point is that i seem to be about at the end of my tether although as yet i am glad to say nobody has actually pressed me and i have come to you as a friend and a relative for advice what is to be done i have sold you all the valuable land and i am glad to think that you have made a very good thing of it some years ago also you took over the two heaviest mortgages on the abbey estate and i am sorry to say that the interest is considerably in arrear there remain the floating debts and other charges amounting in all to about 7000 pounds which i have no means of meeting and meanwhile of course the place must be kept up under these circumstances john i ask you as a business man what is to be done  and as a business man i say im hanged if i know said porson with unwonted energy all debts no assetsthe position is impossible unless indeed something happens  quite so thats it my only comfort isthat something might happen and he paused  porson fidgeted about on the edge of the leather sofa and turned red in his heart he was wondering whether he dared offer to pay off the debts this he was quite able to do more he was willing to do since to him good simple man the welfare of the ancient house of monk of which his only sister had married the head was a far more important thing than parting with a certain number of thousands of pounds for birth and station in his plebeian humility john porson had a reverence which was almost superstitious moreover he had loved his dead sister dearly and in his way he loved her son also also he revered his brotherinlaw the polished and splendidlooking colonel although it was true that sometimes he writhed beneath his military and aristocratic heel particularly indeed did he resent in his secret heart those continual sarcasms about his taste in architecture  now although the monetary transactions between them had been many as luck would have itentirely without his own designthey chanced in the main to have turned to his porsons advantage thus owing chiefly to his intelligent development of its possibilities the land which he bought from the monk estate had increased enormously in value so much so indeed that even if he lost all the other sums advanced upon mortgage he would still be considerably to the good therefore as it happened the colonel was really under no obligations to him in these circumstances mr porson did not quite know how a coldblooded offer of an advance of cash without securityin practice a giftwould be received  have you anything definite in your mind he hesitated timidly  the colonel reflected on his part he was wondering how porson would receive the suggestion of a substantial loan it seemed too much to risk he was proud and did not like to lay himself open to the possibility of rebuff  i think not john unless morris should chance to make a good marriage which is unlikely for as you know he is an odd fish i can see nothing before us except ruin indeed at my age it does not greatly matter but it seems a pity that the old house should come to an end in such a melancholy and discreditable fashion  a pity it is more than a pity jerked out porson with a sudden wriggle which caused him to rock up and down upon the stiff springs of the new sofa  as he spoke there came a knock at the door and from the further side of it a slow rich voice was heard saying may i come in  thats mary said mr porson yes come in dear its only your uncle  the door opened mary came in and in some curious quiet way at once her personality seemed to take possession of and dominate that shaded room to begin with her stature gave an idea of dominion for without being at all coarse she was tall and full in frame the face also was somewhat massive with a rounded chin and large blue eyes that had a trick of looking half asleep and above a low broad forehead grew her waving golden hair parted simply in the middle after the old greek fashion she wore a white dress with a silver girdle that set off the beautiful outlines of her figure to great advantage and with her a perfume seemed to pass perhaps from the roses on her bosom  a beautiful woman thought the colonel to himself as she came in and he was no mean or inexperienced judge a beautiful woman but a regular lotuseater  how do you do uncle richard said mary pausing about six feet away and holding out her hand i heard you scolding my poor dad about his bowwindow in fact you woke me up and do you know you used exactly the same words as you did at your visit after we came down from london last year  bless me my dear said the colonel struggling to his feet and kissing his niece upon the forehead what a memory you have got it will get you into trouble some day  i daresayme or somebody else but history repeated itself uncle that is all the same sleepy me in a loungechair the same hot day the same bluebottle and the same you scolding the same daddy about the same window though what on earth dads window can matter to anyone except himself i cant understand  i daresay not my dear i daresay not we can none of us know everythingnot even latter day young ladiesbut i suggest that a few hours with fergussens handbook of architecture might enlighten you on the point  mary reflected but the only repartee that she could conjure at the moment was something about ancient lights which did not seem appropriate therefore as she thought that she had done enough for honour and to remind her aweinspiring relative that he could not suppress her suddenly she changed the subject  you are looking very well uncle she said surveying him calmly and younger than you did last year how is my cousin morris will the aerophone talk yet  be careful said the colonel gallantly if even my grey hairs can provoke a compliment what homage is sufficient for a sleeping beauty as for morris he is i believe much as usual at least he stood this morning till daybreak staring at the sea i understand howeverif he doesnt forget to comethat you are to have the pleasure of seeing him this evening when you will be able to judge for yourself  now dont be sarcastic about morris uncle id rather you went on abusing dads window  certainly not my dear if it displeases you but may i ask why he is to be considered sacred  why she answered and a genuine note crept into her bantering voice because he is one of the few men worth anything whom i ever chanced to meetexcept dad there and  spare me cut in the colonel with admirable skill for well he knew that his name was not upon the ladys lips but would it be impertinent to inquire what it is that constitutes morriss preeminent excellence in your eyes  of course not only it is three things not one first he works harder than any man i know and i think men who work adorable because i am so lazy myself secondly he thinks a great deal and very few people do that to any purpose thirdly i never feel inclined to go to sleep when he takes me in to dinner oh you may laugh if you like but ask dad what happened to me last month with that wretched old member of the government and before the sweets too  please please put in mr porson turning pink under pressure of some painful recollection if you have finished sparring with your uncle isnt there any tea mary  i believe so she said relapsing into a state of bland indifference ill go and see if i dont come back youll know it is there and mary passed through the door with that indolent graceful walk which no one could mistake who once had seen her  both her father and her uncle looked after her with admiration mr porson admired her because the man or woman who dared to meet that domestic tyrant his brotherinlaw in single combat and could issue unconquered from the doubtful fray was indeed worthy to be honoured colonel monk for his part hastened to do homage to a very pretty and charming young lady one moreover who was not in the least afraid of him  mary had gone and the air from the offending window which was so constructed as to let in a maximum of draught banged the door behind her the two men looked at each other a thought was in the mind of each but the colonel trained by long experience and wise in his generation waited for mr porson to speak many and many a time in the after days did he find reason to congratulate himself upon this superb reticencefor there are occasions when discretion can amount almost to the height of genius under their relative circumstances if it had been he who first suggested this alliance he and his family must have remained at the gravest disadvantage and as for stipulations well he could have made none but as it chanced it was from poor porsons lips that the suggestion came  mr porson cleared this throatonce twice thrice at the third rasp the colonel became very attentive he remembered that his brotherinlaw had done exactly the same thing at the very apex of a longdeparted crisis indeed just before he offered spontaneously to take over the mortgages on the abbey estate  you were talking colonel he began when mary came in and he paused  i daresay replied the colonel indifferently fixing a contemptuous glance upon some stone mullions of atrocious design  about morris marrying  oh yes so i was well  wellshe seems to like him i know she does indeed she never talks of any other young man  she who  my daughter mary andsowhy shouldnt theyyou know  really john i must ask you to be a little more explicit its no good your addressing me in your business ciphers  welli meanwhy shouldnt he marry her morris marry mary is that plain enough he asked in desperation  for a moment a mist gathered before the colonels eyes here was salvation indeed if only it could be brought about oh if only it could be brought about  but the dark eyes never changed nor did a muscle move upon that pale commanding countenance  morris marry mary he repeated dwelling on the alliterative words as though to convince himself that he had heard them aright that is a very strange proposition my dear john and sudden too why they are first cousins and for that reason i suppose the thing never occurred to metill last night he added to himself  yes i know colonel but i am not certain that this first cousin business isnt a bit exaggerated the returns of the asylums seem to show it and i know my doctor sir henry andrews says its nonsense youll admit that he is an authority also it happened in my own family my father and mother were cousins and we are none the worse  on another occasion the colonel might have been inclined to comment on this statementof course most politely now however he let it pass  well john he said putting aside the cousinship let me hear what your idea is of the advantages of such a union should the parties concerned change to consider it suitable  quite so quite so thats business said mr porson brightening up at once from my point of view these would be the advantages as you know colonel so far as i am concerned my origin for the time i have been able to trace itthats four generations from old john porson the quaker sugar merchant who came from nobody knows wherealthough honest is humble and until my fathers day all in the line of retail trade but then my dear wife came in she was a governess when i married her as you may have heard and of a very good scotch family one of the camerons so mary isnt all of our cutany more he added with a smile than morris is all of yours still for her to marry a monk would be a lift upa considerable lift up and looked at from a business point of view worth a deal of money  also i like my nephew morris and i am sure that mary likes him and id wish the two of them to inherit what i have got they wouldnt have very long to wait for it colonel for those doctors may say what they will but i tell you he added pathetically tapping himself over the heartthough you dont mention it to maryi know better oh yes i know better thats about all except of course that i should wish to see her settled before im gone a man dies happier you understand if he is certain whom his only child is going to marry for when he is dead i suppose that he will know nothing of what happens to her or perhaps he added as though by an afterthought he may know too much and not be able to help which would be painful very painful  dont get into those speculations john said the colonel waving his hand they are unpleasant and lead nowheresufficient to the day is the evil thereof  quite so quite so life is a queer game of blindmans buff isnt it played in a mist on a mountain top and the players keep dropping over the precipices but nobody heeds because there are always plenty more and the game goes on forever well thats my side of the case do you wish me to put yours  i should like to hear your view of it  very good it is this heres a nice girl no one can deny that and a nice man although hes oddyou will admit as much hes got name and he will have fame or i am much mistaken but as it chances through no fault of his he wants money or will want it for without money the old place cant go on and without a wife the old race cant go on now mary will have lots of money for to tell the truth it keeps piling up until i am sick of it ive been lucky in that way colonel because i dont care much about it i suppose i dont think that i ever yet made a really bad investment just look two years ago to oblige an old friend who was in the shop with me when i was young i put 5000 pounds into an australian mine never thinking to see it again yesterday i sold that stock for 50000 pounds  fifty thousand pounds ejaculated the colonel astonished into admiration  yes or to be accurate 49375 pounds 3s 10d andthats where the jar comes ini dont care i never thought of it again since i got the brokers note till this minute i have been thinking all day about my heart which is uneasy and about what will happen to mary when i am gone whats the good of this dirty money to a dying man id give it all to have my wife and the boy i lost back for a year or two yes i would go into a shop again and sell sugar like my grandfather and live on the profits from the till and the counter theres mary calling we must tell a fib we must say that we thought she was to come to fetch us dont you forget well there it is perhaps youll think it over at your leisure  yes john replied the colonel solemnly certainly i will think it over of course there are pros and cons but on the whole speaking offhand i dont see why the young people should not make a match also you have always been a good relative and what is better a good friend to me so of course if possible i should like to fall in with your wishes  mr porson who was advancing towards the door wheeled round quickly  thank you colonel he said i appreciate your sentiments but dont you make any mistake it isnt my wishes that have to be fallen in withor your wishes its the wishes of your son morris and my daughter mary if they are agreeable id like it well if not all the money in the world nor all the families in the world wouldnt make me have anything to do with the job or you either whatever our failings we are honest menboth of us who would not sell our flesh and blood for such trash as that    chapter iv  mary preaches and the colonel prevails  a fortnight had gone by and during this time morris was a frequent visitor at seaview also his cousin mary had come over twice or thrice to lunch with her father or without him once indeed she had stopped all the afternoon spending most of it in the workshop with morris this workshop it may be remembered was the old chapel of the abbey a very beautiful and still perfect building finished in early tudor times in which by good fortune the rich stained glass of the east window still remained it made a noble and spacious laboratory with its wide nave and lovely roof of chestnut wood whereof the corbels were seraphs whiterobed and goldenwinged  are you not afraid to desecrate such a place with your horrid vicesi mean the iron thingsand furnace and litter asked mary she had sunk down upon an anvil on which lay a newspaper the first seat that she could find and thence surveyed the strange incongruous scene  well if you ask i dont like it answered morris but there is no other place that i can have for my father is afraid of the forge in the house and i cant afford to build a workshop outside  it ought to be restored said mary with a beautiful organ in a carved case and a lovely alabaster altar and one of those perpetual lamps of silverthe french call them veilleuses dont theyand the stations of the cross in carved oak and all the rest of it  mary it may be explained had a tendency to admire the outward adornments of ritualism if not its doctrines  quite so answered morris smiling when i have from five to seven thousand to spare i will set about the job and hire a highchurch chaplain with a fine voice to come and say mass for your benefit by the way would you like a confessional also you omitted it from the list  i think not besides what on earth should i confess except being always late for prayers through oversleeping myself in the morning and general uselessness  oh i daresay you might find something if you tried suggested morris  speak for yourself please morris to begin with your own account there is the crime of sacrilege in using a chapel as a workshop look those are all tombstones of abbots and other holy people and under each tombstone one of them is asleep yet there you are using strong language and whistling and making a horrible noise with hammers just above their heads i wonder they dont haunt you i would if i were they  perhaps they do said morris only i dont see them  then they cant be there  why not because things are invisible and intangible it does not follow that they dont exist as i ought to know as much as anyone  of course but i am sure that if there were anything of that sort about you would soon be in touch with it with me it is different i could sleep sweetly with ghosts sitting on my bed in rows  why do you say thatabout me i mean asked morris in a more earnest voice  oh i dont know go and look at your own eyes in the glassbut i daresay you do often enough look here morris you think me very sillyalmost foolishdont you  i never thought anything of the sort as a matter of fact if you want to know i think you a young woman rather more idle than most and with a perfect passion for burying your talent in very white napkins  well it all comes to the same thing for there isnt much difference between foolborn and foolmanufactured sometimes i wake up however and have moments of wisdomas when i made you hear that thing you know thereby proving that it is all right only uselesshavent i  i daresay but come to the point  dont be in a hurry it is rather hard to express myself what i mean is that you had better give up staring  staring i never stared at you or anyone else in my life  stupid morris by staring i mean stargazing and by stargazing i mean trying to get away from the earthin your mind you know  morris ran his fingers through his untidy hair and opened his lips to answer  dont contradict me she interrupted in a full steady voice thats what you are thinking of half the day and dreaming about all the night  whats that he ejaculated  i dont know she answered with a sudden access of indifference do you know yourself  i am waiting for instruction said morris sarcastically  all right then ill try i mean that you are not satisfied with this world and those of us who live here you keep trying to fashion anotheroh yes you have been at it from a boy you see i have got a good memory i remember all your vision storiesand then you try to imagine its inhabitants  well said morris with the sullen air of a convicted criminal without admitting one word of this nonsense what if i do  only that you had better look out that you dont find whatever it is you seek its a horrible mistake to be so spiritual at least in that kind of way you should eat and drink and sleep ten hours as i do and not go craving for vision till you can see and praying for power until you can create  see create who what  the inhabitant or inhabitants just think you may have been building her up all this time imagination by imagination and thought by thought then her day might come and all that you have put out piecemeal will return at once yes she may appear and take you and possess you and lead you  she why she and where  to the devil i imagine answered mary composedly and as you are a man one can guess the guides sex its getting dark let us go out this is such a creepy place in the dark that it actually makes me understand what people mean by nerves and morris of course you understand that i have only been talking rubbish i always liked inventing fairy tales you taught me only this one is too grown updisagreeable what i really mean is that i do think it might be a good thing if you wouldnt live quite so much alone and would go out a bit more you are getting quite an odd look on your face you are indeed not like other men at all i believe that it comes from your worrying about this wretched invention until you are half crazy over the thing any change there  he shook his head no i cant find the right alloynot one that can be relied upon i begin to doubt whether it exists  why dont you give it upfor a while at any rate  i have i made a novel kind of electrical handsaw this spring and sold the patent for 100 pounds and a royalty theres commercial success for you and now i am at work on a new lamp of which i have the idea  i am uncommonly glad to hear it said mary with energy and i say morris you are not offended at my silly parables are you you know what i mean  not a bit i think it is very kind of you to worry your head about an impossible fellow like me and look here mary i have done some dreaming in my time it is true for so far the world has been a place of tribulation to me and it is sick hearts that dream but i mean to give it up for i know as well as you do that there is only one end to all these systems of mysticism mary looked up  i mean he went on correcting himself to the mad attempt unduly and prematurely to cultivate our spiritual natures that we may live to and for them and not to and for our natural bodies  exactly my argument put into long words said mary there will be plenty of time for that when we get down among those old gentlemen yondera year or two hence you know meanwhile let us take the world as we find it it isnt a bad place after all at times and there are several things worth doing for those who are not too lazy  goodbye i must be off my bicycle is there against the railings oh how i hate that machine now listen morris do you want to do something really useful and earn the blessings of an affectionate relative then invent a really reliable electrical bike that would look nice and do all the work so that i could sit on it comfortably and get to a place without my legs aching as though i had broken them and a red face and no breath left in my body  i will think about it he said indeed i have thought of it already but the accumulators are the trouble  then go on thinking theres an angel think hard and continually until you evolve that blessed instrument of progression i say i havent a lamp  ill lend you mine suggested morris  no other peoples lamps always go out with me and so do my own for that matter ill risk it i know the policeman and if we meet i will argue with him goodbye dont forget we are coming to dinner tomorrow night its a party isnt it  i believe so  what a bore i must unpack my london dresses well goodbye again  goodbye dear answered morris and she was gone  dear thought mary to herself he hasnt called me that since i was sixteen i wonder why he does it now because i have been scolding him i suppose that generally makes men affectionate  for a while she glided forward through the grey twilight and then began to think again muttering to herself  you idiot mary why should you be pleased because he called you dear he doesnt really care twopence about you his blood goes no quicker when you pass by and no slower when you stay away why do you bother about him and what made you talk all that stuff this afternoon because you think he is in a queer way and that if he goes on giving himself up to his fancies he will become madyes madbecauseoh whats the use of making excusesbecause you are fond of him and always have been fond of him from a child and cant help it what a fate to be fond of a man who hasnt the heart to care for you or for any other woman perhaps however thats only because he hasnt found the right one as he might do at any time and then  where are you going to and wheres your light shouted a hoarse voice from the pathway on which she was unlawfully riding  my good man i wish i knew answered mary blandly    morris for whom the day never seemed long enough was a person who breakfasted punctually at halfpast eight whereas colonel monk to whomat any rate at monkslandthe day was often too long generally breakfasted at ten to his astonishment however on entering the diningroom upon the morrow of his interview in the workshop with mary he found his father seated at the head of the table  this means a few words with me about something disagreeable thought morris to himself as he dabbed viciously at an evasive sausage he was not fond of these domestic conversations nor was he in the least reassured by his fathers airy and informed comments upon the contents of the globe which always arrived by post and the marvel of its daily turnover article whereof the perpetual variety throughout the decades constituted the colonel was wont to say the eighth wonder of the world instinct instructed by experience assured him that these were but the first moves in the game  towards the end of the meal he attempted retreat pretending that he wanted to fetch something but the colonel who was watching him over the top of the pink page of the globe intervened promptly  if you have a few minutes to spare my dear boy i should like to have a chat with you he said  certainly father answered the dutiful morris i am at your service  very good then i will light my cigar and we might take a stroll on the beach that is after i have seen the cook about the dinner tonight perhaps i shall find you presently by the steps  i will wait for you there answered morris and wait he did for a considerable while for the interview with the cook proved lengthy moreover the colonel was not a punctual person or one who set an undue value upon his own or other peoples time at length just as morris was growing weary of the pristine but enticing occupation of making ducks and drakes with flat pebbles his father appeared after salutations as they say in the east he wasted ten more minutes in abusing the cook ending up with a direct appeal for his sons estimate of her capacities  she might be better and she might be worse answered morris judicially  quite so replied the colonel drily the remark is sound and applies to most things at present however i think that she is worse also i hate the sight of her fat red face but bother the cook why do you think so much about her i have something else to say  i dont think said morris she doesnt excite me one way or the other except when she is late with my breakfast  then as he expected after the cook came the crisis  you will remember my dear boy began the colonel affectionately a little talk we had a while ago  which one father  the last of any importance i believe i refer to the occasion when you stopped out all night contemplating the sea an incident which impressed it upon my memory  morris looked at him why was the old gentleman so inconveniently observant  and doubtless you remember the subject  there were a good many subjects father they ranged from mortgages to matrimony  quite so to matrimony well have you thought any more about it  not particularly father why should i  confound it morris exclaimed the colonel losing patience dont chop logic like a petty sessions lawyer lets come to the point  that is my desire answered morris and quite clearly there rose up before him an inconsequent picture of his mother teaching him the catechism many many years ago thereat as was customary with his mind when any memory of her touched it his temper softened like iron beneath the influence of fire  very good then what do you think of mary as a wife  how should i know under the circumstances  the colonel fumed and morris added i beg your pardon i understand what you mean  then his father came to the charge  to be brief will you marry her  will she marry me asked morris isnt she too sensible  his fathers eye twinkled but he restrained himself this he felt was not an occasion upon which to indulge his powers of sarcasm  upon my word if you want my opinion i believe she will but you have to ask her first look here my boy be advised by me and do it as soon as possible the notion is rather new to me i admit but taking her all round where would you find a better woman you and i dont always agree about things we are of a different generation and look at the world from different standpoints but i think that at the bottom we respect each other and i am sure he added with a touch of restrained dignity that we are naturally and properly attached to each other under these circumstances and taking everything else into consideration i am convinced also that you will give weight to my advice i assure you that i do not offer it lightly it is that you should marry your cousin mary  there is her side of the case to be considered suggested morris  doubtless and she is a very shrewd and sensible young woman under all her dolce far niente air who is quite capable of consideration  i am not worthy of her his son broke in passionately  that is for her to decide i ask you to give her an opportunity of expressing an opinion  morris looked at the sea and sky then he looked at his father standing before him in an attitude that was almost suppliant with head bowed hands clasped and on his clearcut face an air of real sincerity what right had he to resist this appeal he was heartwhole without any kind of complication and for his cousin mary he had true affection and respect moreover they had been brought up together she understood him and in the midst of so much that was uncertain and bewildering she seemed something genuine and solid something to which a man could cling it may not have been a right spirit in which to approach this question of marriage but in the case of a young man like morris who was driven forward by no passion by no scheme even of personal advancement this substitution of reason for impulse and instinct was perhaps natural  very well i will he answered but if she is wise she wont  his father turned his head away and sighed softly and that sigh seemed to lift a tons weight off his heart  i am glad to hear it he answered simply the rest must settle itself by the way if you are going up to the house tell the cook that i have changed my mind we will have the soles fried with lemon she always makes a mess of them au maitre dhotel    chapter v  a proposal and a promise  although it consisted of but a dozen people the dinnerparty at the abbey that night was something of a function to begin with the old refectory with its stone columns and arches still standing as they were in the prereformation days lit with cunninglyarranged and shaded electric lights designed and set up by morris was an absolutely ideal place in which to dine then although the monk family were impoverished they still retained the store of plate accumulated by past generations much of this silver was old and very beautiful and when set out upon the great sideboards produced an affect well suited to that chamber and its accessories the company also was pleasant and presentable there were the local baronet and his wife the two beauties of the neighbourhood miss jane rose and miss eliza layard with their respective belongings the clergyman of the parish a mr tomley who was leaving the county for the north of england on account of his wifes health and a clever and rising young doctor from the county town these with mr porson and his daughter made up the number who upon this particular night with every intention of enjoying themselves sat down to that rather rare entertainment in monksland a dinnerparty  colonel monk had himself very carefully placed the guests as a result morris to whose lot it had fallen to take in the wealthy miss layard a young lady of handsome but somewhat illtempered countenance found himself at the foot of the oblong table with his partner on one side and his cousin on the other mary who was conducted to her seat by mr layard the delicate brother an insignificant pallidlooking specimen of humanity for reasons of her own not unconnected perhaps with the expected presence of the misses layard and rose had determined to look and dress her best that night she wore a robe of some rich white silk tight fitting and cut rather low and upon her neck a single row of magnificent diamonds the general effect of her sheeny dress snowlike skin and golden waving hair as she glided into the shaded room suggested to morriss mind a great white lily floating down the quiet water of some dark stream and when presently the light fell on her a vision of a silver mistladen star lying low upon the ocean at the break of dawn later after she became acquainted with these poetical imaginings mary congratulated herself and her maid very warmly on the fact that she had actually summoned sufficient energy to telegraph to town for this particular dress  of the other ladies present miss layard was arrayed in a hotlooking red garment which she imagined would suit her dark eyes and complexion miss rose on the contrary had come out in the virginal style of muslin and blue bows whereof the effect unhappily was somewhat marred by a fiery complexion acquired as the result of three days violent play at a tennis tournament to this unfortunate circumstance miss layard who had her own views of miss rose was not slow in calling attention  what has happened to poor jane she said addressing mary she looks as though she had been redochred down to her shoulders  who is poor jane asked that young lady languidly oh you mean miss rose i know she has been playing in that tennis tournament atwhats the name of the place dad would drive me there this afternoon and it made me quite hot to look at her jumping and running and hitting for hour after hour but shes awfully good at it she won the prize dont you envy anybody who can win a prize at a tennis tournament miss layard  no she answered sharply for miss layard did not shine at tennis i dislike women who go about what my brother calls pothunting just as if they were professionals  oh do you i admire them it must be so nice to be able to do anything well even if its only lawn tennis its the poor failures like myself for whom i am so sorry  i dont admire anybody who can come to out to a dinner party with a head and neck like that retorted eliza  why not you cant burn and that should make you more charitable and i tie myself up in veils and umbrellas which is absurd besides what does it matter you see it is different with most of us miss rose is so goodlooking that she can afford herself these little luxuries  that is a matter of opinion replied miss layard  oh i dont think so at least the opinion is all one way dont you think miss rose beautiful mr layard she said turning to her companion  ripping said that gentleman with emphasis but i wish she wouldnt beat one at tennis it is an insult to the stronger sex  mary looked at him reflectively his sister looked at him also  and i am sure that you think her beautiful dont you morris went on the imperturbable mary  certainly of course lovely he replied with a vacuous stare at the elderly wife of the baronet  there miss layard now you collect the opinions of the gentlemen all along your side and mary turned away ostensibly to talk to her cavalier but really to find out what could possibly interest morris so deeply in the person or conversation of lady jones  lady jones was talking across the table to mr tomley the departing rector a benevolentlooking person with a broad forehead adorned like that of father time by a single lock of snowy hair  and so you are really going to the far coast of northumberland mr tomley to exchange livings with the gentleman with the odd name how brave of you  mr tomley smiled assent adding you can imagine what a blow it is to me lady jones to separate myself from my dear parishioners and friendshere he eyed the colonel with whom he had waged a continual war during his five years of residence in the parish and added but we must all give way to the cause of duty and the necessities of health mrs tomley says that this part of the country does not agree with her and is quite convinced that unless she is taken back to her native northumberland air the worst may be expected  i fancy that it has arrived in that poor mans case thought mary to herself lady jones who also knew mrs tomley and the power of her tongue nodded her head sympathetically and said  of course of course a wifes health must be the first consideration of every good man but isnt it rather lonely up there mr tomley  lonely lady jones the clergyman replied with energy and shaking his white lock i assure you that the place is a howling desert a great moor behind and the great sea in front and some rocks and the church between the two thats about all but my wife likes it because she used to stay at the rectory when she was a little girl her uncle was the incumbent there she declares that she has never been well since she left the parish  and what did you say is the name of the present inhabitant of this earthly paradise the man with whom you have exchanged interrupted the colonel  fregeliusthe reverend peter fregelius  what an exceedingly odd name is he an englishman  yes but i think that his father was a dane and he married a danish lady  indeed is she living  oh no she died a great many years ago the old gentleman has only one child lefta girl  what is her name asked someone idly in a break of the general conversation so that everybody paused to listen to his reply  stellastella fregelius a very unusual girl  then the conversation broke out again with renewed vigour and all that those at morriss end of the table could catch were snatches such as wonderful eyes independent young person well read and musical oh yes poor as church mice thats why he accepted my offer  at this point the doctor began a rather vehement argument with mr porson as to the advisability of countervailing duties to force foreign nations to abandon the sugar bounties and no more was heard of mr tomley and his plans  on the whole mary enjoyed that dinnerparty miss layard somewhat sore after her first encounter attempted to retaliate later  but by this time marys argumentative energy had evaporated therefore adroitly appealing to mr layard to take her part she retired from the fray till seeing that it grew acrimonious for this brother and sister did not love each other she pretended to hear no more  have you been stopping out all night again and staring at the sea morris she inquired because i understand it is a habit of yours you seem so sleepy i know that i must have looked just like you when that old political gentleman took me in to dinner and i made an exhibition of myself  what was that asked morris  so she told him the story of her unlawful slumbers and so amusingly that he burst out laughing and remained in an excellent mood for the rest of the feast or at any rate until the ladies had departed after this event once more he became somewhat silent and distant  it was not wonderful to most men except the very experienced proposals are terrifying ordeals and morris had made up his mind if he could find a chance to propose to mary that night the thing was to be done so the sooner he did it the better  then it would be over one way or the other besides and this was strange and opportune enough never had he felt so deeply and truly attracted to mary whether it was because her soft indolent beauty showed at its best this evening in that gown and setting or because her conversation with its subacid tinge of kindly humour amused him orand this seemed more probablebecause her whole attitude towards himself was so gentle and so full of sweet benevolence he could not say at any rate this remained true she attracted him more than any woman he had ever met and sincerely he hoped and prayed that when he asked her to be his wife she might find it in her heart to say yes  the rest of the entertainment resembled that of most country dinnerparties conducted to the piano by the colonel who understood music very well the talented ladies of the party including miss rose sang songs with more or less success while miss layard criticised mary was appreciative and the men talked at length the local baronets wife looked at the local baronet who thereupon asked leave to order the carriage this example the rest of the company followed in quick succession until all were gone except mr porson and his daughter  well my dear said mr porson i suppose that we had better be off too or you wont get your customary nine hours  mary yawned slightly and assented asserting that she had utterly exhausted herself in defending miss rose from the attacks of her rival miss layard  no no broke in the colonel come and have a smoke first john ive got that old map of the property unrolled on purpose to show you and i dont want to keep it about for it fills up the whole place morris will look after mary for half an hour i daresay  certainly said morris but the heart within him sank to the level of his dressshoes here was the opportunity for which he had wished but as he could not be called a forward or even a pushing lover he was alarmed at its very prompt arrival this answer to his prayers was somewhat too swift and thorough there is a story of an enormously fat old boer who was seated on the veld with his horse at his side when suddenly a band of armed natives rushed to attack him oh god help he cried in his native taal as he prepared to heave his huge form into the saddle having thus invoked divine assistance this dutch falstaff went at the task with such a will that in a trice he found himself not on the horse but over it lying upon his back indeed among the grasses o god that deluded burgher exclaimed reproachfully as the kaffirs came up and speared him thou hast helped a great deal too much  at this moment morris felt very much like this stout but simple dweller in the wilderness he would have preferred to coquet with the enemy for a while from the safety of his saddle but providence willed it otherwise  wont you come out mary he said with the courage which inspires men in desperate situations he felt that it would be impossible to say those words with the electric lights looking at him like so many eyes the thought of it even made him warm all over  i dont know it depends is there anything comfortable to sit on  the deck chair he suggested  that sounds nice i have slumbered for hours in deck chairs look theres a fur rug on that sofa and heres my white cape now you get your coat and ill come  thank you no i dont want any coat i am hot enough already  mary turned and looked him up and down with her wondering blue eyes  do you really think it safe she said to expose yourself to all sorts of unknown dangers in this unprotected condition  of course he answered i am not afraid of the night air even in october  very well very well morris she went on and there was meaning in her voice then whatever happens dont blame me its so easy to be rash and thoughtless and catch a chill and then you may become an invalid for life or die you know one cant get rid of it againat least not often  morris looked at her with a puzzled air and stepped through the window which he had opened on to the lawn whither with a quaint little shrug of her shoulders mary followed him muttering to herself  now if he takes cold it wont be my fault then she stopped clasped her hands and said oh what a lovely night i am glad that we came out here  she was right it was indeed lovely high in the heavens floated a bright halfmoon across whose face the little whiteedged clouds drifted in quick succession throwing their gigantic shadows to the world beneath all silver was the sleeping sea where the moonlight fell upon it and when this was eclipsed then it was all jet to the right and left up to the very borders of the cliff lay the soft wreaths of roke or landfog covering the earth as with a cloak of down but pierced here and there by the dim and towering shapes of trees yet although these curling wreaths of mist hung on the edges of the cliff like white water about to fall they never fell since clear to the sight though separated from them by a gulf of translucent blackness lay the yellow belt of sand up which inch by inch the tide was creeping  and the airno wind stirred it though the wind was at work aloftit was still and bright as crystal and crisp and cold as newiced wine for the first autumn frost was falling  they stood for a few moments looking at all these wonderful beauties of the mysterious nightwhich dwellers in the country so rarely appreciate because to them they are common daily thingsand listening to the soft longdrawn murmuring of the sea upon the shingle then they went forward to the edge of the cliff but although morris threw the fur rug over it mary did not seat herself in the comfortablelooking deck chair her desire for repose had departed she preferred to lean upon the low grey wall in whose crannies grew lichens tiny ferns and in their season harebells and wallflowers morris came and leant at her side for a while they both stared at the sea  pray are you making up poetry she inquired at last  why do you ask such silly questions he answered not without indignation  because you keep muttering to yourself and i thought that you were trying to get the lines to scan also the sea and the sky and the night suggest poetry dont they  morris turned his head and looked at her  you suggest it he said with desperate earnestness in all that shining white especially when the moon goes in then you look like a beautiful spirit new lit upon the edge of the world  at first mary was pleased the compliment was obvious and coming from morris great she had never heard him say so much as that before then she thought an instant and the echo of the word spirit came back to her mind and jarred upon it with a little sudden shock even when he had a lovely woman at his side must his fancy be wandering to these unearthly denizens and similes  please morris she said almost sharply do not compare me to a spirit i am a woman nothing more and if it is not enough that i should be a woman then she paused to add i beg your pardon i know you meant to be nice but once i had a friend who went in for spiritstableturning ones i meanwith very bad results and i detest the name of them  morris took this rebuff better than might have been expected  would you object if one ventured to call you an angel he asked  not if the word was used in a terrestrial sense it excites a vision of possibilities and the fib is so big that anyone must pardon it  very well then i call you that  thank you i should be delighted to return the compliment can you think of any celestial definition appropriate to a young gentleman with dark eyes  oh mary please stop making fun of me said morris with something like a groan  why she asked innocently besides i wasnt making fun its only my way of carrying on conversation they taught it me at school you know  morris made no answer in fact he did not know what on earth to say or rather how to find the fitting words after all it was an accident and not his own intelligence that freed him from his difficulty mary moved a little causing the white cloak which was unfastened to slip from her shoulders morris put out his hand to catch it and met her hand in another instant he had thrown his arm round her drawn her to him and kissed her on the lips then abashed at what he had done he let her go and picked up the cloak  might i ask began mary in her usual sweet low tones then her voice broke and her blue eyes filled with tears  i beg your pardon i am a brute began morris utterly abased by the sight of these tears which glimmered like pearls in the moonlight but of course you know what i mean  mary shook her head vacantly apparently she could not trust herself to speak  dear will you take me  she made no answer only after pausing for some few seconds as though lost in thought with a little action more eloquent than any speech she leant herself ever so slightly towards him  afterwards as she lay in his arms words came to him readily enough  i am not worth your having he said i know i am an odd fellow not like other men my very failings have not been the same as other mens for instancebefore heaven it is trueyou are the first woman whom i ever kissed as i swear to you that you shall be the last then what else am i a failure in the very work that i have chosen and the heir to a bankrupt property oh it is not fair i have no right to ask you  i think it quite fair and here i am the judge morris then sentence by sentence she went on not all at once but with breaks and pauses  you asked me just now if i loved you and i told youyes but you did not ask me when i began to love you i will tell you all the same i cant remember a time when i didnt no not since i was a little girl it was you who grew away from me not me from you when you took to studying mysticism and aerophones and were repelled by all women myself included  i know i know he said dont remind me of my dead follies some things are born in the blood  quite so and they remain in the bone i understand morris unless you maltreat me wilfullywhich i am sure you would never doi shall always understand  what are you afraid of he asked in a shaken voice i feel that you are afraid  oh one or two things that you might overwork yourself for instance or lest you should find that after all you are more human than you imagine and be taken possession of by some strange stella coming out of nowhere  what do you mean and why do you use that name he said amazed  what i say dear as for that name i heard it accidentally at table tonight and it came to my lipsof itself it seemed to typify what i meant and to suggest a wandering starsuch as men like you are fond of following  upon my honour said morris i will do none of these things  if you can help it you will do none of them i know it well enough i hope and believe that there will never be a shadow between us while we live but morris i take you risks and all because it has been my chance to love you and nobody else otherwise i should think twice but love doesnt stop at risks  what have i done to deserve this groaned morris  i cannot see i should very much like to know replied mary with a touch of her old humour  it was at this moment that colonel monk happening to come round the corner of the house walking on the grass and followed by mr porson saw a sight which interested him with one hand he pointed it out to porson at the same moment motioning him to silence with the other then taking his brotherinlaw by the arm he dragged him back round the corner of the house  they make a pretty picture there in the moonlight dont they john my boy he said come we had better go back into the study and talk over matters till they have done even the warmth of their emotions wont keep out the night air for ever    chapter vi  the good old days  for the next month or to be accurate the next five weeks everything went merrily at monks abbey it was as though some cloud had been lifted off the place and those who dwelt therein no longer did the colonel look solemn when he came down in the morning and no longer was he cross after he had read his letters now his interviews with the steward in the study were neither prolonged nor anxious indeed that functionary emerged thence on saturday mornings with a shining countenance drying the necessary cheque heretofore so difficult to extract by waving it ostentatiously in the air lastly the colonel did not seem to be called upon to make such frequent visits to his man of business and to tarry at the office of the bank manager in northwold once there was a meeting but contrary to the general custom the lawyer and the banker came to see him in company and stopped to luncheon at this meal moreover the three of them appeared to be in the best of spirits  morris noted all these things in his quiet observant way and from them drew certain conclusions of his own but he shrank from making inquiries nor did the colonel offer any confidences after all why should he who had never meddled with his fathers business choose this moment to explore it especially as he knew from previous experience that such investigations would not be well received it was one of the colonels peculiarities to keep his affairs to himself until they grew so bad that circumstances forced him to seek the counsel or the aid of others still morris could well guess from what mine the money was digged that caused so comfortable a change in their circumstances and the solution of this mystery gave him little joy cash in consideration of an unconcluded marriage that was how it read to his sensitive nature the transaction seemed one of doubtful worth  however no one else appeared to be troubled if indeed these things existed elsewhere than in his own imagination this morris admitted was possible for their access of prosperity might after all be no more than a resurrection of credit vivified by the news of his engagement with the only child of a man known to be wealthy his uncle porson with a solemnity that was almost touching had bestowed upon mary and himself a jerky but earnest blessing before he drove home on the night of the dinnerparty he went so far indeed as to kiss them both an example which the colonel followed with a more finished but equally heartfelt grace  now his uncle john beamed upon him daily like the noonday sun also he began to take him into his confidence and consult him as to the erection of houses affairs of business and investments in the course of these interviews morris was astonished not to say dismayed to discover how large were the sums of money as to the disposal of which he was expected to express opinions  you see it will all be yours my boy said mr porson one day in explanation so it is best that you should know something of these affairs yes it will all be yours before very long and he sighed  i trust that i shall have nothing to do with it for many years blurted out morris  say months say months answered his uncle stretching out his hands as though to push something from him then to all appearances overcome by a sudden anguish physical or mental he turned and hurried from the room  taking them all together those five weeks were the happiest that morris had ever known no longer was he profoundly dissatisfied with things in general no longer ravaged by that desire of the moth for the star which in some natures is almost a disease his outlook upon the world was healthier and more hopeful for the first time he saw its wholesome joyous side had he failed to do so indeed he must have been a very strange man for he had much to make the poorest heart rejoice  thus mary always a charming woman since her engagement had become absolutely delightful witter more wideawake more beautiful morris could look forward to the years to be spent in her company not only without misgiving but with a confidence that a while ago he would have thought impossible moreover as good fortunes never come singly his were destined to be multiplied it was in those days after so many years of search and unfruitful labour that at last he discovered a clue which in the end resulted in the perfection of the instrument that was the parent of the aerophone of commerce and gave him a name among the inventors of the century which will not easily be forgotten  strangely enough it was morriss good genius mary who suggested the substance or rather the mixture of substances whereof that portion of the aerophone was finally constructed which is still known as the monk sound waves receiver whether as she alleged she made this discovery by pure accident or whether as seems possible she had thought the problem out in her own feminine fashion with results that proved excellent does not matter in the least the issue remains the same an apparatus which before would work only on rare occasionsand then without any certitudebetween people in the highest state of sympathy or nervous excitement has now been brought to such a stage of perfection that by its means anybody can talk to anybody even if their interests are antagonistic or their personal enmity bitter  after the first few experiments with this new material morris was not slow to discover that although it would need long and careful testing and elaboration for him it meant in the main the realisation of his great dream and success after years of failure andthat was the strange part of itthis realisation and success he owed to no effort of his own but to some chance suggestion made by mary he told her this and thanked her as a man thanks one through whom he has found salvation in answer she merely laughed saying that she was nothing but the wire along which a happy inspiration had reached his brain and that more than this she neither wished nor hoped nor was capable of being  then suddenly on this happy tranquil atmosphere which wrapped them aboutlike the sound of a passing bell at a childs feastfloated the first note of impending doom and death  the autumn held fine and mild and mary who had been lunching at the abbey was playing croquet with morris upon the side lawn this game was the only one for which she chanced to care perhaps because it did not involve much exertion morris who engaged in the pastime with the same earnestness that he gave to every other pursuit in which he happened to be interested was as might be expected getting the best of the encounter  wont you take a couple of bisques dear he asked affectionately after a while i dont like always beating you by such a lot  id die first she answered bisques are the badge of advertised inferiority and a mark of the givers contempt  stuff said morris  stuff indeed as though it wasnt bad enough to be beaten at all but to be beaten with bisques  thats another argument said morris first you say you are too proud to accept them and next that you wont accept them because it is worse to be defeated with points than without them  anyway if you had the commonest feelings of humanity you wouldnt beat me replied mary adroitly shifting her ground for the third time  how can i help it if you wont have the bisques  how by pretending that you were doing your best and letting me win all the same of course though if i caught you at it i should be furious but whats the use of trying to teach a blunt creature like you tact my dear morris i assure you i do not believe that your efforts at deception would take in the simplestminded cow why even dad sees through you and the person who cant impose upon my dad oh she added suddenly in a changed voice there is george coming through the gate something has happened to my father look at his face morris look at his face  in another moment the footman stood before them  please miss the master he began and hesitated  not dead said mary in a slow quiet voice do not say that he is dead  no miss but he has had a stroke of the heart or something and the doctor thought you had better be fetched so i have brought the carriage  come with me morris she said as dropping the croquet mallet she flew rather than ran to the brougham  ten minutes later they were at seaview in the hall they met mr charters the doctor why was he leaving because  no no he said answering their looks the danger is past he seems almost as well as ever  thank god stammered mary then a thought struck her and she looked up sharply and asked will it come back again  yes was his straightforward answer  when  from time to time at irregular periods but in its fatal shape as i hope not for some years  the verdict might have been worse dear said morris  yes yes but to think that it has passed so near to him and he quite alone at the time morris she went on turning to him with an energy that was almost fierce if you wont have my father to live with us i wont marry you do you understand  perfectly dear you leave no room for misconception by all means let him live with usif he can get on with my father he added meaningly  ah she replied i never thought of that also i should not have spoken so roughly but i have had such a shock that i feel inclined to treat you likelikea toad under a harrow so please be sympathetic and dont misunderstand me or i dont know what i shall say then by way of making amends mary put her arms round his neck and gave him a kiss all of her own accord saying morris i am afraidi am afraid i feel as if our good time was done  after this the servant came to say that she might go up to her fathers room and that scene of our drama was at an end  mr porson owned a villa at beaulieu in the south of france which he had built many years before as a winter house for his wife whose chest was weak here he was in the habit of spending the spring months more perhaps because of the associations which the place possessed for him than of any affection for foreign lands now however after this last attack three doctors in consultation announced that it would be well for him to escape from the fogs and damp of england so to beaulieu he was ordered  this decree caused consternation in various quarters mr porson did not wish to go mary and morris were cast down for simple and elementary reasons and colonel monk found this change of planit had been arranged that the porsons should stop at seaview till the new year which was to be the day of the marriageinconvenient and indeed disturbing once those young people were parted reflected the colonel in his wisdom who could tell what might or might not happen  in this difficulty he found an inspiration why should not the wedding take place at once very diplomatically he sounded his brotherinlaw to find that he had no opposition to fear in this quarter provided that mary and her husband would join him at beaulieu after a week or two of honeymoon then he spoke to morris who was delighted with the idea for morris had come to the conclusion that the marriage state would be better and more satisfactory than one of prolonged engagement  it only remained therefore to obtain the consent of mary which would perhaps have been given without much difficulty had her uncle been content to leave his son or mr porson to ask it of her as it chanced this he was not willing to do porson he was sure would at once give way should his daughter raise any objection and in morriss tact and persuasive powers the colonel had no faith  in the issue confident in his own diplomatic abilities he determined to manage the affair himself and to speak to his niece the mistake was grave for whereas she was as wax to her father or her lover something in her uncles manner or it may have been his very personality always aroused in mary a spirit of opposition on this occasion too that manner was not fortunate for he put the proposal before her as a thing already agreed upon by all concerned and one to which her consent was asked as a mere matter of form  instantly mary became antagonistic she pretended not to understand she asked for reasons and explanations finally she announced in idle words beneath which ran a current of determination that neither her father nor morris could really wish this hurried marriage since had they done so one or other of them would have spoken to her on the subject when pressed she intimated very politely but in language whereof the meaning could hardly be mistaken that she held this fixing of the date to be peculiarly her own privilege and when still further pressed said plainly that she considered her father too ill for her to think of being married at present  but they both desire it expostulated the colonel  they have not told me so mary answered setting her red lips  if that is all they will tell you so soon enough my dear girl  perhaps uncle after they have been directed to do so but that is not quite the same thing  the colonel saw that he had made a mistake and too late changed his tactics  you see mary your fathers state of health is precarious he might grow worse  she tapped her foot upon the ground of these allusions to the possible and indeed the certain end of her beloved fathers illness she had a kind of horror  in that event that dreadful event she answered he will need me my whole time and care to nurse him these i might not be able to give if i were already married i love morris very dearly i am his for whatever i may be worth but i was my fathers before morris came into my life and he has the first claim upon me  what then do you propose asked the colonel curtly for opposition and argument bred no meekness in his somewhat arbitrary breast  to be married on new years day wherever we are if morris wishes it and the state of my fathers health makes it convenient if not uncle richard to wait till a more fitting season then she rosefor this conversation took place at seaviewsaying that it was time she should give her father his medicine  thus the project of an early marriage fell through for having once been driven into announcing her decision in terms so open and unmistakable mary would not go back on her word  morris who was much disappointed pleaded with her her father also spoke upon the subject but though the voice was the voice of mr porson the arguments she perceived were the arguments of colonel monk therefore she hardened her heart and put the matter by refusing indeed to discuss it at any length yetand it is not the first time that a woman has allowed her whims to prevail over her secret wishesin truth she desired nothing more than to be married to morris so soon as it was his will to take her  finally a compromise was arranged there was to be no wedding at present but the whole party were to go together to beaulieu there to await the development of events it was arranged moreover by all concerned that unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent it the marriage should be celebrated upon or about new years day    chapter vii  beaulieu  beautiful as it might be and fashionable as it might be morris did not find beaulieu very entertaining indeed in an unguarded moment he confessed to mary that he hated the hole even the steam launch in which they went for picnics did not console him fond though he was of the sea while as for monte carlo after his third visit he was heard to declare that if they wanted to take him there again it must be in his coffin  the colonel did not share these views he was out for a holiday and he meant to enjoy himself to begin with there was the club at nice where he fell in with several old comrades and friends then whom should he meet but lady rawlins once for a little while in the distant past they had been engaged until suddenly the young lady a beauty in her day jilted him in favour of a wealthy banker of hebraic origin now many years after the banker was aged violent and uncomely habitually exceeded in his cups and abused his wife before the servants so it came about that to the poor woman the colonels courteous if somewhat sarcastic consolations were really very welcome it pleased him also to offer them the jilting he had long ago forgiven indeed he blessed her nightly for having taken that view of her obligations seeing that jane millet as she was then however pretty her face may once have been had neither fortune nor connections  yes my dear jane he said to her confidentially one afternoon i assure you i often admire your foresight now if you had done the other thing where should we have been today in the workhouse i imagine  i suppose so answered lady rawlins meekly and suppressing a sigh since for the courtly and distinguished colonel she cherished a sentimental admiration which actually increased with age but you didnt always think like that richard then she glanced out of the window and added oh there is jonah coming home and he looks so cross and the poor lady shivered  the colonel put up his eyeglass and contemplated jonah through the window he was not a pleasing spectacle a rather lowclass hebrew who calls himself a christian of unpleasant appearance and sinister temper suffering from the effects of lunch is not an object to be loved  ah i see said the colonel yes sir jonah ages doesnt he as indeed we do all of us and he glanced at the ladys spreading proportions then he went on you really should persuade him to be tidier in his costume jane his ancestral namesake could scarcely have looked more dishevelled after his sojourn with the whale well it is a small failing one cant have everything and on the whole with your wealth and the rest you have been a very fortunate woman  oh richard how can you say so murmured the wretched lady rawlins as she took the hand outstretched in farewell for jonah in large doses was more than the colonel could stomach  indeed as the door closed behind him she wiped away a tear whispering to herself and to think that i threw over dear richard in order to marry thatthatyes i will say itthat horror  meanwhile as he strolled down the street beautifully dressed and still looking very upright and handsomefor he had never lost his figurethe colonel was saying to himself  silly old woman well i hope that by now she knows the difference between a gentleman and a halfchristianised moneyhunting winebibbing jew however shes got the fortune which was what she wanted although she forgets it now and hes got a lachrymose stout old party but how beautiful she used to be my word how beautiful she used to be to go to see her now is better than any sermon it is an admirable moral exercise  to lady rawlins also the colonels visits proved excellent moral exercises tinged with chastenings whenever he went away he left behind him some aphorism or reflection filled with a wholesome bitter but still she sought his society and in secret adored him  in addition to the club and lady rawlins there were the tables at monte carlo with their motley company which to a man of the world could not fail to be amusing besides the colonel had one weaknesssometimes he did a little gambling and when he played he liked to play fairly high morris accompanied him once to the salles de jeu andthat was enough what passed there exactly could never be got out of him even by mary whose sense of humour was more than satisfied with the little comedies in progress about her no single point of which did she ever miss  only funny as she might be in her general feebleness and badly as she might have behaved in some distant past for lady rawlins she felt sorry her kind heart told mary that this unhappy person also possessed a heart although she was now stout and on the wrong side of middle age she was aware too that the colonel knew as much and his scientific pinpricks and searings of that guileless and unprotected organ struck her as little short of cruel none the less so indeed because the victim at the stake imagined that they were inflicted in kindness by the hand of a still tender and devoted friend  i hope that i shant quarrel with my fatherinlaw reflected mary to herself after one of the best of these exhibitions hes got an uncommonly long memory and likes to come even however i never shall because hes afraid of me and knows that i see through him  mary was right a very sincere respect for her martial powers when roused ensured perfect peace between her and the colonel with his son however it was otherwise even in this age of the triumph of the offspring parents do exist who take advantage of their sons strict observance of the fifth commandment it is easy to turn a man into a moral bolster and sit upon him if you know that an exaggerated sense of filial duty will prevent him from stuffing himself with pins so it came about that morris was sometimes sat upon especially when the colonel was suffering from a bad evening at the tables well out of sight and hearing of mary be it understood who on such occasions was apt to develop a quite formidable temper  it is over this question of the tables that one of these domestic differences arose which in its results brought about the return of the monks to monksland upon a certain afternoon the colonel asked his son to accompany him to monte carlo morris refused rather curtly perhaps  very well replied the colonel in his grandest manner i am sure i do not wish for an unwilling companion and doubtless your attention is claimed by affairs more important than the according of your company to a father  no replied morris with his accustomed truthfulness i am going out seafishing that is all  quite so allow me then to wish good luck to your fishing does mary accompany you  no i think not she says the boat makes her sick and she cant bear eels  so much the better as i can ask for the pleasure of her society this afternoon  yes you can ask said morris suddenly turning angry  do you imply morris that the request will be refused  certainly father if i have anything to do with it  and might i inquire why  because i wont have mary taken to that place to mix with the people who frequent it  i see this is exclusiveness with a vengeance perhaps you consider that those unholy doors should be shut to me also  i have no right to express an opinion as to where my father should or should not go but if you ask me i think that under all the circumstances you would do best to keep away  the circumstances what circumstances  those of our poverty which leaves us no money to risk in gambling  then the colonel lost all control of his temper as sometimes happened to him and became exceedingly violent and unpleasant what he said does not matter let it suffice that the remarks were of a character which even headstrong men are accustomed to reserve for the benefit of their womenfolk and other intimate relations  attracted by the noise which was considerable mary came in to find her uncle marching up and down the room vituperating morris who with quite a new expression upon his facea quiet dogged kind of expressionwas leaning upon the mantelpiece and watching him  uncle began mary would you mind being a little quieter my father is asleep upstairs and i am afraid that you will wake him  i am sorry my dear very sorry but there are some insults that no man with selfrespect can submit to even from a son  insults insults mary repeated opening her blue eyes then looking at him with a pained air morris why do you insult your father  insult he replied then i will tell you how my father wanted to take you to play with him at monte carlo this afternoon and i said that you shouldnt go thats the insult  you observe my dear broke in the colonel that already he treats you as one having authority  yes said mary and why shouldnt he now that my father is so weak who am i to obey if not morris  oh well well said the colonel diplomatically beginning to cool for he could control his temper when he liked everyone to their taste but some matters are so delicate that i prefer not to discuss them and he looked round for his hat  by this time however the cyclonic condition of things had affected mary also and she determined that he should not escape so easily  before you go she went on in her slow voice i should like to say uncle that i quite agree with morris i dont think those tables are quite the place to take young ladies to especially if the gentleman with them is much engaged in play  indeed indeed then you are both of a mind which is quite as it should be of course too upon such matters of conduct and etiquette we must all bow to the taste and the experience of the youngeven those of us who have mixed with the world for forty years might i ask my dear mary if you have any further word of advice for me before i go  yes uncle replied mary quite calmly i advise you not to lose so much ofof your money or to sit up so late at night which you know never agrees with you also i wish you wouldnt abuse morris for nothing because he doesnt deserve it and i dont like it and if we are all to live together after i am married it will be so much more comfortable if we can come to an understanding first  then muttering something beneath his breath about ladies in general and this young lady in particular the colonel departed with speed  mary sat down in an armchair and fanned herself with a pockethandkerchief  thinking of the right thing to say always makes me hot she remarked  well if by the right thing you mean the strong thing you certainly discovered it replied morris looking at her with affectionate admiration  i know but it had to be done dear hes losing a lot of money which is mere wastehere morris groaned but asked no questionsbesides and her voice became earnest i will not have him talking to you like that the fact that one man is the father of another man doesnt give him the right to abuse him like a pickpocket also if you are so good that you put up with it i have myself to considerthat is if we are all to live as a happy family do you understand  perfectly said morris i daresay you are right but i hate rows  so do i and that is why i have accepted one or two challenges to single combat quite at the beginning of things you mark my words he will be like a lamb at breakfast tomorrow  you shouldnt speak disrespectfully of my father at any rate to me suggested the oldfashioned morris rather mildly  no dear and when i have learnt to respect him i promise you that i wont there dont be vexed with me but my uncle richard makes me cross and then i scratch as he said the other day all women are like cats you know when they are young they play when they get old they use their clawsi quote uncle richardand although i am not old yet i cant help showing the claws dad is ill that is the fact of it morris and it gets upon my nerves  i thought he was better love  yes he is better he may live for years i hope and believe that he will but it is terribly uncertain and now look here morris why dont you go home  do you want to get rid of me love he asked looking up  no i dont you know that i am sure but what is the use of your stopping here there is nothing for you to do and i feel that you are wasting your time and that you hate it tell the truth dont you long to be back at monksland working at that aerophone  i should be glad to get on with my experiments but i dont like leaving you he answered  but you had better leave me for a while it is not comfortable for you idling here particularly when your father is in this uncertain temper if all be well in another couple of months or so we shall come together for good and be able to make our own arrangements according to circumstances till then if i were you i should go home especially as i find that i can get on with my uncle much better when you are not here  then what is to happen after we marry and i cant be sent away  who knows but if we are not comfortable at monks abbey we can always set up for ourselveswith dad at seaview for instance hes peaceable enough besides he must be looked after and to be frank my uncle hectors him poor dear  i will think it over said morris and now come for a walk on the beach and we will forget all these worries  next morning the colonel appeared at breakfast in a perfectly angelic frame of mind having to all appearance utterly forgotten the contretemps of the previous afternoon perhaps this was policy or perhaps the fact of his having won several hundred pounds the night before mollified his mood at least it had become genial and he proved a most excellent companion  look here old fellow he said to morris throwing him a letter across the table if you have nothing to do for a week or so i wish you would save an aged parent a journey and settle up this job with simpkins  morris read the letter it had to do with the complete reerection of a set of buildings on the abbey farm and the putting up of a certain drainage mill over this question differences had arisen between the agent simpkins and the rural authorities who alleged that the said mill would interfere with an established right of way indeed things had come to such a point that if a lawsuit was to be avoided the presence of a principal was necessary  simpkins is a quarrelsome ass explained the colonel and somebody will have to smooth those fellows down will you go because if you wont i must and i dont want to break into the first pleasant holiday i have had for five yearsthanks to your kindness my dear john  certainly i will go if necessary answered morris but i thought you told me a few months ago that it was quite impossible to execute those alterations on account of the expense  yes yes but i have consulted with your uncle here and the matter has been arranged hasnt it john  mr porson was seated at the end of the table and morris looking at him noticed with a shock how old he had suddenly become his plump cheerful face had fallen in the cheeks were quite hollow now his jaws seemed to protrude and the skin upon his bald head to be drawn quite tight like the parchment on a drum  of course of course colonel he answered lifting his chin from his breast upon which it was resting arranged quite satisfactorily arranged then he looked about rather vacantly for his mind it was clear was far away and added do you want i mean were you talking about the new drainage mill for the salt marshes mary interrupted and explained  yes yes how stupid of me i am afraid i am getting a little deaf and this air makes me so sleepy in the morning now just tell me again what is it  mary explained further  morris to go and see about it well why shouldnt he it doesnt take long to get home nowadays not but that we shall be sorry to lose you my dear boy or at least one of us will be sorry and he tried to wink in his old jovial fashion and chuckled feebly  mary saw and sighed while the colonel shook his head portentously nobody could play the part of jobs comforter to greater perfection  the end of it was that after a certain space of hesitation morris agreed to go this menage at beaulieu oppressed him and he hated the place besides mary seeing that he was worried almost insisted on his departure  if i want you back i will send for you she said go to your work dear you will be happier  so he kissed her fondly and wentas he was fated to go  goodbye my dear son said mr porsonsometimes he called him his son now i hope that i shall see you again soon and if i dont you will be kind to my daughter mary wont you you understand everybody else is deadmy wife is dead my boy is dead and soon i shall be dead so naturally i think a good deal about her you will be kind to her wont you goodbye my son and dont trouble about money theres plenty    chapter viii  the sunk rocks and the singer  morris arrived home in safety and speedily settled the question of the drainage mill to the satisfaction of all concerned but he did not return to beaulieu to begin with although the rural authorities ceased to trouble them his father was most urgent that he should stay and supervise the putting up of the new farm buildings and wrote to him nearly every day to this effect it occurred to his son that under the circumstances he might have come to look after the buildings himself also that perhaps he found the villa at beaulieu more comfortable without his presence a conjecture in which he was perfectly correct  upon the first point also letters from mary soon enlightened him it appeared that shortly after his departure sir jonah in a violent fit of rage brought on by drink and a remark of his wifes that had she married colonel monk she would have been a happy woman burst a small bloodvessel in his head with the strange result that from a raging animal of a man he had been turned into an amiable and perfectly harmless imbecile under so trying a domestic blow naturally mary explained colonel monk felt it to be his duty to support and comfort his old friend to the best of his ability this added mary he does for about three hours every day i believe indeed that a place is always laid for him at meals while poor sir jonah for whom i feel quite sorry although he was such a horrid man sits in an armchair and smiles at him continually  so morris determined to take the advice which mary gave him very plainly and abandoned all idea of returning to beaulieu at any rate on this side of christmas his plans settled he went to work with a will and was soon deeply absorbed in the manufacture of experimental receivers made from the new substance so completely indeed did these possess his mind that as mary at last complained his letters to her might with equal fitness have been addressed to an electrical journal since from them even diagrams were not lacking  so things went on until the event occurred which was destined profoundly and mysteriously to affect the lives of morris and his affianced wife that event was the shipwreck of the steam tramp trondhjem upon the wellknown sunk rocks outside the sands which run parallel to the coast at a distance of about five knots from the monksland cliff in this year of our story about the middle of november the weather set in very mild and misty it was the third of these roky nights and the seafog poured along the land like vapour from an opened jar of chemicals morris was experimenting at the forge in his workshop very lateor rather early for it was near to two oclock in the morningwhen of a sudden through the open window rising from the quiet sea beneath he heard the rattle of oars in rowlocks wondering what a boat could be doing so near inshore at a season when there was no night fishing he went to the window to listen presently he caught the sound of voices shouting in a tongue with which he was unacquainted followed by another sound that of a boat being beached upon the shingle immediately below the abbey now guessing that something unusual must have happened morris took his hat and coat and unlocking the abbots door lit a lantern and descended the cement steps to the beach here he found himself in the midst of ten or twelve men most of them tall and bearded who were gathered about a ships boat which they had dragged up high and dry one of these men who from his uniform he judged to be the captain approached and addressed him in a language that he did not understand but imagined must be danish or norwegian  morris shook his head to convey the blankness of his ignorance whereupon other men addressed him also in northern tongues then as he still shook his head a lad of about nineteen came forward and spoke in broken and barbarous french  naufrage la bas he said bateau a vapeur naufrage sur les rochersbrouillard nouse echappe  tous asked morris  the young man shrugged his shoulders as though he were doubtful on the point then added pointing to the boat  homme beaucoup blesse pasteur anglais  morris went to the cutter and holding up the lantern looked down to find an oldish man with sharp features dark eyes and grizzled beard lying under a tarpaulin in the bottom of the boat he was clothed only in a dressing gown and a bloodstained nightshirt groaning and semiunconscious  jambe casse beaucoup mal casse explained the french scholar  apportezle vite apres moi said morris this order having been translated by the youth several stalwart sailors lifted up the injured man and placing the tarpaulin beneath him took hold of it by the sides and corners then following morris they bore him as gently as they could up the steps into the abbey to a large bedroom upon the first floor where they laid him upon the bed  meanwhile by the industrious ringing of bells as they went morris had succeeded in rousing a groom a pageboy and the cook the first of these he sent off post haste for dr charters next having directed the cook to give the foreign sailormen some food and beer he told the pageboy to conduct them to the sailors home a place of refuge provided as is common upon this stormy coast for the accommodation of distressed and shipwrecked mariners as he could extract nothing further it seemed useless to detain them at the abbey then pending the arrival of the doctor with the assistance of the old housekeeper he set to work to examine the patient this did not take long for his injuries were obvious the right thigh was broken and badly bruised and he bled from a contusion upon the forehead this wound upon his head seemed also to have affected his brain at any rate he was unable to speak coherently or to do more than mutter something about shipwreck and steamer trondhjem and to ask for water  thinking that at least it could do no harm morris gave him a cup of soup which had been hastily prepared just as the patient finished drinking it which he did eagerly the doctor arrived and after a swift examination administered some anaesthetic and got to work to set the broken limb  its a bad smashvery bad he explained to morris something must have fallen on him i think if it had been an inch or two higher hed have lost his leg or his life or both as perhaps he will now at the best it means a couple of months or so on his back no i think the cut on his head isnt serious although it has knocked him silly for a while  at length the horrid work was done and the doctor who had to return to a confinement case in the village departed before he went he told morris that he hoped to be back by five oclock he promised also that before his return he would call in at the sailors home to see that the crew were comfortable and discover what he could of the details of the catastrophe meanwhile for his part morris undertook to watch in the sickroom  for nearly three hours while the drug retained his grip of him the patient remained comatose all this while morris sat at his bedside wondering who he might be and what curious circumstance could have brought him into the company of these rough northmen sailors to his profession he had a clue although no sure one for round his neck the man wore a silver cross suspended by a chain this suggested that he might be a clergyman and went far to confirm the broken talk of the frenchspeaking sailor clearly also he was a person of some breeding and position the refinement of his face and the delicacy of his hands showed as much while morris was watching and wondering suddenly the man awoke and began to talk in a confused fashion  where am i he asked  at monksland answered morris  thats all right thats where i should be but the ship the shipthen a pause and a cry stella stella  morris pricked his ears where is stella he asked  on the rocks she struck then darkness all darkness stella come here stella  a memory awoke in the mind of morris and he leant over the patient who again had sunk into delirium  do you mean stella fregelius he asked  the man turned his flushed face and opened his dark eyes  of course stella fregeliuswho else there is only one stella and again he became incoherent  for a while morris plied him with further questions but as he could obtain no coherent answer he gave him his medicine and left him quiet then for another halfhour or so he sat and watched while a certain theory took shape in his mind this gentleman must be the new rector it seemed as though probably accompanied by his daughter he had taken passage in a danish tramp boat bound for northwold which had touched at some northumbrian port morris knew that the incoming clergyman had a daughter for now that he thought of it he had heard mr tomley mention the fact at the dinnerparty on the night when he became engaged yes and certainly she was named stella but there was no woman among those who had come to land and he understood the injured man to suggest that his daughter had been left upon the steamer which was said to have gone ashore upon some rocks or perhaps upon the sunk rocks themselves  now the only rocks within twenty miles of them were these famous sunk rocks about six knots away even within his own lifetime four vessels had been lost there either because they had missed or mistaken the lightship signal further out to sea as sometimes happened in a fog such as prevailed this night or through false reckonings the fate of all these vessels had been identical they had struck upon the reef rebounded or slid off and foundered in deep water probably in this case the same thing had happened at least the facts so far as he knew them pointed to that conclusion evidently the escape of the crew had been very hurried for they had saved nothing he judged also that the clergyman mr fregelius having rushed on deck had been injured by the fall of some spar or block consequent upon the violence of the impact of the vessel upon the reef and in this hurt condition had been thrown into the boat by the sailors  then where was the daughter stella was she killed in the same fashion or drowned probably one or the other but there was a third bare possibility which did no credit to the crew that she had been forgotten in the panic and hurry and left behind on the sinking ship  at first morris thought of rousing the captain of the lifeboat on reflection however he abandoned this idea for really what had he to go on beyond the scanty and disjointed ravings of a delirious man very possibly the girl stella was not upon the ship at all probably also hours ago that vessel had vanished from the eyes of men for ever to send out the lifeboat upon such a wildgoose chase would be to turn himself into a laughingstock  still something drew his thoughts to that hidden line of reef and the ship which might still be hanging on it and the woman who might still be living in the ship  it was a painful vision from which he could not free his mind  then there came to him an idea why should he not go to the sunk rocks and look there was a light breeze off land and with the help of the pageboy who was sitting up as the tide was nearing its full he could manage to launch his small sailingboat which by good fortune was still berthed near the beach steps it was a curious chance that this should be so seeing that in most seasons she would have been by now removed to the shed a mile away to be out of reach of possible damage from the furious winter gales as it happened however the weather remaining so open this had not been done further the codlings having begun to run in unusual numbers as is common upon this coast in late autumn morris that very morning had taken the boat out to fish for them an amusement which he proposed to resume on the morrow in the hope of better sport therefore the boat had her sails on board and was in every way ready for sea  why should he not go for one reason only that he could suggest there was a certain amount of risk in sailing about the sunk rocks in a fog even for a tiny craft like his for here the currents were very sharp also in many places the points of the rocks were only just beneath the surface of the water but he knew the dangerous places well enough if he could see them as he ought to be able to do for the dawn should break before he arrived and after all what was a risk more or less in life he would go he felt impelledstrangely impelledto go though of course it was all nonsense and probably he would be back by nine oclock having seen nothing at all  by this time the injured mr fregelius had sunk into sleep or stupor doubtless beneath the influence of the second draught which he had administered to him in obedience to the doctors orders on his account therefore morris had no anxiety since the cook a steady middleaged woman could watch by him for the present  he called her and gave her instructions bidding her tell the doctor when he came that he had gone to see if he could make out anything more about the wreck and that he would be back soon then ordering the pageboy a stout lad to accompany him he descended the steps and together with some difficulty they succeeded in launching the boat now for a moment morris hesitated wondering whether he should take the young man with him but remembering that this journey was not without its dangers finally he decided to go alone  i am just going to have a sail round thomas to look if i can make out anything about that ship  yes sir remarked thomas doubtfully but it is rather a queer time to hunt for her and in this seahaze too especially round the sunk rocks shall i leave the lunch basket in the locker sir or take it up to the house  leave it it wasnt touched today and i might be glad of some breakfast morris answered then having hoisted his sail he sat himself in the stern with the tiller in one hand and the sheet in the other instantly the water began to lap gently against the bow and in another minute he glided away from the sight of the doubting thomas vanishing like some seaghost into the haze and that chill darkness which precedes the dawn  it was very dark and the mist was very damp and the wind what there was of it very cold especially as in his hurry he had forgotten to bring a thick ulster and had nothing but a covert coat and a thin oilskin to wear moreover he could not see in the least where he was going or do more than lay his course for the sunk rocks by means of the boats compass which he consulted from time to time by the help of a bullseye lantern  this went on for nearly an hour by the end of which morris began to wonder why he had started upon such a fools errand also he was growing alarmed he knew that by now he should be in the neighbourhood of the reef and fancied indeed that he could hear the water lapping against its rocks accordingly as this reef was ill company in the dark morris hauled down his sail and in case he should have reached the shallows threw out his little anchor which was attached to six fathoms of chain at first it swung loose but four or five minutes later the boat having been carried onward into fleeter water by the swift current that was one of the terrors of the sunk rocks it touched bottom dragged a little and held fast  morris gave a sigh of relief for that blind journey among unknown dangers was neither safe nor pleasant now at least in this quiet weather he could lie where he was till light came praying that a wind might not come first already the cold november dawn was breaking in the east he was able to see the reflection of it upon the fog and the surface of the water black and oilylooking became visible as it swept past the sides of his boat now too he was sure that the rocks must be close at hand for he could hear the running tide distinctly as it washed against them and through the dense growth of seaweed that clung to their crests and ridges  presently too he heard something else which at first caused him to rub his eyes in the belief that he must have fallen asleep and dreamt nothing less indeed than the sound of a womans voice he began to reason with himself what was there strange in this he was told or had inferred that a woman had been left upon a ship doubtless this was she upon some rock or raft perhaps only then she would have been crying for help and this voice was singing and in a strange tongue more sweetly than he had heard woman sing before  it was incredible it was impossible what woman would sing in a winter daybreak upon the sunk rockssing like the siren of old fable yet there quite close to him over the quiet sea rose the song strong clear and thrilling once it ceased then began again in a deeper more triumphant note such as a valkyrie might have sung as she led some norndoomed host to their last battle  morris sat and listened with parted lips and eyes staring at the fleecy mist he did not move or call out because he was certain that he must be the victim of some hallucination bred of fog or of fatigue or of cold and as it was very strange and moving he had no desire to break in upon its charm  so there he sat while the triumphant splendid song rolled and thrilled above him and by degrees the grey light of morning grew to right and left to right and left it grew but strangely enough although he never noted it at the time he and his boat lay steeped in shadow then of a sudden there was a change  a puff of wind from the north seemed to catch the fog and roll it up like a curtain so that instantly all the sea became visible broken here and there by roundheaded weeddraped rocks out of the east also poured a flood of light from the huge ball of the rising sun and now it was that morris learned why the gloom had been so thick about him for his boat lay anchored full in the shadow of the lost ship trondhjem there not thirty yards away rose her great prow the cutwater which stood up almost clear showing that she had forced herself on to a ridge of rock there too poised at the extreme point of the sloping forecastle and supporting herself with one hand by a wire rope that ran thence to the foremast was the woman to whose sirenlike song he had been listening  at that distance he could see little of her face but the newwakened wind blew the long dark hair about her head while round her falling almost to her naked feet was wrapped a full red cloak had morris wished to draw the picture of a vikings daughter guiding her fathers ship into the fray there down to the red cloak bare feet and flying tresses stood its perfect model  the wild scene gripped his heart whoever saw the like of it this girl who sang in the teeth of death the desolate grey face of ocean the brown and hungry rocks the huge abandoned ship and over all the angry rays of a winter sunrise  thus out of the darkness of the winter night out of the bewildering white mists of the morning did this woman arise upon his sight this strange new star begin to shine upon his life and direct his destiny  at the moment that he saw her she seemed to see him at any rate she ceased her ringing defiant song and leaning over the netting rail stared downwards  morris began to haul at his anchor but though he was a strong man at first he could not lift it just as he was thinking of slipping the cable however the little flukes came loose from the sand or weeds in which they were embedded and with toil and trouble he got it shipped then he took a pair of sculls and rowed until he was nearly under the prow of the trondhjem it was he too who spoke first  you must come to me he called  yes the woman answered leaning over the rail i will come but how shall i jump into the water  no he said it is too dangerous you might strike against a rock or be taken by the current the companion ladder seems to be down on the starboard side go aft to it i will row round the ship and meet you there  she nodded her head and morris started on his journey it proved perilous to begin with there were rocks all about also here the tide or the current or both ran with the speed of a millrace so that in places the sea bubbled and swirled like a boiling kettle however skilled and strong he might be it was hard for one man to deal with such difficulties and escape disaster still following the port side of the ship since owing to the presence of certain rocks he dared not attempt the direct starboard passage he came at last to her stern then he saw how imminent was the danger for the poop of the vessel which seemed to be of about a thousand tons burden was awash and waterlogged but rolling and lifting beneath the pressure of the tide as it drew on to flood  to morris who had lived all his life by the sea and understood such matters it was plain that presently she would float or be torn off the point of the rock on which she hung brokenbacked and sink in the hundredfathomdeep water which lay beyond the reef there was no time to spare and he laboured at his oars fiercely till at length partly by skill and partly by good fortune he reached the companion ladder and fastened to it with a boathook  now no woman was to be seen she had vanished morris called and called but could get no answer while the great dead carcass of the ship rolled and laboured above its towering mass of iron threatening to fall and crush him and his tiny craft to nothingness he shouted and shouted again then in despair lashed his boat to the companion and ran up the ladder  where could she have gone he hurried forward along the heaving jerking deck to the main hatchway here he hesitated for a moment then knowing that if anywhere she must be below set his teeth and descended the saloon was a foot deep in water which washed from side to side with a heavy sickening splash and there carrying a bag in one hand holding up her garments with the other and wading towards him from the dry upper part of the cabin at last he found the lady whom he sought  be quick he shouted for gods sake be quick the ship is coming off the rock  she splashed towards him now he had her by the hand now they were on the deck and now he was dragging her after him down the companion ladder they reached the boat and just as the ship gave a great roll towards them morris seized the oars and rowed like a madman  help me he gasped the current is against us and sitting opposite to him she placed her hands upon his hands pressing forward as he pulled her slight strength made a difference and the boat forged aheadthirty forty seventy yardstill they reached a rock to which exhausted he grappled with a hook bidding her hold on to the floating seaweed thus they rested for thirty seconds perhaps when she spoke for the first time  look she said  as she spoke the steamer slid and lifted off the reef for a few moments she wallowed then suddenly her stern settled her prow rose slowly in the air till it stood up straight fifty or sixty feet of it then with a majestic but hideous rush down went the trondhjem and vanished for ever  all round about her the sea boiled and foamed while in the great hollow which she made on the face of the waters black lumps of wreckage appeared and disappeared  tight hold tight he cried or she will suck us after her  suck she did till the water poured over the gunwale then the worst passed and the boat rose again the foam bubbles burst or floated away in little snowy heaps the sea resumed its level and save for the floating debris became as it had been for thousands of years before the lost trondhjem rushed downward to its depths  now for the first time knowing the immediate peril past morris looked at the face of his companion it was a fine face and beautiful in its way dark eyes very large and perfect whereof the pupils seemed to expand and contract in answer to every impulse of the thoughts within above the eyes long curving lashes and delicately pencilled arched eyebrows and above them again a forehead low and broad the chin rounded the lips full rich and sensitive the complexion of a clear and beautiful pallor the ears tiny the hands delicate the figure slim of medium height and alive with grace the general effect most uncommon and without being lovely breathing a curious power and personality  such was the woman whom he had saved from death  oh how splendid she said in her deep voice and clasping her hands what a death for ship or man what a death and after it the great calm sea taking and ready to take for ever  thank heaven that it did not take you answered morris wrathfully  why she answered  because you are still alive who by now would have been dead  it seems that it was not fated this time she answered adding the next it may be different  yes he said reflectively the next it may be different miss fregelius  she started how do you know my name she asked  from your fathers lips he is ashore at my house the sailors must have seen the light in my workshop and steered for it  my father she gasped he is still alive but oh how is that possible he would never have left me  yes he lives but with a broken thigh and his head cut open he was brought ashore senseless so you need not be ashamed of him those sailors are the cowards  she sighed as though in deep relief i am very glad i had made up my mind that he must be dead for of course i knew that he would never have left me otherwise it did not occur to me that he might be carried away senseless is he and she paused then added tell me the worstquick  no the doctor thinks in no danger at present only a break of the thigh and a scalp wound of course he could not help himself for he can have known no more than a corpse of what was passing he went on it is those sailors who are to blamefor leaving you on the ship i mean  she shrugged her shoulders contemptuously  the sailors from such rough men one does not expect much they had little time and thought of themselves not of a passenger whom they had scarcely seen thank god they did not leave my father behind also  you do not thank god for yourself said morris curiously as he prepared to hoist the sail for his mind harked back to his old wonderment  yes i do but it was not his will that i should die last night i have told you that it was not fated she answered  quite so that is evident now but were i in your case this really remarkable escape would make me wonder what is fated  yes it does a little but not too much for you see i shall learn in time you might as well wonder how it happened that you arrived to save me and to what end  morris hesitated for this was a new view of the case before he answered  that your life should be saved i suppose  and why should it happen that your boat should come to save me  i dont know chance i suppose  neither do i but i dont believe in chance everything has its meaning and purpose  only one so seldom finds it out life is too short i suppose replied morris  by now the sail was up the boat was drawing ahead and he was seated at her side holding the tiller  why did you go down into the saloon miss fregelius he asked presently  she glanced at herself and now for the first time he noticed that she wore a dress beneath her red cloak and that there were slippers on her feet which had been bare  i could not come into the boat as i was she explained dropping her eyes the costume which is good enough to be drowned in is not fitted for company my cabin was well forward and i guessed that by wading i could reach it also i had some trinkets and one or two books i did not wish to lose and she nodded at the handbag which she had thrown into the boat  morris smiled it is very nice of you to pay so much respect to appearances he said but i suppose you forgot that the vessel might come off the rocks at any moment and crush me who was waiting  oh no she answered i thought of it i have always been accustomed to the sea and know about such things  and still you went for your dress and your trinkets  yes because i was certain that it wouldnt happen and that no harm would come to either of us by waiting a few minutes  indeed and who told you that  i dont know but from the moment that i saw you in the boat i was certain that the danger was done withat least the immediate danger she added    chapter ix  miss fregelius  while miss fregelius was speaking morris had been staring at the sail which after drawing for a time in an indifferent fashion had begun to flap aimlessly  what is the matter asked his companion has the wind veered again  he nodded dead from the west now and rising fast i hope that your spirit of prophecy still speaks smooth things for upon my word i believe we are both of us in a worse mess than ever  cant we row ashore it is only a few miles is it  we can try but i am afraid we are in for a regular tearer we get them sometimes on this coast after a spell of calm weather  please give me an oar she said i am used to rowingof a sort  so he let down the sail and they began to row for ten minutes or so they struggled against the everrising gale then morris called to her to ship oars  it is no use exhausting ourselves miss fregelius he said for now the tide is on the ebb and dead against us as well as the wind  what are you going to do she asked  morris glanced back to where a mile behind them the sea was beginning to foam ominously over the sunk rocks here and there throwing up isolated jets of spray like those caused by the blowing of a whale  i am going to try to clear them he said and then run before it perhaps we might make the far lightship five and twenty miles away help me to pull up the sail so thats enough she cant stand too much now hold the sheet and if i bid you let go that instant ill steer  a few seconds later the boats head had come round and she was rushing through the water at great speed parallel with the line of the sunk rocks but being momentarily driven nearer to them the girl stella fregelius stared at the farthest point of foam which marked the end of the reef  you must hold her up if you want to clear it she said quietly  i cant do any more in this wind he answered you seem to know about boats you will understand  she nodded and on they rushed the everfreshening gale on their beam  this boat sails well said stella as a little water trickled over the gunwale  morris made no answer his eyes were fixed upon the point of rock only bidding his companion hold the tiller he did something to the sail now they were not more than five hundred yards away  it will be a very near thing she said  very he answered and i dont want to be officious but i suggest that you might do well to say your prayers  she looked at him and bowed her head for a minute or so then suddenly she lifted it again and stared at the terror ahead of them with wide unflinching eyes  on sped the boat while more and more did tide and gale turn her prow into the reef at the end of it a large humpbacked rock showed now and again through the surf like the fin of a black whale that was the rock which they must clear if they would live morris took the boathook and laid it by his side they were very near now they would clear it no the wash sucked them in like a magnet  goodbye said morris instinctively but stella answered nothing  the wave that lifted them broke upon the rock in a cloud of spray wherein for some few instants their boat seemed to vanish they were against it the boat touched and stella felt a long ribbon of seaweed cut her like a whip across the face kneeling down morris thrust madly with the boathook and thus for an instantjust oneheld her off his arms doubled beneath the strain and then came the backwash  oh heaven it had swept them clear the rock was behind the sail drew and swiftly they fled away from the death that had seemed certain  stella sighed aloud while morris wiped the water from his face  are we clear she asked presently  of the sunk rocks yes we are round them but the north sea is in front of us and what looks like the worst gale that has blown this autumn is rising behind  this is a good seaboat and on the open water i think perhaps that we ought to weather it she said trying to speak cheerfully as morris stowed the sail for in that wind they wanted no canvas  i wish we had something to eat she added presently i am so hungry  by good luck i can help you there he answered yesterday i was out fishing and took lunch for myself and the boatman but the fish wouldnt bite so we came back without eating it and it is still in the locker shift a little please i will get the basket  she obeyed and there was the food sure enough plenty of it a thick packet of sandwiches and two boiled eggs a loaf and a large lump of cheese for the boatman a flask of whiskey a bottle of beer another of water and two of soda they ate up the sandwiches and the eggs morris drinking the beer and stella the soda water for whiskey as yet she would not touch  now she said we are still provisioned for twentyfour hours with the bread and cheese the water and the soda which is left  yes he answered if we dont sink or die of cold we shall not starve i never thought that sandwiches were so good before and he looked hungrily at the loaf  you had better put it away you may want it later she suggested and he put it away  tell me if you dont mind he asked for the food and the lightening of the strain upon his nerves had made him conversational what is that song which you sang upon the ship and why did you sing it  she coloured a little and smiled a sweet smile that seemed to begin in her eyes  it is an old norse chant which my mother taught me she was a dane as my father is also by descent it has come down in her family for many many generations and the legend is that the women of her race always sang it or repeated it while the men were fighting and if they had the strength in the hour of their own death i believe that is true for she died whispering it herself yes it grew fainter and fainter until it ceased with her breath so when i thought that my hour had come i sang it also for the first time for i tried to be brave and wished to go as my forefathers went it is a foolish old custom but i like old customs i am ashamed that you should have heard it i thought myself alone that is all  you are a very strange young lady said morris staring at her  strange she answered laughing not at all only i wanted to show those scores of dead people that their traditions and spirit still lived on in me their poor modern child think how glad they must have been to hear the old chant as they swept by in the wind just now waiting to give me welcome  morris stared still harder was this beautiful girl mad he knew something of the old norse literature and myths a fantastic vision rose up in his mind of her forebears scores and hundreds of them gathered at some ghostly walhalla feast listening to the familiar paean as it poured from her fearless heart and waiting to rise and greet her the last newcomer of their blood with skoll daughter skoll  she watched him as though she read his thought  you see they would have been pleased it is only natural she said and i have a great respect for the opinion of my ancestors  then you are sure they still exist in some shape or form and are conscious  she laughed again of course i am sure the world of spirits as i think is the real world the rest is a nightmare at least it seems like a nightmare because we dont know the beginning or the end of the dream  the old egyptians thought something like that said morris reflectively they only lived to die  but we she answered should only die to live and that is why i try not to be afraid i daresay however i mean the same as they did only you do not seem to have put their thought quite clearly  you are right i meant that for them death was but a door  that is better i think she said that was their thought and that is my thought and she added searching his face perhaps your thought also  yes he answered though somehow you concentrate it i have never seen things or rather this thing quite so sharply  because you have never been in a position to see them they have not been brought home to you or your mind may have wanted an interpreter perhaps i am that interpreterfor the moment then she added were you afraid just now dont tell me if you had rather not only i should like to compare sensations i wasmore than on the ship i admit it  no he answered i suppose that i was too excited  what were you thinking of when we bumped against the rocks she asked again  well now that you mention it he replied rubbing his forehead with his left hand like a man newly awakened i could think of nothing but that song of yours which you sang upon the vessel everything grew dark for an instant and through the darkness i remembered the song  are you married she asked as though speaking to herself  no i am engaged  then why and she stopped confused  morris guessed what had been in her mind and of a sudden felt terribly ashamed  because of that witchsong of yours he answered with a flash of anger which made me forget everything  she smiled and answered it wasnt the song it was the excitement and struggle which blotted out the rest one does not really think at all at such moments or so i believe i know that i didnt not just when we bumped against the rock but it is odd that you should believe that you remembered my song for according to tradition that is just what the chant should do and what it always did its ancient name means the overlord because those who sang it and those who heard it were said to remember nothing else and to fear nothing not even death our lord it is the welcome that they give to death  what egregious nonsense he blurted out  i daresay but then why do you understand my nonsense so well tell me if you will of what blood are you  danish i believe in the beginning  oh she said laughing no doubt that accounts for it some forefather of yours may have heard the song of the overlord perhaps from the lips of some foremother of mine so of course you remembered and understood  such a thing will scarcely bear argument will it  of course it wont i have only been joking all the time though i do half believe in this old song as my ancestors did before me i mean that as i thought i had to die i liked to keep up the ancient custom and sing it first it encouraged my spirits but where are we going  to where our spirits will need no more encouragement he answered grimly or at least i fear it may be so miss fregelius to drop jests it is blowing very hard off land the sea is getting up and this is but a small boat we are doing pretty well now but sooner or later i fear and i think it right to tell you that a wave may poop us and then  there will be an end said stella is there anything to be done have you any plan  none except to make the far lightship as i told you but even if we succeed i dont know whether it will be possible to get aboard of her unless the sea moderates  wont the lifeboat come out to look for you she asked  he shook his head how could they find one tiny sail upon the great ocean moreover it will be supposed either that i have foundered or made some port along the coast there is the worst of it i fear that it may be telegraphed everywhere and he sighed deeply  why she asked are you a very important person that they should bother to do that you see she added in explanation i dont even know your name or where you come from only that you told me you worked in a shop which she added reflectively looking at him seems odd  even then and there morris could not help a smile really this young lady was very original  no he answered i am not at all important and i work in a shop because i am an inventoror try to bein the electrical line my name is morris monk and i am the son of colonel monk and live at the abbey house monksland now you know all about me  oh of course i do mr monk she said in some confusion how foolish of me not to guess you are my fathers principal new parishioner of whom mr tomley gave us a full description  did he indeed what did he say he asked idly  do you really want to know mr monk  yes if it is amusing just now i shall be grateful for anything that can divert my thoughts  and you will promise not to bear malice against mr tomley  certainly especially as he has gone away and i dont expect to see him any more  well he described your father colonel monk as a handsome and distinguished elderly gentleman of very good birth and manners too when he chose who intensely disliked growing old he said that he thought of himself more than of anybody else in the world and next of the welfare of his family and that if we wished to get on with him we must be careful not to offend his dignity as then he would be quarrelsome  thats true enough or most of it answered morris a good picture of my fathers weak side and what was his definition of myself  he said that you were in his opinion one of the most interesting people that he had ever met that you were a dreamer and a mystic that you cared for few of the things which usually attract young men and that you were in practice almost a misogynist he added that although heretofore you had not succeeded he thought that you possessed real genius in certain lines but that you had not your fathers courtly air that was his term of course i am only repeating so you must not be angry  well said morris i asked for candour and i have got it without admitting the accuracy of his definitions i must say that i never thought that pompous old tomley had so much observation then he added quickly to change the subject since the possible discussion of his own attributes physical or mental alarmed him miss fregelius you have not told me how you came to be left aboard the ship  really mr monk i dont know i heard a confused noise in my sleep and when i woke up it was to find myself alone and the saloon half full of water i suppose that after the vessel struck the sailors thinking that she was going down got off at once taking my father who had been injured and made insensible in some way with them as he happened to be on deck leaving me to my chance you know we were the only passengers  were you not frightened when you found yourself all alone like that  yes at first dreadfully then i was so distressed about my father whom i thought dead and angry with them for deserting me that i forgot to be frightened and afterwardswell i was too proud besides we must die alone every one of us so we may as well get accustomed to the idea  morris shrugged his shoulders impatiently  you think that i need not talk so much about our mortal end well perhaps under all the circumstances we may as well keep our thoughts on this worldwhile it lasts you have not told me mr monk how you came to be sailing about alone this morning did you come out to look at the wreck  do you think that i am mad he asked not without indignation should i make a journey at night in a november fog with every chance of a gale coming up to the sunk rocks in this cockleshell and alone merely to look at the place where as i understood rather vaguely a foreign tramp steamer had gone down  well it does seem rather odd but why else did you come were you fishing men will risk a great deal for fishing i know i have seen that in norway  why do you pretend not to understand miss fregelius you must know perfectly well that i came to look for you  indeed she answered candidly i knew nothing of the sort how did you find out that i was still on the ship or that the ship was still above water and even if you knew both why should you risk your life just on the faint chance of rescuing a girl whom you never saw  i cant quite tell you but your father in his delirium muttered some words which made me suspect the truth and a sailor who could speak a little bad french said that the trondhjem was lost upon some rocks well these are the only rocks about here and as the whole story was too vague to carry to the lifeboat people i thought that i would come to look so you see it is perfectly simple  so simple mr monk that i do not understand it in the least you must have known the risks for you asked no one to share themthe risks that are so near and real and shivering visibly she looked at the grey combers seething past them and the windtorn horizon beyond yet youyou who have ties faced all this on the chance of saving a stranger  please please broke in morris at any rate you see it was a happy inspiration  yes for me perhapsbut for you oh if it should end in your being taken away from the world before your time from the world and the lady whowhat then  morris winced then he said gods will be done but although we may be in danger we are not dead yet not by a long way  she would hate me whose evil fortune it was to draw you to death and in life or out of it i should never forgive myselfnever never and she covered her eyes with her cold wet hand and sighed  why should you grieve over what you cannot help asked morris gently  i cannot quite explain to you she answered but the thought of it seems so sad    chapter x  dawn and the land  a day a whole day spent upon that sullen sunless waste of water with the great waves bearing them onwards in one eternal monotonous procession till at length they grew dizzy with looking at them and the ceaseless gale piping in their ears long ago they had lost sight of land even the tall church towers built by our ancestors as beacons on this stormy coast had vanished utterly twice they sighted ships scudding along under their few rags of canvas and once a steamer passed the smoke from her funnels blowing out like long black pennons but all of these were too far off or too much engaged with their own affairs to see the little craft tossing hither and thither like a usedup herring basket upon the endless area of ocean  fortunately from his youth morris had been accustomed to the management of boats in all sorts of weather the occupation of sailing alone upon the waters being one well suited to his solitary and reflective disposition thus it came about that they survived when others less skilful might have drowned sometimes they ran before the seas sometimes they got up a few square feet of sail and taking advantage of a veer in the wind tried to tack and once when it blew its hardest fearing lest they should be pooped for over an hour they contrived to keep head on to the waves  thus diversified by some necessary bailing passed the short november day long enough for them till once more the darkness began to gather they had still some food and drink left indeed had it not been for these they would have perished most happily also with the sun the wind dropped although for hours the sea remained dangerously high now wet and cold were their enemies worse than any that they had been called upon to face long ago the driving spray had soaked them to the skin and there upon the sea the winter night was very chill  while the wind fortunately for them by comparison a warm one still blew from the west and the sea remained tempestuous they found some shelter by wrapping themselves in a corner of the sail towards midnight however it got round to the northeast enough of it to moderate the sea considerably and to enable them to put the boat about and go before it with a closely reefed sail now indeed they were bitterly cold and longed even for the shelter of the wet canvas still morris felt and stella was of the same mind that before utter exhaustion overtook them their best chance for life lay in trying to make the shore which was they knew not how far away  there then for hours they cowered in the stern of the boat huddled together to protect themselves as best they might from the weather and plunging forward beneath their little stretch of sail sleep they could not for that icy breath bit into their marrow and of this morris was glad since he did not dare relax his watch for an instant so sometimes they sat silent and sometimes by fits and starts they talked their lips close to each others face as though they were whispering to one another  to while away the weary time morris told his companion about his invention the aerophone then she in turn told him something of her previous lifestella was now a woman of four and twenty it seemed that her mother had died when she was fourteen at the rectory in northumberland where she was born after that with short intervals she had spent five years in denmark whither her father came to visit her every summer most of this time she passed at a school in copenhagen going for her holidays to stay with her grandmother who was the widow of a small landowner of noble family and lived in an ancient dilapidated house in some remote village at length the grandmother died leaving to stella the trifle she possessed after which her education being completed she returned to northumberland to keep house for her father here too it would seem that her life was very lonely for the place was but an unvisited coast village and they were not rich enough to mix much with the few county families who lived anywhere within reach  have you no brothers or sisters asked morris  even then numb as was her flesh with cold he felt her wince at the question  no no she answered none nowat least none here i havei mean i hada sister my twin but she died when we were seventeen this was the most dreadful thing that ever happened to me the thing which made me what i am  i dont quite understand what are you then  oh something very unsatisfactory i am afraid quite different from other people what mr tomley said you were mr monk a mystic and a dreamer of dreams a lover of the dead one who dwells in the past andin the future  morris did not pursue the subject even under their strange circumstances favourable as they were to intimacy and confidences it seemed impertinent to him to pry into the mysteries of his companions life only he asked at hazard almost  how did you spend your time up there in northumberland  in drawing a little in collecting eggs moths and flowers a great deal in practising with my violin playing and singing and during the long winters in making translations in my spare time of norse sagas which no one will publish  i should like to read them i am fond of the sagas he said and after this under pressure of their physical misery the conversation died away  hour succeeded to hour and the weather moderated so much that now they were in little danger of being swamped this indeed was fortunate since in the event of a squall or other emergency in their numbed condition it was doubtful whether they could have found enough strength to do what might be necessary to save themselves they drank what remained of the whiskey which put life into their veins for a while but soon its effects passed off leaving them if possible more frozen than before  what is the time asked stella after a long silence  it should be daybreak in about two hours he said in a voice that attempted cheerfulness  then a squall of sleet burst upon them and after this new misery a torpor overcame stella at least her shiverings grew less violent and her head sank upon his shoulder morris put one arm round her waist to save her from slipping into the water at the bottom of the boat making shift to steer with the other thus for a while they ploughed forwardwhither he knew not across the inky sea for there was no moon and the stars were hidden driven on slowly by the biting breath of the winter wind  presently she awoke lifted her head and spoke saying  we cant last much longer in this cold and wet you are not afraid are you  no not exactly afraid only sorry it is hard to go with so much to be done andto leave behind  you shouldnt think like that she answered for what we leave must follow she will suffer but soon she will be with you again where everything is understood only you ought to have died with her and not with me a stranger  fate settles these things he muttered and if it comes to that maybe god will give her strength but the dawn is near and by it we may see land  yes yesnow her voice had sunk to a whisperthe dawn is always near and by it we shall see land  then again stellas head sank upon his shoulder and she slept heavily nor although he knew that such slumbers are dangerous did he think it worth while to disturb her  the invisible seas hissed past the sharp wind bit his bones and over him too that fatal slumber began to creep but although he seldom exercised it morris was a man of strong will and while any strength was left he refused to give way would this dreadful darkness never end for the fiftieth time he glanced back over his shoulder and now he was sure of it the east grew ashen he waited awhile for the november dawn is slow in breaking then looked again heaven be thanked the cold wind had driven away the clouds and there upon the edge of the horizon peeped up the fiery circle of the sun throwing long rays of sickly yellow across the grey troubled surface of the waters in front of him lay a dense bank of fog which from its character as morris knew well must emanate from the reeking face of earth they were near shore it could not be doubted still he did not wake his companion perhaps he might be in error and sleep even a deathsleep is better than the cheatings of disappointed hope  what was that dim object in front of him surely it must be the ruin a mile or so to the north of monksland that was known as the death church once a village stood here but the sea had taken most of it indeed all that remained today was this old deserted fane which having been built upon a breast of rising ground still remained awaiting its destruction by the slow sap of the advancing ocean even now at times of very high tide the sea closed in behind cutting the fabric off from the mainland where it looked like a forsaken lighthouse rather than the tower and chancel of a church but there not much more than a mile away yes there it was and morris felt proud to think how straight he had steered homewards through that stormy darkness  the sea was still wild and high but he was familiar with every inch of the coast and knew well that there was a spot to the south of the dead church just where the last rood of graveyard met the sand upon which he could beach the boat safely even in worse weather for this nook morris headed with a new energy the fires of life and hope burnt up in him giving him back his strength and judgment  at last they were opposite to the place and watching his chance he put the helm down and ran in upon the crest of a wave till the boat grounded in the soft sand and began to wallow there like a dying thing fearing lest the backwash should suck them off into the surf again he rolled himself into the water for jump he could not indeed it was as much as he could do to stand with a last effort of his strength he seized stella in his arms and struggled with her to the sandy shore where he sank down exhausted then she woke oh i dreamed i dreamed she said staring round her wildly  what he asked  that it was all over and afterwards that i and she broke off suddenly adding but it was all a dream for we are safe on shore are we not  yes thank heaven said morris sit still and i will make the boat secure she has served us a good turn and i do not want to lose her after all  she nodded and wading into the water with numbed hands he managed to lift the little anchor and carry it ashore in his arms  there he said the tide is ebbing and shell hold fast enough until i can send to fetch her or if not it cant be helped come on miss fregelius before you grow too stiff to walk and bending down he helped her to her feet  their road ran past the nave of the church which was ruined and unroofed at some time during the last two generations however although the parishioners saw that it was useless to go to the cost of repairing the nave they had bricked in the chancel and to within the last twenty years continued to use it as a place of worship indeed the old oak door taken from the porch still swung on rusty hinges in the partition wall of red brick stella looked up and saw it  i want to look in there she said  wouldnt it do another time the moment did not strike morris as appropriate for the examination of ruined churches  no if you dont mind i should like to look now while i remember just for one instant  so he shrugged his shoulders and they limped forward up the roofless nave and through the door she stared at the plain stone altar at the eastern window of which part was filled with ancient coloured glass and part with cheap glazed panes at the oak choir benches mouldy and broken at the few wallslabs and decaying monuments and at the roof still strong and massive  i dreamed of a place very like this she said nodding her head i thought that i was standing in such a spot in a fearful gale and that the sea got under the foundations and washed the dead out of their graves  really miss fregelius he said with some irritation for the surroundings of the scene and his companions talk were uncanny do you think this an occasion to explore ruins and relate nightmares then he added i beg your pardon but i think that the cold and wet have affected your nerves for my part i have none left  perhaps at least forgive me i did so want to look she answered humbly as arminarm for she needed support they passed from the altar to the door  a grotesque imagination entered the numbed mind of morris their slow and miserable march turned itself to a vision of a bridal procession from the altar wet dishevelled halffrozen they two were the bridegroom and the bride and the bride was a seer of visions and the bridegroom was a dreamer of dreams yes and they came up together out of the bitter sea and the darkness and they journeyed together to a vault of the dead  thank heaven they were out of the place and above was the sun shining and to the right and left the grey ocean and the purple ploughlands coldlooking suggesting dangers and labour but wholesome all of them and good to the eye of man only why did this woman see visions and why did he dream dreams and what was the meaning of their strange meeting upon the sea and what  where are we going asked stella after a while and very faintly  home to the abbey i mean where your father lies now it is not much more than a mile away  she sighed her strength was failing her  you had better try to walk it will warm you he urged and she struggled on  it was a miserable journey but they reached the house at length passing first through a street of the village in which no one seemed to be awake a wretchedlooking couple they stumbled up the steps into the porch where morris rang the bell for the door was locked the time seemed an age but at last steps were heard the door was unbarred and there appeared a vision of the lad thomas yawning and clad in a nightshirt and a pair of trousers with braces attached which dangled to the floor  oh lord he said when he saw them and his jaw dropped  get out of the way you young idiot said morris and call the cook    it was halfpast seven in the evening that is dinner time and morris stood in the study waiting for stella who had announced through the housemaid that she was coming down  after telling the servants to send for the doctor and attend to his companion who had insisted upon being led straight to her fathers room morriss first act that morning on reaching home was to take a bath as hot as he could bear then he drank several cups of coffee with brandy in it and as the office would soon be open wrote a telegram to mary which ran thus   if you hear that i have been drowned dont believe it have arrived safe home after a night at sea   this done for he guessed that all sorts of rumours would be abroad he inquired after mr fregelius and stella having learned that they were both going on well and sent off his telegram morris went to bed and slept for ten hours    morris looked round the comfortable sittingroom with its recessed tudor windows its tall bookcases and open hearth where burned a bright fire of old ships timbers supported on steel dogs and thought to himself that he was fortunate to be there then the door opened he heard the housemaids voice say this way please miss and stella came in she wore a plain white dress that seemed to fit her very well though where she got it from he never discovered and her luxuriant hair was twisted up into a simple knot on the bosom of her dress was fixed a spray of brilliant ampelopsis leaves it was her only ornament but none could have been more striking for the rest although she limped and still looked dark and weary about the eyes to all appearances she was not much the worse for their terrible adventure  morris glanced at her could this dignified and lovely young lady be that redcloaked loosehaired valkyrie whom he had seen singing at daybreak upon the prow of the sinking ship or the piteous bedraggled person whom he had supported from the altar in the dead church  she guessed his thoughtfrom the beginning stella had this curious power of discovering his mindand said with a smile  fine feathers make fine birds and even cleopatra would have looked dreadful after a november night in an open boat  have you recovered he asked  yes mr monk that is i dont think i am going to have inflammation of the lungs or anything horrid of the sort the remedies and that walk stopped it but my feet are peeling from being soaked so long in salt water and my hands are not much better see and she held them towards him  then dinner was announced and for the second time that day they walked arminarm  it seems a little strange doesnt it suggested morris as he surveyed the great refectory in which they two seated at the central table looked so lone and small  yes she answered but so it should anything quite usual would have been out of place today  then he asked her how her father was going on and heard what he had already learned from the doctor that he was doing as well as could be expected  by the way mr monk she added if you can spare a few minutes after dinner and are not too tired he would so much like to see you  of course answered morris a little nervously for he scented a display of fervent gratitude  after this they dropped into desultory conversation curiously different from the intimate talk which passed between them in the boat then they had been in danger and at times in the very shadow of death a condition that favours confidences since those who stand beneath his wings no longer care to hide their hearts the reserves which so largely direct our lives are lifted their necessity is past and in the face of the last act of nature nature asserts herself who cares to continue to play a part when the audience has dispersed the curtain is falling and the paybox has put up its shutters now very unexpectedly these two were on the stage again and each assumed the allotted role  stella admired the room whereon morris set to work to explain its characteristics to find to his astonishment that miss fregelius had more knowledge of architecture than he could boast he pointed out certain details alleging them to be elizabethan work to which age they had been credited for generations whereon she suggested and indeed proved that some of them dated from the earlier years of henry viii and that some were late jacobean while morris was wondering how he could combat this revolutionary opinion the servant brought in a telegram it was from mary at beaulieu and ran   had not heard that you were drowned but am deeply thankful that you are saved why did you pass a night at sea in this weather is it a riddle grieved to say my father not so well best love and please keep on shore mary   at first morris was angry with this rather flippant message then he laughed as he had already discovered in fact his anxieties had been quite groundless the pageboy thomas it appeared when questioned had given the inquirers to understand that his master had gone out to fish taking his breakfast with him later on his nonappearance he amended this statement suggesting out of the depths of a fertile imagination that he had sailed down to northwold where he meant to pass the night therefore although the cook a farseeing woman who knew her thomas and hated him had experienced pangs of doubt nobody else troubled the least and even the small community of monksland remained profoundly undisturbed as to the fate of one of its principal inhabitants  so little is an unsympathetic world concerned in our greatest and most particular adventures a birth a marriage an inquest a scandalthese move it superficially for the rest it has no enthusiasm to spare this cold neglect of events which had seemed to him so important reacted upon morris who now that he had got over his chill and fatigue saw them in their proper proportions a little adventure in an open boat at sea which had ended without any mishap was not remarkable and might even be made to appear ridiculous so the less said about it especially to mary whose wit he feared the better  when dinner was finished stella left the room passing down its shadowed recesses with a peculiar grace of which even her limp could not rob her ten minutes later while morris sat sipping a glass of claret the nurse came down to tell him that mr fregelius would like to see him if he were disengaged reflecting that he might as well get the interview over morris followed her at once to the abbots chamber where the sick man lay  except for a single lamp near the bed the place was unlighted but by the fire its glow falling on her whitedraped form and pale uncommon face sat stella as he entered she rose and coming forward accompanied him to the bedside saying in an earnest voice  father here is our host mr monk the gentleman who saved my life at the risk of his own  the patient raised his bandaged head and stretched out a long thin hand he could stir nothing else for his right thigh was in splints beneath a cofferlike erection designed to keep the pressure of the blankets from his injured limb  sir i thank you he said in a dry staccato voice all the humanity that is lacking from the hearts of those rude wretches the crew of the trondhjem must have found its home in you  morris looked at the dark quiet eyes that seemed to express much which the thin and impassive face refused to reveal at the grey pointed beard and the yellowish skin of the outstretched arm here before him he felt lay a man whose personality it was not easy to define one who might be foolish or might be able but of whose character the leading note was reticence inherent or acquired then he took the hand and said simply  pray say no more about it i acted on an impulse and some wandering words of yours with results for which i could not hope there is nothing to thank me for  then sir i thank god who inspired you with that impulse and may every blessing reward your bravery  stella looked up as though to speak but changed her mind and returned to her seat by the fire  what is there to reward said morris impatiently that your daughter is still alive is my reward how are you tonight mr fregelius    chapter xi  a morning service  mr fregelius replied he was as well as could be expected that the doctor said no complications were likely to ensue but that here upon this very bed he must lie for at least two months that he added is a sad thing to have to say to a man into whose house you have drifted like a log into a pool of the rocks  it is not my house but my fathers who is at present in france answered morris but i can only say on his behalf that both you and your daughter are most welcome until you are well enough to move to the rectory  why should i not go there at once interrupted stella i could come each day and see my father  no no certainly not said morris how could you live alone in that great empty house  i am not afraid of being alone she answered smiling but let it be as you like mr monkat any rate until you grow tired of us and change your mind  then mr fregelius told morris what he had not yet heardthat when it became known that they had deserted stella leaving her to drown in the sinking ship the attentions of the inhabitants of monksland to the cowardly foreign sailors became so marked that their consul at northwold had thought it wise to get them out of the place as quickly as possible while this story was in progress stella left the room to speak to the nurse who had been engaged to look after her father at night  afterwards at the request of mr fregelius morris told the tale of his daughters rescue in the course of it he mentioned how he found her standing on the deck of the sinking ship and singing a norse song which she had informed him was an ancient deathdirge  the old clergyman turned his head and sighed  what is the matter asked morris  nothing mr monk only that song is unlucky in my family and i hoped that she had forgotten it  morris looked at him blankly  you dont understandhow should you but mr monk there are strange things and strange people in this world and i think that my daughter stella is one of the strangest of them fey like the restonly a fey norse woman would sing in such a moment  again morris looked at him  oh it is an old northern term and means foreseeing and foredoomed to my knowledge her grandmother her mother and her sister all three of them sang or repeated that song when in some imminent danger to their lives and all three of them were dead within the year the coincidence is unpleasant  surely said morris with a smile you who are a clergyman can scarcely believe in such superstition  no i am not superstitious and i dont believe in it but the thing recalls unhappy memories they have been deathlovers all of them i never heard of a case of one of that family who showed the slightest fear at the approach of death and some have greeted it with eagerness  well said morris would not that mean only that their spiritual sight is a little clearer than ours and their faith a little stronger theoretically we should all of us wish to die  quite so yet we are human and dont but she is safe thanks to you who but for you would now be gone my head is still weak from that blowyou must pay no attention to me i think that i hear stella coming you will say nothing to herabout that song i meanwill you we never talk of it in my family  when still stiff and sore from his adventure in the open boat morris went to bed it was clear to his mind after careful consideration that fortune had made him the host of an exceedingly strange couple of mr fregelius he was soon able to form an estimate distinct enough although for aught he knew it might be erroneous the clergyman struck him as a person of some abilities who had been doomed to much disappointment and suffered from many sorrows doubtless his talents had not proved to be of a nature to advance him in the world probably indeedand here morriss hazard was correcthe was a scholar and a bookworm without individuality to whom fate had assigned minor positions in a profession which however sincere his faith he was scarcely fitted to adorn  the work of a clergyman in a country parish if it is to succeed should be essentially practical and this man was not practical clearly thought morris he was one of those who beat their wings against the bars with the common result it was the wings that suffered the bars only grew a trifle brighter then it seemed that he had lost a wife to whom he was attached and the child who remained to him although he loved her and clung to her he did not altogether understand so it came about perhaps that he had fallen under the curses of loneliness and continual apprehension and in this shadow where he was doomed to walk flourished forebodings and regrets drawing their strength from his starved nature like fungi from a tree outgrown and fallen in the forest  mr fregelius so thought morris was timid and reticent because he dared not discover his heart that had been so sorely trampled by fate and fortune yet he had a heart which if he could find a confessor whom he could trust he longed to ease in confidence for the rest the mans physical frame not too robust at any time was shattered and with it his nervesudden shipwreck painful accident the fierce alternatives of hope and fear then at last a delirium of joy at the recovery of one whom he thought dead had done their work with him and in this broken state some ancient secret superstition became dominant and strive as he would to suppress it even in the presence of a stranger had burst from his lips in hints of unsubstantial folly  such was the father or such he appeared to morris but of the daughter what could be said without doubt she was a woman of strange and impressive power at this very moment her sweet voice touched with that continual note of pleading still echoed in his brain and the dark quiet eyes that now slept and now shone large as her thoughts fled through them like some mysterious sky at night in which the summer lightning pulses intermittently who might forget those eyes that once had seen them already he wished to be rid of their haunting and could not then her beautyhow unusual it was yet how rich and satisfying to the eye and sense in some ways almost eastern notwithstanding her norse blood  often morris had read or heard of the bewildering power of women which for his part hitherto he had been inclined to attribute to shallow and very common causes such as underlie all animate nature yet that of stellafor undoubtedly she had powersuggested another interpretation to his mind or was it after all nothing but a variant one of the protean shapes of the ancient lifecompelling mystery and her strange chant the song of which her father made light but feared so much her quick insight into the workings of his own thought her courage in the face of danger and sharp physical miseries her charm her mastery what was he to make of them lastly why did he think so much about her it was not his habit where strangers were concerned and why had she awakened in his somewhat solitary and secluded mind a sympathy so unusual that it seemed to him that he had known her for years and not for hours  pondering these things and the fact that perhaps within the coming weeks he would find out their meaning morris went to sleep when he awoke next morning his mood had changed somewhat vaguely he remembered his perturbations of the previous night indeed but now they only moved him to a smile their reasons were so obvious such exaggerated estimates and thoughts follow strange adventuresand in all its details this adventure was very strangeas naturally as nightmares follow indigestion  presently thomas came to call him and brought up his letters among them one from mary containing nothing in particular for of course it had been despatched before her telegram but written in her usual humorous style which made him laugh aloud  there was a postscript to the letter screwed into the unoccupied space between the date line and the dearest morris at its commencement it ran   how would you like to spend our honeymoon in a yacht in the mediterranean i think that would do there is nothing like solitude in a wretched little boat to promote mutual understanding if your devotion could stand the strain of a dishevelled and seasick spouse our matrimonial future has no terrors for your loving mary   as morris read he ceased to laugh yes he thought to himself solitude in a wretched little boat does promote mutual understanding i am not certain that it does not promote it too much then with an access of irritation bother the people i wish i could be rid of them the whole thing seems likely to become a worry  next he took up a letter from his father which when perused did not entertain him in the least there was nothing about lady rawlins in it of whom he longed to hear or thought that he did nothing about that entrancing personality the bibulous and violent sir jonah now so meek and lamblike but plenty whole pages indeed as to details connected with the estate also it contained a goodly sprinkling of sarcasms and grumblings at his morriss bad management of various little matters which the colonel considered important most of all however was his parent indignant at his neglect to furnish him with details sufficiently ample of the progress of the new buildings lastly he desired by return of post a verbatim report of the quarrel that as he was informed had occurred on the school board when a prominent roman catholic threatened to throw an inkstand at a dissenting minister who coram populo called him the son of a babylonian woman  by the time that morris had finished this epistle and two others which accompanied it he was in no mood for further reflections of an unpractical or dreamy nature who can wonder when it is stated that they contained respectively a summary demand for the amount of a considerable bill which he imagined he had paid and a request that he would read a paper before a science institute upon the possibilities of aerial telephones made by a very unpleasing lady whom he had once met at a lawntennis party indeed it would not be too much to say that if anyone had given him the opportunity he would have welcomed a chance to quarrel especially with the lady of the local institute thus cured of all moral distempers and every tendency to speculate on feminine charms hidden or overt did he descend to the sabbath breakfast  that morning morris accompanied stella to church where the services were still being performed by a stopgap left by mr tomley here again stella was a surprise to him for now her demeanour and at a little distance her appearance also were just such as mark ninetyeight out of every hundred clergymans daughters in the country so quiet and reserved was she that anyone meeting her that morning might have imagined that she was hurrying from the accustomed bibleclass to sit among her pupils in the church this impression indeed was as it were certificated by an oldfashioned silk fichu that she had been obliged to borrow which in bygone years had been worn by morriss mother  once in church however matters changed to begin with finding it warm stella threw off the fichu greatly to the gain of her personal appearance next it became evident that the beauties of the ancient building appealed to her which was not wonderful for these old seaside eastern counties churches relics of long past wealth and piety are some of them among the most beautiful in the world then came the venite of which here and there she sang a line or so just one or two rich notes like those that a thrush utters before he bursts into full song rare as they might be however they caused those about her in the church to look at the strange singer wonderingly  after this in the absence of his father morris read the lessons and although being blessed with a good voice this was a duty which he performed creditably enough that day he went through it with a certain sense of nervousness why he was nervous at first he did not guess till chancing to glance up he became aware that miss fregelius was looking at him out of her halfclosed eyes what is more she was listening critically and with much intenseness whereupon instantly he made a mistake and put a false accent on a name  in due course the lessons done with they reached the first hymn which was one that scarcely seemed to please his companion at any rate she shut the book and would not sing in the case of the second hymn however matters were different this time she did not even open the book it was evident that she knew the words perhaps among the most beautiful in the whole collection by heart the reader will probably be acquainted with them they begin       and now o father mindful of the love      that bought us once for all on calvarys tree  at first stella sang quite low as though she wished to repress her powers now as it happened at monksland the choir was feeble but inoffensive whereas the organ was a good if a worn and neglected instrument suited to the great but sparsely peopled church and the organist a man who had music in his soul low as she was singing he caught the sound of stellas voice and knew at once that before him was a woman who in a supreme degree possessed the divinest gift perhaps with which nature can crown her sex the power and gift of song forgetting his wretched choir he began to play to her she seemed to note the invitation and at once answered to it       look father look on his anointed face  swelled from her throat in deep contralto notes rich as those the organ echoed  but the full glory of the thing that surpassing music which set monksland talking for a week was not reached till she came to the third verse perhaps the pure passion and abounding humanity of its spirit moved her perhaps by this time she was the thrall of her own song perhaps she had caught the look of wonder and admiration on the face of morris and was determined to show him that she had other music at command besides that of pagan deathchants at least she sang up and out till her notes dominated those of the choir which seemed to be but an accompaniment to them till they beat against the ancient roof and down the depth of the long nave to be echoed back as though from the golden trumpets of the angels that stood above the tower screen till even the village children ceased from whispers and playing to listen openmouthed       and then for those our dearest and best      by this prevailing presence we appeal      o fold them closer to thy mercys breast      o do thine utmost for their souls true weal      from tainting mischief keep them white and clear      and crown thy gifts with strength to persevere  it was as her voice lingered upon the deep tones of these last words that suddenly stella seemed to become aware that practically she was singing a solo that at any rate no one else in the congregation was contributing a note then she was vexed or perhaps a panic took her at least not another word of that hymn passed her lips in vain the organist paused and looked round indignantly the little boys the clerk and the stout coachbuilder were left to finish it by themselves with results that by contrast were painful  when stella came out of church redraped in the antique and unbecoming fichu she found herself the object of considerable attention indeed upon one pretext and another nearly all the congregation seemed to be lingering about the porch and pathway to stare at the new parsons shipwrecked daughter when she appeared among them was miss layard and with her the delicate brother they were staying to lunch with the stopgaps meek little wife indeed this selfsatisfied and somewhat acrimonious lady miss layard engaged morris in conversation and pointedly asked him to introduce her to miss fregelius  we are to be neighbours you know she explained for we live at the hall in the next parish not more than a mile away  indeed answered stella who did not seem much impressed  my brother and i hope to call upon mr fregelius and yourself as soon as possible but i thought i would not wait for that to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance  you are very kind indeed said stella simply at present i am afraid it is not much use calling upon my father as he is in bed with a broken thigh also we are not at the rectory until he can be moved we are only guests at the abbey and she looked at morris who added rather grumpily by way of explanation  of course miss layard you have heard about the wreck of the trondhjem and how those foreign sailors saw the light in my workshop and brought mr fregelius to the abbey  oh yes mr monk and how they left miss fregelius behind and you went to fetch her and all sorts of strange things happened to you we think it quite wonderful and romantic i am writing to dear miss porson to tell her about it because i am sure that you are too modest to sing your own praises  morris grew angry at the best of times he disliked miss layard now he began to detest her and to long for the presence of mary who understood how to deal with that not too wellbred young person  you really neednt have troubled he answered i have already written  then my epistle will prove a useful commentary if i were engaged to a modern hero i am sure i could not hear too much about him and fixing her eyes upon the black silk fichu the heroine of the adventure  meanwhile stella was being engaged by the brother who surveyed her with pale admiring eyes which did not confine their attentions to the fichu  monk is always an awfully lucky fellow he said just fancy his getting the chance of doing all that and finding you waiting on the ship at the end of it he added with desperate and emphatic gallantry theres to be a whole column about it in the northwold times tomorrow i wish the thing had come my way thats all  unless you understand how to manage a boat in a heavy sea and the winds and tides of this coast thoroughly i dont think that you should wish that mr layard said stella  why not he asked sharply as a matter of fact the little man was a miserable sailor and suspected her of poking fun at him  because you would have been drowned mr layard and lying at the bottom of the north sea among the dogfish and congereels this morning instead of sitting comfortably in church  mr layard started and stared at her evidently this ladys imagination was as vivid as it was suggestive  i say miss fregelius he said you dont put things very pleasantly  no i am afraid not but then drowning isnt pleasant i have been near it very lately and i thought a great deal about those congereels and sudden death isnt pleasant and perhapsunless you are very very good as i daresay you arewhat comes after it may not be quite pleasant all of which has to be thought of before one goes to sea in an open boat in winter on the remotest chance of saving a strangers lifehasnt it  somehow mr layard felt distinctly smaller  i daresay one wouldnt mind it at a pinch he muttered monk isnt the only plucky fellow in the world  i am sure you would not mr layard replied stella in a gentler voice still these things must be considered upon such occasions and a good many others  a brave man doesnt think he acts persisted mr layard  no replied stella a foolish man doesnt think a brave man thinks and sees and still actsat least that is how it strikes me although perhaps i have no right to an opinion but mr monk is going on so i must say goodmorning  are many of the ladies about here so inquisitive and the young gentlemen sodecided she was going to say but changed the word to kindasked stella of morris as they walked homeward  ladies snapped morris miss layard isnt a lady and never will be she has neither birth nor breeding only good looks of a sort and money i should like he added viciouslyi should like to shut her into her own coal mine  stella laughed which was a rare thing with herusually she only smiledas she answered  i had no idea you were so vindictive mr monk and what would you like to do with mr layard  oh inever thought much about him he is an ignorant uneducated little fellow but worth two of his sister all the same after all hes got a heart i have known him do kind things but she has nothing but a temper  meanwhile at the luncheon table of the stopgap the new and mysterious arrival miss fregelius was the subject of fierce debate  pretty i dont call her pretty said miss layard she has fine eyes that is all and they do not look quite right what an extraordinary garment she had on too it might have come out of noahs ark  i fancy suggested the hostess a mild little woman that it came out of the wardrobe of the late mrs monk you know miss fregelius lost all her things in that ship  then if i were she i should have stopped at home until i got some new ones snapped miss layard  perhaps everybody doesnt think so much about clothes as you do eliza suggested her brother stephen seeing an opportunity which he was loth to lose eliza in the privacy of domestic life was not a person to be assailed with a light heart but in company when to some extent she must keep her temper under control more might be dared  she shifted her chair a little with her a familiar sign of war and while searching for a repartee which would be sufficiently crushing cast on stephen a glance that might have turned wine into vinegar  somewhat tremulously for unless the fire could be damped before it got full hold she knew what they might expect the little hostess broke in with  what a beautiful singing voice she has hasnt she  who asked eliza pretending not to understand  why miss fregelius of course  oh well that is a matter of opinion  hang it all eliza said her brother there cant be two opinions about it she sings like an angel  do you think so stephen i should have said she sings like an opera dancer  always understood that their gifts lay in their legs and not in their throats but perhaps you mean a prima donna remarked stephen reflectively  no i dont prima donnas are not in the habit of screeching at the top of their voices and then stopping suddenly to make an effect and attract attention  certainly she has attracted my attention and i only wish i could hear such screeching every day it would be a great change it may be explained that the layards were musical and that each detested the music of the other  really stephen rejoined eliza with sarcasm as awkward as it was meant to be crushing i shall have to tell jane rose that she is dethroned poor dearbeaten out of the field by a hymntune a pair of brown eyes anda black silk fichu  this was a venomous stab since for a distance of ten miles round everyone with ears to hear knew that stephens admiration of miss rose had not ended prosperously for stephen the poisoned knife sank deep and its smart drove the little paleeyed man to fury  you can tell her what you like eliza he replied for his selfcontrol was utterly gone but it wont be much use for shell know what you mean shell know that you are jealous of miss fregelius because shes so good looking just as you are jealous of her and of mary porson and of anybody else who dares to be pretty and with crushing meaning to look at morris monk  eliza gasped then said in a tragic whisper stephen you insult me oh if only we were at home i would tell you  i have no doubt you wouldyou often do but im not going home at present i am going to the northwold hotel  really broke in their hostess almost wringing her hands this is sunday mr layard remember this is sunday  i am not likely to forget it replied the maddened stephen but over the rest of this edifying scene we will drop a veil  thus did the advent of stella bring with it surprises rumours and family dissensions what else it brought remains to be told    chapter xii  mr layards wooing  the days went by with an uneventful swiftness at the abbey and after he had once accustomed himself to the strangeness of what was in effect solitude in the house with an unmarried guest of the other sex it may be admitted very pleasantly to morris at first that rather remarkable young lady stella had alarmed him somewhat so that he convinced himself that the duties of this novel hospitality would prove irksome as a matter of fact however in fortyeight hours the irksomeness was all gone to be replaced within twice that period by an atmosphere of complete understanding which was comforting to his fearful soul  the young lady was never in the way now that she had procured some suitable clothes the young lady was distinctly good looking she was remarkably intelligent and wellread she sang as stephen layard had said like an angel she took a most enlightened interest in aerophones and their possibilities she proved a very useful assistant in various experiments and made one or two valuable suggestions while mary and the rest of them were away the place would really be dull without her and somehow he could not be as sorry as he ought when dr charters told him that old mr fregeliuss bones were uniting with exceeding slowness  such were the conclusions which one by one took shape in the mind of that illstarred man morris monk as yet however let the student of his history understand they were not tinged with the slightest arrierepensee he did not guess even that such relations as already existed between stella and himself might lead to grievous trouble that at least they were scarcely wise in the case of a man engaged  all he felt all he knew was that he had found a charming companion a woman whose thought if deeper or at any rate different to his and not altogether to be followed was in tune with his he could not always catch her meaning and yet that unrealised meaning would appeal to him himself a very spiritual man and a humble seeker after truth his nature did intuitive reverence to one who appeared to be still more spiritual who as he conjectured at times at any rate had discovered some portion of the truth he believed it although she had never told him so indeed that semimystical side of stella whereof at first she had shown him glimpses seemed to be quite in abeyance she dreamed no more dreams she saw no more visions or if she did she kept them to herself yet to him this woman seemed to be in touch with that unseen which he found it so difficult to weigh and appreciate instinctively he felt that her best thoughts her most noble and permanent desires were there and not here  as he had said to her in the boat the old egyptians lived to die in life a clay hut was for them a sufficient lodging in death they sought a costly sculptured tomb hewn from the living rock with them these things were symbolical since that great people believed with a wonderful certainty that the true life lay beyond they believed too that on the earth they did but linger in its gateway passing their time with such joy as they could summon baring their heads undismayed to the rain of sorrow because they knew that very soon they would be crowned with eternal joys whereof each of these sorrows was but an earthly root  stella fregelius reminded morris of these old egyptians indeed had he wished to carry the comparison from her spiritual to her physical attributes it still might have been considered apt for in face she was somewhat eastern let the reader examine the portrait bust of the great queen taia clothed with its mysterious smile which adorns the museum in cairo and given fair instead of dusky skin with certain other minor differences he will behold no mean likeness to stella fregelius however this may be for if morris saw the resemblance there were others who could not agree with him doubtless although not an eastern ancient or modern she was tinged with the fatalism of the east mingled with a certain contempt of death inherited perhaps from her northern ancestors and an active pervading spirituality that was all her own yet her manners were not gloomy nor her air tragic for he found her an excellent companion fond of children and flowers and at times merry in her own fashion but this gaiety of hers always reminded morris of that which is said to have prevailed in the days of the terror among those destined to the guillotine never for one hour did she seem to forget the end vanity of vanities saith the preacher and that lesson was her watchword  one evening they were walking together upon the cliff in the west the sun had sunk leaving a pale lemoncoloured glow upon the sky then far away over the quiet sea showing bright and large in that frosty air sprang out a single star stella halted in her walk and looked first at the sunset heaven next at the solemn sea and last at that bright particular star set like a diadem of power upon the brow of advancing night morris watching her saw the blood mantle to her pale face while the dark eyes grew large and luminous proud too and full of secret strength at length his curiosity got the better of him  what are you thinking of he asked  do you wish me to tell you  yes if you will  you will laugh at me  yesas i laugh at that sky and sea and star  well then i was thinking of the old eternal difference between the present and the future  you mean between life and death queried morris and she nodded answering  between life and death and how little people see or think of it they just live and forget that beneath them lie their fathers bones they forget that in some few daysperhaps more perhaps lessother unknown creatures will be standing above their forgotten bones as blind as selfseeking as puffed up with the pride of the brief moment and filled with the despair of their failure the glory of their success as they are tonight  perhaps suggested morris they say that while they are in the world it is well to be of the world that when they belong to the next it will be time to consider it i am not sure that they are not right i have heard that view he added remembering a certain conversation with mary  oh dont think that she answered almost imploringly for it is not true really it is not true of course the next world belongs to all but our lot in it does not come to us by right that must be earned  the old doctrine of our faith suggested morris  yes but as i believe there is more behind more which we are not told that we must find out for ourselves with groanings which cannot be uttered by hope we are saved did not st paul hint at it  what do you mean  i mean that as our spirit sows so shall it reap as it imagines and desires so shall it inherit it is here that the soul must grow not there as the child comes into the world with a nature already formed and its blood filled with gifts of strength or weakness so shall the spirit come into its world wearing the garment that it has woven and which it cannot change  the garment which it has woven said morris that means free will and how does free will chime in with your fatalism miss fregelius  perfectly the material given us to weave with that is fate the time which is allotted for the task that is fate again but the pattern is our own here are brushes here is pigment so much of it of such and such colours and here is light to work by now paint your picture says the master paint swiftly with such skill as you can not knowing how long is allotted for the task and so we weave and so we paint every one of usevery one of us  what is your picture miss fregelius tell me if you will  she laughed and drew herself up mine oh it is large it is to reign like that star it is to labour forward from age to age at the great tasks that god shall set me to return and bow before his throne crying it is done behold is the work good for the hour that they endure it is still to be with those whom i have loved on earth although they cannot see me to soothe their sorrows to support their weakness to lull their fears it is that the empty longing and daily prayer may be filled and filled and filled again like a cup from a stream which never ceases  and what is that daily prayer asked morris looking at her  o god touch me with thy light and give me understandingyes understandingthe word encloses all i seek she replied then checking herself added in a changed voice come let us go home it is foolish to talk long of such things    shortly after this curious conversation which was never renewed between them or at least but once a new element entered into the drama the necessary semicomic element without which everything would be so dull this fresh factor was the infatuation which possibly the reader may have foreseen of the susceptible impulsive little man stephen layard for stella fregelius the lady whose singing he had admired and who had been a cause of war between him and his sister like many weak men stephen layard was obstinate also from boyhood up he had suffered much at the hands of eliza who was not in fact quite so young as she looked hence there arose in his breast a very natural desire for retaliation eliza had taken a violent dislike to miss fregelius whom he thought charming this circumstance in their strained relations was reason enough to induce stephen to pay court to her even if his natural inclination had not made the adventure very congenial  therefore on the first opportunity he called at the abbey to ask after the rector to be as he had hoped received by stella finding his visit exceedingly agreeable after a day or two he repeated it and this time was conducted to the old clergymans bedroom upon whom his civility made a good impression  now as it happened although he did not live in monksland mr layard was one of the largest property owners in the parish a circumstance which he did not fail to impress upon the new rector being by nature and training a hardworking man who wished to do his best for his cure even while he lay helpless mr fregelius welcomed the advances of this wealthy young gentleman with enthusiasm especially when he found that he was no niggard a piece of land was wanted for the cemetery mr layard offered to present an acre money was lacking to pay off a debt upon the readingroom mr layard headed the subscription list with a handsome sum and so forth  now the details of these various arrangements could not conveniently be settled without many interviews and thus very soon it came about that scarcely a day went by upon which mr layards dogcart did not pass through the abbey gates generally he came in the morning and stopped to lunch or he came in the afternoon and stopped to tea in fact or thus it seemed to morris he always stopped to something so much so that although not lacking in hospitality at times morris found his presence wearisome for in truth the two men had nothing in common  he must have turned over a new leaf with a vengeance for he never would give a sixpence to anything during old tomleys time remarked morris to stella i suppose that he has taken a great fancy to your father which is a good thing for the parish as those layards are richer than croesus  yes answered stella with a curious little smile  but to herself she did not smile for if morris found his visitor a bore to stella he was nothing short of an infliction increased rather than mitigated by numerous presents of hothouse fruit and flowers offered to herself and entailing each of them an expression of thanks verbal or written at first she treated the thing as a joke till it grew evident that her admirer was as much in earnest as his nature would permit thereon foreseeing eventualities she became alarmed  unless some means could be found to stop him it was now clear to stella that mr layard meant to propose to her and as she had not the slightest intention of accepting him this was an honour which she did not seek but she could find no sufficient means hints and even snubs only seemed to add fuel to the fire and of a perpetual game of hide and seek she grew weary  so it came about that at last she shrugged her shoulders and left things to take their chance finding some consolation for her discomfort in the knowledge that miss layard convinced that the rectors daughter was luring her inexperienced brother into an evil matrimonial net could in no wise restrain her rage and indignation so openly did this lady express her views indeed that at length a report of them reached even morriss inattentive ears whereon he was at first very angry and then burst out laughing that a man like stephen layard should hope to marry a woman like stella fregelius seemed to him so absurd as to be almost unnatural yet when he came to think it over quietly he was constrained to admit to himself that the match would have many advantages for the young lady whereof the first and foremost were that stephen was very rich and although slangy and without education in its better sense at heart by no means a bad little fellow so morris shrugged his shoulders shut his eyes continued to dispense luncheons and afternoon teas and though with an uneasy mind like stella herself allowed things to take their chance  all this while however his own friendship with stella grew apace enhanced as it was in no small degree by the fact that now her help in his scientific operations had become most valuable indeed it appeared that he was destined to owe the final success of his instrument to the assistance of women who at the beginning at any rate knew little of its principles mary it may be remembered by some fortunate chance made the suggestion as to the substance of the receiver which turned the aerophone from a great idea into a practical reality now to complete the work it was stella not by accident but after careful study of its problem who gave the thought that led to the removal of the one remaining obstacle to its general and successful establishment  to test this new development of the famous sound deflector and perfect its details scores of experiments were needed most of which he and she carried out together this was their plan one of them established him or herself in the ruined building known as the dead church while the other took up a position in the abbey workshop from these respective points a distance of about two miles they tested the machines with results that day by day grew better and clearer till at length under these conditions they were almost perfect  strange was the experience and great the triumph when at last morris seated in the abbey with his apparatus before him unconnected with its twin by any visible medium was able without interruption for a whole morning to converse with stella established in the dead church  it is done he cried in unusual exultation now if i die tomorrow it does not matter  instantly came the answer in stellas voice  i am very happy if i do nothing else i have helped a man to fame  then a hitch arose the inevitable hitch it was found that in certain states of the atmosphere and sometimes at fixed hours of the day the sounds coming from the receiver were almost inaudible at other times again the motive force seemed to be so extraordinarily active that the sound deflector notwithstanding the instrument captured and transmitted a thousand noises which are not to be heard by the unobservant listener or in some cases by any human ear  weird enough these noises were at times like great sighs they came like the moan of the breeze brought from an infinite distance like mutterings and groanings arisen from the very bowels of the earth then there were the splash or boom of the waves the piping of the seawind the cry of curlew or blackbacked gulls all mingled in one great and tangled skein of sound that choked the voice of the speaker and in their aggregate bewildered him who hearkened  these and others which need not be detailed were problems that had to be met necessitating many more experiments thus it came about that through most of the short hours of winter daylight morris and stella found themselves at their respective positions corresponding or trying to correspond through the aerophones if the weather was very bad or very cold morris went to the dead church otherwise that post was allotted to stella both because it was more convenient that morris should stay in his laboratory and by her own choice  two principal reasons caused her to prefer to pass as much of her time as was possible in this desolate and unvisited spot first because mr layard was less likely to find her when he called and secondly that for her it had a strange fascination indeed she loved the place clothed as it was with a thousand memories of those who had been human like herself but nowwere not she would read the inscriptions upon the chancel stones and study the coatsofarms and names of those departed trying to give to each lost man and woman a shape and character till at length she knew all the monuments by appearance as well as by the names inscribed upon them  one of these dead oddly enough had been named stella ethel smythe daughter of sir thomas smythe whose family lived at the old hall now in the possession of the layards this stella had died at the age of twentyfive in the year 1741 and her tombstone recorded that in mind she was clean and sweet and in body beautiful also at the foot of it was a doggerel couplet written probably by her bereaved father which ran       though here my star seems set      i know twill light me yet  stella the live stella thought these simple words very touching and pointed them out to morris he agreed with her and tried in the records of the parish and elsewhere to discover some details about the dead girls life but quite without avail  thats all thats left he said one day nodding his head at the tombstone the star is quite set  i know twill light me yet murmured his companion as she turned away to the work in hand sometimes she went on as i sit here at dusk listening to all the strange sounds which come from that receiver i fancy that i can hear stella and her poor father talking while they watch me only i cannot understand their language  ah said morris if that were right we should have found a means of communication from the dead and with the unseen world at large  why not asked stella  i dont know i have thought of it he answered and the subject dropped  one afternoon stella wrapped in thick cloaks was seated in the chancel of the dead church attending to the instrument which stood upon the stone altar morris had not wished her to go that morning for the weather was very coarse and snow threatened but anticipating a visit from mr layard she insisted saying that she should enjoy the walk now the experiments were in progress and going beautifully in order to test the aerophones fully in this rough weather morris and stella had agreed to read to each other alternate verses from the book of job beginning at the thirtyeighth chapter  canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the bands of orion read stella presently in her rich clear voice  instantly from two miles away came the next verse the sound of those splendid words rolling down the old church like echoes of some lesson read generations since  canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons  so it went on for a few more verses till just as the instrument was saying who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heart the rude door in the brick partition opened admitting a rush of wind andstephen layard  the little man sidled up nervously to where stella was sitting on a campstool by the altar  how do you do said stella holding out her hand and looking surprised  how do you do miss fregelius whatwhat are you doing in this dreadfully cold place on such a bitter day  before she could answer the voice of morris anxious and irritated for as the next verse did not follow he concluded that something had gone wrong with the apparatus rang through the church asking  who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heart  good gracious said mr layard i had no idea that monk was here i left him at the abbey where is he  at the abbey answered stella as for the second time the voice of morris rolled out the question from the book  i dont understand said stephen beginning to look frightened has it anything to do with his electrical experiments  stella nodded then addressing the instrument said  please stop reading for a while mr layard is calling here  confound him came the swift answer let me know when he is gone he said he was going home whereon stella switched off before worse things happened  mr layard who had heard these words began a confused explanation till stella broke in  please dont apologise you changed your mind and we all do that but i am afraid this is a cold place to come to  you are right there why on earth do you sit here so long  to work mr layard  why should you work i thought women hated it and above all why for monk does he pay you  i work because i like work and shall go on working till i die and afterwards i hope also these experiments interest me very much mr monk does not pay me i have never asked him to do so indeed it is i who am in his debt for all the kindness he has shown to my father and myself to any little assistance that i can give him he is welcome  i see said mr layard but i should have thought that was mary porsons job you know he is engaged to her dont you  yes but miss porson is not here and if she were perhaps she would not care for this particular work  then came a pause which not knowing what this awkward silence might breed stella broke  i suppose you saw my father she said how did you find him looking  oh better i thought but that leg of his still seems very bad then with a gasp and a great effort he went on i have been speaking to him about you  indeed said stella looking at him with wondering eyes  yes and he says that ifit suits us both he is quite willing that in fact he would be very pleased to see you so well provided for  stella could not say that she did not understand the falsehood was too obvious so she merely went on looking a circumstance from which mr layard drew false auguries  you know what i mean dont you he jerked out  she shook her head  i meani mean that i love you that you have given me what this horrid thing was talking about just nowunderstanding to the heart yes thats it understanding to the heart will you marry me stella i will make you a good husband and it isnt a bad place and all that and though your father says he has little to leave you you will be treated as liberally as though you were a lady in your own right  stella smiled a little  will you marry me he asked again  i am afraid that i must answer no mr layard  then the poor man broke out into a rhapsody of bitter disappointment genuine emotion and passionate entreaty  it is no use mr layard said stella at last indeed i am much obliged to you you have paid me a great compliment but it is not possible that i should become your wife and the sooner that is clear the better for us both  are you engaged he asked  no mr layard and probably i never shall be i have my own ideas about matrimony and the conditions under which i would undertake it are not at all likely ever to be within my reach  again he imploredfor at the time this woman really held his heartwringing his hands and indeed weeping in the agony of a repulse which was the more dreadful because it was quite unexpected he had scarcely imagined that this poor clergymans daughter who had little but her looks and a sweet voice would really refuse the best match for twenty miles round nor had his conversation with her father suggested to his mind any such idea  it was true that mr fregelius had given him no absolute encouragement he had said that personally the marriage would be very pleasing to himself but that it was a matter of which stella must judge and when asked whether he would speak to his daughter he had emphatically declined still stephen layard had taken this to be all a part of the paternal formula and rejoiced thinking the matter as good as settled dreadful indeed then was it to him when he found that he was called upon to contemplate the dull obverse of his shield of faith and not its bright and shining face in which he had seen mirrored so clear a picture of perfect happiness  so he begged on piteously enough till at last stella was forced to stop him by saying as gently as she could  please spare us both mr layard i have given my answer and i am sorry to say that it is impossible for me to go back upon my word  then a sudden fury seized him  you are in love with somebody else he said you are in love with morris monk and he is a villain when he is engaged to go taking you too i know it  then mr layard said stella striving to keep her temper you know more than i know myself  very likely he answered i never said you knew it but its true for all that i feel it herewhere you will feel it one day to your sorrowand he placed his hand upon his heart  a sudden terror took hold of her but with difficulty she found her mental balance  i hoped mr layard she said that we might have parted friends but how can we when you bring such accusations  i retract them broke in the distracted man you mustnt think anything of what i said it is only the pain that has made me mad for gods sake at least let us part friends for then perhaps some day we may come together again  stella shook her head sadly and gave him her hand which he covered with kisses then reeling in his gait like one drunken the unhappy suitor departed into the falling snow  mechanically stella switched on the instrument and at once morriss voice was heard asking  i say hasnt he gone  yes she said  thank goodness why on earth did you keep him gossiping all that time now thenwho can number the clouds in wisdom  not mr layard or i thought stella sadly to herself as she called back the answering verse    chapter xiii  two questions and the answer  at length the light began to fade and for that day their experiments were over in token of their conclusion twice stella rang the electric warning bell which was attached to the aerophone and in some mysterious manner caused the bell of its twin instrument to ring also then she packed the apparatus in its box for with its batteries it was too heavy and too delicate to be carried conveniently locking it up and left the church which she also locked behind her outside it was still snowing fast but softly for the wind had dropped and a sharp frost was setting in causing the fallen snow to scrunch beneath her feet about halfway along the bleak line of deserted cliff which stretched from the dead church to the first houses of monksland she saw the figure of a man walking swiftly towards her and knew from the bent head and broad slightly stooping shoulders that it was morris coming to escort her home presently they met  why did you not wait for me he asked in an irritated voice i told you i was coming and you know that i do not like you to be tramping about these lonely cliffs at this hour  it is very kind of you she answered smiling that slow soft smile which was characteristic of her when she was pleased a smile that seemed to be born in her beautiful eyes and thence to irradiate her whole face but it was growing dreary and cold there so i thought that i would start  yes he answered i forgot and what is more it is very selfish of me to keep you cooped up in such a place upon a winters day enthusiasm makes one forget everything  at least without it we should do nothing besides please do not pity me for i have never been happier in my life  i am most grateful he said earnestly i dont know what i should have done without you through this critical time or what i shall and he stopped  it went beautifully today didnt it she broke in as though she had not heard his words  yes he answered beyond all expectations we must experiment over a greater distance and then if the thing still works i shall be able to speak with my critics in the gate you know i have kept everything as dark as possible up to the present for it is foolish to talk first and fail afterwards i prefer to succeed first and talk afterwards  what a triumph it will be said stella all those clever scientists will arrive prepared to mock then think they are taken in and at last go away astonished to write columns upon columns in the papers  and after that queried morris  oh after that honour and glory and wealth and power andthe happy ending doesnt it sound nice  yees in a way but he added with energy it wont come off no not the aerophones they are right enough i believe but all the rest of it  why not  because it is too much happy endings dont come off the happiness lies in the struggle you knowan old saying but quite true afterwards something intervenes  to have struggled happily and successfully is happiness in itself whatever comes afterwards nothing can take that away i have done something it is good it cannot be changed it is a stone built for ever in the pyramid of beauty or knowledge or advancement what can man hope to say more at the last and how few live to say it to say it truly you will leave a great name behind you mr monk  i shall leave my work that is enough for me he answered  for a while they walked in silence then some thought struck him and he stopped to ask  why did layard come to the dead church today he said that he was going home and it isnt on his road  stella turned her head but even in that faint light not quickly enough to prevent him seeing a sudden flush change the pallor of her face to the rich colour of her lips  to call i suppose or correcting herself perhaps from curiosity  and what did he talk about  oh the aerophone i think i dont remember  that must be a story he said laughing i always remember layards conversation for longer than i want it has a knack of impressing itself upon me what was it cemetery land church debts the new drainage scheme or something equally entrancing and confidential  under this crossexamination stella grew desperate unnecessarily perhaps and said in a voice that was almost cross  i cannot tell you please lets talk of something else  then of a sudden morris understood and like a foolish man at once jumped to a conclusion far other than the truth doubtless layard had gone to the church to propose to stella and she had accepted him or half accepted him the confusion of her manner told its own tale a new and strange sensation took possession of morris he felt unwell he felt angry if the aerophone refused to work at all tomorrow he would care nothing he could not see quite clearly and was not altogether sure where he was walking  i beg your pardon he said in a cold voice as he recovered himself it was most impertinent of me he was going to add pray accept my congratulations but fortunately or unfortunately stopped himself in time  stella divined something of what was passing in his mind not all indeed for to her the full measure of his folly would have been incomprehensible for a moment she contemplated an explanation then abandoned the idea because she could find no words because also this was another persons secret and she had no right to involve an honest man who had paid her a great compliment in her confidences so she said nothing to morris for the moment at any rate a conclusive proof of his worst suspicions  the rest of that walk was marked by unbroken silence both of them were very glad when it was finished  it was five oclock when they reached the abbey so that there were two hours to be spent before it was time to dress for dinner when she had taken off her things stella went straight to her fathers room to give him his tea by now mr fregelius was much better although the nature of his injuries made it imperative that he should still stay in bed  is that you stella he said in his high nervous voice and although she could not see them in the shadow of the curtain she knew that his quick eyes were watching her face eagerly  yes father i have brought you your tea are you ready for it  thank you my dear have you been at that placewhat do you call itthe dead church all day  yes and the experiments went beautifully  did they did they indeed commented her father in an uninterested voice the fate of the experiments did not move him isnt it very lonely up there in that old church  i prefer to be alonegenerally  i know i know forgive me but you are a very odd woman my dear  perhaps father but not more so than those before me am i most of them were a little different from other people i have been told  quite right stella they were all odd women but i think that you are quite the oddest of the family then as though the subject were disagreeable to him he added suddenly mr layard came to see me today  so he told me answered stella  oh you have met him i remember he said he should call in at the dead church as he had something to say to you  stella determined to get the conversation over so she forced the pace she was a person who liked to have disagreeable things behind her drawing herself up she answered steadily  he did call in andhe said it  what my dear what asked mr fregelius innocently  he asked me to marry him father i think he told me with your consent  mr fregelius auguring the very best from this openness answered in tones which he could not prevent from betraying an unseemly joy  quite true stella i told him to go on and prosper and really i hope he has prospered  yes said stella reflectively  then my dear love am i to understand that you are engaged to him  engaged to him certainly not she answered  then snapped out her justly indignant parent how in the name of heaven has he prospered  by my refusing him of course we should never have suited each other at all he would have been miserable if i had married him  mr fregelius groaned in bitterness of spirit  oh stella stella he cried what a disappointment  why should you be disappointed father dear she asked gently  why you stand there and ask why when i hear that my daughter who will scarcely have a sixpenceor at least very few of themhas refused a young man with between seventeen and eighteen thousand pounds a yearthats his exact income for he told me himself a most estimable churchman who would have been a pillar of strength to me a man whom i should have chosen out of ten thousand as a soninlaw and he ceased overwhelmed  father i am sorry that you are sorry but it is strange you should understand me so little after all these years that you could for one moment think that i should marry mr layard  and why not pray are you better born  yes interrupted stella whose one pride was that of her ancient lineage  i didnt mean that i meant better bred and generally superior to him you talk as though you were of a different clay  perhaps the clay is the same said stella but the mind is not  oh there it is again spiritual and intellectual pride which causes you to set yourself above your fellows and in the end will be your ruin it has made a lonely woman of you for years and it will do worse than that it will turn you into an old maidif you live he added as though shaken by some sudden memory  perhaps said stella i am not frightened at the prospect i daresay that i shall have a little money and at the worst i can always earn a living my voice would help me to it if nothing else does father dear you mustnt be vexed with me and praypray do understand that no earthly thing would make me marry a man whom i dislike rather than otherwise who at least is not a mate for me merely because he could give me a fine house to live in and treat me luxuriously what would be the good of such things to me if i knew that i had tarnished myself and violated my instincts  you talk like a bookyou talk like a book muttered the old gentleman but i know that the end of it will be wretchedness for everybody people who go on as you do about instincts and fine feelings and all that stuff are just the ones who get into some dreadful mess at last i tell you that such ideas are some of the devils best baits  stella began to grow indignant  do you think father that you ought to talk to me quite like that she asked dont you know me well enough to be sure that i should never get into what you call a messat least not in the way i suppose you mean my heart and thought are my own and i shall be prepared to render account of them for the rest you need not be afraid  i didnt mean thati didnt mean anything of the sort  i am glad to hear it broke in stella it would scarcely have been kind especially as i am no longer a child who needs to be warned against the dangers of the world  what i did mean is that you are an enigma that i am frightened about you that you are no companion because your thoughtsyes and at times your face tooseem unnatural unearthly and separate you from others as they have separated you from this poor young man  i am what i was made answered stella with a little smile and i seek company where i can find it some love the natural some the spiritual and each receive from them their good why should they blame one another  mad muttered her father to himself as she left the room mad as she is charming and beautiful or if not mad at least quite impracticable and unfitted for the world what a disappointment to mewhat a bitter disappointment well i should be used to them by now  meanwhile morris was in his workshop in the old chapel entering up his record of the days experiments which done he drew his chair to the stove and fell into thought somehow the idea of the engagement of miss fregelius to stephen layard was not agreeable to him probably because he did not care about the young man yet now that he came to think of it quietly in all her circumstances it would be an admirable arrangement and the offer undoubtedly was one which she had been wise to accept on the whole such a marriage would be as happy as marriages generally are the man was honest the man was young and rich and very soon the man would be completely at the disposal of his brilliant and beautiful wife  personally he morris would lose a friend since a woman cannot marry and remain the friend of another man that however would probably have happened in any case and to object on this account even in his secret heart would be abominably selfish indeed what right had he even to consider the matter the young lady had come into his life very strangely and made a curious impression upon him she was now going out of it by ordinary channels and soon nothing but the impression would remain it was proper natural and the way of the world there was nothing more to be said  somehow he was in a dreary mood and everything bored him he fetched marys last letter there was nothing in it but some chitchat except the postscript which was rather longer than the letter and ran   i am glad to hear the young lady whom you fished up out of the sea is such an assistance to you in your experiments i gather from what i hearalthough you havent mentioned the factthat she is as beautiful as she is charming and that she sings wonderfully she must be something remarkable i am sure because eliza layard evidently detests her and says that she is trying to ensnare the affections of that squire of dames her brother stephen now temporarily homeless after a visit to jane rose what will you do when you have to get on without her i am afraid you must accustom yourself to the idea unless she would like to make a third in the honeymoon party joking apart i am exceedingly grateful to her for all the help she has given you and dear dear morris more delighted than i can tell you to learn that after all your years of patient labour you believe success to be absolutely within sight  my father i am sorry to say is no better indeed although the doctors deny it i believe he is worse and i see no prospect of our getting away from here at present however dont let that bother you and above all dont think of coming out to this place which makes you miserable and where you cant work what a queer menage you must be at the abbey now you and the star who has risen from the oceanshe ought to have been called venusteteatete and the i gather rather feeble and uninteresting old gentleman in bed upstairs i should like to see you when you didnt know why dont you invent a machine to enable people at a distance to see as well as to hear each other it would be very popular and bring society to utter wreck does the northern starshe is danish isnt shemake good coffee and how oh how does she get on with the cook   morris put down the letter and laughed aloud mary was as amusing as ever and he longed to see her again especially as he was convinced that she was really bored out there at beaulieu with mr porson sick and his father very much occupied with his own affairs in a moment he made up his mind he would go out and see her of course he could ill spare the time but for the present the more pressing of his experiments were completed and he could write up his data there anyway he would put in a fortnight at beaulieu and what is more start tomorrow if it could be arranged  he went to the table and began a letter to mary announcing that she might expect to see him sometime on the day that it reached her when he had got so far as this he remembered that the dressing bell had already rung some minutes and ran upstairs to change his clothes as he fastened his tie he thought to himself sadly that this would be his last dinner with stella fregelius and as he brushed his hair he determined that unless she had other wishes it should be as happy as it could be made he would like this final meal to be the pleasantest of all their meals and although of course he had no right to form an opinion on the matter he thought that perhaps she might like it too they were going to part to enter on different walks of lifefor now be it said he had quite convinced himself that she was engagedso let their parting memories of each other be as agreeable as possible  meanwhile stella also had her reflections her conversation with her father had troubled her more perhaps than her remarks might have suggested there was little between this pair except the bond of blood which sometimes seems to be so curiously accidental so absolutely devoid of influence in promoting mutual sympathies or in opening the door to any deep and real affection still notwithstanding this lack of true intimacy stella loved her father as she felt that he loved her and it gave her pain to be forced to cross his wishes she knew with what a fierce desire although he was ashamed to express all its intensity he desired that she should accept this the first chance of wealthy and successful marriage that had come her way and the anguish which her absolute refusal must have entailed upon his heart  of course it was very worldly of him and therefore reprehensible yet to a great extent she could sympathise with his disappointment at bottom he was a proud man although he repressed his pride and kept it secret he was an ambitious man also and his lot had been confined to humble tasks absolutely unrecognised beyond his parish of a remotelyplaced country parson moreover his family had been rich he had been brought up to believe that he himself would be rich and then owing to certain circumstances was doomed to pass his days in comparative poverty  even death had laid a heavy hand on him she was the last of her race and she knew he earnestly desired that she should marry and bear children so that it might not become extinct and now this chance this princely chance which from his point of view seemed to fill every possible condition had come unawares like a messenger from heaven and she refused its entertainment looked at through his eyes the position was indeed cruel  yet deeply as she sympathised with him in his disappointment stella never for one moment wavered in her determination marry mr layard her blood shrank back to her heart at the very thought and then rushed to her neck and bosom in a flood of shame no she was sorry but that was impossible a thing which no woman should be asked to do against her will  the subject wearied her but as brooding on it could not mend matters she dismissed it from her mind and turned her thoughts to morris why she did not know but something had come between them he was vexed with her and what was more disappointed she could feel it well enough andshe found his displeasure painful what had she done wrong how had she offended him surely it could not beand once again that red blush spread itself over face and bosom he could not believe that she had accepted the man he could never have so grossly misunderstood her her nature her ideas everything about her and yet who knew what he would or would not believe in some ways as she had already discovered mr monk was curiously simple how could she tell him the truth without using words which she did not desire to speak here instinct came to her aid it might be done by making herself as agreeable to him as possible for surely he must know that no girl would do her best to please one man when she had just promised herself to another so it came about that quite innocently stella determined to allay her hosts misgivings by this doubtful and dangerous expedient  to begin with she put on her best dressa low bodice of black silk relieved with white and a single scarlet rose from the hothouse round her neck also fastened by a thin chain she wore a large bloodred carbuncle shaped like a heart and about her slender waist a quaint girdle of ancient danish silver two of the ornaments which she had saved from the shipwreck her dark and waving hair she parted in the middle after a new fashion tying its masses in a heavy knot at the back of her head and thus adorned descended to the library where morris was awaiting her  he stood leaning over the fire with his back towards her but hearing the sweep of a skirt turned round and as his eyes fell upon her started a little never till he saw her thus had he known how beautiful stella was at times quite without design his eyes betrayed his thought but with his lips he said merely as he offered her his arm  what a pretty dress did it come out of northwold  the material did i made it up and i am glad that you think it nice  this was a propitious beginning and the dinner that followed did not belie its promise the conversation turned upon one of the norse sagas that stella had translated for which morris had promised to try to find a publisher then abandoning the silence and reserve which were habitual to him he began to talk asking her about her work and her past she answered him freely enough telling him of her school days in denmark of her long holiday visits to the old danish grandmother whose memory stretched back through three generations and whose mind was stored with traditions of men and days now long forgotten this particular saga she said had for instance never been written in its entirety till she took it down from the old dames lips much as in the fifteenth century the iceland sagas were recorded by snorro sturleson and others even the traditional music of the songs as they were sung centuries ago she had received from her with their violin accompaniments  i have one in the house broke in morris a violinrather a good instrument i used to play a little when i was young i wish if you dont mind that you would sing them to me after dinner  i will try if you like she answered but i dont know how i shall get on for my own old fiddle to which i am accustomed went to the bottom with a lot of other things in that unlucky shipwreck you know we came by sea because it seemed so cheap and that was the end of our economy fortunately all our heavy baggage and furniture were not ready and escaped  i do not call it unlucky said morris with grave courtesy since it gave me the honour of your acquaintance or perhaps i may say of your friendship  yes she answered looking pleased certainly you may say of my friendship it is owing to the man who saved my life is it notwith a great deal more that i can never pay  dont speak of it he said that midnight sail was my one happy inspiration my one piece of real good luck  perhaps and she sighed that is for me though who can tell i have often wondered what made you do it there was so little to go on  i have told you inspiration pure inspiration  and what sent the inspiration mr monk  fate i suppose  yes i think it must be what we call fateif it troubles itself about so small a thing as the life of one woman  then to change the subject she began to talk of the northumberland moors and mountains and of their years of rather dreary existence among them till at length it was time to leave the table this they did together for even then morris drank very little wine  may i get you the violin and will you sing he asked eagerly when they reached the library  if you wish it i will try  then come to the chapel there is a good fire and it is put away there  presently they were in the ancient place where morris produced the violin from the cupboard and having set a new string began to tune it  that is a very good instrument said stella her eyes shining you dont know what you have brought upon yourself playing the violin is my pet insanity and once or twice since i have been here when i wanted it i have cried over the loss of mine especially as i cant afford to buy another oh what a lovely night it is look at the full moon shining on the sea and snow i never remember her so bright and the stars too they glitter like great diamonds  it is the frost answered morris yes everything is beautiful tonight  stella took the violin played a note or two then screwed up the strings to her liking  do you really wish me to sing mr monk she asked  of course more than i can tell you  then will you think me very odd if i ask you to turn out the electric lamps i can sing best so you stand by the fire so that i can see my audience the moon through this window will give me all the light i want  he obeyed and now she was but an ethereal figure with a patch of red at her heart and a line of glimmering white from the silver girdle beneath her breast on whose pale face the moonbeams poured sweetly for a while she stood thus and the silence was heavy in that beautiful dismantled place of prayer then she lifted the violin and from the first touch of the bow morris knew that he was in the presence of a mistress of one of the most entrancing of the arts slow and sweet came the plaintive penetrating sounds that seemed to pass into his heart and thrill his every nerve now they swelled louder now they almost died away and now only touching the strings from time to time she began to sing in her rich contralto voice he could not understand the words but their burden was clear enough they were a lament the lament of some sorrowing woman the sweet embodiment of an ancient and forgotten grief thus embalmed in heavenly music  it was done the echoes of the following notes of the violin fainted and died among the carven angels of the roof it was done and morris sighed aloud  how can i thank you he said i knew that you were a musician but not that you had such genius to listen to you makes a man feel very humble  she laughed the voice is a mere gift for which no one deserves credit although of course it can be improved  if so what of the accompaniment  that is different that comes from the heart and hard work do you know that when i was under my old master out in denmark who in his time was one of the finest of violinists in the north of europe i often played for five and sang for two hours a day also i have never let the thing drop it has been the consolation and amusement of a somewhat lonely life so by this time i ought to understand my art although there remains much to be learnt  understand it why you could make a fortune on the stage  a living perhaps if my voice will bear the continual strain i daresay that some time i shall drift therefor the livingnot because i like the trade or have any wish for popular success it is a fact that i had far rather sing alone to you here tonight and know that you are pleased than be cheered by a whole opera house full of strange people  and ioh i cannot explain sing on sing all you can for tomorrow i must go away  go away she faltered  yes i will explain to you afterwards but please sing while i am here to listen  the words struck heavy on her heart numbing itwhy she knew not for a moment she felt helpless as though she could neither sing nor play she did not wish him to go she did not wish him to go her intellect came to her aid why should he go heaven had given her power and this man could feel its weight would it not suffice to keep him from going she would try she would play and sing as she had never done before sing till his heart was soft play till his feet had no strength to wander beyond the sound of the sweet notes her art could summon from this instrument of strings and wood  so again she began and played on and on and on from time to time letting the bow fall to sing in a flood of heavenly melody that seemed by nature to fall from her lips note after note as dew or honey fall drop by drop from the calyx of some perfect flower now long did she play and sing those sad mysterious siren songs they never knew the moon travelled on its appointed course and as its beams passed away gradually that divine musician grew dimmer to his sight now only the stars threw their faint light about her but still she played on and on and on the music swelled it told of dead and ancient wars where all day long the noise of battle rolled it rose shrill and high and in it rang the scream of the valkyries preparing the feast of odin it was low and sad and tender the voice of women mourning for their dead it changed it grew unearthly spiritualised such music as those might use who welcome souls to their long home lastly it became rich and soft and far as the echo of a dream and through it could be heard sighs and the broken words of love that slowly fell away and melted as into the nothingness of some happy sleep  the singer was weary her fingers could no longer guide the bow her voice grew faint for a moment she stood still looking in the flicker of the fire and the pale beams of the stars like some searcher returned from heaven to earth then half fainting down she sank upon a chair  morris turned on the lamps and looked at this fair being this chosen home of music who lay before him like a broken lily then back into his heart with a chilling shock came the thought that this woman to him at least the most beautiful and gifted his eyes had seen had promised herself in marriage to stephen layard that she her body her mind her musicall that made her the stella fregelius whom he knewwere the actual property of stephen layard could it be true was it not possible that he had made some mistake that he had misunderstood a burning desire came upon him to know to know before he went and upon the forceful impulse of that moment he did what at any other time would have filled him with horror he asked her the words broke from his lips he could not help them  is it true he said with something like a groan can it be true that youyou are really going to marry that man  stella sat up and looked at him so she had guessed aright she made no pretence of fencing with him or of pretending that she did not know to whom he referred  are you mad to ask me such a thing she asked with a strange break in her voice  i am sorry he began  she stamped her foot upon the ground  oh she said it hurts me it hurtsfrom my father i understood but that you should think it possible that i would sell myselfi tell you that it hurts and as she spoke two large tears began to roll from her lovely pleading eyes  then you mean that you refused him  what else  thank you of course i have no right to interfere but forgive me if i say that i cannot help feeling glad even if it is taken on the ground of wealth you can easily make as much money as you want without him and he glanced at the violin which lay beside her  she made no reply the subject seemed to have passed from her mind but presently she lifted her head again and in her turn asked a question  did you not say that you are going away tomorrow  then something happened to the heart and brain and tongue of morris monk so that he could not speak the thing he wished he meant to answer a monosyllable yes but in its place he replied with a whole sentence  i was thinking of doing so but after all i do not know that it will be necessary especially in the middle of our experiments  stella said nothing not a single word only she found her handkerchief and without in the least attempting to hide them there before his eyes wiped the two tears off her face first one and then the other  this done she held out her hand to him and left the room    chapter xiv  the return of the colonel  next morning morris and stella met at breakfast as usual but as though by mutual consent neither of them alluded to the events of the previous evening thus the name of mr layard was taboo nor were any more questions asked or statements volunteered as to that journey the toils of which morris had suddenly discovered he was after all able to avoid this morning as it chanced no experiments were carried on principally because it was necessary for stella to spend the day in the village doing various things on behalf of her father and lunching with the wife of dr charters who was one of the churchwardens  by the second post which arrived about three oclock morris received two letters one from his father and one from mary there was something about the aspect of these letters that held his eye that from his father was addressed with unusual neatness the bold letters being written with all the care of a candidate in a calligraphic competition the stamps also were affixed very evenly and the envelope was beautifully sealed with the full monk coat done in black wax these as experience told him were signs that his father had something important to communicate since otherwise everything connected with his letters was much more casual further to speak at hazard he should judge that this matter whatever it might be was not altogether disagreeable to the writer  marys letter also had its peculiarities she always wrote in a large loose scrawl running the words into one another after the idle fashion which was an index to her character in this instance however the fault had been carried to such an extreme that the address was almost illegible indeed morris wondered that the letter had not been delayed the stamps too were affixed anyhow and the envelope barely closed  something has happened he thought to himself then he opened marys letter it was dated tuesday that is two days before and ran   dearestmy father is dead my poor old father and now i have nobody but you left in the world thank god at the last he was without pain and they thought insensible but i know he wasnt because he squeezed my hand some of his last words that could be understood were give my love to morris oh i feel as though my heart would break after my mothers death till you came into my life he was everything to meeverything everything i cant write any more  your loving mary  ps dont trouble to come out here it is no good he is to be buried tomorrow and next day i am going en retraite for a month as i must have time to get over thisto accustom myself to not seeing him every morning when i come down to breakfast you remember my french friend gabrielle destree well she is a nun now a subsomething or other in a convent near here where they take in people for a payment somehow she heard my father was dead and came to see me and offered to put me up at the convent which has a beautiful large garden for i have been there so i said yes for i shant feel lonely with her and it will be a rest for a month i shall write to you sometimes and you neednt be afraid they wont make me a roman catholic your father objected at first but now he quite approves indeed i told him at last that i meant to go whether he approved or not it seems it doesnt matter from a business point of view as you and he are left executors of my fathers will when the month is up i will come to england and we will settle about getting married this is the address of the convent as nearly as i can remember it letters will reach me there   morris laid down the sheet with a sad heart for he had been truly attached to his uncle porson whose simple virtues he understood and appreciated then he opened his fathers letter which began in an imposing manner   my dear son usually he called him morrisit is with the deepest grief that i must tell you that poor john porson your uncle passed away this morning about ten oclock i was present at the time and did my best to soothe his last moments with such consolations as can be offered by a relative who is not a clergyman i wished to wire the sad event to you but mary in whom natural grief develops a selfwill that perhaps is also natural peremptorily refused to allow it alleging that it was useless to alarm you and waste money on telegrams how like a woman to think of money at such a moment when it was quite impossible that you could arrive here in time for the funeral for he wouldnt be brought home which under these queer foreign regulations must take place tomorrow also she announced to my surprise and i must admit somewhat to my pain that she intended to immure herself for a month in a convent after the fashion of the roman faith so that it was no use your coming as men are not admitted into these places it never seems to have occurred to her that under this blow i should have liked the consolation of her presence or that i might wish to see you my son still you must not think too much of all this although i have felt bound to bring it to your notice since women under such circumstances are naturally emotional rebellious against the decrees of providence and consequently somewhat selfish  to turn to another subject i am glad to be able to inform youyou will please accept this as an official notice of the factthat on reading a copy of your uncles will which by his directions was handed to me after his death i find that he has died much better off even than i expected the net personalty will amount to quite 100000 pounds and there is large realty of which at present i do not know the value all this is left to mary with the fullest possible powers of disposal you and i are appointed executors with a complimentary legacy of 500 pounds to you and but 100 pounds to me however the testator in consideration of the forthcoming marriage between his son morris and my daughter mary remits all debts and obligations that may be due to his estate by the said richard monk lieutenantcolonel companion of the bath and an executor of this will this amounts to something of course but i will not trouble you with details at the moment  after all now that i come to think of it it is as well that you should not leave home at present as there will be plenty of executors business to keep you on the spot no doubt you will hear from your late uncles lawyers thomas and thomas and as soon as you do so you had better go over to seaview and take formal possession of it and its contents as an executor of the will i have no time to write more at present as the undertaker is waiting to see me about the last arrangements for the interment which takes place at the english cemetery here the poor man has gone but at least we may reflect that he can be no more troubled by sickness etc and it is a consolation to know that he has made arrangements so eminently proper under the circumstances  your affectionate father  richard monk  ps i shall remain here for a little while so as to be near mary in case she wishes to see me and afterwards work homewards via paris i expect to turn up at the abbey in a fortnights time or so   quite in his best style reflected morris to himself remits all debts and obligations that may be due to his estate by the said richard monk i should be surprised if they dont amount to a good lot no wonder my father is going to return via paris he must feel quite rich again  then he sat down to write to mary  under the pressure of this sudden blowfor the fact that mr porson had been for some time in failing health and the knowledge that his life might terminate at any time did not seem to make it less suddena cloud of depression settled on the abbey household before dinner morris visited mr fregelius and told him of what had happened whereon that pious and kindly but somewhat inefficient man bestowed upon him a wellmeant lecture of consolation appreciating his motives morris thanked him sincerely and was rising to depart when the clergyman added  it is most grievous to me mr monk that in these sad hours of mourning you should be forced to occupy your mind with the details of an hospitality which has been forced upon you by circumstances for the present i fear this cannot be altered  i do not wish it altered interrupted morris  it is indeed kind of you to say so but i am happy to state the doctor tells me if i continue to progress as well as at present i shall be able to leave your roof  my fathers roof broke in morris again  i beg pardonyour fathers roofin about a fortnight  i am sorry to hear it sir and please clear your mind of the idea that you have ceased to be welcome your presence and that of miss fregelius will lessen not increase my trouble i should be lonely in this great place with no company but that of my own thoughts  i am glad to hear you say so whether you feel it or not you are kind very kind  and so for the while they parted when she came in that afternoon mr fregelius told stella the news but as it happened she did not see morris until she met him at dinner time  you have heard he asked  oh yes she answered and i am sorry so sorry i do not know what more to say  there is nothing to be said answered morris my poor uncle had lived out his lifehe was sixtyeight you know and there is an end  were you fond of him forgive me for asking but people are not always fondreally fondof those who happen to be their relations  yes i was very fond of him he was a good man though simple and selfmade very kind to everybody especially to myself  then do not grieve for him his pains are over and some day you will meet him again will you not  i suppose so but in the presence of death faith falters  i know but i think that is when it should be strongest and clearest that is when we should feel that whatever else is unreal and false this is certain and true  morris bowed his head in assent and there was silence for a while  i am afraid that miss porson must feel this very much stella said presently  yes she seems quite crushed she was his only living child you know  are you not going to join her  no i cannot she has gone into a convent for a month near beaulieu and i am afraid the sisters would not let me through their gates  is she a catholic  not at all but an old friend of hers holds some high position in the place and she has taken a fancy to be quiet there for a while  it is very natural answered stella and nothing more was said upon the subject  stella neither played the violin nor sang that night nor indeed again while she remained alone with morris at the abbey both of them felt that under the circumstances this form of pleasure would be out of place if not unfeeling and it was never suggested for the rest however their life went on as usual on two or three occasions when the weather was suitable some further experiments were carried out with the aerophone but on most days stella was engaged in preparing the rectory a square redbrick house dating from the time of george iii to receive them as soon as her father could be moved very fortunately as has been said their journey in the steamer trondhjem had been decided upon so hurriedly that there was no time to allow them to ship their heavy baggage and furniture which were left to follow and thus escaped destruction now at length these had arrived and the unpacking and arrangement gave her constant thought and occupation in which morris occasionally assisted  one evening indeed he stayed in the rectory with her helping to hang some pictures till about halfpast six oclock when they started for the abbey as it chanced a heavy gale was blowing that night one of the furious winter storms which are common on this coast and its worst gusts beat upon stella so fiercely that she could scarcely stand and was glad to accept the support of morriss arm as they struggled along the high road thus a particularly savage blast tore the hood of stellas ulster from her head whereupon leaning over her in such a position that his face was necessarily quite close to her own with some difficulty he managed to replace the hood  it was while morris was so engaged that a dogcart which because of the roar of the wind he did not hear and because of his position he could not see until it was almost passing them came slowly down the road  then catching the gleam of the lamps he looked up and started back thinking that they were being run into to perceive that the occupants of the dogcart were stephen and eliza layard  at the same moment stephen recognised them as indeed he could scarcely help doing with the light of the powerful lamp shining full upon their faces he shouted something to his sister who also stared coldly at the pair then a kind of fury seemed to seize the little man at any rate he shook his clenched fist in a menacing fashion and brought down the whip with a savage cut upon the horse as the animal sprang forward moreover morris could almost have sworn that he heard the words kissing her spoken in stephens voice followed by a laugh from eliza  then the dogcart vanished into the darkness and the incident was closed  for a moment morris stood angry and astonished but reflecting that in this wind his ears might have deceived him and that at any rate stella had heard nothing through her thick frieze hood he once more offered his arm and walked forward  the next day was sunday when as usual he escorted stella to church the layards were there also but he noticed that somewhat ostentatiously they hurried from the building immediately on the conclusion of the service and it struck him that this demonstration might have some meaning eliza whom he afterwards observed engaged apparently in eager conversation with a knot of people on the roadway was as he knew well no friend to him for reasons which he could guess nor as he had heard from various quarters was she any friend of stella fregelius any more than she had been to jane rose it struck him that even now she might be employed in sowing scandal about them both and for stellas sake the thought made him furious but even if it were so he did not see what he could do therefore he tried to think he was mistaken and to dismiss the matter from his mind  colonel monk had written to say that he was coming home on the wednesday but he did not in fact put in an appearance till the halfpast six train on the following saturday evening when he arrived beautifully dressed in the most irreproachable black and in a very good temper  ah morris old fellow he said i am very pleased to see you again after all there is no place like home and at my time of life nothing to equal quiet i cant tell you how sick i got of that french hole if it hadnt been for mary and my old friend lady rawlins who as usual was in trouble with that wretched husband of hershe is an imbecile now you knowi should have been back long before well how are you getting on  oh pretty well thank you father morris answered in that rather restrained voice which was natural to him when conversing with his parent i think i really think i have nearly perfected my aerophone  have you well then i hope you will make something out of it after all these years not that it much matters now however he added contentedly by the way that reminds me how are our two guests the new parson and his daughter that was a queer story about your finding her on the wreck are they still here  yes but the old gentleman is out of bed now and he expects to be able to move into the rectory on monday  does he well they must have given you some company while you were alone there is no time like the present i will go up and see him before i dress for dinner  accordingly morris conducted his father to the abbots chamber and introduced him to the clergyman mr fregelius was seated in his armchair with a crutch by his side and on learning who his visitor was made a futile effort to rise  pray pray sir said the colonel keep seated or you will certainly hurt your leg again  when i should be obliged to inflict myself upon you for another five or six weeks replied mr fregelius  in that case sir said the colonel with his most courteous bow and for that reason only i should consider the accident fortunate by these happy words making of his guest a devoted friend for ever  i dont know how to thank you i really dont know how to thank you  then pray mr fregelius leave the thanks unspoken what would you have had usor rather my sondo turn a senseless shattered man from his door and that man his future spiritual pastor and master  but there was more he mr monk i mean saved my daughter stellas life you know a block or a spar fell on me immediately after the ship struck then those cowardly dogs of sailors thinking that she must founder instantly threw me into the boat and rowed away leaving her to her fate in the cabin whereon your son acting on some words which i spoke in my delirium sailed out alone at night and rescued her  yes i heard something but morris is not too communicative the odd thing about the whole affair so far as i can gather is that he should have discovered that there was anybody left on board but he is a curious fellow morris those things which one would expect him to know he never does know and the things that nobody else has ever heard of he seems to have at his fingers ends by instinct or second sight or something well it has all turned out for the best hasnt it  oh yes i suppose so answered mr fregelius glancing at his injured leg at any rate we are both alive and have not lost many of our belongings  quite so and under the circumstances you should be uncommonly thankful but i need not tell a parson that well i can only say that i am delighted to have such a good opportunity of making your acquaintance which i am sure will lead to our pulling together in parish affairs like a pair of matched horses now i must go and dress but i tell you what ill come and smoke a cigar with you afterwards and put you au fait with all our various concerns youll find them a nice lot in this parish i can tell you a nice lot old tomley just gave them up as a bad job  i hope i shant do that replied mr fregelius after his retreating form  the colonel was down to dinner first and standing warming himself at the library fire when stella once more in honour of his arrival arrayed in her best dress entered the room the colonel put up his eyeglass and looked at her as she came down its length  by jove he thought to himself i didnt know that the clergymans daughter was like this nobody ever said so after all that fellow morris cant be half such a fool as he looks for he kept it dark then he stepped forward with outstretched hand  you must allow me to introduce myself miss fregelius he said with an oldfashioned and courtly bow and to explain that i have the honour to be my sons father  she bowed and answered yes i think i should have known that from the likeness  hum said the colonel even at my age i am not certain that i am altogether flattered morris is an excellent fellow and very clever at electrical machines but i have never considered him remarkable for personal beautynot exactly an adonis or an apollo or a narcissus you know  i should doubt whether any of them had such a nice face replied stella with a smile  my word now that is what i call a compliment worth having but i hear the gentleman himself coming shall i repeat it to him  no please dont colonel monk i did not mean it for compliment only for an answer  your wish is a command but may i make an exception in favour of miss porson who prospectively owns the nice face in question she would be delighted to know it so highly rated and he glanced at her sharply the look of a man of the world who is trying to read a womans heart  by all means answered stella in an indifferent voice but recognising in the colonel one who as friend or foe must be taken into account then morris came in and they went to dinner  here also colonel monk was very pleasant he made stella tell the story of the shipwreck and of her rescue and generally tried to draw her out in every possible way but all the while he was watching and taking note of many things before they had been together for five minutes he observed that this couple his son and their visitor were on terms of extreme intimacyintimacy so extreme and genuine that in two instances at least each anticipated what the other was going to say without waiting for any words to be spoken thus stella deliberately answered a question that morris had not put and he accepted the answer and continued the argument quite as a matter of course also they seemed mysteriously to understand each others wants and worst of all he noted that when speaking they never addressed each other by name evidently just then each of them had but one you in the world  now the colonel had not passed through very varied experiences and studied many sides and conditions of life for nothing indeed he would himself explain that he was able to see as far into a brick wall as other folk  the upshot of all this was that first he thought morris a very lucky fellow to be an object of undoubted admiration to those beautiful eyes it may be explained that the colonel throughout life had been an advocate of taking such goods as the gods provided something of a worshipper too at the shrine of lovely thais his second reflection was that under all the circumstances it seemed quite time that he returned home to look after him  now miss fregelius he said as she rose to leave the table when morris and i have had a glass of wine and ten minutes to chat over matters connected with his poor uncles death i am going to ask you to do me a favour before i go up to smoke a cigar with your father it is that you will play me a tune on the violin and sing me a song  did mr monk tell you that i played and sang she asked  no he did not indeed mr monk has told me nothing whatsoever about you his as you may have observed is not a very communicative nature the information came from a much less interesting though for aught i know from a more impartial sourcethe fat pageboy thomas who is first tenor in the wesleyan chapel and therefore imagines that he understands music  but how could thomas began morris when his father cut him short and answered  oh ill tell you quite simply i had it from the interesting youths own lips as he unpacked my clothes it seems that the day before the news of your uncles death reached this place thomas was aroused from his slumbers by hearing what he was pleased to call hangels aarping and singing as soon as he convinced himself that he still lingered on the earth drawn by the sweetness of the sounds just in his jacket and breeches he followed them until he was sure that they proceeded from your workshop the chapel  now as you know on the upstair passage there still is that queer slit through which the old abbots used to watch the monks at their devotions finding the shutter unlocked the astute thomas followed their example as well as he could for he says there was no light in the chapel except that of the fire by which presently he made out your figure miss fregelius sometimes playing the violin and sometimes singing and that of morrisagain i must quoteasitting in a chair by the fire with his ands at the back of is ead astaring at the floor and rocking imself as though he felt right down bad no dont interrupt me morris i must tell my story its very amusing  well miss fregelius he saysand mind you this is a great complimentthat you sang and played till he felt as though he would cry when at last you sank down quite exhausted in a chair then suddenly realising that he was very cold and hearing the stable clock strike two he went back to bed and thats the end of the tale now you will understand why i have asked you this favour i dont see why morris and thomas should keep it all to themselves  i shall be delighted answered stella who although her cheeks were burning and she knew that the merciless colonel was taking note of the fact on the whole had gone through the ordeal remarkably well then she left the room  as soon as the door closed morris turned upon his father angrily  oh my dear boy the colonel said please do not begin to explain i know its all perfectly right and there is nothing to explain why shouldnt you get an uncommonly pretty girl with a good voice to sing to youwhile you are still in a position to listen but if you care to take my advice next time you will see that the shutter of that hagioscope or whatever they call it is locked as such elevated delights a deux are apt to be misinterpreted by the vulgar and now theres enough of this chaff and nonsense i want to speak to you about the executorship and matters connected with the property generally  half an hour later when the colonel appeared in the drawingroom the violin was fetched and stella played it and sang afterwards to a pianoforte accompaniment the performance was not of the same standard by any means as that which had delighted thomas for stella did not feel the surroundings quite propitious still with her voice and touch she could not fail and the result was that before she had done the colonel grew truly enthusiastic  i know a little of music he said and i have heard most of the best singers and violinists during the last forty years but in the face of all those memories i hope you will allow me to congratulate you miss fregelius there are some notes in your voice which really reduce me to the condition of peeping thomas and hardened old fellow that i am almost make me feel inclined to cry    chapter xv  three interviews  the next day was a sunday and the colonel went to church wearing a hatband four inches deep morris however declined to accompany him saying that he had a letter to write to mary whereon his father who at first was inclined to be vexed replied that he could not be better employed and that he was to give her his love then he asked if miss fregelius was coming but somewhat to his disappointment was informed that she wished to stay with her father  i wonder thought the colonel to himself as he strolled to the church now and again acknowledging greetings or stopping to chat with one of the villagersi wonder if they are going to have a little sacred music together in the chapel if so upon my soul i should like to make the congregation and that pious fellow morris toothe blameless morristo go philandering about in this fashion i hope it wont come to marys ears but if it does luckily with all her temper she is a sensible woman and knows that even jove nods at times  after the service the colonel spoke to various friends accepted their condolences upon the death of mr porson and finally walked down the road with eliza layard  you must have found that all sorts of strange things have happened at the abbey since you have been away colonel monk she said presently in a sprightly voice  well yes at least i dont know i understand that morris has improved that blessed apparatus of his and the new parson and his daughter have floated to our doors like driftwood by the way have you seen miss fregelius  seen her yes i have seen her  she is a wonderfully captivating girl isnt she so unusual with those great eyes of hers that seem to vary with the light  like a cats snapped eliza  the light withini was going to say  oh i thought you meant the light without well she may be fascinatingto men but as i am only a woman i cannot be expected to appreciate that you see we look more to other things  ah well so far as i am a judge she seemed to me to be pretty well set up in them also she has a marvellous voice is certainly a firstclass violinist and i should say extremely wellread especially in norse literature  oh i daresay she is a genius as well as a beauty  i gather said the colonel with a smile that you do not like miss fregelius as my acquaintance with her is limited would you think me rude if i asked why  how can i be expected to like her seeing and she paused  seeing what miss layard  what havent you heard i thought it was common property  he shook his head i have heard nothing go on pray this is quite interesting  that she led on that silly brother of mine until he proposed to heryes proposed to herand then refused him stephen has been like a crazy creature ever since moaning and groaning and moping till i think that he will go off his head instead of returning thanks to providence for a merciful escape  the colonel set his lips as though to whistle then checked himself  under the circumstances presuming them to be accurately stated i am not prepared to say who is to be congratulated or who should thank providence these things are so individual are they not but if one thing is clear whatever else she is or is not miss fregelius cannot be a fortunehunter although she must want money  she may want other things more  perhaps but i am very stupid i am afraid i do not understand  men for instance suggested eliza  dear me that sounds almost carnivorous i am afraid that there are not many about here to satisfy her appetite your brother morris the curate at morton and myself if at my age i may creep into that honourable company are the only single creatures within four miles and from these stephen and morris must apparently be eliminated  why should morris be eliminated  a reason may occur to you  do you mean because he is engaged what on earth does that matter  nothingin the eastbut rightly or wrongly we have decided upon a monogamous system a man cant marry two wives miss layard  but he can throw over one girl to marry another  do you suggest that morris is contemplating this experiment  i i suggest nothing all i know is  well now what do you know  if you wish me to tell you as perhaps i ought i know this colonel monk that the other night when i was driving along the rectory road i saw your son mr monk kissing this wonderful miss fregelius that is all and stephen saw it also you ask him  thank you i think i would rather not but what an odd place for him to choose for this interchange of early christian courtesies alsoif you are not mistakenhow well it illustrates that line in the hymn this morning  how many a spot defiles the robe that wraps an earthly saint  such adventures seem scarcely in morriss line and i should have thought that even an inexperienced saint would have been more discreet  men always jest at serious things said eliza severely  which do you meanthe saints or the kissing both are serious enough but the two in combination  dont you believe me asked eliza  of course but could you give me a few details  eliza could and didwith amplifications  now what do you say colonel monk she asked triumphantly  i say that i think you have made an awkward mistake miss layard it seems to me that all you saw is quite consistent with the theory that he was buttoning or arranging the young ladys hood i understand that the wind was very high that night  eliza started this was a new and unpleasant interpretation which she hastened to repudiate arranging her hood indeed  when he might have been kissing her you cannot understand such moderation still it is possible and he ought to have the benefit of the doubt witnesses to character would be valuable in such a case and hisnot to mention the ladysis curiously immaculate  of course you are entitled to your own opinion but i have mine  suddenly the colonel changed his bantering satirical tone and became stern and withering  miss layard he said does it occur to you that on evidence which would not suffice to convict a bicyclist of riding on a footpath you are circulating a scandal of which the issue might be very grave to both the parties concerned  i am not circulating anything i was telling you privately replied eliza still trying to be bold  i am glad to hear it i understand that neither you nor your brother have spoken of this extraordinary tale and i am quite certain that you will not speak of it in the future  i cannot answer for my brother she said sulkily  no but in his own interest and in yours i trust that you will make him understand that if i hear a word of this i shall hold him to account also that his propagation of such a slander will react upon you who were with him  how asked eliza now thoroughly frightened for when he chose the colonel could be very crushing  thus your brothers evidence is that of an interested person which no one will accept and of yours miss layard it might be inferred that it was actuated by jealousy of a charming and quite innocent girl or perhaps by other motives even worse which i would rather you did not ask me to suggest  eliza did not ask him she was too wise as she knew well when roused the colonel was a man with a bitter tongue and a good memory  i am sure i am the last person who would wish to do mischief she said in a humble voice  of course i know that i know that well now we understand each other so i must be turning home thank you so much for having been quite candid with me good morning miss layard remember me to stephen  phew reflected the colonel to himself that battle is wonafter a fashionbut just about fortyeight hours too late by this time that vixen of a woman has put the story all over the place oh morris you egregious ass if you wanted to take to kissing like a schoolboy why the deuce did you select the high road for the purpose this must be put a stop to i must take steps and at once they mustnt be seen together again or there will be trouble with mary but how to do it how to do it that is the question and one to which i must find an answer within the next two hours what a kettle of fish what a pretty kettle of fish  in due course and after diligent search he found the answer to this question    at lunch time the colonel remarked casually that he had walked a little way with miss layard who mentioned that she had seen themie his son and miss fregeliusstruggling through the gale the other night then he watched the effect of this shot morris moved his chair and looked uncomfortable clearly he was a most transparent sinner but on stella it took no effect  as usual reflected the colonel the lady has the most control or perhaps he tried to kiss her and she wouldnt let him and a consciousness of virtue gives her strength  after luncheon the colonel paid a visit to mr fregelius ostensibly to talk to him about the proposed restoration of the chancel for which he as holder of the great tithes was jointly liable with the rector a responsibility that in the altered circumstances of the family he now felt himself able to face when this subject was exhausted which did not take long as mr fregelius refused to express any positive opinion until he had inspected the church the colonels manner grew portentously solemn  my dear sir he said there is another matter a somewhat grave one upon which for both our sakes and the sakes of those immediately concerned i feel bound to say a few words  mr fregelius who was a timid man looked very much alarmed a conviction that the grave matter had something to do with stella flashed into his mind but all he said was  i am afraid i dont understand colonel monk  no indeed how should you well to come to the point it has to do with that very charming daughter of yours and my son morris  i feared as much groaned the clergyman  indeed i thought you said you did not understand  no but i guessed wherever stella goes things seem to happen  exactly well things have happened here to be brief i mean that a lot of silly women have got up a scandal about themno scandal is too strong a wordgossip  what is alleged asked mr fregelius faintly  well that your daughter threw over that young ass stephen layard becausethe story seems to me incredible i admitshe had fallen violently in love with morris further that she and the said morris were seen embracing at night on the rectory road which i dont believe as the witnesses are layard who is prejudiced and his sister who is the most illbred bitter and disappointed woman in the county lastly and this is no doubt true that they are generally on terms of great intimacy and we all know where that leads to between a man and womanplato thy confounded fantasies etc you see when people sit up singing to each other alone till two in the morningi dont mean that morris sings he has no more voice than a crow he does the appreciative audiencewell other people will talk wont they  i suppose so the world being what it is sighed mr fregelius  exactly the world being what it is and men and women what they are a most unregenerate lot and au fond very primitive as i daresay you may have observed  what is to be done  well under other circumstances i should have said nothing at all except congratulate them most heartily more especially my son but in this case there are reasons which make such a course impossible as you know morris is engaged to be married to my niece miss porson and it is a contract which even if he wished it honour would forbid him to break for family as well as for personal reasons  quite so quite so it is not to be thought of but again i askwhat is to be done  is that not rather a question for you to consider i suggest that you had better speak to your daughter just a hint you know just a hint  upon my word id rather not stella can be sodecidedat times and we never seem quite to understand each other i did speak to her the other day when mr layard wished to marry her a match i was naturally anxious for but the results were not satisfactory  still i think you might try  very well i will try and colonel monk i cannot tell you how grieved i am to have brought all this trouble on you  not a bit answered the colonel cheerfully i am an old student of human nature and i rather enjoy it its like watching the puppets on a stage only we mustnt let the comedy grow into a tragedy  ah thats what i am afraid of some tragedy stella is a woman who takes things hard and if any affection really has sprung up  it will no doubt evaporate with the usual hysterics and morning headache bless me i have known dozens of them and felt some myself in my timethe headaches i mean not the other things dont be alarmed if she gets angry mr fregelius but just appeal to her reason she will see the force of it afterwards  an hour or so later the colonel started for a walk on the beach to look at some damage which a high tide had done to the cliff as he was nearing the abbey steps on his return he saw the figure of a woman standing quite still upon the sands an inspection through his eyeglass revealed that it was stella and instinct told him her errand  this is rather awkward he thought as he braced himself to battle especially as i like that girl and dont want to hurt her feelings hullo miss fregelius are you taking the air you should walk or you will catch cold  no colonel monk i was waiting for you  waiting for me me this is indeed an honour and one which age appreciates  she waved aside his twoedged badinage you have been speaking to my father she said  instantly the colonel assumed a serious manner not the most serious such as he wore at funerals but still one suited to a grave occasion  yes i have  you remember all that you said  certainly miss fregelius and i assume that for the purposes of this conversation it need not be repeated  she bowed her head and replied i have come to explain and to tell you three things first that all these stories are false except that about the singing secondly that whoever is responsible for them has made it impossible that i should live in monksland so i am going to london to earn my own living there and thirdly that i hope you will excuse my absence from dinner as i think the more i keep to myself until we go tomorrow the better though i reserve to myself the right to speak to mr monk on this subject and to say goodbye to him  she is taking it hard and she is fond of himdeuced fond of him poor girl thought the colonel but aloud he said my dear miss fregelius i never believed the stories as for the principal one common sense rebels against it all i said to your father was that there appears to be a lot of talk about the place and under the circumstances of my sons engagement that he might perhaps give you a friendly hint  oh indeed he did not put it quite like that he gave me to understand that you had told himthat i wassoso much in love with mr monk that on this account i hadrejected mr layard  please keep walking said the colonel or you really will catch cold then suddenly he stopped looked her sharply in the face much as he had done to eliza and said well and are you not in love with him  for a moment stella stared at him indignantly then suddenly he saw a blush spread upon her face to be followed by an intense pallor while the pupils of the lovely eyes enlarged themselves and grew soft next instant she put her hand to her heart tottered on her feet and had he not caught her would perhaps have fallen  i do not think i need trouble you to answer my question which indeed now that i think of it was one i had no right to put he said as she recovered herself  oh my god moaned stella wringing her hands i never knew it till this moment you have brought it home to me you yes you and she burst out weeping  here are the hysterics thought the colonel and i am afraid that the headache will be bad tomorrow morning  to her however he said very tenderly my dear girl my dear girl pray do not distress yourself these little accidents will happen in the best regulated hearts and believe me you will get over it in a month or two  accident she said it is no accident it is fatei see it all nowand i shall never get over it however that is my own affair and i have no right to trouble you with my misfortunes  oh but you will indeed and though you may think the advice hard i will tell you the best way  she looked up in inquiry  change your mind and marry stephen layard he is not at all a bad fellow andthere are obvious advantages  this was the colonels first really false move as he himself felt before the last word had left his lips  colonel monk she said because i am unfortunate is it any reason that you should insult me  miss fregelius to my knowledge i have never insulted any woman and certainly i should not wish to begin with one who has just honoured me with her confidence  is it not an insult she answered with a sort of sob when a woman to her shame and sorrow has confessedwhat i haveto bid her console herself by marriage with another man  now that you put it thus i confess that perhaps some minds might so interpret an intention which did not exist it seemed to me that after a while in marriage you would most easily forget a trouble which my son so unworthily has brought on you  dont blame him for he does not deserve it if anybody is to blame it is i but in truth all those stories are false we have neither of us done anything  do not press the point miss fregelius i believe you  we have neither of us done anything she repeated and what is more if you had not interfered i do not think that i should have found out the truth or at least not yettill i saw him married perhaps when it would have been no matter  when you see a man walking in his sleep you do your best to stop him said the colonel  and so cause him to fall over the precipice and be dashed to bits oh you should have let me finish my journey then i should have come back to the bed that i have made to lie on and waked to find myself alone and nobody would have been hurt except myself who caused the evil  the colonel could not continue this branch of the conversation even to him a hardened vessel as he had defined himself it was too painful  you said you mean to earn a living in london how  by my voice and violin if one can sing and play with a sore heart i have an old aunt a sister of my fathers who is a music mistress with whom i daresay i can arrange to live and who may be able to get me some introductions  i hope that i can help you there and i will to the best of my ability indeed if necessary i will go to town and see about things allow me to add this miss fregelius that i think you are doing a very brave thing and what is more a very wise one and i believe that before long we shall hear of you as the great new contralto  she shrugged her shoulders it may be i dont care goodbye by the way i wish to see mr monk once more before i go it would be better for us all i suppose that you dont object to that do you  miss fregelius my son is a man advancing towards middle age it is entirely a point for you and him to decide and i will only say that i have every confidence in you  thank you she answered and turning walked rapidly down the lonely beach till her figure melted into the gathering gloom of the winters night once however when she thought that she was out of eyeshot he saw her stop with her face towards the vast and bitter sea and saw also that she was wringing her hands in an agony of the uttermost despair  she looks like a ghost said the colonel aloud with a little shiver like a helpless homeless ghost with the world behind her and the infinite in front and nothing to stand on but a patch of shifting sand wet with her own tears  when the colonel grew thus figurative and poetical it may be surmised by anyone who has taken the trouble to study his mixed and somewhat worldly character that he was deeply moved and he was moved more so indeed than he had been since the death of his wife why he would have found it hard to explain on the face of it the story was of a trivial order and in some of its aspects rather absurd two young people who happened to be congenial but one of whom was engaged chance to be thrown together for a couple of months in a country house although there is some gossip nothing at all occurs between them beyond a little perfectly natural flirtation the young mans father hearing the gossip speaks to the young lady in order that she may take steps to protect herself and his son against surmise and misinterpretation thereupon a sudden flood of light breaks upon her soul by which she sees that she is really attached to the young man and being a woman of unusual character or perhaps absurdly averse to lying even upon such a subject in answer to a question admits that this is so and that she very properly intends to go away  could anything be more commonplace more in the natural order of events why then was he moved oh it was that womans face and eyes old as he might be he felt jealous of his son jealous to think that for him such a woman could wear this countenance of wonderful and thrilling woe what was there in morris that it should have called forth this depth of passion undefiled now if there were no marybut there was a mary it was folly to pursue such a line of thought  from sympathy for stella which was deep and genuine to anger with his son proved to the colonel an easy step morris was that worst of sinners a hypocrite morris being engaged to one woman had taken advantage of her absence deliberately to involve the affections of another or at any rate caused her considerable inconvenience he was wroth with morris and what was more before he grew an hour older he would let him have a piece of his mind  he found the sinner in his workshop the chapel making mathematical calculations the very sight of which added to his fathers indignation the man he reflected to himself who under these circumstances could indulge an abnormal talent for mathematics especially on sunday must be a coldblooded brute he entered the place slamming the door behind him and morris looking up noted with alarm for he hated rows that there was war in his eye  wont you take a chair father he said  no thank you i would rather say what i have to say standing  what is the matter  the matter is sir that i find that by your attentions you have made that poor girl miss fregelius while she was a guest in my house the object of slander and scandal to every illnatured gossip in the three parishes  morriss quiet thoughtful eyes flashed in an ominous and unusual manner  if you were not my father he said i should ask you to change your tone in speaking to me on such a subject but as things are i suppose that i must submit to it unless you choose otherwise  the facts morris answered his father justify any language that i can use  did you get these facts from stephen layard and miss layard ah i guessed as much well the story is a lie i was merely arranging her hood which she could not do herself as the wind forced her to use her hand to hold her dress down  the thought of his own ingenuity in hitting on the right solution of the story mollified the colonel not a little  pshaw he said i knew that do you suppose that i believed you fool enough to kiss a girl on the open road when you had every opportunity of kissing her at home i know too that you have never kissed her at all or ostensibly at any rate done anything that you shouldnt do  what is my offence then asked morris  your offence is that you have got her talked about that you have made her in love with youdont deny it i have it from her own lips that you have driven her out of this place to earn a living in london as best she may and that being yourself an engaged manhere once more the colonel drew a bow at a ventureyou are what is called in love with her yourself  these two were easy victims to the skill of so experienced an archer the shaft went home between the joints of his sons harness and morris sank back in his chair and turned white generosity or perhaps the fear of exciting more unpleasant consequences prevented the colonel from following up this head of his advantage  there is more a great deal more behind he went on for instance all this will probably come to marys ears  certainly it will i shall tell her of it myself  which will be tantamount to breaking your engagement may i ask if that is your intention  no but supposing that all you say were true and that it was my intention what then  then sir to my oldfashioned ideas you would be a dishonourable fellow to cast away the woman who has only you to look to in the world that you may put another woman who has taken your fancy in her place  morris bit his lip  still speaking on that supposition he replied would it not be more dishonourable to marry her would it not be kinder shameful as it may be to tell her all the truth and let her seek some worthier man  the colonel shrugged his shoulders i cant split hairs he said or enter on an argument of sentimental casuistry but i tell you this morris although you are my only son and the last of our name that rather than do such a thing under all the circumstances it would be better that you should take a pistol and blow your brains out  very probably answered morris but would you mind telling me also what are the exact circumstances which would in your opinion so aggravate this particular case  you have a copy of your uncle porsons will in that drawer give it me  morris obeyed and his father searched for and read the following sentence in consideration of the forthcoming marriage between his son morris and my daughter mary the said testator remits all debts and obligations that may be due to his estate by the said richard monk lieutenant colonel companion of the bath and an executor of this will  well said morris  well replied the colonel coolly those debts in all amounted to 19543 pounds no wonder you seem astonished but they have been accumulating for a score of years theres the fact any way so discussion is no use now do you understand in consideration of the forthcoming marriage remember  i shall be rich some day that machine you laugh at will make me rich already i have been approached i might repay this money  yes and you might not such hopes and expectations have a way of coming to nothing besides hang it all morris you know that there is more than money in the question  morris hid his face in his hands for a moment when he removed them it was ashen yes he said things are unfortunate you remember that you were very anxious that i should engage myself and mary was so good as to accept me perhaps i cannot say i should have done better to have waited till i felt some real impulse towards marriage however that is all gone by and father you need not be in the least afraid there is not the slightest fear that i shall attempt to do anything of which you would disapprove  i was sure you wouldnt old fellow answered the colonel in a friendly tone not when you came to think matters seem to have got into a bit of a tangle dont they most unfortunate that charming young lady being brought to this house in such a fashion really it looks like a spite of what she called fate however i have no doubt that it will all straighten itself somehow by the way she told me that she should wish to see you once to say goodbye before she went dont be vexed with me if should she do so i suggest to you to be very careful your position will be exceedingly painful and exceedingly dangerous and in a moment all your fine resolutions may come to nothing though i am sure that she does not wish any such thing poor dear unless she really seeks this interview i think indeed it would be best avoided  morris made no answer and the colonel went away somewhat weary and sorrowful for once he had seen too much of his puppetshow    chapter xvi  a marriage and after  stella did not appear at dinner that night or at breakfast next day in the course of the morning growing impatient for he had explanations to make morris sent her a note worded thus   can i see youm m   to which came the following answer   not today meet me tomorrow at the dead church at three oclock stella   it was the only letter that he ever received from her  that afternoon december 23 mr fregelius and his daughter moved to the rectory in a fly that had been especially prepared to convey the invalid without shaking him morris did not witness their departure as the colonel either by accident or design had arranged to go with him on this day to inspect the new buildings which had been erected on the abbey farm nor indeed were the names of the departed guests so much as mentioned at dinner that night the incident of their long stay at the abbey with all its curious complications was closed and both father and son by tacit agreement determined to avoid all reference to it at any rate for the present  the christmas eve of that year will long be remembered in monksland and all that stretch of coast as the day of the great gale which wrought so much damage on its shores the winters dawn was of extraordinary beauty for all the eastern sky might have been compared to one vast flower with a heart of burnished gold and sepals and petals of many coloured fires slowly from a central point it opened slowly its splendours spread across the heavens then suddenly it seemed to wither and die till where it had been was nothing but masses of grey vapour that arose gathered and coalesced into an ashen pall hanging low above the surface of the ashen sea the coastguard watching the glass hoisted their warning cone although as yet there was no breath of wind and old sailormen hanging about in knots on the cliff and beach went to haul up their boats as high as they could drag them knowing that it would blow hard by night  about midday the sea began to be troubled as though its waves were being pushed on by some force as yet unseen and before two oclock gusts of cold air from the noreast travelled landwards off the ocean with a low moaning sound which was very strange to hear  as morris trudged along towards the dead church he noticed as we do notice such things when our minds are much preoccupied and oppressed that these gusts were coming quicker and quicker although still separated from each other by periods of aerial calm then he remembered that a great gale had been prophesied in the weather reports and thought to himself that they portended its arrival  he reached the church by the narrow spit of sand and shingle which still connected it with the shore passed through the door in the rough brick wall closing it behind him and paused to look already under that heavy sky the light which struggled through the brineencrusted eastern window was dim and grey presently however he discovered the figure of stella seated in her accustomed place by the desolatelooking stone altar whereon stood the box containing the aerophone that they had used in their experiments she was dressed in her darkcoloured ulster of which the hood was still drawn over her head giving her the appearance of some cloaked nun lingering out of time and place in the ruined habitations of her worship  as he advanced she rose and pushed back the hood revealing the masses of her waving hair to which it had served as a sole covering in silence stella stretched out her hand and in silence morris took it for neither of them seemed to find any words at length she spoke fixing her sad eyes upon his face and saying  you understand that we meet to part i am going to london tomorrow my father has consented  that is christmas day he faltered  yes but there is an early train the same that runs on sundays  then there was another pause  i wish to ask your pardon he said for all the trouble that i have brought upon you  she smiled i think it is i who should ask yours you have heard of these stories  yes my father spoke to me he told me of his conversation with you  all of it  i do not know i suppose so and he hung his head  oh she broke out in a kind of cry if he told you all  you must not blame him he interrupted he was very angry with me he considered that i had behaved badly to you and everybody and i do not think that he weighed his words  i am not angry now that i think of it what does it matter i cannot help things and the truth will out  yes he said quite simply we love each other so we may as well admit it before we part  yes she echoed without disturbance or surprise i know nowwe love each other  these were the first intimate words that ever passed between them this their declaration unusual even in the long history of the passions of men and women and not the less so because neither of them seemed to think its fashion strange  it must always have been so said morris  always she answered from the beginning from the time you saved my life and we were together in the boat andperhaps who can saybefore i can see it now only until they put light into our minds we did not understand i suppose that sooner or later we should have found it out for having been brought together nothing could ever have really kept us asunder  nothing but death he answered heavily  that is your old error the error of a lack of faith she replied with one of her bright smiles death will unite us beyond the possibility of parting i pray god that it may come quicklyto me not to you you have your life to lead mine is finished i do not mean the life of my body but the real life that within  i think that you are right i grow sure of it but here there is nothing to be done  of course she answered eagerly nothing do you suppose that i wished to suggest such a treachery  no you are too pure and good  good i am notwho isbut i believe that i am pure  it is bitter groaned morris  why so my heart aches and yet through the pain i rejoice because i know that it is well with us had you not loved me then it would have been bitter the rest is little what does it matter when and how and where it comes about today we partfor ever in the flesh you will not look upon this mortal face of mine again  why do you say so  because i feel that it is true  he glanced up hastily and she answered the question in his eyes  noindeednot thati never thought of such a thing i think it a crime we are bid to endure the burden of our day i shall go on weaving my web and painting my picture till soon or late god says hold and then i shall die gladly yes very gladly because the real beginning is at hand  oh that i had your perfect faith groaned morris  then if you love me learn it from me should i of all people tell you what is not true it is the truthi swear it is the truth i am not deceived i know i know i know  what do you knowabout us  that when it is over we shall meet again where there is no marriage where there is nothing gross where love perfect and immortal reigns and passion is forgotten there that we love each other will make no heart sore not even hers whom here perhaps we have wronged there will be no jealousies since each and all themselves happy in their own way and according to their own destinies will rejoice in the happiness of others there too our life will be one life our work one work our thought one thoughtnothing more shall separate us at all in that place where there is no change or shadow of turning therefore and she clasped her hands and looked upwards her face shining like a saints although the tears ran down it therefore o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory  you talk like one upon the verge of it who hears the beating of deaths wings it frightens me stella  i know nothing of that it may be tonight or fifty years hencewe are always on the verge and those wings i have heard from childhood fifty even seventy years and after themall the infinite one tiny grain of sand compared to the bed of the great sea that sea from which it was washed at dawn to be blown back again at nightfall  but the dead forgetin that land all things are forgotten were you to die i should call to you and you would not answer and when my time came i might look for you and never find you  how dare you say it if i die search and you shall see no do not search wait at your death i will be with you  whatever happens in life or deathhere or hereafterswear that you will not forget me and that you will love me only swear it stella  come to this altar she said when she had thought a moment and give me your handso now before my maker and the presences who surround us i marry you morris monk not in the fleshwith your flesh i have nothing to dobut in the spirit i take your soul to mine i give my soul to yours yours it was from its births day yours it is and when it ceases to be yours let it perish everlastingly  so be it to both of us for ever and for ever he answered  this then was their marriage and as they walked hand in hand away from the ancient altar which surely had never seen so strange a rite there returned to morris an idle fantasy which had entered his mind at this very spot when they landed one morning halffrozen after that night in the open boat but he said nothing of it for with the memory came a recollection of certain wandering words which that same day fell from stellas lips words at the thought of which his spirit thrilled and his flesh shuddered what if she were near it or he were near it or both of them what if this solemn ceremony of marriage mocked yet made divine had taken place upon the very threshold of its immortal consummation she read his thought and answered  remember always far and near it is the same thing time is nothing this oath of ours cannot be touched by time or earthly change  i will remember he answered  what more did they say he never could be sure nor does it matter for what is written bears its gist  go away first she said presently i promised your father that i would bring no further trouble on you so we must not be seen together go now for the gale is rising fast and the darkness grows  this is hard to bear he muttered setting his teeth are you sure that we shall not meet again in after years  sure you look your last upon me on the earthly stella whom you know and love  it must be done he said  it must be done she echoed goodbye husband till that appointed hour of meeting when i may call you so without shame and she held out her hand  he took and pressed it speak he could not then like a man stricken in years he passed down the church with bent head and shambling feet at the door he turned to look at her she was standing erect and proud as a conqueror her hand resting upon the altar even at that distance their eyes met and in hers lit with a wild and sudden ray from the sinking sun he could see a strange light shine then he went out of the door and dragged it to behind him to battle his way homeward through the roaring gale that stung and buffeted him like all the gathered spites and hammerings of destiny  this then was their parting a parting pure and stern and high unsolaced by one soft word unsweetened by a single kiss yet it seems fitting that those who hope to meet in the light of the spirit should make their last farewells on earth beneath such solemn shadows  and stella after all she was but a woman a woman with a very human heart she knew the truth indeed to whom it was given to see before the due determined time of vision but still she was troubled with that human heart and weighed down by the flesh over which she triumphed now that he was gone pride and strength seemed both to leave her and with a low cry like the cry of a wounded seabird she cast herself down there upon the cold stones before the altar and wept till her senses left her    a great gale roared and howled the waters driven onwards by its furious breath beat upon the eastern cliffs till these melted like snow beneath them taking away field and church town and protecting wall and in return casting up the wrecks of ships and the bodies of dead men  morris could not sleep who could sleep in such an awful tempest who could sleep that had passed through such a parting oh his heart ached and he was as one sick to death and with him continually was the thought of stella and before him came the vision of her eyes he could not sleep so rising he dressed himself and went to the window high in the heavens swept clean of clouds by the furious blasts floated a wandering moon throwing her ghastly light upon the swirling furious sea shorewards rushed the great rollers in unending lines there to break in thunder and seethe across the shingle till the seawall stopped them and sent the spray flying upwards in thin white clouds  god help those in the power of the sea tonight thought morris for many of them will not keep christmas here  then it seemed to his mind excited by storm and sorrow as though some power were drawing him as though some voice were telling him that there was that which he must hear aimlessly halfunconsciously he wandered to his workshop in the old chapel turned on one of the lamps and stood at the window watching the majestic progress of the storm and thinking thinking thinking  while he remained thus suddenly thrilling his nerves as though with a quick shock of pain sharp and clear even in that roar and turmoil rang out the sound of an electric bell he started round and looked yes as he thought in all the laboratory there was only one bell that could ring none other had its batteries charged and that bell was attached to the aerophone whereof the twin stood upon the altar in the dead church the instrument was one of the pair with which he had carried out his experiments of the last two months  his heart stood still great god what could have caused that bell to ring it could not ring it was a physical impossibility unless somebody were handling the sister instrument and at four oclock in the morning who could be there and except one who would know its working with a bound he was by the aerophone and had given the answering signal then instantly as though she were standing at his side in the room for this machine does not blur the voice or heighten its tone he heard stella speaking  is it you who answer me she asked  yes yes he said but where are you at this hour of the night  where you left me in the dead church floated back the quick reply through the raving breadths of storm listen after you went my strength gave out and i suppose that i fainted at least a little while ago i woke up from a deep sleep to find myself lying before the alter here i was frightened for i knew that it must be far into the night and an awful gale is blowing which shakes the whole church i went to the door and opened it and by the light of the moon i saw that between me and the shore lies a raging sea hundreds of yards wide then i came back and threw out my mind to you and tried to wake you if you slept tried to make you understand that i wished you to go to the aerophone and hear me  i will get help at once broke in morris  i beg you came back the voice i beg you do not stir the time is very short already the waves are dashing against the walls of the chancel and i hear the water rumbling in the vaults beneath my feet listen her voice ceased and in place of it there swelled the shriek of the storm which beat about the dead church the rush too of the water in the hollow vaults and the crashing of old coffins as they were washed from their niches another instant and stella had cut off these sounds and was speaking again  it is useless to think of help no boat nothing could live upon that fearful sea moreover within five minutes this church must fall and vanish  my god my god wailed morris  do not grieve it is a waste of precious time and do not stir till the end i want you to know that i did not seek this death i never dreamed of such a thing you must tell my father so and bid him not to mourn for me it was my intention to leave the church within ten minutes of yourself this cup is given to me by the hand of fate i did not fill it do you hear and understand  i hear and understand answered morris  now you see she went on that our talk today was almost inspired my web is woven my picture is painted and to me heaven says hold the thought that it might be so was in your mind was it not  yes  and i answered your thought telling you that time is nothing this i tell you again for your comfort in the days that remain to you of life oh i bless god i bless god who has dealt so mercifully to me where are now the long years of lonely suffering that i fearedi who stand upon the threshold of the eternal    i can talk no more the water is rising in the churchalready it is about my knees but remember every word which i have said to you remember that we are wedtruly wed that i go to wait for you and that even if you do not see me i will if i may be near you alwaystill you die and afterwards will be with you alwaysalways  stay cried morris  what have you to say be swift the water rises and the walls are cracking  that i love you now and for ever and for ever that i will remember everything and that i know beyond a doubt that you have seen and speak the truth  thank you for those blessed words and for this life fare you well    for a moment there was silence or at least stellas voice was silent while morris stood over the aerophone the sweat running from his face rocking like a drunken man in his agony and waiting for the end then suddenly loud clear and triumphant broke upon his ears the sound of that song which he had heard her sing upon the sinking ship when her death seemed near the ancient song of the overlord once more at the last mortal ebb while the water rose about her breast stellas instincts and blood had asserted themselves and forgetting aught else she was dying as her pagan forefathers had died with the secret ancient chant upon her lips yes she sang as skarphedinn the hero sang while the flame ate out his life  the song swelled on and the great waters boomed an accompaniment then came a sound of crashing walls and for a moment it ceased only to rise again still clearer and more triumphant again a crasha seething hissand the instrument was silent for its twin was shattered shattered also was the fair shape that held the spirit of stella    again and again morris spoke eagerly entreatingly but the aerophone was dumb so he ceased at length and even then well nigh laughed when he thought that in this useless piece of mechanism he saw a symbol of his own soul which also had lost its mate and could hold true converse with no other  then he started up and just as he was ran out into the raving night  three hours later when the sun rose upon christmas day if any had been there to note him they might have seen a dishevelled man standing alone upon the lonely shore there he stood the backwash of the mighty combers hissing about his knees as he looked seaward beneath the hollow of his hand at a spot some two hundred yards away where one by one their long lines were broken into a churning yeast of foam  morris knew well what broke themthe fallen ruins of the church that was now stellas sepulchre and oh in that dark hour he would have been glad to seek her where she lay    chapter xvii  the return of mary  curiously enough indirectly but in fact it was the circumstance of stellas sudden and mysterious death that made morris a rich and famous man and caused his invention of the aerophone to come into common use very early on the following morning but not before she was missed from the rectory and sought far and wide one of the first places visited by those who searched was the abbey whither they met morris returning through the gale wildeyed flyinghaired and altogether strange to see they asked him if he knew what had become of miss fregelius  yes he replied she has been crushed or drowned in the ruins of the dead church which was swept away by the gale last night  then they stared and asked how he knew this he answered that being unable to sleep that night on account of the storm he had gone into his workshop when his attention was suddenly attracted by the bell of the aerophone by means of which he learned that miss fregelius had been cut off from the shore in the church he added that he ran as hard as he could to the spot only to find at dawn that the building had entirely vanished in the gale and that the sea had encroached upon the land by at least two hundred paces  of course these statements concerning the aerophone and its capabilities were reported all over the world and much criticisedvery roughly in some quarters thereupon morris offered to demonstrate the truth of what he had said the controversy proved sharp but of this he was glad it was a solace to him perhaps even it prevented him from plunging headlong into madness at first he was stunned he did not feel very much then the first effects of the blow passed a sense of the swiftness and inevitableness of this awful consummation seemed to sink down into his heart and crush him the completeness of the tragedy its greekplay qualities were overwhelming question and answer seed and fruitthere was no space for thought or growth between them the curtain was down upon the temporal and lo almost before its folds had shaken to their place it had risen upon the eternal his nature reeled beneath this knowledge and his loss had it not been for those suspicions and attacks it might have fallen  the details of the struggle need not be entered into as they have little to do with the lifestory of morris monk it is enough to say that in the end he more than carried out his promises under the severest conditions and in the presence of various scientific bodies and other experts  afterwards came the natural results the great aerophone company was floated in which morris as vendor received half the shareshe would take no cashwhich shares by the way soon stood at five and a quarter also he found himself a noted man was asked to deliver an address before the british association was nominated on the council of a leading scientific society and in due course after a year or two received one of the greatest compliments that can be paid to an englishman that of being elected to its fellowship as a distinguished person by the committee of a famous club thus did morris prosper greatlyvery greatly and in many different ways but with all this part of his life we are scarcely concerned  on the day of his daughters death morris visited mr fregelius for whom he had a message he found the old man utterly crushed and broken  the last of the blood mr monk he moaned when morris hoarsevoiced and slowworded had convinced him of the details of the dreadful fact the last of the blood and i left childless at least you will feel for me and with me you will understand  it will be seen that although outside of some loose talk in the village which indirectly had produced results so terrible no one had ever suggested such a thing curiously enough by some intuitive process mr fregelius who to a certain extent at any rate guessed his daughters mind took it for granted that she had been in love with morris he seemed to know also by the same deductive process that he was attached to her  i do indeed said morris with a sad smile thinking that if only the clergyman could look into his heart he would perhaps be somewhat astonished at the depth of that understanding sympathy  i told you went on mr fregelius and you laughed at me that it was most unlucky her having sung that hateful norse song the greeting to death when you found her upon the steamer trondhjem  everything has been unlucky mr fregeliusor lucky he added beneath his breath but you will like to know that she died singing it the aerophone told me that  mr monk the old man said catching his arm my daughter was a strange woman a very strange woman and since i heard this dreadful news i have been afraid that perhaps she wasunhappy she was leaving her home on your accountyes on your account its no use pretending otherwise although no one ever told me soandthat she knew the church was going to be washed away  she thought you might think so answered morris and he gave him stellas last message moreover he told him more of the real circumstances than he revealed to anybody else he told him what nobody else ever knew for on that lonely coast none had seen him enter or leave the place how he had met her in the churchabout the removal of the instruments as he left it to be inferredand at her wish had come home alone because of the gossip which had arisen he explained also that according to her own story from some unexplained cause she had fallen asleep in the church after his departure and awakened to find herself surrounded by the waters with all hope gone  and now she is dead now she is dead groaned mr fregelius and i am alone in the world  i am sorry for you said morris simply but there it is it is no use looking backward we must look forward  yes look forward both of us since she is hidden from both you see almost from the first i knew you were fond of her added the clergyman simply  yes he answered i am fond of her though of that the less said the better and because our case is the same i hope that we shall always be friends  you are very kind i shall need a friend now i am alone now quite alone and my heart is broken  here it may be added that morris was even better than his word out of the wealth that came to him in such plenty for instance he was careful to augment the old mans resources without offending his feelings by adding permanently and largely to the endowment of the living also he attended to his wants in many other ways which need not be enumerated and not least by constantly visiting him many were the odd hours and the evenings that shall be told of later which they spent together smoking their pipes in the rectory study and talking of her who had gone and whose lost life was the strongest link between them otherwise and elsewhere except upon a few extraordinary occasions her name rarely passed the lips of morris  yet within himself he mourned and mourned although even in the first bitterness not as one without hope he knew that she had spoken truth that she was not dead but only for a while out of his sight and hearing    ten days had passed and for morris ten weary almost sleepless nights the tragedy of the destruction of the new rectors daughter in the ruins of the dead church no longer occupied the tongues of men and paragraphs in papers one day the sea gave up the hood of her brown ulster the same that morris had been seen arranging by stephen and eliza layard it was found upon the beach after this even the local police admitted that the conjectures as to her end must be true and since for the lack of anything to hold it on there could be no inquest the excitement dwindled and died nor indeed as her father announced that he was quite satisfied as to the circumstances of his daughters death was any formal inquiry held concerning them a few people however still believed that she was not really drowned but had gone away secretly for unknown private reasons the world remembers few people even if they be distinguished for ten whole days it has not time for such longcontinued recollection of the dead this world of the living who hurry on to join them  if this is the case with the illustrious the wealthy and the powerful how much more must it be so in the instance of an almost unknown girl a stranger in the land morris and her father remembered her for she was part of their lives and lived on with their lives stephen layard mourned for the woman whom he had wished to marryfiercely at first with the sharp pain of disappointed passion then intermittently and at last after he was comfortably wedded to somebody else with a mild and sentimental regret three or four times a year eliza too when once convinced that she was really dead was much shocked and talked vaguely of the judgments and dispensations of providence as though this victim were preeminently deserving of its most stern decrees it was rumoured however among the observant that her christian sorrow was perhaps tempered by a secret relief at the absence of a rival who as she now admitted sang extremely well and had beautiful eyes  the colonel also thought of the guest whom the sea had given and taken away and with a real regret for this girls force talents and loveliness had touched and impressed him who had sufficient intellect and experience to know that she was a person cast in a rare and noble mould but to morris he never mentioned her name no further confidence had passed between them on the matter yet he knew that to his son this name was holy therefore being in some ways a wise man he thought it well to keep his lips shut and to let the dead bury their dead  by all the rest stella fregelius was soon as much forgotten as though she had never walked the world or breathed its air that gale had done much damage and taken away many livesall down the coast was heard the voice of mourning hers chanced to be one of them and there was nothing to be said    on the morning of the eleventh day came a telegram from mary addressed to morris and dated from london it was brief and to the point come to dinner with me at seaview and bring your fathermary  when morris drove to seaview that evening he was as a man is in a dream sorrow had done its work on him agonising his nerves till at length they seemed to be blunted as with a very excess of pain much as the nerves of the victims of the inquisition were sometimes blunted till at length they could scarcely feel the pincers bite or the irons burn always abstemious also for this last twelve days he had scarcely swallowed enough food to support him with the result that his body weakened and suffered with his mind  then there was a third trouble to contend withthe dull and gnawing sense of shame which seemed to eat into his heart in actual fact he had been faithful enough to mary but in mind he was most unfaithful how could he come to her the woman who was to be his wife the woman who had dealt so well by him with the memory of that spiritual marriage at the altar of the dead church still burning in his brainthat marriage which now was consecrated and immortalised by death what had he to give her that was worth her taking he who if the truth were known shrank from all idea of union with any earthly woman who longed only to be allowed to live out his time in a solitude as complete as he could find or fashion it was monstrous it was shameful and then and there he determined that before ever he stood in monksland church by the side of mary porson at least he would tell her the truth and give her leave to choose to his other sins against her deceit should not be added  might i suggest morris said the colonel who as they drove had been watching his sons face furtively by the light of the brougham lampmight i suggest that under all the circumstances mary would perhaps appreciate an air a little less reminiscent of funerals you may recollect that several months have passed since you parted  yes said morris and a great deal has happened in that time  of course her father is dead the colonel alluded to no other death poor porson how painfully that beastly window in the diningroom will remind me of him come here we are pull yourself together old fellow  morris obeyed as best he could and presently found himself following the colonel into the drawingroom for once in his life as he reflected heartily glad to have the advantage of his parents society he could scarcely be expected to be very demonstrative and loverlike under the fire of that observant eyeglass  as they entered the drawingroom by one door mary looking very handsome and imposing in a low black dress which became her fair beauty admirably appeared at the other catching sight of morris she ran or rather glided forward with the graceful gait that was one of her distinctions and caught him by both hands bending her face towards him in open and unmistakable invitation  in a moment it was over somehow and she was saying  morris how thin you look and there are great black lines under your eyes uncle what have you been doing to him  when i have had the pleasure of saying howdoyoudo to you my dear he replied in a somewhat offended voicefor the colonel was not fond of being overlooked even in favour of an interesting soni shall be happy to do my best to answer your question  oh i am so sorry she said advancing her forehead to be kissed but we saw each other the other day didnt we and one cant embrace two people at once and of course one must begin somewhere but why have you made him so thin  the colonel surveyed morris critically with his eyeglass  really my dear mary he replied i am not responsible for the variations in my sons habit of body then as morris turned away irritably he added in a stage whisper hes been a bit upset poor fellow he felt your fathers death dreadfully  mary winced a little then recovering her vivacity said  well at any rate uncle i am glad to see that nothing of the sort has affected your health i never saw you looking better  ah my dear as we grow older we learn resignation  and how to look after ourselves thought mary  at that moment dinner was announced and she went in on morriss arm the colonel gallantly insisting that it should be so after this things progressed a good deal better the first plunge was over and the cool refreshing waters of marys conversation seemed to give back to morriss system some of the tone that it had lost also when he thought fit to use it he had a strong will and he thought fit this night lastly like many a man in a quandary before him he discovered the strange advantages of a scientific but liberal absorption of champagne mary noticed this as she noticed everything and said presently with her eyes wide open  might i ask my dear if you areill you are eating next to nothing and thats your fourth large glass of champagneyou who never drank more than two dont you remember how it used to vex my poor dad because he said that it always meant half a bottle wasted and a temptation to the cook  morris laughedhe was able to laugh by nowand replied as it happened with perfect truth that he had an awful toothache  then everything is explained said mary did you ever see me with a toothache well i should advise you not for it would be our last interview i will paint it for you after dinner with pure carbolic acid its splendid that is if you dont drop any on the patients tongue  morris answered that he would stick to champagne then mary began to narrate her experiences in the convent in a fashion so funny that the colonel could scarcely control his laughter and even morris toothache heartache and all was genuinely amused  imagine my dear morris she said you know the time i get down to breakfast or perhaps you dont its one of those things which i have been careful to conceal from you but you will one day and i believe that over it our matrimonial happiness may be wrecked well at what hour do you think i found myself expected to be up in that convent  seven suggested morris  at seven at a quarter to five if you please at a quarter to five every morning did some wretched person come and ring a dinnerbell outside my door and it was no use going to sleep again not the least for at halfpast five two hideous old laysisters arrived with buckets of waterthey have a perfect passion for cleanlinessand began to scrub out the cell whether you were in bed or whether you werent  then she rattled on to other experiences trivial enough in themselves but so entertaining when touched and lightened with her native humour that very soon the evening had worn itself pleasantly away without a single sad or untoward word  good night dear said mary to morris who this time managed to embrace her with becoming warmth you will come and see me tomorrow wont youno not in the morning remember i have been getting up at a quarter to five for a month and i am trying to equalise matters but after luncheon then we will sit before a good fire and have a talk for the weather is so delightfully bad that i am sure i shant be forced to take exercise  very well at three oclock said morris when the colonel who had been reflecting to himself broke in  look here my dear you must be down to lunch or if you are not you ought to be so as i want to have a chat with you about some of your poor fathers affairs and am engaged for the rest of the day i will come over then if you will allow me  certainly uncle if you like but wouldnt morris do insteadas representing me i mean  yes he answered when you are married he will do perfectly well but until that happy event i am afraid that i must take your personal opinion  oh very well said mary with a sigh i will expect you at a quarter past one    chapter xviii  two explanations  accordingly at a quarter past one on the following day the colonel arrived at seaview went in to lunch with mary and made himself very amusing and agreeable about the domestic complications of his old friend lady rawlins and her objectionable husband and other kindred topics then adroitly enough he changed the conversation to the subject of the great gale and when he talked of it awhile said suddenly  i suppose that you have heard of the dreadful thing that happened here  what dreadful thing asked mary i have heard nothing you must remember that i have been in a convent where one does not see the english papers  the death of stella fregelius said the colonel sadly  what the daughter of the new rectorthe young lady whom morris took off the wreck and whom i have been longing to ask him about only i forgot last night do you mean to say that she is dead  dead as the sea can make her she was in the old church yonder when it was swept away and now lies beneath its ruins in four fathoms of water  how awful said mary tell me about it how did it happen  well through morris poor fellow so far as i can make out and that is why he is so dreadfully cut up you see she helped him to carry on his experiments with that machine she sitting in the church and he at home in the abbey with a couple of miles of coast and water between them well you are a woman of the world my dear and you must know that all this sort of thing means a great deal more intimacy than is desirable how far that intimacy went i do not know and i do not care to inquire though for my part i believe that it was a very little way indeed still eliza layard got hold of some cock and bull tale and you can guess the rest  perfectly said mary in a quiet voice if eliza was concerned in it but please go on with the story  well the gossip came to my ears  through eliza queried mary  through elizawho said and he told her about the incident of the ulster and the dogcart adding that he believed it to be entirely untrue  as mary made no comment he went on i forgot to say that miss fregelius seems to have refused to marry stephen layard who fell violently in love with her which to my mind accounts for some of this gossip still i thought it my duty and the best thing i could do to give a friendly hint to the old clergyman stellas father a funny witheredup old boy by the way he seems to have spoken to his daughter rather indiscreetly whereon she waylaid me as i was walking on the sands and informed me that she had made up her mind to leave this place for london where she intended to earn her own living by singing and playing on the violin i must tell you that she played splendidly and in my opinion had one of the most glorious contralto voices that i ever heard  she seems to have been a very attractive young woman said mary in the same quiet contemplative voice  i think went on the colonel take her all in all she was about the most attractive young woman that ever i saw poor thing upon my word dear old as i am i fell half in love with her myself and so would you if you had seen those eyes of hers  i remember broke in mary that old mr tomley after he returned from inspecting the northumberland living spoke about miss fregeliuss wonderful eyesat the dinnerparty you know on the night when morris proposed to me and she shivered a little as though she had turned suddenly cold  well let me go on with my story after she had told me this and i had promised to help her with introductionsexactly why or how i forgetbut i asked her flat out if she was in love with morris thereoni assure you my dear mary it was the most painful scene in all my long experiencethe poor thing turned white as a sheet and would have fallen if i had not caught hold of her when she came to herself a little she admitted frankly that this was her case but addedof which of course one may believe as much as one likes that she had never known it until i asked the question  i think that quite possible said mary and really uncle to me your crossexamination seems to have been slightly indiscreet  possibly my dear very possibly even solomon might be excused for occasionally making a mistake where the mysterious articles which young ladies call their hearts are concerned i tell what happened that is all shall i go on  if you please  well after this she announced that she meant to see morris once to say goodbye to him before she went to london and left me practically the next thing i heard about her was that she was dead  did she commit suicide asked mary  it is said not it is suggested that after morriss interview with her in the dead churchfor i gather there was an interview though nobody knows about it and thats where they metshe fell asleep which sounds an odd thing to do in the midst of such a gale as was raging on christmas eve and so was overwhelmed but who can say impressionable and unhappy women have done such deeds before now especially if they imagine themselves to have become the object of gossip of course also the mere possibility of such a thing having happened on his account would be and indeed has been enough to drive a man like morris crazy with grief and remorse  what had he to be remorseful for asked mary if a young woman chanced to fall in love with him why should he be blamed or blame himself for that after all peoples affections are in their own keeping  i imaginevery little if anything at least i know this that when i spoke to him about the matter after my talk with her i gathered from what he said that there was absolutely nothing between them to be quite frank however as i have tried to be with you my dear throughout this conversation i also gathered that this young lady had produced a certain effect upon his mind or at least that the knowledge that she had avowed herself to be attached to himwhich i am afraid i let out for i was in a great rageproduced some such effect well afterwards i believe although i have asked no questions and am not sure of it he went and said goodbye to her in this church at her request then this dreadful tragedy happened and there is an end of her and her story  have you any object in telling it to me uncle  yes my dear i have i wished you to know the real facts before they reached you in whatever distorted version morriss fancy or imagination or exaggerated candour may induce him to present them to you also my dear even if you find or think you find that you have cause of complaint against him i hope that you will see your way to being lenient and shutting your eyes a little  severity was never my strong point interrupted mary  for this reason went on the colonel the young woman concerned was a very remarkable person if you could have heard her sing for instance you would have said so yourself it is a humiliating confession but i doubt whether one young man out of a hundred single engaged or married could have resisted being attracted by her to just such an extent as she pleased especially if he were flattered by the knowledge that she was genuinely attracted by himself  mary made no answer  didnt you say you had some documents you wanted me to sign she asked presently  oh yes here is the thing and he pulled a paper out of his pocket the lawyers write that it need not be witnessed  mary glanced at it couldnt morris have brought thishe is your coexecutor isnt heand saved you the trouble  undoubtedly he could but  but what  well if you want to know my dear said the colonel with a grave countenance just now morris is in a state in which i do not care to leave more of this important business in his hands than is necessary  what am i to understand by that uncle she said looking at him shrewdly do you mean that he isnot quite well  yes mary i mean thathe is not quite well that is if my observation goes for anything i mean he went on with quiet vehemence i mean thatjust at present of course he has been so upset by this miserable affair that for my part i wouldnt put any confidence in what he says about it or about anything else the thing has got upon his nerves and rendered him temporarily unfit for the business of ordinary life you know that at the best of times he is a very peculiar man and not quite like other people  well have you signed that thank you my dear by jove i must be off i shall be late as it is i may rely upon your discretion as to what we have been talking about may i not but i thought it as well to let you know how the land lay  yes uncle and thank you for taking so much trouble  when the door had closed behind him mary reflected awhile then she said to herself  he thinks morris is a little off his head and has come here to warn me i should not be surprised and i daresay that he is right any way a new trouble has risen up between us the shadow of another woman poor thing well shadows melt and the dead do not come back she seems to have been very charming and clever and i daresay that she fascinated him for a while but with kindness and patience it will all come right only i do hope that he will not insist upon making me too many confidences  so thought mary who by nature was forgiving gentle and an optimist not guessing how sorely her patience as an affianced wife and her charity as a woman of the world would be tried within the hour  from all of which it will be seen that for once the diplomacy of the colonel had prospered somewhat beyond its deserts the departed cannot explain or defend themselves and morriss possible indiscretions already stood discounted in the only quarter where they might do harm  half an hour later mary sitting beside the fire with her toes upon the grate and her face to the window perceived morris on the gravel drive wearing a preoccupied and rather wretched air she noted moreover that before he rang the bell he paused for a moment as though to shake himself together  here you are at last she said cheerfully as he bent down to kiss her seven whole minutes before your time which is very nice of you now sit down there and get warm and we will have a good long talk  morris obeyed my father has been lunching with you has he not he said somewhat nervously  yes dear and telling me all the news and a sad budget it seems to be about the dreadful disasters of the great gale and the death of that poor girl who was staying with you miss fregelius  at the mention of this name morriss face contorted itself as the face of a man might do who was seized with a sudden pang of sharp and unexpected agony  mary he said in a hoarse and broken voice i have a confession to make to you and i must make itabout this dead woman i mean i will not sail under false colours you must know all the truth and then judge  dear me she answered this sounds dreadfully tragic but i may as well tell you at once that i have already heard some gossip  i daresay but you cannot have heard all the truth for it was known only to me and her  now do what she would to prevent it her alarm showed itself in marys eyes  what am i to understand she said in a low voiceand she looked a question  oh no he answered with a faint smile nothing at all  not that you have been embracing her for instance that i understand is eliza layards story  no no i never did such a thing in my life  a little sigh of relief broke from marys lips at the worst this was but an affair of sentiment  i think dear she said in her ordinary slow voice that you had better set out the trouble in your own words with as few details as possible or none at all such things are painful are they notespecially where the dead are concerned  morris bowed his head and began you know i found her on the ship singing as she only could sing and she was a very strange and beautiful womanperhaps beautiful is not the word  it will do interrupted mary at any rate you thought her beautiful  then afterwards we grew intimate very intimate without knowing it almostindeed i am not sure that we should ever have known it had it not been for the mischiefmaking of eliza layard  may she be rewarded ejaculated mary  well and after shethat is eliza layardhad spoken to my father he attacked mr fregelius his daughter and myself and it seems that she confessed to my father that she waswas  in love with younot altogether unnatural perhaps from my point of view though of course she oughtnt to have been so  yes and said that she was going away andon christmas eve we met there in the dead church then somehowfor i had no intention of such a thingall the truth came out and i found that i was no longer master of myself andgod forgive me and you mary forgive me toothat i loved her also  and afterwards said mary moving her skirts a little  and afterwardsoh it will sound strange to youwe made some kind of compact for the next world a sort of spiritual marriage i can call it nothing else then i shook hands with her and went away and in a few hours she was deaddead but the compact stands mary yes that compact stands for ever  a compact of a spiritual marriage in a place where there is no marriage do you mean morris that you wish this strange proceeding to destroy your physical and earthly engagement to myself  no no nor did she wish it she said so but you must judge i feel that i have done you a dreadful wrong and i was determined that you should know the worst  that was very good of you mary said reflectively for really there is no reason why you should have told me this peculiar story morris you have been working pretty hard lately have you not  yes he replied absently i suppose i have  was this young lady what is called a mystic  perhaps danish people often are at any rate she saw things more clearly than most i mean that the future was nearer to her mind and in a sense the past also  indeed you must have found her a congenial companion i suppose that you talked a good deal of these things  sometimes we did  and discovered that your views were curiously alike for when one mystic meets another mystic and the other mystic has beautiful eyes and sings divinely the spiritual marriage will follow almost as a matter of course what else is to be expected but i am glad that you were faithful to your principles both of you and clung fast to the ethereal side of things  morris writhed beneath this satire but finding no convenient answer to it made none  do you remember my dear went on mary the conversation we had one day in your workshop before we were engagedthats years ago isnt itabout stargazing considered as a fine art  i remember something he said  that i told you for instance that it might be better if you paid a little more attention to matters physical lest otherwise you should go on praying for vision till you could see and for power until you could create  morris nodded  well and i think i saiddidnt i that if you insisted upon following these spiritual exercises the result might be that they would return upon you in some concrete shape and take possession of you and lead you into company and surroundings which most of us think it wholesome to avoid  yes you said something like that  it wasnt a bad bit of prophecy was it went on mary rubbing her chin reflectively and you see his satanic majesty knew very well how to bring about its fulfilment mystical lovely and a wonderful mistress of music which you adore really one would think that the bait must have been specially selected  crushed though he was morriss temper began to rise beneath the lash of marys sarcasm he knew however that it was her method of showing jealousy and displeasure both of them perfectly natural and did his best to restrain himself  i do not quite understand you he said also you are unjust to her  not at all i daresay that in herself she was what you think her a perfect angel indeed the descriptions that i have heard from your father and yourself leave no doubt of it in my mind but even angels have been put to bad purposes perhaps their innocence makes it possible to take advantage of them  he opened his lips to speak but she held up her hand and went on  you mustnt think me unsympathetic because i put things as they appear to my very mundane mind look here morris it just comes to this if this exceedingly attractive young lady had made love to you or had induced you to make love to her so that you ran away with her or anything else of course you would have behaved badly and cruelly to me but at least your conduct would be natural and to be explained we all know that men do this kind of thing and women too for the matter of that under the influence of passionand are often very sorry for it afterwards but she didnt do this she took you on your weak side which she understood thoroughlyprobably because it was her own weak sideand outheroded herod or rather outmysticised the mystic finishing up with some spiritual marriage which if it is anything at all is impious what right have we to make bargains for the beyond about which we know nothing  she did know something said morris with a sullen conviction  you think she did because you were reduced to a state of mind in which if she had told you that the sun goes round the earth you would quite readily have believed her my dearest morris that way madness lies perhaps you understand now what i have been driving at and the best proof of the absurdity of the whole thing is that i stupid as i am from my intimate knowledge of your character since childhood was able to predict that something of this sort would certainly happen to you you will admit that is a little odd wont you  yes its odd or perhaps it shows that you have more of the inner sight than you know but there were circumstances about the story which you would find difficult to explain  not in the least in your own answer lies the explanationyour tendency to twist things i prophesy certain developments from my knowledge of your character whereupon you at once credit me with second sight which is absurd  i dont see the analogy said morris  dont you i do all this soul business is just a love affair gone wrong if circumstances had been a little differentif for instance there had been no mary porsoni doubt whether anybody would have heard much about spiritual marriages somehow i think that things would have settled down into a more usual groove  morris did not attempt to answer he felt that mary held all the cards and not unnaturally was in a mood to play them moreover it was desecration to him to discuss stellas most secret beliefs with any other woman and especially with mary their points of view were absolutely and radically different the conflict was a conflict between the natural and the spiritual law or in other words between hard brutal facts and theories as impalpable as the perfume of a flower or the sound waves that stirred his aerophone moreover he could see clearly that marys interpretation of this story was simple namely that he had fallen into temptation and that the shock of his parting from the lady concerned followed by her sudden and violent death had bred illusions in his mind in short that he was slightly crazy therefore to be well scolded pitied and looked after rather than sincerely blamed the position was scarcely heroic or one that any man would choose to fill still he felt that it had its conveniences that at any rate it must be accepted  all these questions are very much a matter of opinion he said then added unconsciously reflecting one of stellas sayings and i daresay that the truth is for each of us exactly what each of us imagines it to be  i was always taught that the truth is the truth quite irrespective of our vague and often silly imaginings the difficulty being to find out exactly what it is  perhaps answered morris declining argument which is always useless between people are are determined not to sympathise with each others views i knew that you would think my story foolish i should never have troubled you with it had i not felt it to be my duty for naturally the telling of such a tale puts a man in a ridiculous light  i dont think you ridiculous morris i think that you are suffering slightly from shock that is all what i say is that i detest all this spiritual hocuspocus to which you have always had a leaning i fear and hate it instinctively as some people hate cats because i know that it breeds mischief and that as i said before people who go on trying to see do see or fancy that they do while we are in the world let the world and its limitations be enough for us when we go out of the world then the supernatural may become the natural and cease to be hurtful and alarming  yes said morris those are very good rules well mary i have told you the history of this sad adventure of which the book is now closed by death and i can only say that i am humiliated if anybody had said to me six months ago that i should have to come to you with such a confession i should have answered that he was a liar but now you see  yes repeated mary i see  then will you give me your answer for you must judge i have told you that you must judge  judge not that ye be not judged answered mary who am i that i should pass sentence on your failings goodness knows that i have plenty of my own if you dont believe me go and ask the nuns at that convent whatever were the rights and wrongs of it the thing is finished and done with and nobody can be more sorry for that unfortunate girl than i am also i think that you have behaved very well in coming to tell me about your trouble but then that is like you morris for you couldnt be deceitful however hard you might try  so dear with your leave we will say no more about stella fregelius and her spiritual views when i engaged myself to you as i told you at the time i did so with my eyes open for better or for worse and unless you tell me right out that you dont want me i have no intention of changing my mind especially as you need looking after and are not likely to come across another stella  there i havent talked so much for months i am quite tired and wish to forget about all these disagreeables i am afraid i have spoken sharply but if so you must make allowances for such stories are apt to sour the sweetesttempered womenfor half an hour if i have seemed bitter and cross dear it is because i love you better than any creature in the world and cant bear to thinkso you must forgive me do you morris  forgive i forgive he stammered overwhelmed  there she said again very softly stretching out her arms come and give me a kiss and let us change the subject once and for ever i want to tell you about my poor father he left some messages for you morris    chapter xix  morris the married man  more than three years had gone by within twelve weeks of the date of the conversation recorded in the last chapter morris and mary were married in monksland church although the wedding was what is called quiet on account of the recent death of the brides father the colonel who gave her away was careful that it should be distinguished by a certain stamp of modest dignity which he considered to be fitting to the station and fortune of the parties to him indeed this union was the cause of heartfelt and earnest rejoicings which is not strange seeing that it meant nothing less than a new lease of life to an ancient family that was on the verge of disappearance had morris not married the race would have become extinct at any rate in the direct line and had he married where there was no money it might as his father thought become bankrupt which in his view was almost worse  the one terror which had haunted the colonel for years like a persistent nightmare was that a day seemed to be at hand when the monks would be driven from monksland where from sire to son they had sat for so many generations that day had nearly come when he was a young man indeed it was only averted by his marriage with the somewhat humbly born miss porson who brought with her sufficient dowry to enable him to pay off the major portion of the mortgages which then crippled the estate but at that time agriculture flourished and the rents from the property were considerable moreover the colonel was never of a frugal turn of mind so it came about that every farthing was spent  afterwards followed a period of falling revenues and unlet farms but still the expenses went on with the result as the reader knows that at the opening of this history things were worse than they had ever been and indeed without the help received from mr porson must ere that have reached their natural end now the marriage of his son with a wealthy heiress set a period to all such anxiety and unless the couple should be disappointed of issue made it as certain as anything can be in this mutable world that for some generations to come at any rate the name of monk of monksland would still appear in the handbooks of county families  in the event these fears proved to be groundless since by an unexpected turn of the wheel of chance morris became a rich man in reward of his own exertions and was thus made quite independent of his wifes large fortune this however was a circumstance which the colonel could not be expected to foresee for how could he believe that an electrical invention which he looked upon as a mere scientific toy would ultimately bring its author not only fame but an income of many thousands per annum yet this happened  other things happened also which under the circumstances were quite as satisfactory seeing that within two years of his marriage morris was the father of a son and daughter so that the old abbey where by the especial request of the colonel they had established themselves once more echoed to the voices of little children    in those days if anyone among his acquaintances had been asked to point out an individual as prosperous and happy as under the most favoured circumstances it is given to a mortal to be he would unhesitatingly have named morris monk  what was there lacking to this man he had lineage that in his own neighbourhood gave him standing better than that of many an upstart baronet or knight and with it health and wealth he had a wife who was acknowledged universally to be one of the most beautiful charming and witty women in the county whose devotion to himself was so marked and open that it became a public jest who had moreover presented him with healthy and promising offspring in addition to all these good things he had suddenly become in his own line one of the most famous persons in the world so that wherever civilized man was to be found there his name was known as monk who invented that marvellous machine the aerophone lastly there was no more need for him as for most of us to stagger down his road beneath a never lessening burden of daily labour his work was done a great conception completed after half a score of years of toil and experiment had crowned it with unquestionable success now he could sit at ease and watch the struggles of others less fortunate  there are however few men on the right side of sixty whose souls grow healthier in idleness although nature often recoils from it man was made to work and he who will not work calls down upon himself some curse visible or invisible as he who works although the toil seem wasted wakes up one day to find the arid wilderness where he wanders strown with a manna of blessing this should be the prayer of all of understanding that whatever else it may please heaven to take away there may be left to them the power and the will to work through disappointment through rebuffs through utter failure even still to work many things for which they are or are not wholly responsible are counted to men as sins surely however few will press more heavily upon the beam of the balance when at length we are commanded to unfold the talents which we have been given and earned than those fateful words lord mine lies buried in its napkin or worse still lord i have spent mine on the idle pleasures which my body loved  therefore it was not to the true welfare of morris when through lack of further ambition or rather of the sting of that spur of necessity which drives most men on he rested upon his oars and in practice abandoned his labours drifting down the tide no man of high intelligence and acquisitive brain can toil arduously for a period of years and suddenly cease from troubling to find himself as he expects at rest for then into the swept and garnished chambers of that empty mind enter seven or more blue devils depression marks him for its own melancholy forebodings haunt him remorse for past misdeeds long repented of is his daily companion with these erinnyes more felt perhaps than any of them comes the devastating sense that he is thwarting the best instinct of his own nature and the divine command to labour while there is still light because the night draws on apace in which no man can labour  mary was fond of society in which she liked to be accompanied by her husband so morris whose one great anxiety was to please his wife and fall in with her every wish went to a great many parties which he hated mary liked change also so it came about that three months in the season were spent in london where they had purchased a house in green street that was much frequented by the colonel and another two or sometimes three months at the villa on the riviera which mary was very fond of on account of its associations with her parents  also in the summer and shooting seasons when they were at home the old abbey was kept full of guests for we may be sure that people so rich and distinguished did not lack for friends and mary made the very best of hostesses  thus it happened that except at the seasons when his wife retired under the pressure of domestic occurrences morris found that he had but little time left in which to be quiet that his life in short was no longer the life of a worker but that of a commonplace country gentleman of wealth and fashion  now it was mary who had brought these things about and by design for she was not a woman to act without reasons and an object it is true that she liked a gay and pleasant life for gaiety and pleasure were agreeable to her easy and somewhat indolent mind also they gave her opportunities of exercising her faculties of observation which were considerable  but mary was far fonder of her husband than of those and other vanities indeed her affection for him shone the guiding star of her existence from her childhood she had been devoted to this cousin who since her earliest days had been her playmate and at heart had wished to marry him and no one else then he began his experiments and drifted quite away from her afterwards things changed and they became engaged again the experiments were carried on with the aid of another woman and again he drifted away from her also the drifting in this instance was attended by serious and painful complications  now the complications had ceased to exist they threatened her happiness no more indeed had they been much worse than they were she would have overlooked them being altogether convinced of the truth of the old adage which points out the folly of cutting off ones nose to spite ones face whatever his failings or shortcomings morris was her joy the human being in whose company she delighted without whom indeed her life would be flat stale and unprofitable the stronger then was her determination that he should not slip back into his former courses those courses which in the end had always brought about estrangement from herself  inventions the details of which she could not understand meant as she knew well long days and weeks of solitary brooding therefore inventions and indeed all unnecessary work were in his case to be discouraged such solitary brooding also drew from the mind of morris a vague mist of thought about matters esoteric which to marys belief had the properties of a miasma that crept like poison through his being she wished for no more stargazing no more mysticism and above all no more memories of the interloping woman who in his company had studied its doubtful and dangerous delights  although since the day of morriss confession mary had never even mentioned the name of stella to him she by no means forgot that such a person once existed indeed carelessly and without seeming to be anxious on the subject she informed herself about her down to the last possible detail so that within a few months of the death of miss fregelius she knew as she thought everything that could be known of her life at monksland moreover she saw three different pictures of her one a somewhat prim photograph which mr fregelius her father possessed taken when she was about twenty another a coloured drawing made by morriswho was rather clever at catching likenessesof her as she appeared singing in the chapel on the night when she had drawn the pageboy thomas from his slumbers and the third also a photograph taken by some local amateur of her and morris standing together on the beach and engaged evidently in eager discussion  from these three pictures and especially from morriss sketch which showed the spiritual light shining in her eyes and her face rapt as it were in a very ecstasy of music mary was able to fashion with some certainty the likeness of the living woman the more she studied this the more she found it formidable and the more she understood how it came about that her husband had fallen into folly also she learned to understand that there might be greater weight and meaning in his confession than she had been inclined to allow to it at the time that at any rate its extravagances ought not to be set down entirely as her fatherinlaw had suggested with such extreme cleverness to the vagaries of a mind suffering from sudden shock and alarm  all these conclusions made mary anxious by wrapping her husband round with common domestic cares and a web of daily social incident to bury the memory of this stella beneath everthickening strata of forgetfulness not that in themselves these reminiscences however hallowed could do her any further actual harm but because the train of thought evoked thereby was as she conceived morbid and dangerous to the balance of his mind  the plan seemed wise and good and in the case of most men probably would have succeeded yet in morriss instance from the commencement it was a failure she had begun by making his story and ideas absurd enough on the face of them an object of somewhat acute sarcasm if not of ridicule this was a mistake since thereby she caused him to suppress every outward evidence of them to lock them away in the most secret recesses of his heart if the lid of a caldron full of fluid is screwed down while a fire continues to burn beneath it the steam which otherwise would have passed away harmlessly gathers and struggles till the moment of inevitable catastrophe the fact that for a while the caldron remains inert and the steam invisible is no indication of safety to attain safety in such a case either the fire must be raked out or the fluid tapped mary had screwed down the lid of her domestic caldron but the flame still burned beneath and the water still boiled within  this was her first error and the second proved almost as mischievous she thought to divert morris from a central idea by a multitude of petty counterattractions she believed that by stopping him from the scientific labours and esoteric speculation connected with this idea that it would be deadened and in time obliterated  as a matter of fact by thus emptying his mind of its serious and accustomed occupations mary made room for the very development she dreaded to flourish like an upas tree for although he breathed no word of it although he showed no sign of it to morris the memory of the dead was a constant companion time heals all things that is the common saying but would it be possible to formulate any fallacy more complete there are many wounds that time does not heal and often enough against the dead it has no power at allfor how can time compete against the eternity of which they have become a part the love of them where they have been truly loved remains quite unaltered in some instances indeed it is emdued with a power of terrible and amazing growth  on earth very probably that deep affection would have become subject to the natural influences of weakening and decay and in the instance of a man and woman the soulpossessing passion might have passed to be replaced by a more moderate customworn affection but the dead are beyond the reach of those mouldering fingers there they stand perfect and unalterable with arms which never cease from beckoning with a smile that never grows less sweet come storm come shine nothing can tarnish the pure and gleaming robes in which our vision clothes them we know the worst of them their faults and failings cannot vex us afresh their errors are all forgiven it is their best part only that remains unrealised and unread their purest aspirations which we follow with leaden wings their deepest thoughts that we still strive to plumb with the short line of our imagination or experience and to weigh in our imperfect balances  yes there they stand and smile and beckon while ever more radiant grow their brows and more to be desired the knowledge of their perfect majesty there is no human passion like this passion for the dead none so awful none so holy none so changeless for they have become eternal and our desire for them is sealed with the stamp of their eternity and strengthens in the shadow of its wings till the shadows flee away and we pass to greet them in the dawn of the immortal morning  yes within the secret breast of morris the flame of memory still burned and still seethed those bitter waters of desire for the dead there was nothing carnal about this desire since the passions of the flesh perish with the flesh nor was there anything of what a man may feel when he sees the woman whom he loves and who loves him forced to another fate for to those he robs death has this advantage over the case of other successful rivals his embrace purifies and of it we are not jealous the longing was spiritual and for this reason it did not weaken but indeed became a part of him to grow with the spirit from which it took its birth still had it not been for a chance occurrence there in the spirit it might have remained buried in due course to pass away with it and seek its expression in unknown conditions and regions unexplored  in a certain fashion morris was happy enough he was very fond of his wife and he adored his little children as men of tender nature do adore those that are helpless and for whose existence they are responsible he appreciated his public reputation his wealth and the luxury that lapped him round and above all he was glad to have been the means of restoring and indeed of advancing the fortunes of his family  moreover as has been said above all things he desired to please mary the lovely amiable woman who had complimented him with her unvarying affection andwhen he went astraywho with scarcely a reproach had led him back into its gentle fold least of all therefore was it his will to flaunt before her eyes the spectre from a past which she wished to forget or even to let her guess that such a past still permeated his present therefore on this subject settled the silence of the dead till at length mary observant as she was became wellnigh convinced that stella fregelius was forgotten and that her fantastic promises were disproved yet no mistake could have been more profound  it was morriss habit whenever he could secure an evening to himself which was not very often to walk to the rectory and smoke his pipe in the company of mr fregelius had mary chanced to be invisibly present or to peruse a stenographic report of what passed at one of these evening callswhereof for reasons which she suppressed she did not entirely approveshe might have found sufficient cause to vary her opinion on these occasions ostensibly morris went to talk about parish affairs and indeed to a certain extent he did talk about them for instance stella who had been so fond of music once described to him the organ which she would like to have in the fine old parish church of monksland now that renovated instrument stood there and was the admiration of the countryside as it well might be in view of the fact that it had cost over four thousand pounds  again mr fregelius wished to erect a monument to his daughter which as her body never had been found could properly be placed in the chancel of the church morris entered heartily into the idea and undertook to spend the hundred pounds which the old gentleman had saved for this purpose on his account and to the best advantage in affect he did spend it to excellent advantage as mr fregelius admitted when the monument arrived  it was a lovely thing executed by one of the first sculptors of the day in white marble upon a black stone bed and represented the mortal shape of stella there she lay to the very life wrapped in a white robe portrayed as a sleeper awakening from the last sleep of death her eyes wide and wondering and on her face that rapt look which morris had caught in his sketch of her singing in the chapel at the edge of the base of this remarkable effigy set flush on the black marble in letters of plain copper was her namestella fregeliuswith the date of her death on one side appeared the text that she had quoted o death where is thy sting and on the other its continuation o grave where is thy victory and at the foot part of a verse from the fortysecond psalm deep calleth unto deep    all thy waves and storms have gone over me  like the organ this monument which stood in the chancel was much admired by everybody except mary who found it rather theatrical and indeed when nobody was looking surveyed it with a gloomy and a doubtful eye  that morris had something to do with the thing she was quite certain since she knew well that mr fregelius would never have invented any memorial so beautiful and full of symbolism also she doubted his ability to pay for a piece of statuary which must have cost many hundreds of pounds a third reason which seemed to her conclusive was that the face on the statue was the very face of morriss drawing although of course it was possible that mr fregelius might have borrowed the sketch for the use of the sculptor but of all this although it disturbed her occurring as it did just when she hoped that stella was beginning to be forgotten she spoke not a word to morris least said soonest mended is a good if a homely motto or so thought mary  the monument had been in place a year but whenever he was at home morriss visits to mr fregelius did not grow fewer indeed his wife noticed that if anything they increased in number which as the organ was now finished down to the last allegorical carvings of its case seemed remarkable and unnecessary of course the fact was that on these occasions the conversation invariably centred on one subject and that subject stella considered in certain aspects it must have been a piteous thing to see and hear these two men each of them bereaved of one who to them above all others had been the nearest and dearest trying to assuage their grief by mutual consolations morris had never told mr fregelius all the depth of his attachment to his daughter at least not in actual unmistakable words although as has been said from the first her father took it for granted and morris tacitly at any rate had accepted the conclusion indeed very soon he found that no other subject had such charms for his guest that of stella he might talk for ever without the least fear that morris would be weary  so the poor childless unfriended old man put aside the reserve and timidity which clothed him like a garment and talked on into those sympathetic ears knowing well howeverfor the freemasonry of their common love taught it to himthat in the presence of a third person her name no allusion to her even must pass his lips in short these conversations grew at length into a kind of seance or solemn rite a joint offering to the dead of the best that they had to give their tenderest thoughts and memories made in solemn secrecy and with uplifted hearts and minds  mr fregelius was an historian and possessed some interesting records upon which it was his habit to descant amongst other things he instructed morris in the annals of stellas ancestry upon both sides which as it happened could be traced back for many generations in these discourses it grew plain to his listener whence had sprung certain of her qualities such as her fearless attitude towards death and her tendency towards mysticism here in these musty chronicles far back in the times when those of whom they kept record were half if not wholly heathen these same qualities could be discovered among her forbears  indeed there was one woman of whom the saga told a certain ancestress named saevuna whereof it is written that she was of all women the very fairest and that she drew the hearts of men with her wonderful eyes as the moon draws mists from a marsh who in some ways might have been stella herself stella unchristianized and savage  this saevunas husband rebelled against the king of his country and being captured was doomed to a shameful death by hanging as a traitor thereon under pretence of bidding him farewell she administered poison to him partaking of the same herself and continues the saga they both of them until their pains overcame them died singing a certain ancient song which had descended in the family of one of them and is called the song of the overlord or the offering to death this song while strength and voice remained to them it is the duty of this family to say or sing or so they hold it in the hour of their death but if they sing it except by way of learning its words and music from their mothers and escape death it will not be for very long seeing that when once the offering is laid upon his altar the overlord considers it his own and after the fashion of gods and men takes it as soon as he can so sweet and strange was the singing of this saevuna until she choked that the king and his nobles came out to hear it and all men thought it a great marvel that a woman should sing thus in the very pains of death moreover they declared many of them that while the song went on they could think of nothing else and that strange and wonderful visions passed before their eyes but of this nobody can know the truth for certain as the woman and her husband died long ago  you see said mr fregelius when he had finished translating the passage aloud it is not wonderful that i thought it unlucky when i heard that you had found stella singing this same song upon the ship much as centuries ago her ancestress saevuna sang it while she and her husband died  at any rate the omen fulfilled itself answered morris with a sigh and she too died with the song upon her lips though i do not think that it had anything to do with these things which were fated to befall  well said the clergyman the fate is fulfilled now and the song will never be sung again she was the last of her race and it was a law among them that neither words nor music should ever be written down  when such old tales and legends were exhausted and outside the immediate object of their search some of them were of great interest to a man who like morris had knowledge of norse literature and was delighted to discover in mr fregelius a scholar acquainted with the original tongues in which they were written these companions fell back upon other matters but all of them had to do with stella one night the clergyman read some letters written by her as a child from denmark on another he produced certain dolls which she had dressed at the same period of her life in the costume of the peasants of that country on a third he repeated a piece of rather indifferent poetry composed by her when she was a girl of sixteen its strange title was the resurrection of dead roses it told how in its authors fancy the flowers which were cut and cast away on earth bloomed again in heaven never to wither more a pretty allegory but treated in a childish fashion  thus then from time to time as occasion offered did this strange pair celebrate the rites they thought so harmless and upon the altar of memory make offerings to their dead    chapter xx  stellas diary  it seems to be a law of life that nothing can stand completely still and changeless all must vary must progress or retrograde the very rocks in the bowels of the earth undergo organic alterations while the eternal hills that cover them increase or are worn away much more is this obvious in the case of ephemeral man of his thoughts his works and everything wherewith he has to do he who within the period of a few short years is doomed to appear wax wane and vanish  even the conversations of mr fregelius and morris were subject to the working of this universal rule and in obedience to it must travel towards a climax either of fruition however unexpected or their purpose served whatever it may have been to decay and death for lack of food upon which to live and flourish the tiniest groups of impulses or incidents have their goal as sure and as appointed as that of the cluster of vast globes which form a constellation between them the principal distinction seems to be one of size and at present we are not in a position to say which may be the most important the issue of the smallest of unrecorded causes or of the travelling of the great worlds the destiny of a single human soul shaped or directed by the one for aught we know may be of more weight and value than that of a multitude of hoary universes naked of life and spirit or perhaps to the eye that sees and judges the difference is nothing  thus even these semisecret interviews when two men met to talk over the details of a lost life with which however profoundly it may have influenced them in the past they appeared so far as this world is concerned to have nothing more to do were destined to affect the future of one of them in a fashion that could scarcely have been foreseen this became apparent or put itself in the way of becoming apparent when on a certain evening morris found mr fregelius seated in the rectory diningroom and by his side a little pile of manuscript volumes bound in shabby cloth  what are those asked morris her translation of the saga of the cave outlaws  no morris answered mr fregeliushe called him morris when they were aloneof course not dont you remember that they were bound in red he added reproachfully and that we did them up to send to the publisher last week  yes yes of course he wrote to me yesterday to say that he would be glad to bring out the bookmorris did not add at my riskbut what are they  they are replied mr fregelius her journals which she appears to have kept ever since she was fourteen years of age you remember she was going to london on the day that she was drownedthat christmas day well before she went out to the old church she packed her belongings into two boxes and there those boxes have lain for three years and more because i could never find the heart to meddle with them but a few nights ago i wasnt able to sleepi rest very badly nowso i went and undid them lifting out all the things which her hands had put there at the bottom of one of the boxes i found these volumes except the last of them in which she was writing till the day of her death that was at the top i was aware that she kept a diary for i have seen her making the entries but of its contents i knew nothing in fact until last night i had forgotten its existence  have you read it now asked morris  i have looked into it it seems to be a history of her thoughts and theories facts are very briefly noted it occurred to me that you might like to read it why not  yes yes very much answered morris eagerly that is if you think she will not mind you see it is private  mr fregelius took no notice of the tense of which morris made use for the reason that it seemed natural to him that he should employ it their strange habit was to talk of stella not as we speak of one dead but as a living individuality with whom they chanced for a while to be unable to communicate  i do not think that she will mind he answered slowly quite the reverse indeed it is a record of a phase and period of her existence which i believe she might wish those who areinterested in herto study especially as she had no secrets that she could desire to conceal from first to last i believe her life to have been as clear as the sky and as pure as running water  very well answered morris if i come across any passage that i think i ought not to read i will skip  i can find nothing of the sort or i would not give it to you said mr fregelius but of course i have not read the volumes through as yet there has been no time for that i have sampled them here and there that is all    that night morris took those shabby notebooks home with him mary who according to her custom went to bed early being by this time fast asleep he retired to his laboratory in the old chapel where it was his habit to sit especially when as at the present time his father was away from home here without wasting a moment he began his study of them  it was with very strange sensations such as he had never before experienced that he opened the first of the volumes written some thirteen years earlier that is about ten years before stellas death their actual acquaintance had been but brief now he was about to complete his knowledge of her to learn many things which he had found no time or had forgotten to inquire into to discover the explanation of various phases of her character hitherto but halfrevealed perhaps to trace to its source the energy of that real but mystic faith with which it was informed this diary that had comeor perhaps been sent to himin so unexpected a fashion was the key whereby he hoped to open the most hidden chambers of the heart of the woman whom he loved and who loved him with all her strength and soul  little wonder then that he trembled upon the threshold of such a search he was like the neophyte of some veiled religion who after long years of arduous labour and painful preparation is at length conducted to the doors of its holy of holies and left to enter there alone what will he find beyond them the secret he longed to learn the seal and confirmation of his hardwon faith or empty baulking nothingness would the goddess herself the unveiled isis wait to bless her votary within those doors or would that hall be tenanted but by a painted and bedizened idol a thing fine with ivory and gold but dead and soulless  might it not be better indeed to turn back while there was yet time to be content to dwell on in the wide outer courts of the imagination where faith is always possible rather than to hazard all no it would morris felt be best to learn the whole truth especially as he was sure that it could not prove other than satisfying and beautiful blind must he have been indeed and utterly without intuition if with every veil that was withdrawn from it the soul of stella did not shine more bright  another question remained was it well that he should read these diaries was not his mind already full enough of stella if once he began to read might it not be overladen in short mary had dealt well by him when those books were open in his hand would he be dealing well by mary answersexcellent answersto these queries sprang up in his mind by dozens  stella was dead but you are sworn to her in death commented the voice of conscience would you rob the living of your allegiance before the time  there was no possible harm in reading the records of the life and thoughts of a friend or even of a love departed yet suggested the voice of conscience are you so sure that this life is departed have you not at whiles felt its presence that mysterious presence of the dead so sweet so heavy and so unmistakable with which at some time or other in their lives many have made acquaintance will not the study of this life cause that life to draw near the absorption of those thoughts bring about the visits of other and greater thoughts whereof they may have been as it were the seed  anyone who knew its author would be interested to read this human document the product of an intelligence singularly bright and clear of a vision whose point of outlook was one of the highest and most spiritual peaks in the range of our human imaginings quite so agreed the voice of conscience for instance mary would be delighted why not begin with her in fact why not peruse these pages togetherit would lead to some interesting arguments why pore over them in this selfish manner all alone and at the dead of night when no one can possibly disturb you or since you have blocked the hagioscope even see you and why does the door of that safe stand open because of the risk of fire if anyone should chance to come in with a candle i suppose no of course it would not be right to leave such books about especially as they do not belong to you  then enraged or at least seriously irritated by these impertinent comments of his inner self upon himself morris bade conscience to be gone to its own place next after contemplating it for a while as eve might have contemplated the apple unmindful of a certain petition in the lords prayer he took up the volume marked i and began to read the wellremembered handwriting with its quaint mediaevallooking contractions even at the age when its author had opened her diary he noted that this writing was so tiny and neat that many of the pages might have been taken from a monkish missal also there were few corrections what she set down was already determined in her mind  from that time forward morris sat up even later than usual nor did he waste those precious solitary hours but the diary covered ten full years of a womans life during all of which time certainly never a week passed without her making entries in it some of them of considerable length thus it came aboutfor he skipped no wordthat a full month had gone by before morris closed the last volume and slipped it away into its hidingplace in the safe  as mr fregelius had said the history was a history of thoughts and theories rather than of facts but notwithstanding this perhaps on account of it indeed it was certainly a work which would have struck the severest and least interested critic as very remarkable the prevailing note was that of vividness what the writer had felt what she had imagined what she had desired was all set out frequently in but few words with such crystal clearness such incisive point that it came home to the readers thought as a flash of sudden light might come home to his eye in a preeminent degree stella possessed the gift of expression even her most abstruse selfcommunings and speculations were portrayed so sharply that their meaning could not possibly be mistaken this it was that gave the book much of its value her thoughts were not vague she could define them in her own consciousness and what is more rare on paper  so much for the form of the journal its matter is not so easy to describe at first as might be expected from her years it was somewhat childish in character but not on that account the less sweet and fragrant of a childs poor heart here with stern accuracy were recorded her little faults of omission and commissionhow she had answered crossly how she had not done her duty varied occasionally with short poems some copied some of her own composition and prayers also of her making one or two of them very touching and beautiful from time to time tooindeed this habit clung to her to the lastshe introduced into her diary descriptions of scenery generally short and detached but set there evidently because she wished to preserve a sketch in words of some sight that had moved her mind  here is a brief example describing a scene in norway where she was visiting as it appeared to her upon some evening in late autumn this afternoon i went out to gather cranberries on the edge of the firbelt below the stead beneath me stretched the great mossswamp so wide that i could not discern its borders and grey as the sea in winter the wind blew and in the west the sun was setting a big red sun which glowed like the coppercovered cathedral dome that we saw last week all about in the moss stood pools of black stagnant water with little straggling bushes growing round them under the clouds they were ink but in the path of the red light there they were blood a man with a large basket on his back and a long staff in his hand was walking across the moss from west to east the wind tossed his cloak and bent his grey beard as he threaded his way among the pools the red light fell upon him also and he looked as though he were on fire before him gathering thicker as the sun sank were shadows and blackness he seemed to walk into the blackness like a man wading into the sea it swallowed him up he must have felt very lonely with no one near him in that immense grey place now he was all gone except his head that wore a halo of the red light he looked like a saint struggling across the world into the black gates for a minute he stood still as though he were frightened then a sudden gust seemed to sweep him on again right into the gates and i lost sight of that man whom i shall never see any more i wonder whether he was a saint or a sinner and what he will find beyond the gates a curlew flew past me borne out of the darkness and its cry made me feel sad and shiver it might have been the mans soul which wished to look upon the light again then the sun sank and there was no light only the wind moaning and far far away the sad cry of the curlew  this description was simple and unpolished as it was short yet it impressed the mind of morris and its curious allegorical note appealed to his imagination the grey moss broken by stagnant pools lonesome and primeval the dreary pipe of the wildfowl the red and angry sun fronting the gloom of advancing oblivious night the solitary traveller windbuffeted wayworn aged heavyladen fulfilling the last stage of his appointed journey to a realm of sleep and shadow all these sprang into vision as he read till the landscape concentrated and expressing itself in its tiny central point of human interest grew more real in memory and meaning than many with which he was himself familiar  yet that description was written by an untrained girl not yet seventeen years of age but with such from first to last and this was by no means the best of them he found her pages studded  then jotted down from day to day came the account of the illness and death of her twin sister gudrun a pitiful tale to read hopes prayers agonies of despair all were here recorded the last scene also was set out with a plain and noble dignity written by the bed of death in the presence of death now under the hand of suffering the child had become a woman and as was fitting her full soul found relief in deeper notes goodbye gudrun she ended my heart is broken but i will mourn for you no more god has called you and we give you back to god wait for me my sister for i am coming also and i will not linger i will walk quickly  it was from this sad day of her only sisters death that the first real developments of the mystical side of stellas character must be dated the sudden vanishing in gudrun in the bloom of youth and beauty brought home to her the lesson which all must learn in such a fashion that henceforth her whole soul was tinged to its sad hue  now i understand it all she wrote after returning from the funeral we do not live to die we die to live as a grain of sand to the whole shore as a drop of water to the whole sea so is what we call our life to the real life of course one has always been taught that in church but i never really comprehended it before henceforth this thought shall be a part of me every morning when i wake i will remember that i am one night nearer to the great dawn every night when i lie down to sleep i will thank god that another day of waiting has ended with the sunset yes and i will try to live so that after my last sunset i may meet the end as did gudrun without a single doubt or fear for if i have nothing to reproach myself with why should i be reproached if i have longed for light and lived towards the light however imperfect i may be why should i be allotted to the darkness  almost on the next page appeared a prayer for the welfare and greater glory of her who was dead and for the mourner who was left alive with this quaint note appended my father would not approve of this as it is against the rubric but all the same i mean to go on praying for the dead why should i not if my poor petitions cannot help them who are above the need for help at least they may show that they are not forgotten oh that must be the bitter part to live on full of love and memory and watch forgetfulness creeping into the hearts of the loved and the remembered the priests never thought of it but there lies the real purgatory  the diary showed it to be a little more than a year after this that spiritual doubts began to possess the soul of stella after all was she not mistaken was there any world beyond the physical were we not mere accidents born of the will or the chance of the flesh and shaped by the pressure of centuries of circumstance were not all religions different forms of a gigantic fraud played by his own imagination upon blind believing man and so on to the end of the long list of those questions which are as old as thought  i look she wrote under the influence of this mood but everywhere is blackness blackness without a single star i cry aloud but the only answer is the echo of my own voice beating back upon me from the deaf heavens i pray for faith yet faith fades and leaves me i ask for signs and there is no sign the argument so far as i have read and heard it seems the other way and yet i do not believe their proofs i do not believe that so many generations of good men would have fed full upon a husk of lies and have lain down to sleep at last as though satisfied with meat my heart rises at the thought i am immortal i know that i am immortal i am a spirit in days to come unchained by matter time or space i shall stand before the throne of the father of all spirits receiving of his wisdom and fulfilling his commandments yet o god help thou my unbelief o god draw and deliver me from this abyss  from this time forward here and there in the diary were to be found passages or rather sentences that morris did not understand they alluded to some secret and persistent effort which the writer had been making and after one of them came these words i have failed again but she was near me i am sure that she was very near me  then at last came this entry which as the writing showed was written with a shaking hand i have seen her beyond the possibility of a doubt she appeared and was with me quite a while and oh the rapture it has left me weak and faint after all that long long preparation it is of the casting forth of spirits that it is said this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting but it is also true of the drawing of them down to see a spirit one must grow akin to spirits which is not good for us who are still in the flesh i am satisfied i have seen and i know now i shall call her back no more lest the thing should get the mastery of me and i become unfitted for my work on earth this morning i could scarcely hold the bow of the violin and its sweetest notes sounded harsh to me i heard discords among their harmonies also i had no voice to sing and after all the money and time that have been spent upon them i must keep up my playing and singing since perhaps in the future if my fathers health should fail as it often threatens to do they may be our only means of livelihood no i shall try no more i will stop while there is yet time while i am still my own mistress and have the strength to deny me this awful joy but i have seen i have seen and i am thankful who shall never doubt again yet the world and those who tread it can never more be quite the same to me and that is not wholesome this is the price which must be paid for vision of that which we were not meant to touch to taste to handle  after this for some yearsuntil it was decided indeed that they should move to monkslandthere was little of startling interest in the diary it recorded descriptions of the wild moorland scenery of birds and ferns and flowers also there were sketches of the peasantry and of the gentlefolk with whom the writer came in contact very shrewd and clever some of them but with this peculiaritythat they were absolutely free from unkindness of thought or words though sometimes their author allowed herself the license of a mitigated satire such things with notes of domestic and parish matters and of the progress made in her arduous and continual study of vocal and instrumental music made up the sum of these years of the diary then at length at the beginning of the last volume came this entry  the unexpected has happened somebody has actually been found in whose eyes this cure of souls is desirablenamely a certain mr tomley the rector of a village called monksland upon the east coast of england i will sum up the history of the thing for some years i have been getting tired of this place although in a way i love it too it is so lonely here andi confess my weaknessplaying and singing as i do now i should like occasionally to have a better audience than a few old halfdeaf clergymen their preoccupied and commonplace wives some yeomen farmers and a curate or two  it was last year though i find that i didnt put it down at the time that at the concert in aid of the rebuilding of pankford church i played tartinis il trillo del diavolo to me one of the weirdest and most wonderful bits of violin music in the world i know that i was almost crying when i finished it but next day i saw in the report in the local paper written by our musical man that miss fregelius then relieved the proceedings with a comic interlude on the violin which was much appreciated by the audience it was that i confess ityes the idiotic remark of our musical man which made me determine if it was in any way possible that i would shake the dust of this village off my feet then so far as my father is concerned the stipend is wretched and decreasing also he has never really got on here he is too shy too reserved perhaps in a way too well read and educated for these roughandready people even his foreign name goes against him the curates about here call him frigid fregelius it is the local idea of a joke  so i persuaded him to advertise for an exchange although he said it was a mere waste of money as nobody in his senses would look at this parish then came the wonderful thing after the very first advertisementyes the very firstarrived a letter from mr tomley rector of monksland where the stipend is 100 pounds a year better than this saying that he would wish to inquire into the matter he has inquired he has been a pompous old gentleman with a slow voice and a single lock of white hair above his forehead he says that it is satisfactory and that subject to the consent of the bishop etc he thinks that he will be glad to effect the exchange afterwards i found him in front of the house staring at the moorland behind the sea in front and the church in the middle and looking very wretched i asked him why he wanted to do itthe words popped out of my mouth i couldnt help them it was all so odd  then i found out the reason mr tomley has a wife who is or thinks she isi am not sure whichan invalid and who i gather speaks to mr tomley with no uncertain sound mr tomleys wife was the niece of a longdeparted rector who was inducted in 1815 and reigned here for fortyfive years he was rich a bachelor and rebuilt the church is it not all written in the flyleaf of the last register mrs tomley inherited her uncles landed property in this neighbourhood and says that she is only well in the air of northumberland so mr tomley has to come up here which he doesnt at all like although i gather that he is glad to escape from his present squire who seems to be a distinguished but arbitrary old gentleman an excolonel of the guards rather quarrelsome too with a habit of making fun of mrs tomley theres the explanation  so just because of the silly criticism of our musical man we are going to move several hundred miles but is that really the cause are these things done of our own desire or do we do them because we must as our forefathers believed beneath our shouts and chattering they have always heard the slow thunder of the waves of fate through the flare of our straw fires and the dust of our hurrying feet they could always see the shadow of his black banners and the sheen of his advancing spears and for them every wayside signpost was painted with his finger  i think like that too perhaps because i am all nearly all norse and we do not shake off the strong and ancient shackle of our blood in the space of a few generations of christian freedom and enlightenment yes i see the finger of fate upon this signpost of an advertisement in a church paper his flag is represented to me by mr tomleys white and cherished lock assuredly our migration is decreed of the norns therefore i accept it without question but i should like to know what kind of a web of destiny they are weaving for us yonder in the place called monksland    chapter xxi  the end of stellas diary  a month or two later in the diary came the account of the shipwreck of the trondhjem and of the writers rescue from imminent death my first great adventure the pages were headed they told how her father with whom readymoney was a scarce commodity and who had a passion for small and uncomfortable economies suddenly determined to save two or three pounds by taking a passage in a norwegian tramp steamboat named the trondhjem this vessel laden with a miscellaneous cargo had put in at a northumbrian port and carried freight consisting of readymade windows doorframes and other wooden housefittings suited to the requirements of the builders of seaside villas to be delivered at the rising wateringplace of northwold upon her way to london then followed a description of the voyage the dirt of the ship the surpassing nastiness of the food and the roughness of the crew whose sailorlike qualities inspired the writer with no confidence  next the diary which now had been written up by stella in the abbey where morris read it went on to tell of how she had gone to her berth one night in the cabin next to that occupied by her father and being tired by a long day in the strong sea air had fallen instantly into a heavy sleep which was disturbed by a nightmarelike dream of shock and noise this imagined pandemonium it said was followed by a great quiet in the midst of which she awoke to miss the sound of the thumping screw and of the captain shouting his orders from the bridge  for a while the writing told she lay still till a sense that something was wrong awoke her thoroughly when she lit the candle which she kept by her berth and rising peeped out into the saloon to see that water was washing along its floor presently she made another discovery that she was alone utterly alone even her fathers cabin being untenanted  the rest need not be repeated in detail throwing on some garments and a red cloak of northcountry frieze she made her way to the deck to find that the ship was abandoned by every living soul including her own father why or under what circumstances remained a mystery she retreated into the captains cabin which was on deck being afraid to go below again in the darkness and sheltered there until the light came then she went out and though the dim mistladen dawn crept forward to the forecastle and staring over the side discovered that the prow of the ship was fixed upon a rock while her stern and waist which floated clear heaved and rolled with every sea as she stood thus the vessel slipped back along the reef three feet or more throwing her to the deck and thrilling her from head to foot with the most sickening sensation she had ever experienced then the trondhjem caught and hung again but stella so she wrote knew that the end must be near as the ship would lift off with the full tide and founder and for the first time felt afraid  i did not fear what might come after death went on the diary but i did fear the act of death i was so lonely and the dim waters looked so cold the brown shoulders of the rocks which showed now and again through the surges so cruel to be dashed by those cold waters upon those iron rocks till the life was slowly ground out of my body and my fatherthe thought of him tormented my mind was he dead or had he deserted me the last seemed quite impossible for it would have supposed him a coward and i was sure that he would rather die than leave me therefore as i feared the first must be true i was afraid and i was wretched and i said my prayers and cried a little while the cold struck me through the red cloak and the damp mist made me shiver  then suddenly i remembered that it had not been the custom of my ancestors and countrywomen of the old time to die weeping and with the thought some of my courage came back i rose from the deck and stood upon the prow of the ship supporting myself by a rope as many a dead woman of my race has done before me in the hour of battle and shipwreck as i stood thus believing that i was about to die there floated into my mind a memory of the old norse song that my mother had taught me as she learned it from her mother it is called the song of the overlord and for generations without count on their deathbeds has been sung or if they were too weak to sing whispered by the women of my family even my mother murmured it upon the day she died although to all appearances she had become an englishwoman and the first line of it  hail to thee sky king hail to thee earth king  were the last words that the gentlest creature whom i ever knew my sister gudrun muttered before she became unconscious this song it has always been held unlucky to sing except upon the actual approach of death since otherwise so goes the old saying it draws the arrow whose flight was wide and death being invoked comes soon still for me i believed there was no escape for i was quite sure from her movements that the steamer would soon come off the rocks and i had made my confession and said my prayers so i began to sing and sang my loudest pleasing myself with the empty foolish thought that in some such circumstance as this many a danish seakings daughter had sung that song before me  then as i sang a wind began to blow and suddenly the mist was driven before it like puffs of smoke and in the east behind me rose the red ball of the sun its light fell upon the rocks and upon the waters beyond them and there to my amazement appearing and disappearing upon the ridges and hollows of the swell i saw a man alone in a sailingboat which rode at anchor within thirty yards of me at first i thought that it must be my father then the man caught sight of me and i saw his face as he looked up for the sun shone upon his dark eyes and knew that he was a stranger  he lifted his anchor and called to me to come to the companion ladder and his voice told me that he was a gentleman i could not meet him as i was with my hair loose and barefooted like some norse viking girl so i took the risk for now although i cannot tell why i felt sure that no harm would come to him or me and ran to the cabin where also was this volume of my diary and my mothers jewels that i did not wish to lose when at last i was ready after a fashion i came out with my bag and there splashing through the water of the saloon ran the stranger shouting angrily to me to be quick as the ship was lifting off the rock which made me think how brave it was of him to come aboard to look for me in an instant he caught me by the hand and was dragging me up the stairs and down the companion so that in another minute we were together in the boat and he had told me that my father was on shorethank godthough with a broken thigh  then some pages of the diary were taken up with the description of the twentyfour hours which she had spent on the open sea with himself of their landing dazed and exhausted at the dead church and her strange desire to explore it their arrival at the abbey and her meeting with her father after these came a passage that may be quoted  he is not handsomei call him plainwith his projecting brow large mouth and untidy brown hair but notwithstanding his stoop and his thin hands he looks a fine man and when they light up his eyes are beautiful it was brave of him too very brave although he thinks nothing of it to come out alone to look for me like that i wonder what brought him i wonder if anything told his mind that i a girl whom he had never seen was really on the ship and in danger perhapsat any rate he came and the odd thing is that from the moment i saw him and especially from the moment i heard his voice i felt as though i had known him all my life probably he would think me mad if i were to say so indeed i am by no means sure that he does not pay me that compliment already with some excuse perhaps in view of the song of the overlord and all my wild talk well after such a night as i had spent anyone might be excused for talking foolishly it is the reaction from never expecting to talk again at all the chief advantage of a diary is that one may indulge in the luxury of telling the actual truth so i will say that i feel as though i had known him always alwaysand as though i understood him as one understands a person one has watched for years what is more i think that he understands me more than most people do not that this is wonderful seeing how few i know at any rate he guesses more or less what i am thinking about and can see that there is something in the ideas which others consider foolish as perhaps they are  it is very odd that i who had made sure that i was gone should be still alive in this pleasant house and saved from death by this pleasant companion to find my father whom i feared was dead also living and all this after i had sung the song of the overlord so much for its illluck but all the same my father was rather upset when he heard that i had been found singing it he is very superstitious my dear old father that is one of the few norse characteristics which he has left in him i told him that there was no use in being disturbed since in the end things must go as they are fated  mr monk is engaged to a miss porson he told me that in the boat i asked him what he was thinking of when we nearly overset against that dreadful rock he answered that he could only think of the song he had heard me singing on the ship which i considered a great compliment to my voice quite the nicest i ever had but he ought to have been thinking about the lady to whom he is engaged and he understood that i thought so which i daresay i should not have allowed him to do however when people believe that they are going to be drowned they grow confidential and expose their minds freely he exposed his when he told me that he thought i was talking egregious nonsense and i am afraid that i laughed at him i dont think that he really can love herthat is as engaged people are supposed to love each other if he did he would not have grown so angrywith himselfand then turned upon me because the recollection of my old death song had interfered with the reflections which he ought to have offered upon her altar that is what struck me as odd not his neglecting to remember her in a moment of danger since then we often forget everything except some triviality of the hour but of course this is all nonsense which i oughtnt to write here even as most people have their own ways of being fond of each other also it is no affair of mine  i have seen miss porsons photograph a large one of her in court dress which stands in mr monks laboratory such a lovely place it was an old chapel she is a beautiful woman large and soft and regallooking a very woman it would be difficult to imagine a better specimen of the eternal feminine also they say that is the nurse who is looking after my father says that she is very rich and devoted to mr morris so mr morris is a lucky man i wonder why he didnt save her from a shipwreck instead of me it would have given an appropriate touch of romance to the affair which is now entirely wasted upon a young person if i may still call myself so with whom it has no concern  what interests me more than our hosts matrimonial engagements however are his experiments with aerophones that is a wonderful invention if only it can be made to work without fail upon all occasions i do wish that i could help him there it would be some return for his great kindness for it must be a dreadful nuisance to have an old clergyman with a broken leg and his inconvenient daughter suddenly quartered upon you for an unlimited period of time  the record of the following weeks was very full but almost entirely concernedbrief mention of other things such as her fathers health exceptedwith full and accurate notes and descriptions of the aerophone experiments to morris reading them it was wonderful especially as stella had received no training in the science of electricity that she could have grasped the subject thus thoroughly in so short a time evidently she must have had a considerable aptitude for its theory and practice as might be seen by the study that she gave to the literature which he lent her including some manuscript volumes of his own notes also there were other entries thus  today mr stephen layard proposed to me in the dead church i had seen it coming for the last three weeks and wished to avoid it but he would not take a hint i am most sorry as i really think he cares about mefor the whilewhich is very kind of him but it is out of the question and i had to say no indeed he repels me i do not even like being in the same room with him although no doubt this is very fastidious and wrong of me i hope that he will get over it soon in fact although he seemed distressed i am not vain enough to suppose that it will be otherwise     of course my father is angry for reasons which i need not set down this i expected but he said some things which i wish he had left unsaid for they made me answer him as i ought not to have done fathers and daughters look at marriage from such different standpoints what is excellent in their eyes may be as bad as death or in some cases worse to the woman who of course must pay the price     i sang and played my best last night my very very best indeed i dont think i ever did so well before and perhaps never shall again he was movedmore moved than i meant him to be and i was moved myself i suppose that it was the surroundings that old chapelhow well those monks understood acoustic propertiesthe moonlight the upset to my nerves this afternoon my fear that he believed that i had accepted mr l imagine his believing that i thought better of him and he did believe iteverything put together  while i was singing he told me that he was going awayto see miss porson at beaulieu i suppose when i had finishedoh how tired i was after the effort was overhe asked me straight out if i intended to marry mr layard and i asked him if he was mad then i put another question i dont know why i never meant to do it but it came up from my heartwhether he had not said that he was going away in answer he explained that he was thinking of so doing but had changed his mind oh i was pleased when i heard that i was never so pleased in my life before after all the gift of music is of some use  but why should i have been pleased mr monks comings or goings are nothing to me i have no right to interfere with them even indirectly or to concern myself about them yet i cried when i heard those words but i suppose it was the music that made me cry it has that inconvenient effect sometimes well i have no doubt that he will see plenty of miss porson and it would have been a great pity to break off the experiments just now  one more extract from the very last entry in the series of books it was written at the rectory on christmas eve just before stella started out to meet morris at the dead church  hecolonel masked me and i told him the truth straight out i could not help myself it burst from my lips although the strange thing is that until he put it into my mind with the question i knew nothing then of a sudden in an instant in a flash i understood and i knew that my whole being belonged to this man his son morris what is love once i remember hearing a clever cynic argue that between men and women no such thing exists he called their affection by other names and said that for true love to be present the influence of sex must be absent this he proved by declaring that this marvellous passion of love about which people talk and write is never heard of where its object is old or deformed or even very ugly although such accidents of chance and time are no bar to the true love oflet us saythe child and the parent or the friend and the friend  well the argument seemed difficult to answer although at the time i knew that it must be wrong but how could i who was utterly without experience talk of such a hard matter now i understand that love the real love between a man and a woman if it be real embraces all the other sorts of love morewhether the key be physical or spiritual it unlocks a window in our hearts through which we see a different world from the world that we have known also with this new vision come memories and foresights this man whom i lovethree months ago i had never seen his faceand now i feel as though i had known him not only all my life but from the beginning of timeas though we never could be parted any more  and i talk thus about one who has never said a tender word to me why because my thought is his thought and my mind his mind how am i sure of that because it came upon me at the moment when i learned the truth about myself he and i are one therefore i learned the truth about him also  i was like eve when she left the tree knowledge was mine only i had eaten of the fruit of life yet the taste of it must be bitter in my mouth what have i done i have given my spirit into the keeping of a man who is pledged to another woman and as i think have taken his from her keeping to my own what then is this other woman who is so good and kind to be robbed of all that is left to her in the world am i to take from her him who is almost her husband never if his heart has come to me i cannot help itfor the rest no so what is left to me his spirit and all the future when the flesh is done with that is heritage enough how the philosopher who argued about the love of men and women would laugh and mock if he could see these words supposing that he could say stella fregelius i am in a position to offer you a choice will you have this man for your husband and live out your natural lives upon the strict stipulation that your relationship ends absolutely and forever with your last breaths or will you let him go to the other woman for their natural lives with the prospect of that heritage which your imagination has fashioned that dim eternity of double joy where hand in hand twain and yet one you will fulfil the secret purpose of your destinies  what should i answer then  before heaven i would answer that i would not sell myself to the devil of the flesh and of this present world what barter my birthright of immortality for the mess of pottage of a few brief years of union pay out my high hopes to their last bright coin for this dinner of mingled herbs drain the well of faith dug with so many prayers and labours that its waters may suffice to nourish a rose planted in the sand whose blooms must die at the first touch of creeping earthly frost  the philosopher would say that i was mad that the linnet in the hand is better than all the birds of paradise which ever flew in fabled tropic seas  i reply that i am content to wait till upon some glorious morning my ship breaks into the silence of those seas and watching from her battered bulwarks i behold the islands of the blest and catch the scent of heavenly flowers and see the jewelled birds whereof i dream floating from palm to palm  but if there are no such isles he would answer if with their magic birds and flowers they are indeed but the baseless fabric of a dream if your ship amidst the ravings of the storm and the darkness of the tortured night should founder once and for ever in the dark strait which leads to the gateways of that dawnthose gateways through which no traveller returns to lay his fellows course for the harbours of your perfect sea what then  then i would say let me forswear god who has suffered me to be deceived with false spirits and sink to depths where no light breaks where no memories stir where no hopes torment yes then let me deny him and die who am of all women the most miserable but it is not so for to me a messenger has come at my prayer once the gates were opened and now i know quite surely that it was permitted to me to see within them that i might find strength in this the bitter hour of my trial  yet how can i choke the truth and tread down the human heart within me oh the road which my naked feet must tread is full of thorns and heavy the cross that i must bear i go now in a few minutes time to bid him farewell if i can help it i shall never see him again no not even after many years since it is better not also perhaps this is weakness but i should wish him to remember me wearing such beauty as i have and still young before time and grief and labour have marked me with their ugly scars it is the stella whom he found singing at the daybreak on the ship which brought her to him for whom i desire that he should seek in the hour of a different dawn  i go presently to my marriage as it were a cold and pitiful feast many would think itthese nuptials of lifelong renunciation the philosopher would say why renounce you have some advantages some powers use them the man loves you play upon his natural weakness help yourself to the thing that chances to be desirable in your eyes three years hence who will blame you who will even remember his father well he likes you already and in time a man of the world accepts accomplished facts especially if things go well as they will do for that invention must succeed no one else yes three others he would remember however much he loved me for i should have brought him to do a shameful act and she would remember whom i had robbed of her husband coming into his life after he had promised himself to her last of allmost of all perhapsi myself should remember day by day and hour by hour that i was nothing more than one of the family of thieves  no i will have none of such philosophy at least i stella fregelius will live and die among the upright so i go to my cold marriage such as it is so i bend my back to the burden so i bow my head to the storm and throughout it all i thank god for what he has been pleased to send me i may seem poor but how rich i am who have been dowered with a love that i know to be eternal as my eternal soul i go and my husband shall receive me not with a lovers kiss and tenderness but with words few and sad with greetings that almost before their echoes die must fade into farewells i wrap no veil about my head he will set no ring upon my hand perchance we shall plight no troth so be it our hour of harvest is not yet  yesterday was very sharp and bleak with scuds of sleet and snow driven by the wind but as i drove here with my father i saw a man and a woman in the midst of an empty lifeless field planting some winter seed who looking at them who that did not know could foretell the fruits of their miserable unhopeful labour yet the summer will come and the sweet smell of the flowering beans and the song of the nesting birds and the plentiful reward of the year crowned with fatness it is a symbol of this marriage of mine today we sow the seed next after a space of raving rains and winds will follow the long white winter of death then some dim sweet spring of awakening and beyond it the fulness of all joy  what is there about me that it would make me ashamed that he should know this husband to whom i must tell nothing i cannot think no other man has been anything to me i can remember no great sin i have worked making the best of such gifts as i possess i have tried to do my duty and i will do it to the end surely my heart is whole and my hands are clean perhaps it is a sin that i should have learned to love him that i should look to a far future where i may be with him if so am i to blame who ask nothing here can i conquer destiny who am its child can i read or shape the purpose of my maker  and so i go o god i pray thee of thy mercy give me strength to bear my temptations and my trials and to him also give every strength and blessing o father i pray thee of thy mercy shorten these the days of my tribulation upon earth accept and sanctify this my sacrifice of denial grant me pardon here and hereafter through all the abyss of time in thy knowledge and presence that perfect peace which i desire with him to whom i am appointed amen    chapter xxii  the evil gate  such was the end of the diary of stella  morris shut the book with something like a sob then he rose and began to tramp up and down the length of the long lonely room while thoughts crowded confused and overwhelming pressed in upon his mind what a woman was this whom he had lost who had known another so pure so spiritual surely she did not belong to this world and therefore her last prayer was so quickly answered therefore heaven took her many reading those final pages might have said with the philosopher she imagined that the shock of love and the sorrow of separation had turned her brain and that she was mad for who so such might argue would think that person otherwise than mad who dared to translate into action and on earth to set up as a ruling star that faith which day by day their lips professed  yet it would seem after that this dreamer and mystic stella believed in nothing which our religion accepted by millions without cavil does not promise to its votaries its revelations and rewards marked the extremest limits of her fantasy immortality of the personal soul its foundation stone was the rock on which she built a heaven where there is no earthly marriage but where each may consort with the souls most loved and most desired where all sorrows are forgotten all tears are wiped away all purposes made clear reserved for those who deny themselves do their duty and seek forgiveness of their sinsthis heaven conceived by stella is it not vowed to us in the pages of the gospel is it not vowed again and again sometimes with more detail sometimes with less sometimes in open simple words sometimes wrapped in the mystic allegory of the visions of st john but everywhere and continually held before us as our crown and great reward and the rest such things as her belief in guardian angels and that it had been given to her mortal eyes to behold and commune with a beloved ghost is there not ample warrant for them in those inspired writings were not the dead seen of many in jerusalem on the night of fear and are we not told of ministering spirits sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation and of the guardian angels who look continually upon the father  now it all grew clear to morris in stella he beheld an example of the doctrines of christianity really inspiring the daily life of the believer if her strong faith animated all those who served under that banner then in like circumstances they would act as she had acted they would have no doubts their fears would vanish their griefs be comforted and to a great extent even the promptings and passions of their mortality would be trodden under foot with stella they would be ready to neglect the temporary in their certainty of the eternal and even to welcome death to them in truth and not in mere convention the gate of life  many things are promised to those who can achieve faith stella achieved it and became endued with some portion of the promise spiritual faith not inherited nor accepted but hardwon by personal struggle and experience that was the keynote to her character and the explanation of her actions yet that faith when examined into was nothing exotic no combination of mysticism and mummery but one founded upon the daily creed of the english and its fellow churches and understood and applied to the circumstances of a life which was as brief as it seemed to be unfortunate this was morriss discovery open and obvious enough and yet at first until he grew accustomed to it a thing marvellous in his eyes one moreover in which he found comfort since surely that straight but simple path was such as his feet might follow  and she loved him oh how she had loved him there could be no doubt there were her words written in that book not hastily spoken beneath the pressure of some sudden wind of feeling but set down in black and white thought over reasoned out and recorded and then their purport they were a paean of passion but the dirge of its denial they dwelt upon the natural hopes of woman only to put them by  yet how can i choke the truth and tread down the human heart within me oh the road that my naked feet must tread is full of thorns and heavy the cross that i must bear    so i go to my marriage such as it is so i bend my back to the burden so i bow my head to the storm and through it all i thank god for what he has been pleased to send me i may seem poor but how rich i am who have been dowered with a love that i know to be eternal as my eternal soul  that was her creed those were the teachings of her philosophy and this was the woman who had loved him who died loving him her very words came back spoken but a few seconds before the endremember every word which i have said to you remember that we are wedtruly wed that i go to wait for you and that even if you do not see me i will if i may be near you always  i go to wait for you i will be near you always here was another inspiration for three years or more he had been thinking of her as dead or rather he had thought of her in that nebulous undefined fashion in which we consider the dead the slumberous people who forget everything who see nothing who if they exist at all are like stones upon the beach rolled to and fro blind and senseless not of their own desire but by the waves of a fearful fate that itself is driven on with the strength of a secret storm of will and this fate some call the breath of god and some the working of a soulless force that compels the universe past present and to be  but was this view as real as it is common if stella were right if our religion were right it must be most wrong that religion told us that the master of mankind descended into hades to preach to the souls of men did he preach to dumb oceandriven stones to frozen forms and fossils who had once been men or to spirits changed but active and existent  stella too had walked in the valley of doubt by the path which all who think must tread it was written large in the book of her life but she had not fainted there she had lived through its thunderrains its arid blasts of withering dust its quivering quicksands and its miragelike meadows gay with deceitful poisonous flowers at last she had reached the mountain slopes of truth to travel up them higherever higher till she won their topmost peak where the sun shone undimmed and the pure air blew whence the world seemed far away and heaven very near yes and from that heaven she had called down the spirit of her lost sister and thenceforward was content and sure  she had called down the spirit of her sister was it not written in the pages which she thought that no eye but hers would see  well if such spirits were hersstellasmust be also and if they could be made apparent why should not hers share their qualities  morris paused in his swift walk and trembled i will be near you always for aught he knew she was near him nowpresent perhaps in this very room while she was still in life what were her aspirations this was one of them he remembered as it fell from her lips still to be with those whom i have loved on earth although they cannot see me to soothe their sorrows to support their weakness to lull their fears and if this were so if any power were given her to fulfil her will whom would she sooner visit than himself  stay that was her wish on earth while she was a woman but would she still wish it afterwards the spirit was not the flesh the spirit could see and be sure while the flesh must be content with deductions and hazardings if she could see she would know him as he was every failing every secret infirmity every infidelity of heart might be an open writing to her eyes and then would she not close that book in horror  a great writer has said in effect that no man would dare to affront the ears of his fellowsmen much worse than himself perhapswith the true details of his hidden history knowing all the truth they would shrink from him how much more then at such sights and sounds would a pure spirit washed clean of every taint of earth fly from his soiled presence wailing and aghast nay men are hypocrites who in greater or less degree themselves practice the very sins that shock them but spirits knowing all would forgive all they are above hypocrisy if the lord of spirits can weigh the dust whereof we are made and still be merciful shall his bright messengers trample it in scorn and hate will they not also consider the longings of the heart and its uprightness and be pitiful towards the failings of the flesh would stella hate him because he remained as he was madeas herself she might once have been because having no wings with which to rule the air he must still tramp onwards through the foetid clinging mud of earth  oh how he longed to see her that he might win her faith win it beyond all doubt by the evidence of his earthly eyes and senses if i die search and you shall see she had once said to him and then added no do not search but wait wait how could he wait at your death i will be with you why he might live another fifty years that book of her recorded thoughts had aroused in him such a desire for the sight or at least the actual knowledge of her continued being that his blood was aflame as with a madness and yet how should he search  stella he whispered come to me stella but no stella came no wings rustled no breath stirred the empty room was as the room had been its silence seemed to mock him those who slept beneath its marble floor were not more silent  was he mad that he should claim the power to work this miracleto charm the dead back through the gates of death as orpheus charmed eurydice yet stella did this thingbut how he turned to the volume and page of her diary which dealt with the drawing down of gudrun yes here she spoke of continual efforts and of that long long preparationof prayer and fasting also here too was the whole secret summed up in a dozen words to see a spirit one must grow akin to spirits well it could be done and he would do it but look further on where she said i shall call her back no more lest the thing should get the mastery of me and i become unfitted for my work on earth    i will stop while there is yet time while i am still mistress of my mind and have the strength to deny myself this awful joy  was there not a warning in these words and in those other words no do not search but wait surely they told of risk to him who being yet on earth dared to lift a corner of the veil which separates flesh and spirit should get the mastery of me if he saw her once would he be able to do as stella did and by an effort of his will separate himself from a communion so fearful yet so sweet unfitted for my work supposing that it did get the mastery of him would he not also be unfitted for his work on earth  his work what work had he now it seemed to be done for attending scientific meetings receiving dividends playing the country squires only son and the wealthy host whilst awaiting the title which mary wished forthese things are not work and somehow his days were so arranged that he was never allowed to go beyond them all further researches and experiments were discouraged what did it matter if he were unfitted for that which he could no longer do his work was finished there it stood before him in that box stamped monks aerophone the twin no 3412  no he had but one ambition left to pierce the curtain of thick night and behold her who was lost to him her who loved him as man had been seldom loved  the fierce temptation struck him as a sudden squall strikes a ship with all her canvas spread for a moment mast and rigging stood the strain then they went by the board he would do it if it killed him but the task must be undertaken properly deliberately and above all in secret tomorrow he would begin when he had satisfied himself when he had seen then he could always stop  a few minutes later morris stood beside his wifes bed there she lay in the first perfection of young motherhood and beauty a lovely whitewrapped vision with straying golden hair her sweet rounded face pink with the flush of sleep and the long lashes lying like little shadows on her cheek  morris looked at her and his doubts returned what would stella say he thought to himself it almost seemed to him that he could hear her voice bidding him forbear bidding him render unto his wife those things which were his wifes all honour loyalty and devotion if he entered on this course could he still render them was there not such a thing as moral infidelity and did not such exercises as he proposed partake of its nature perhaps perhaps on the whole it might be well to put all this behind him  it was three oclock he was tired out and must sleep the morning would be a more fitting time to ponder such weighty questions of the unwritten matrimonial law  in due course the morning cameindeed it was not far offand with it wiser counsels mary woke early and talked about the baby which was teething indeed so soon as the nurse was up she sent for it that the three of them might hold a consultation over a swollen gum also she discussed the date of their departure to beaulieu for again christmas was near at hand adding however somewhat to morriss relief that unless the babys teeth went on better she really did not think that they could go as it would be most unwise to take her out of the care of dr charters and trust her to the tender mercies of foreign leeches morris agreed that it might be risky and mentioned that in a letter which he had received from the concierge at beaulieu a few days before that functionary said that the place was overrun with measles and scarlatina  morris ejaculated mary sitting bolt upright in bed and you never told me what is more had it not been for babys teeth which brought it to your mind i believe you never would have told me and i might have taken those unprotected little angels andoh goodness i cant bear to think of it  morris muttered some apologies whereon mary looking at him suspiciously through her falling hair asked  why did you forget to show me the letter did you suppress it because you wanted to go to beaulieu  no answered morris with energy i hate beaulieu i forgot that is all because i have so much to think about i suppose  so much i thought that things were arranged now so that you had nothing at all to think about except how to spend your money and be happy with me and adore the dear angelsyes i think that perhaps the nurse had better take her away touch the bell will you there shes gone keep her well wrapped up and mind the draught nurse  no dont get up yet morris i want to talk to you you have been very gloomy of late just like you used to be before you married mooning about and staring at nothing and what on earth do you do sitting up to all hours of the morning in that ghosty old chapel where i wouldnt be alone at twelve oclock for a hundred pounds  i read said morris  read read what novels  sometimes answered morris  oh how can you tell such fibs why that last book by lady whatshername which came in the mudie boxthe one they say is so improperhas been lying on your table for over two months and you cant tell me yet what it was the heroine did wrong morris you are not inventing anything more are you  here was an inspiration i admit that i am thinking of a little thing he said with diffidence as though he were a budding poet with a sonnet on his mind  a little thing what little thing  well a new kind of aerophone designed to work uninfluenced by its twin  well and why shouldnt it everything cant have a twinonly i suppose there would be nothing to hear  thats just the point replied morris in his old professional manner i think there would be plenty to hear if only i could make the machine sensitive to the sounds and capable of reproducing them  what sounds asked mary  well if for instance one could successfully insulate it from the earth noises the sounds which permeate space and even those that have their origin upon the surfaces of the planets and perhaps of the more distant stars  great heavens exclaimed mary imagine a man who can want to let loose upon our poor little world every horrible noise that happens in the stars why what under heaven would be the use of it  well one might communicate with them conceivably even one might hear the speech of their inhabitants if they have any always presuming that such an instrument could be made and that it can be successfully insulated  hear the speech of their inhabitants that is your old idea but you will never succeed thats one blessing morris i suspect you you want to stop at home here to work at this horrible new machine to work for years and years and years without the slightest result i suppose that you didnt invent that about the measles and the scarlatina did you the two of them together sound rather clumsy as though you might have done so  not a bit upon my honour answered morris i will go and get the letter and not sorry to escape from further examination he went  whether the cause were marys doubts and reproaches or the infants gums or the working of his own consciencehe felt that a man with a teething baby has no right to cultivate the occult for quite a long period a whole fortnight indeed morris steadily refrained from any attempt to fulfil his dangerous ambition to pierce the curtain of thick night only he read and reread stellas diarythat secret fascinating work which in effect was building a wall between him and the healthy common instincts of the worldtill he knew whole pages of it by heart also he began a series of experiments whereof the object was to produce an improved and more sensitive aerophone  that any instrument which the intellect of man could produce would really succeed in conveying sounds which if they exist at all are born in the vast cosmic areas that envelope our earth and its atmosphere he believed to be most improbable still such a thing was possible for what is not moreover the world itself as it rushes on its fearful journey across the depths of space has doubtless many voices that have not yet been heard by the ears of men some of which he might be able to discover and record at the least he stood upon the threshold of a new knowledge and now a great desire arose in him to pass its doors if so he might for who could tell what he would learn or see behind them and by degrees as he worked always with one ulterior object in his mind his scruples vanished or were mastered by the growth of his longing till this became his ruling passionto behold the spirit of stella now he no longer reasoned with himself but openly nakedly in his own heart gave his will over to the achievement of this monstrous and unnatural end  how was it to be done that was now the sole dilemma which tormented himas the possible methods of obtaining the drink he craves or the drug that gives him peace and radiant visions torment the dipsomaniac or the morphia victim in his guarded prison he thought of his instruments those magic machines with the working of which stella had been familiar in her life he even poured petitions into them in the hope that these might be delivered far beyond the ken of man only to learn that he was travelling a road which led to a wall impassable the wall that for the lack of a better name we call death which bars the natural from the spiritual  wonderful as were his electrical appliances innumerable as might be their impalpable emanations insoluble as seemed the mystery of their power of catching and transmitting sounds by the agency of ether they were still physical appliances producing physical effects in obedience to the laws of nature but what he sought lay beyond nature and was subject to some rule of which he did not even know the elements and much less the axioms herein his instruments or indeed any that man could make were as futile and as useless as would be the prayers of an archbishop addressed to a mumbojumbo in a fetish house the link was wanting there was and could be no communication between the two the invisible ether which he had subdued to his purposes was still a constituent part of the world of matter he must discover the spiritual ether and discover also the animating force by which it might be influenced  now he formed a new planto reach the dead by his petitions by the invocation of his own spirit seek me and you shall find me she had said so he sought and called in bitterness and concentration of heart but still he did not find stella did not come  he was in despair she had promised and her promise seemed to be broken then it was that in turning the pages of her diary he came across a passage that had escaped him or which he had forgotten it ran thus  in the result i have learned this that we cannot compel the departed to appear even if they hear us they will not or are not suffered to obey if we would behold them we must create the power of vision in our own natures they are about us always only we cannot see or feel their presence our senses are too gross to succeed we must refine our senses until they acquire an aptitude beyond the natural then without any will or any intervention on their parts we may triumph perhaps even when they do not know that we have triumphed    chapter xxiii  stella comes  now by such arts as are known to those who have studied mysticism in any of its protean forms morris set himself to attempt communication with the unseen in their practice these arts are as superlatively unwholesome as in their result successful or not they are unnatural also they are very ancient the chaldeans knew them and the magicians who stood before pharaoh knew them to the early christian anchorites and to the gnostics they were familiar in one shape or another ancient wonderworkers scandinavian and mediaeval seers modern spiritualists classical interpreters of oracles indian fakirs savage witchdoctors and medicine men all submitted or submit themselves to the yoke of the same rule in the hope of attaining an end which however it may vary in its manifestations is identical in essence  this is the rule to beat down the flesh and its instincts and nurture the spirit its aspirations and powers and this is the endto escape before the time if only partially and at intervals into an atmosphere of vision true or false where human feet were meant to find no road and the trammelled minds of men no point of outlook that such an atmosphere exists even materialists would hesitate to deny for it is proved by the whole history of the moral world and especially by that of the religions of the world their founders their prophets and their exponents many of whom have breathed its ether and pronounced it the very breath of life their feet have walked the difficult path standing on those forbidden peaks they have scanned the dim plains and valleys of the unseen and made report of the dreams and shapes that haunt them then the busy hordes of men beneath for a moment pause to listen and are satisfied  lo here is truth they cry now we may cease from troubling so for a while they rest till others answer nay this is truth our teacher told it us from yonder mountain the only holy hill and yet others fall upon them and slay them shouting neither of these is truth she dwells not among the precipices but in the valley there we have heard her accents  and still from cliff to cliff and along the secret vales echoes the voice of truth and still upon the snowwreathed peaks and across the space of rolling ocean and even among the populous streets of men veiled mysterious and changeful her shape is seen by those who have trained themselves or been inspired to watch and hear but no two see the same shape and no two hear the same voice since to each she wears a different countenance and speaks with another tongue for truth is as the sand of the shore for number and as the infinite hues of the rainbow for variety yet the sand is ground out of one mother rock and all the colours of earth and air are born of a single sun  so practising the ancient rites and mysteries and bowing himself to the ancient law whose primeval principles every man and woman may find graven upon the tablets of their solitary heart morris set himself to find that truth which for him was hid in the invisible soul of stella the soul which he desired to behold and handle even if the touch and sight should slay him  day by day he worked for as many hours as he could make his own at the details of his new experiments these in themselves were interesting and promised even to be fruitful but that was not his object or at any rate his principal object in pursuing them with such an eager passion of research the talk and hazardings which had passed between himself and stella notwithstanding both reason and experience had taught him already that all instruments made by the hand of man were useless to break a way into the dwellings of the departed a day might come when they would enable the inhabitants of the earth to converse with the living denizens of the most distant stars but never never with the dead he laboured because of the frame of thought his toil brought with it but still more that he might be alone that he might be able to point to his soiled hands the shabby clothes which he wore when working with chemicals or at the forge the sheets of paper covered with halffinished and maddening calculations as an excuse why he should not be taken out or worse still dragged from his home to stay for nights or perhaps whole weeks in other places even his wife he felt would relent at the sight of those figures and would fly from the odour of chemicals  in fact mary did both for she hated what she called smells and a place strewn with hot irons and bottles of acids which as she discovered if disturbed burnt both dress and fingers the sight also of algebraic characters pursuing each other across quires of paper like the grotesque forces of some broken impish army filled her indolent mind with a wondering admiration that was akin to fear the man she reflected who could force those cabalistic symbols to reveal anything worth knowing must indeed be a genius and one who deserved not to be disturbed even for a tea party  although she disapproved deeply of these renewed studies such was marys secret thought whether it would have sufficed alone to persuade her to permit them is another matter since her instinct keen and subtle as any of morriss appliances warned her that in them lay danger to her home and happiness but just then as it happened there were other matters to occupy her mind the baby became seriously ill over its teething and other infantile complications following for some weeks it was doubtful whether she would survive  now mary belonged to the class of woman which is generally known as motherly and adored her offspring almost to excess consequently for those weeks she found plenty to think about without troubling herself overmuch as to morris and his experiments for these same reasons perhaps she scarcely noticed seated as she was some distance away at the further end of the long table how very ethereal her husbands appetite had become or that although he took wine as usual it was a mere pretence since he never emptied his glass the most loving of women can scarcely be expected to consider a mans appetite when that of a baby is in question or while the child wastes to take note whether or no its father is losing flesh lastly as regards the hours at which he came to bed being herself a sound sleeper mary had long since ceased to interest herself about them on the wise principle that so long as she was not expected to sit up it was no affair of hers  thus it happened that morris worked and meditated by day and by nightah who that has not tried to climb this difficult and endless jacobs ladder resting upon the earth and losing itself far far away in the blue of heaven above can understand what he did by night but those who have stood even on its lowest rung will guess andfor the rest it does not matter  he advanced he knew that he advanced that the gross wall of sense was wearing thin beneath the attacks of his outthrown soul that even if they were not drawn from time to time the black curtains swung aside in the swift pure breath of his continual prayers moreover the dead drew near to him at moments or he drew near the dead even in his earthly brain he could feel their awful presence as wave by wave soft sweet pulses of impression beat upon him and passed through him through and through him they passed till his brow ached and every nerve of his body tingled as though it had become the receiver of some mysterious current that stirred his blood with what was not akin to it and summoned to his mind strange memories and foresights visions came also that he could not define to slip from his frantic grasp like wet sand through the fingers of a drowning man more and more frequently and with an ever increasing completeness did this unearthly air blowing from a shore no human foot has trod breathe through his being and possess him much as some faint wind which we cannot feel may be seen to possess an aspen tree so that it turns white and shivers when every other natural thing is still and as that aspen turns white and shivers in this thin impalpable air so did his spirit blanch and quiver with joy and dread mingled mysteriously in the cup of his expectant soul  again and again those sweet yet sickening waves flowed over him to leave him shaken and unnerved at first they were rare visitors single clouds floating across his calm coming he knew not whence and vanishing he knew not whither now they drove in upon him like some scud ample yet broken before the wind till at whiles as it were he could not see the face of the friendly human sun then he was like a traveller lost in the mist upon a mountain top sure of nothing feeling precipices about him hearing voices calling him seeing white arms stretched out to lead him yet running forward gladly because amid so many perils a fate was in his feet  now too they came with an actual sense of wind he would wake up at night even by his wifes side and feel this unholy breath blowing icecold on his brow and upon the backs of his outstretched hands yet if he lit a candle it had no power to stir its flame yes while it still blew sharp upon him the flame of the candle did not move then the wind would cease and within him the intangible imponderable power would arise and the voices would speak like the far far murmur of a stream and the thoughts which he could not weigh or interpret would soak into his being like some strange dew and soft soft as falling snow invisible feet would tread the air about him till of a sudden a door in his brain seemed to shut and he woke to the world again  every force is subject to laws even if they were but the emanations of an incipient madness which like all else have their origins destinies and forms these possessing vapours were a force which in time morris whose mind from a lifelong training was scientific and methodical accustomed moreover to struggle for dominion over elements unknown or imperfectly appreciated learned to regulate if not entirely to control their visits were pleasant to him a delight even but to experience this joy to the utmost he discovered that their power must be concentrated that if the full effect was to be produced this moral morphia must be taken in strong doses and at stated intervals sufficient space being allowed between them to give his mental being time to recuperate science has proved that even the molecules of a wire can grow fatigued by the constant passage of electricity or the edge of a razor by too frequent stropping both of them to be effective to do their utmost service must have periods of rest  here then his will came to his aid for he found that by its strong concentrated exertion he was enabled both to shut off the sensations or to excite them another thing he found alsothat after a while it was impossible to do without them for a period the anticipation of their next visit would buoy him up but if it were baulked too long then reaction set in and with it the horrors of the pit  this was the first stage of his insanityor of his vision  dear as such manifestations might be to him in time he wearied of them these hints which but awakened his imagination these fantastic spiced meats which without staying it only sharpened his spiritual appetite more than ever he longed to see and to know to make acquaintance with the actual presence whereof they were but the forerunners the cold blasts that go before the storm the vague mystical draperies which veiled the unearthly goddess at whose shrine he was a worshipper he desired the full fierce fury of the tempest the blinding flash of the lightning the heavy hiss of the rain the rush of the winds bursting on him from the four horizons he desired the naked face of his goddess  and she cameor he acquired the power to see her whichever it might be she came suddenly unexpectedly completely as a goddess should    it was on christmas eve at night the anniversary of stellas death four years before morris and his wife were alone at the abbey as the colonel had gone for a fortnight or so to beaulieu just to keep the house aired as he explained also lady rawlins was there with her husband the eviltempered man who by a single stroke of sickness had been converted into a babbling imbecile harmless as a babe and amused for the most part with such toys as are given to babes she so morris understood had intimated that sir jonah was failing really failing quickly and that in her friendlessness at a foreign place especially at christmas time she would be thankful to have the comfort of an old friends presence this the old friend who having been back from town for a whole month was getting rather bored with monksland and the sick baby determined to vouchsafe explaining that he knew that young married people liked to be left to each other now and again especially when they were worried with domestic troubles lady rawlins was foolish and fat but as the colonel remembered she was fond where indeed could another woman be found who would endure so much scientific discipline and yet be thankful also within a few weeks after the expected demise of jonah she would be wondrous wealthythat he knew therefore it seemed that the matter was worth considerationand a journey to beaulieu  so the colonel went and morris more and more possessed by his monomania was glad that he had gone his absence gave him greater opportunities of loneliness it was now no longer necessary that he should sit at night smoking with his father or rather watching him smoke at the expense of so many precious hours when he should be up and doing  morris and mary dined teteatete that evening but almost immediately after dinner she had gone to the nurseries the baby was now threatened with convulsions and a trained nurse had been installed but as mary did not in the least trust the nurse who according to her account was quite unaccustomed to children she insisted upon dogging that functionarys footsteps therefore morris saw little of her    it was one oclock on christmas morning or more hours ago morris had gone though his rites the ritual that he had invented or discoveredin its essence simple and pathetic enoughwhereby he strove to bring himself to the notice of the dead and to fit himself to see or hear the dead such tentative mysticism as served his turn need not be written down but its substance can be imagined by many then through an exercise of his will he had invoked the strange trancelike state which has been described the soft waves flowing from an unknown source had beat upon his brain and with them came the accustomed phenomena the sense of some presence near impending yet impotent suggesting by analogy and effect the misdirected efforts of a blind person seeking something in a room or the painful attempt of one almost deaf striving to sift out words from a confused murmur of sounds the personality of stella seemed to pervade him yet he could see nothing could hear nothing the impression might be from within not from without perhaps after all it was nothing but a dream a miasma a mirage drawn by his own burning thought from the wastes and marshes of his mind peopled with illusive hopes and waterlogged by memories or it might be true and real as yet he could not be certain of its origin  the fit passed delightful in its overpowering emptiness but unsatisfying as all that had gone before it and left him weak for a while morris crouched by the fire for he had grown cold and could not think accurately then his vital human strength returned and as seemed to him to be fitting upon this night of all nights he began one by one to recall the events of that day four years ago when stella was still a living woman  the scene in the dead church the agonies of farewell he summoned them detail by detail word by word her looks the changes of her expression the movements of her hands and eyes and lips he counted and pictured each precious souvenir the sound of her last sentences also as the blind senseless aerophone had rendered them just before the end one by one they were repeated in his brain there stood the very instrument but alas it was silent now its twin lay buried in the sea with her who had worked it  morris grew weary the effort of memory was exhausting and after it he was glad to think of nothing the fire flickered the clear light of the electric lamps shone upon the hard sixteenthcentury faces of the painted angels in the ancient roof without the wind soughed and through it rose the constant sullen roar of the sea  tired disappointed unhappy and full of selfreproaches for when the madness was not on him he knew his sin morris sank into a doze now music crept softly into his sleep sweet thrilling music causing him to open his eyes and smile it was christmas eve and doubtless he heard the village waifs  morris looked up arousing himself to listen and lo there before him unexpected and ineffable was stella stella as she appeared that night on which she had sung to him just as she finished singing indeed when he stood for a while in the faint moonlight the flame of inspiration still flickering in those dark eyes and the sweet lips drawn down a little as though she were about to weep  the sight did not astonish him at the moment he never imagined even then that this could be her spirit that his long labours in a soil no man was meant to till had issued into harvest surely it was a dream nothing but a dream he felt no tremors no cold wind stirred his hair his heart did not stand still nor his breath come short why should a man fear so beautiful a dream yet vaguely enough he wished that it might last forever for it was sweet to see her soas she had been as she had beenyet was she ever thus surely some wand of change had touched her she was beautiful but had she worn that beauty and those eyes could any such have shone in the face of woman  stella he whispered and from roof and walls crept back the echo of his voice he rose and went towards her she had vanished he returned and there she was  speak he muttered speak but no word came only the lovely changeless eyes shone on and watched him  listen music seemed to float about the room such music as he had never heardeven stella could not make the like the air was full of it the night without was full of it millions of voices took up the chant and from far away note by note mighty organs and silver trumpets told its melody  his brain reeled in the ocean of those unimagined harmonies it was tossed like a straw upon a swirling river tossed and overwhelmed  slowly very slowly as the straw might be sucked into the heart of a whirlpool his soul was drawn down into blackness it shuddered it was afraid this vision of a whirlpool haunted him he could see the narrow funnel of its waters smooth shining like jet unspecked by foam solid to all appearances but as he was aware alive every atom of them instinct with some frightful energy the very face of forceand in the teeth of it less than a dead leaf himself  down he went down and still above him shone the beautiful pitying changeless eyes and still round him echoed that strange searching music the eyes receded the music became faint and thenblackness    chapter xxiv  dreams and the sleep  the christmas day which followed this strange night proved the happiest that morris could ever remember to have spent since his childhood in his worldly circumstances of course he was oppressed by none of the everyday worries which at this season are the lot of mostno duns came to trouble him nor through lack of means was he forced to turn any beggar from his door also the baby was much better and marys spirits were consequently radiant never indeed had she been more lovely and charming than when that morning she presented him with a splendid gold chronometer to take the place of the old silver watch which was his mothers as a girl and that he had worn all his life secretly he sorrowed over parting with that familiar companion in favour of its new eightyguinea rival although it was true that it always lost ten minutes a day and sometimes stopped altogether but there was no help for it so he kissed mary and was grateful  moreover the day was beautiful in the morning they walked to church through the abbey plantations which run for nearly half a mile along the edge of the cliff the rime lay thick upon the pines and firsevery little needle had its separate coat of white whereon the suns rays glistened the quiet sea too shone like some gigantic emerald and in the sweet stillness the song of a robin perched upon the bending bough of a young poplar sounded pure and clear  yet it was not this calm and plenty this glittering ocean flecked with white sails and barred by delicate lines of smoke this blue and happy sky nor all the other good things that were given to him in such abundance which steeped his heart in sabbath rest although he sought no inspiration from such drugs and indeed was a stranger to them rather was his joy the joy of the opiumeater while the poison works the joy of him who after suffering long nights of pain has found their antidote and perhaps for the first time appreciates the worth of peace however empty his troubled heart had ceased its striving his wrecked nerves were still his questionings had been answered his ends were attained he had drunk of the divine cup which he desired and its wine flowed through him the dead had visited him and he had tasted of the delight which lies hid in death on that day he felt as though nothing could hurt him any more nothing could even move him the angry voices the wars the struggles the questioningsall the things which torment mankind what did they matter he had forced the lock and broken the bar if only for a little while the door had opened and he had seen that which he desired to see and sought with all his soul and with the wondrous harvest of this pure inhuman passion that owes nothing to sex or time or earth he was satisfied at last  why did you look so strange in church asked mary as they walked home and her voice echoed in the spaces of his void mind as words echo in an empty hall  his thoughts were wandering far and with difficulty he drew them back as birds tied by the foot are drawn back and still fluttering to be free brought home to the familiar cage  strange dear he answered did i look strange  yes like a man in a dream or the face of a saint being comfortably martyred in a picture morris i believe that you are not well i will speak to the doctor he must give you a tonic or something for your liver really to see you and that old mummy mr fregelius staring at each other while he murmured away about the delights of the world to come and how happy we ought to be at the thought of getting there made me quite uncomfortable  why why dear asked morris vacantly  why because the old man with his pale face and big eyes looked more like an astral body than a healthy human being if i met him in his surplice at night i should think he was a ghost and upon my word you are catching the same expression that comes of your being so much together do be a little more human and healthy lose your temper swear at the cook like your father admire jane roses pretty bonnet or her pretty face take to horseracing do anything that is natural even if it is wicked anything that doesnt make one think of graves and stars and infinities and souls who died last night of all of which no doubt we shall have plenty in due season  all right dear answered morris with a fine access of forced cheerfulness we will have some champagne for dinner and play picquet after it  champagne whats the use of champagne when you only pretend to drink it and fill up the glass with sodawater picquet you hate it and so do i and it is silly losing large sums of money to each other which we never mean to pay that isnt the real thing theres no life in that oh morris if you love me do cultivate some human error it is terrible to have a husband in whom there is nothing to reform  i will try love said morris earnestly  yes she replied with a gloomy shake of the head but you wont succeed when mrs roberts told me the other day that she was afraid her husband was taking to drink because he went out walking too often with that pretty widow from north covethe one with the black and gold bonnet whom they say things abouti answered that i quite envied her and she didnt in the least understand what i meant but i understand although i cant express myself  i give up the drink said morris it disagrees but perhaps you might introduce me to the widow she seems rather attractive  i will answered mary stamping her foot shes a horrid vulgar little thing but ill ask her to tea or to stay and anything if she can only make you look rather less disembodied  that night the champagne appeared and feeling his wifes eyes upon him morris swallowed two whole glasses and in consequence was quite cheerful for he had eaten littlecircumstances under which champagne exhilaratesfor a little while then they went into the drawingroom and talked themselves into silence about nothing in particular after which morris began to wander round the room and contemplate the furniture as though he had never seen it before  what are you fidgeting about asked mary morris you remind me of somebody who wants to slip away to an assignation which in your case is absurd i wish your father were back i really do i should be glad to listen to his worst and longest story it isnt often that i sit with you so it would be kinder if you didnt look so bored im cross im going to bed i hope you will spend a pleasant night in the chapel with your thoughts and your instruments and the ghosts of the old abbots but please come into my room quietly i dont like being woke up after three in the morning as i was yesterday and she went slamming the door behind her  morris went also with hanging head and guilty step to his accustomed haunt in the old chapel he knew that he was doing wrong he could sympathise with marys indignation yet he was unable to resist he must see again must drink once more of that heavenly cup  and he failed was it the champagne was it marys sharp words which had ruffled him was it that he had not allowed enough time for the energy which came from him enabling her to appear before his mortal eyes to gather afresh in the lifesprings of his own nature or was she also angry with him  at least he failed the waves came indeed and the cold wind blew but there was no sound of music and no vision again and again he strove to call it upto fancy that he saw it was useless and at last weary broken but filled with a mad irritation such as might be felt by a hungry man who sees food which he cannot touch or by a jealous lover who beholds her that should have been his bride take another husband before his eyes he crept away to such rest as he could win  he awoke ill wretched and unsatisfied but wisdom had come to him with sleep he must not fail again it was too wearing he must prepare himself according to the rules which he had laid down also he must conciliate his wife so that she did not speak angrily to him and thus disturb his calm of mind broken waters mirror nothing if his soul was to be the glass in which that beloved spirit might appear it must be still and undisturbed if then was she built up in his imagination or did he really see her with his eyes he could not tell and after all it mattered little so long as he did see her  he grew cunningin such circumstances a common symptomaffecting a bonhomie a joviality of demeanour indeed which was rather overdone he suggested that mary should ask some people to tea and twice he went out shooting a sport which he had almost abandoned only when she wanted to invite certain guests to stay he demurred a little on account of the baby but so cleverly that she never suspected him of being insincere in short as he could attain his unholy end in no other way morris entered on a career of mild deception designed to prevent his wife from suspecting him of she knew not what his conduct was that of a man engaged in an intrigue in his case however the possible end of his illdoing was not the divorcecourt but an asylum or so some observers would have anticipated yet did man ever adore a mistress so fatal and destroying as this poor shadow of the dead which he desired  it was not until new years eve that stella came again once more enervated and exhausted by the waves morris sank into a doze whence as before he was awakened by the sound of heavenly music to which on this night was added the scent of perfume then he opened his eyesto behold stella as she had been at first so she was now only more lovelya hundred times lovelier than the imagination can paint or the pen can tell here was nothing pale or deathlike no sheeted melancholy spectre but a radiant being whose garment was the light and whose eyes glowed like the heart of some deep jewel about her rolled a vision of many colours such hues as the rainbow has fell upon her face and about her hair and yet it was the same stella that he had known made perfect and spiritual and beyond all imagining divine  once more he addressedimplored her and once more no answer came nor did her face change or that wondrous smile pass from her lips into the gravity of her eyes this at least was sure either that she no longer had any understanding knowledge of his earthly tongue or that its demonstration was to her a thing forbidden what was she then that double of the body which the egyptians called the ka or the soul itself the preuma no eidolon but the immortal ego clothed in human semblance made divine  why was there no answer because his speech was too gross for her to hearken to why did she not speak because his ears were deaf was this an illusion no a thousand times when he approached she vanished but what of it he was mortal she a spirit they might not mix  yet in her own method she did speak spoke to his soul bidding the scales fall from its eyes so that it might see and it saw what human imagination could not fashion behold those gardens those groves that hang upon the measureless mountain face and the white flowers which droop in tresses from the dark bough of yonder towering poplar tree and the jewelled serpent nestling at its root  oh they are gone and when the flameeyed figure smote the vast barring precipices fall apart and the road is smooth and open  how far a million miles no twenty thousand millions look yonder shines the destined star now come so it is reached nay do not stop to stare look again out through utter space to where the low light glows so come once more the suns float past like windblown golden dustlike the countless lamps of boats upon the bosom of a summer sea there beneath lies the very home of power those springing sparks of light they are the ineffable decrees passing outward through infinity that sound it is the voice of worlds which worship  look now out yonder see the flaming gases gather and cohere they burn out and the great globe blackens cool mists wrap it rains fall seas collect continents arise there is life behold it various and infinite and hearken to the whisper of this great universe one tiny note in that song of praise you heard but now yes the life dies the ball grows black again it is the carcase of a world how long have you watched it for an hour a breath but as you judge time some ten thousand million years sleep now you are weary later you shall understand  thus the wraith of stella spoke to his soul in visions presently with drumming ears and eyes before which strange lights seemed to play morris staggered from the place so weak indeed that he could scarcely thrust one foot before the other yet his heart was filled with a mad joy and his brain was drunken with the deep cup of a delight and a knowledge that have seldom been given to man  on other nights the visions were different thus he saw the spirits of men going out and returning and among them his own slumbering spirit that a vast and shadowy stella bore in her arms as a mother bears a babe  he saw also the vision of numbers all the infinite inhabitants of all the infinite worlds passed before him marching through the ages to some end unknown once too his mind was opened and he understood the explanation of evil and the reason of things he shouted at their glorious simplicityshouted for joy but lo before he rose from his chair they were forgotten  other visions there were without count also they would mix and fall into new patterns like the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope there was no end to them and each was lovelier or grander or fraught with a more sweet entrancement than the last and still she who brought them she who opened his eyes who caused his ears to hear and his soul to see she whom he worshipped his hearts twin she who had sworn herself to him on earth and was there waiting to fulfil the oath to all eternity the woman who had become a spirit that spirit that had taken the shape of a womanthere she stood and smiled and changed and yet was changeless and oh what did it matter if his life was draining from him and oh to die at those glittering feet with that perfumed breath stirring in his hair what did he seek more when death would be the great immortal waking when from twilight he passed out to light what more when in that dawn awful yet smiling she should be his and he hers and they twain would be one with thought that answered thought since it was the same thought    there is much that might be toldenough to fill many pages it would be easy for instance to set out long lists of the entrancing dreams which were the soul speech of the spirit of stella and to some extent to picture them also the progress of the possession of morris might be described and the student of his history shown step by step how the consummation that in her life days stella had feared overtook him how the thing got the mastery of him and he became unfitted for his work on earth how too his body wasted and his spiritual part developed till every physical sight and deed became a cause of irritation to his new nature and at times even a source of active suffering  thus an evil odour the spectacle of pain the cry of grief the sight of the carcases of dead animals to take a few examples out of very many were agonies to his abnormal exasperated nerves nor did it stop there since the misfortune which threatened stella when at length she had succeeded in becoming bodily conscious of the presence of the eidolon of her sister and heard discords among the harmonies of the rich music of her violin overtook him also  thus for instance in the scent of the sweetest rose at times morris would discover something frightful even the guise of tender childhood ceased to be lovely in his eyes for now he could see and feel the budding human brute beneath worse still his beautiful companion mary fair and gracious as she was became almost repulsive to him so that he shrank from her as in common life some delicatenurtured man might shrink from a fullbodied coarsetongued young fishwife even her daily need of food which was healthy though not excessive disgusted him to witnesshe who was out of touch with all wholesome appetites of earth whose distorted nature sought an alien rest and solace  of mary herself also it might be narrated how after first mocking at the thought and next thrusting it away by degrees she grew to appreciate the reality of the mysterious foreign influence which reigned in her home it might be told how in that spiritual atmosphere shedding its sleepy indolence her own spirit awoke and grew conscious and farseeing till impressions and hints which in the old days she would have set aside as idle became for her pregnant with light and meaning then at last her eyes were opened and understanding much and guessing more she began to watch the attitude of the colonel also could be studied and how he grew first suspicious then sarcastic and at last thoroughly alarmed even to his ultimate evacuation of the abbey house detailed at length  but to the chronicler of these doings and of their unusual issues at any rate it appears best to resist a natural temptation to deny the desire to paint such closing scenes in petto much more does this certainty hold of their explanation enough has been said to enable those in whom the spark of understanding may burn to discover by its light how much is left unsaid enough has been hinted at to teach how much there is still to guess at least few will deny that some things are best abandoned to the imagination to attempt to drag the last veil from the face of truth in any of her thousand shapes is surely a folly predoomed to failure from the beginning she has been a veiled divinity and veiled however thinly she must and will remain also even were it possible thus to rob her would not her bared eyes frighten us    it was late very late and there pale and haggard in the low light of the fire once again morris stood pleading with the radiant image which his heart revealed  oh speak speak he moaned aloud i weary of those pictures they are too vast they crush me i grow weak i have no strength left to fight against the power of this fearful life that is discovered i cannot bear this calm everlasting life it sucks out my mortality as mists are sucked up by the sun become human speak let me touch your hand or be angry only cease smiling that awful smile and take those solemn eyes out of my heart oh my darling my darling remember that i am still a man in pity answer me before i die    then a low and awful cry and morris turned to behold mary his wife at last she had seen and heard and read his naked heart at last she knew himmad and in his madness most unfaithfula man who loved one dead and dragged her down to earth for company  look there in his charmed and secret sight stood the spirit and there over against her the mortal woman and hewaveringhe lost between the two    certainly he had been sick a long while since the sunray touched the face of the old abbot carved in that corner of the room to support the hammer beam this as he had known from a child only chanced at midsummer mary was bending over him but he was astonished to find that he could sit up and move surely then his mind must have been more ill than his body  hush she said drink this dear and go to sleep  it was a week after and morris had told her all the kind and gentle wife who was so good to him who understood and could even smile as he explained in faltering shameheavy words and he had sworn for her sake and his childrens sake that he would put away this awful traffic and seek such fellowship no more  nor for six months did he seek it not till the winter returned then when his body was strong again the ravening hunger of his soul overcame him and lest he should go mad or die of longing morris broke his oathas she was sure he would    one night mary missed her husband from her side and creeping down in the grey of the morning she found him sitting in his chair in the chapel workshop smiling strangely but cold and dead then her heart seemed to break for she loved him yet remembering her promises and the dust whereof he was made and the fate to which he had been appointed she forgave him all  the search renewed or the fruit of some fresh discoverywhat he sought or what he saw who knowshad killed him  or perhaps stella had seemed to speak at last and the word he heard her say was come    this then is the end of the story of stella fregelius upon earth and this the writing on a leaf torn from the book of three human destinies remember only one leaf
