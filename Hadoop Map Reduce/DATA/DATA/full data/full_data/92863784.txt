92863784	the parsons daughter of oxney colne  by anthony trollope     the prettiest scenery in all englandand if i am contradicted in that assertion i will say in all europeis in devonshire on the southern and southeastern skirts of dartmoor where the rivers dart and avon and teign form themselves and where the broken moor is half cultivated and the wildlooking upland fields are half moor  in making this assertion i am often met with much doubt but it is by persons who do not really know the locality  men and women talk to me on the matter who have travelled down the line of railway from exeter to plymouth who have spent a fortnight at torquay and perhaps made an excursion from tavistock to the convict prison on dartmoor  but who knows the glories of chagford  who has walked through the parish of manaton  who is conversant with lustleigh cleeves and withycombe in the moor  who has explored holne chase  gentle reader believe me that you will be rash in contradicting me unless you have done these things  there or thereaboutsi will not say by the waters of which little river it is washedis the parish of oxney colne  and for those who wish to see all the beauties of this lovely country a sojourn in oxney colne would be most desirable seeing that the sojourner would then be brought nearer to all that he would wish to visit than at any other spot in the country  but there in an objection to any such arrangement  there are only two decent houses in the whole parish and these areor were when i knew the localitysmall and fully occupied by their possessors  the larger and better is the parsonage in which lived the parson and his daughter and the smaller is a freehold residence of a certain miss le smyrger who owned a farm of a hundred acres which was rented by one farmer cloysey and who also possessed some thirty acres round her own house which she managed herself regarding herself to be quite as great in cream as mr cloysey and altogether superior to him in the article of cyder  but yeu has to pay no rent miss farmer cloysey would say when miss le smyrger expressed this opinion of her art in a manner too defiant  yeu pays no rent or yeu couldnt do it  miss le smyrger was an old maid with a pedigree and blood of her own a hundred and thirty acres of fee simple land on the borders of dartmoor fifty years of age a constitution of iron and an opinion of her own on every subject under the sun  and now for the parson and his daughter  the parsons name was woolsworthyor woolathy as it was pronounced by all those who lived around himthe rev saul woolsworthy and his daughter was patience woolsworthy or miss patty as she was known to the devonshire world of those parts  that name of patience had not been well chosen for her for she was a hottempered damsel warm in her convictions and inclined to express them freely  she had but two closely intimate friends in the world and by both of them this freedom of expression had now been fully permitted to her since she was a child  miss le smyrger and her father were well accustomed to her ways and on the whole well satisfied with them  the former was equally free and equally warmtempered as herself and as mr woolsworthy was allowed by his daughter to be quite paramount on his own subjectfor he had a subjecthe did not object to his daughter being paramount on all others  a pretty girl was patience woolsworthy at the time of which i am writing and one who possessed much that was worthy of remark and admiration had she lived where beauty meets with admiration or where force of character is remarked  but at oxney colne on the borders of dartmoor there were few to appreciate her and it seemed as though she herself had but little idea of carrying her talent further afield so that it might not remain for ever wrapped in a blanket  she was a pretty girl tall end slender with dark eyes and black hair her eyes were perhaps too round for regular beauty and her hair was perhaps too crisp her mouth was large and expressive her nose was finely formed though a critic in female form might have declared it to be somewhat broad  but her countenance altogether was wonderfully attractiveif only it might be seen without that resolution for dominion which occasionally marred it though sometimes it even added to her attractions  it must be confessed on behalf of patience woolsworthy that the circumstances of her life had peremptorily called upon her to exercise dominion  she had lost her mother when she was sixteen and had had neither brother nor sister  she had no neighbours near her fit either from education or rank to interfere in the conduct of her life excepting always miss la smyrger  miss le smyrger would have done anything for her including the whole management of her morals and of the parsonage household had patience been content with such an arrangement  but much as patience had ever loved miss le smyrger she was not content with this and therefore she had been called on to put forth a strong hand of her own  she had put forth this strong hand early and hence had come the character which i am attempting to describe  but i must say on behalf of this girl that it was not only over others that she thus exercised dominion  in acquiring that power she had also acquired the much greater power of exercising rule over herself  but why should her father have been ignored in these family arrangements  perhaps it may almost suffice to say that of all living men her father was the man best conversant with the antiquities of the county in which he lived  he was the jonathan oldbuck of devonshire and especially of dartmoor without that decision of character which enabled oldbuck to keep his womenkind in some kind of subjection and probably enabled him also to see that his weekly bills did not pass their proper limits  our mr oldbuck of oxney colne was sadly deficient in these  as a parish pastor with but a small cure he did his duty with sufficient energy to keep him at any rate from reproach  he was kind and charitable to the poor punctual in his services forbearing with the farmers around him mild with his brother clergymen and indifferent to aught that bishop or archdeacon might think or say of him  i do not name this latter attribute as a virtue but as a fact  but all these points were as nothing in the known character of mr woolsworthy of oxney colne  he was the antiquarian of dartmoor  that was his line of life  it was in that capacity that he was known to the devonshire world it was as such that he journeyed about with his humble carpetbag staying away from his parsonage a night or two at a time it was in that character that he received now and again stray visitors in the single spare bedroomnot friends asked to see him and his girl because of their friendshipbut men who knew something as to this buried stone or that old landmark  in all these things his daughter let him have his own way assisting and encouraging him  that was his line of life and therefore she respected it  but in all other matters she chose to be paramount at the parsonage  mr woolsworthy was a little man who always wore except on sundays grey clothesclothes of so light a grey that they would hardly have been regarded as clerical in a district less remote  he had now reached a goodly age being full seventy years old but still he was wiry and active and showed but few symptoms of decay  his head was bald and the few remaining locks that surrounded it were nearly white but there was a look of energy about his mouth and a humour in his light grey eye which forbade those who knew him to regard him altogether as an old man  as it was he could walk from oxney colne to priestown fifteen long devonshire miles across the moor and he who could do that could hardly be regarded as too old for work  but our present story will have more to do with his daughter than with him  a pretty girl i have said was patience woolsworthy and one too in many ways remarkable  she had taken her outlook into life weighing the things which she had and those which she had not in a manner very unusual and as a rule not always desirable for a young lady  the things which she had not were very many  she had not society she had not a fortune she had not any assurance of future means of livelihood she had not high hope of procuring for herself a position in life by marriage she had not that excitement and pleasure in life which she read of in such books as found their way down to oxney colne parsonage  it would be easy to add to the list of the things which she had not and this list against herself she made out with the utmost vigour  the things which she had or those rather which she assured herself of having were much more easily counted she had the birth and education of a lady the strength of a healthy woman and a will of her own  such was the list as she made it out for herself and i protest that i assert no more than the truth in saying that she never added to it either beauty wit or talent  i began these descriptions by saying that oxney colne would of all places be the best spot from which a tourist could visit those parts of devonshire but for the fact that he could obtain there none of the accommodation which tourists require  a brother antiquarian might perhaps in those days have done so seeing that there was as i have said a spare bedroom at the parsonage  any intimate friend of miss le smyrgers might be as fortunate for she was equally well provided at oxney combe by which name her house was known  but miss le smyrger was not given to extensive hospitality and it was only to those who were bound to her either by ties of blood or of very old friendship that she delighted to open her doors  as her old friends were very few in number as those few lived at a distance and as her nearest relations were higher in the world than she was and were said by herself to look down upon her the visits made to oxney combe were few and far between  but now at the period of which i am writing such a visit was about to be made  miss le smyrger had a younger sister who had inherited a property in the parish of oxney colne equal to that of the lady who now lived there but this the younger sister had inherited beauty also and she therefore in early life had found sundry lovers one of whom became her husband  she had married a man even then well to do in the world but now rich and almost mighty a member of parliament a lord of this and that board a man who had a house in eaton square and a park in the north of england and in this way her course of life had been very much divided from that of our miss le smyrger  but the lord of the government board had been blessed with various children and perhaps it was now thought expedient to look after aunt penelopes devonshire acres  aunt penelope was empowered to leave them to whom she pleased and though it was thought in eaton square that she must as a matter of course leave them to one of the family nevertheless a little cousinly intercourse might make the thing more certain  i will not say that this was the sole cause of such a visit but in these days a visit was to be made by captain broughton to his aunt  now captain john broughton was the second son of alfonso broughton of clapham park and eaton square member of parliament and lord of the aforesaid government board  and what do you mean to do with him patience woolsworthy asked of miss le smyrger when that lady walked over from the combe to say that her nephew john was to arrive on the following morning  do with him  why i shall bring him over here to talk to your father  hell be too fashionable for that and papa wont trouble his head about him if he finds that he doesnt care for dartmoor  then he may fall in love with you my dear  well yes theres that resource at any rate and for your sake i dare say i should be more civil to him than papa  but hell soon get tired of making love and what youll do then i cannot imagine  that miss woolsworthy felt no interest in the coming of the captain i will not pretend to say  the advent of any stranger with whom she would be called on to associate must be matter of interest to her in that secluded place and she was not so absolutely unlike other young ladies that the arrival of an unmarried young man would be the same to her as the advent of some patriarchal paterfamilias  in taking that outlook into life of which i have spoken she had never said to herself that she despised those things from which other girls received the excitement the joys and the disappointment of their lives  she had simply given herself to understand that very little of such things would come her way and that it behoved her to liveto live happily if such might be possiblewithout experiencing the need of them  she had heard when there was no thought of any such visit to oxney colne that john broughton was a handsome clever manone who thought much of himself and was thought much of by othersthat there had been some talk of his marrying a great heiress which marriage however had not taken place through unwillingness on his part and that he was on the whole a man of more mark in the world than the ordinary captain of ordinary regiments  captain broughton came to oxney combe stayed there a fortnightthe intended period for his projected visit having been fixed at three or four daysand then went his way  he went his way back to his london haunts the time of the year then being the close of the easter holidays but as he did so he told his aunt that he should assuredly return to her in the autumn  and assuredly i shall be happy to see you johnif you come with a certain purpose  if you have no such purpose you had better remain away  i shall assuredly come the captain had replied and then he had gone on his journey  the summer passed rapidly by and very little was said between miss le smyrger and miss woolsworthy about captain broughton  in many respectsnay i may say as to all ordinary matters no two women could well be more intimate with each other than they wereand more than that they had the courage each to talk to the other with absolute truth as to things concerning themselvesa courage in which dear friends often fail  but nevertheless very little was said between them about captain john broughton  all that was said may be here repeated  john says that he shall return here in august miss le smyrger said as patience was sitting with her in the parlour at oxney combe on the morning after that gentlemans departure  he told me so himself said patience and as she spoke her round dark eyes assumed a look of more than ordinary selfwill  if miss le smyrger had intended to carry the conversation any further she changed her mind as she looked at her companion  then as i said the summer ran by and towards the close of the warm days of july miss le smyrger sitting in the same chair in the same room again took up the conversation  i got a letter from john this morning  he says that he shall be here on the third  does he  he is very punctual to the time he named  yes i fancy that he is a punctual man said patience  i hope that you will be glad to see him said miss le smyrger  very glad to see him said patience with a bold clear voice and then the conversation was again dropped and nothing further was said till after captain broughtons second arrival in the parish  four months had then passed since his departure and during that time miss woolsworthy had performed all her usual daily duties in their accustomed course  no one could discover that she had been less careful in her household matters than had been her wont less willing to go among her poor neighbours or less assiduous in her attentions to her father  but not the less was there a feeling in the minds of those around her that some great change had come upon her  she would sit during the long summer evenings on a certain spot outside the parsonage orchard at the top of a small sloping field in which their solitary cow was always pastured with a book on her knees before her but rarely reading  there she would sit with the beautiful view down to the winding river below her watching the setting sun and thinking thinking thinkingthinking of something of which she had never spoken  often would miss le smyrger come upon her there and sometimes would pass by her even without a word but nevernever once did she dare to ask her of the matter of her thoughts  but she knew the matter well enough  no confession was necessary to inform her that patience woolsworthy was in love with john broughtonay in love to the full and entire loss of her whole heart  on one evening she was so sitting till the july sun had fallen and hidden himself for the night when her father came upon her as he returned from one of his rambles on the moor  patty he said you are always sitting there now  is it not late  will you not be cold  no papa said she i shall not be cold  but wont you come to the house  i miss you when you come in so late that theres no time to say a word before we go to bed  she got up and followed him into the parsonage and when they were in the sittingroom together and the door was closed she came up to him and kissed him  papa she said would it make you very unhappy if i were to leave you  leave me he said startled by the serious and almost solemn tone of her voice  do you mean for always  if i were to marry papa  oh marry  no that would not make me unhappy  it would make me very happy patty to see you married to a man you would lovevery very happy though my days would be desolate without you  that is it papa  what would you do if i went from you  what would it matter patty  i should be free at any rate from a load which often presses heavy on me now  what will you do when i shall leave you  a few more years and all will be over with me  but who is it love  has anybody said anything to you  it was only an idea papa  i dont often think of such a thing but i did think of it then  and so the subject was allowed to pass by this had happened before the day of the second arrival had been absolutely fixed and made known to miss woolsworthy  and then that second arrival took place  the reader may have understood from the words with which miss le smyrger authorised her nephew to make his second visit to oxney combe that miss woolsworthys passion was not altogether unauthorised  captain broughton had been told that he was not to come unless he came with a certain purpose and having been so told he still persisted in coming  there can be no doubt but that he well understood the purport to which his aunt alluded  i shall assuredly come he had said  and true to his word he was now there  patience knew exactly the hour at which he must arrive at the station at newton abbot and the time also which it would take to travel over those twelve uphill miles from the station to oxney  it need hardly he said that she paid no visit to miss le smyrgers house on that afternoon but she might have known something of captain broughtons approach without going thither  his road to the combe passed by the parsonagegate and had patience sat even at her bedroom window she must have seen him  but on such a morning she would not sit at her bedroom windowshe would do nothing which would force her to accuse herself of a restless longing for her lovers coming  it was for him to seek her  if he chose to do so he knew the way to the parsonage  miss le smyrgergood dear honest hearty miss le smyrger was in a fever of anxiety on behalf of her friend  it was not that she wished her nephew to marry patienceor rather that she had entertained any such wish when he first cameamong them  she was not given to match making and moreover thought or had thought within herself that they of oxney colne could do very well without any admixture from eaton square  her plan of life had been that when old mr woolsworthy was taken away from dartmoor patience should live with her and that when she also shuffled off her coil then patience woolsworthy should be the maiden mistress of oxney combeof oxney combe and mr cloyseys farm to the utter detriment of all the broughtons  such had been her plan before nephew john had come among thema plan not to be spoken of till the coming of that dark day which should make patience an orphan  but now her nephew had been there and all was to be altered  miss le smyrgers plan would have provided a companion for her old age but that had not been her chief object  she had thought more of patience than of herself and now it seemed that a prospect of a higher happiness was opening for her friend  john she said as soon as the first greetings were over do you remember the last words that i said to you before you went away  now for myself i much admire miss le smyrgers heartiness but i do not think much of her discretion  it would have been better perhaps had she allowed things to take their course  i cant say that i do said the captain  at the same time the captain did remember very well what those last words had been  i am so glad to see you so delighted to see you ififif  and then she paused for with all her courage she hardly dared to ask her nephew whether he had come there with the express purpose of asking miss woolsworthy to marry him  to tell the truth for there is no room for mystery within the limits of this short storyto tell i say at a word the plain and simple truth captain broughton had already asked that question  on the day before he left oxney come he had in set terms proposed to the parsons daughter and indeed the words the hot and frequent words which previously to that had fallen like sweetest honey into the ears of patience woolsworthy had made it imperative on him to do so  when a man in such a place as that has talked to a girl of love day after day must not he talk of it to some definite purpose on the day on which he leaves her  or if he do not must he not submit to be regarded as false selfish and almost fraudulent  captain broughton however had asked the question honestly and truly  he had done so honestly and truly but in words or perhaps simply with a tone that had hardly sufficed to satisfy the proud spirit of the girl he loved  she by that time had confessed to herself that she loved him with all her heart but she had made no such confession to him  to him she had spoken no word granted no favour that any lover might rightfully regard as a token of love returned  she had listened to him as he spoke and bade him keep such sayings for the drawingrooms of his fashionable friends then he had spoken out and had asked for that handnot perhaps as a suitor tremulous with hopebut as a rich man who knows that he can command that which he desires to purchase  you should think more of this she had said to him at last  if you would really have me for your wife it will not be much to you to return here again when time for thinking of it shall have passed by with these words she had dismissed him and now he had again come back to oxney colne  but still she would not place herself at the window to look for him nor dress herself in other than her simple morning country dress nor omit one item of her daily work  if he wished to take her at all he should wish to take her as she really was in her plain country life but he should take her also with full observance of all those privileges which maidens are allowed to claim from their lovers  he should contract no ceremonious observance because she was the daughter of a poor country parson who would come to him without a shilling whereas he stood high in the worlds books  he had asked her to give him all that she had and that all she was ready to give without stint  but the gift must be valued before it could be given or received he also was to give her as much and she would accept it as beyond all price  but she would not allow that that which was offered to her was in any degree the more precious because of his outward worldly standing  she would not pretend to herself that she thought he would come to her that day and therefore she busied herself in the kitchen and about the house giving directions to her two maids as though the afternoon would pass as all other days did pass in that household  they usually dined at four and she rarely in these summer months went far from the house before that hour  at four precisely she sat down with her father and then said that she was going up as far as helpholme after dinner helpholme was a solitary farmhouse in another parish on the border of the moor and mr woolsworthy asked her whether he should accompany her  do papa she said if you are not too tired  and yet she had thought how probable it might be that she should meet john broughton on her walk  and so it was arranged but just as dinner was over mr woolsworthy remembered himself  gracious me he said how my memory is going  gribbles from ivybridge and old john poulter from bovey are coming to meet here by appointment  you cant put helpholme off till tomorrow  patience however never put off anything and therefore at six oclock when her father had finished his slender modicum of toddy she tied on her hat and went on her walk  she started with a quick step and left no word to say by which route she would go  as she passed up along the little lane which led towards oxney combe she would not even look to see if he was coming towards her and when she left the road passing over a stone stile into a little path which ran first through the upland fields and then across the moor ground towards helpholme she did not look back once or listen for his coming step  she paid her visit remaining upwards of an hour with the old bedridden mother of the tenant of helpholme  god bless you my darling said the old woman as she left her and send you some one to make your own path bright and happy through the world  these words were still ringing in her ears with all their significance as she saw john broughton waiting for her at the first stile which she had to pass after leaving the farmers haggard   patty he said as he took her hand and held it close within both his own what a chase i have had after you   and who asked you captain broughton she answered smiling  if the journey was too much for your poor london strength could you not have waited till tomorrow morning when you would have found me at the parsonage  but she did not draw her hand away from him or in any way pretend that he had not a right to accost her as a lover  no i could not wait  i am more eager to see those i love than you seem to be  how do you know whom i love or how eager i might be to see them there is an old woman there whom i love and i have thought nothing of this walk with the object of seeing her  and now slowly drawing her hand away from him she pointed to the farmhouse which she had left  patty he said after a minutes pause during which she had looked full into his face with all the force of her bright eyes i have come from london today straight down here to oxney and from my aunts house close upon your footsteps after you to ask you that one questiondo you love me  what a hercules she said again laughing  do you really mean that you left london only this morning  why you must have been five hours in a railway carriage and two in a postchaise not to talk of the walk afterwards  you ought to take more care of yourself captain broughton  he would have been angry with herfor he did not like to be quizzed had she not put her hand on his arm as she spoke and the softness of her touch had redeemed the offence of her words  all that i have done said he that i may hear one word from you  that any word of mine should have such potency  but let us walk on or my father will take us for some of the standing stones of the moor how have you found your aunt  if you only knew the cares that have sat on her dear shoulders for the last week past in order that your high mightiness might have a sufficiency to eat and drink in these desolate halfstarved regions  she might have saved herself such anxiety  no one can care less for such things than i do  and yet i think i have heard you boast of the cook of your club  and then again there was silence for a minute or two  patty said he stopping again in the path answer my question  i have a right to demand an answer  do you love me  and what if i do  what if i have been so silly as to allow your perfections to be too many for my weak heart  what then captain broughton  it cannot be that you love me or you would not joke now  perhaps not indeed she said  it seemed as though she were resolved not to yield an inch in her own humour  and then again they walked on  patty he said once more i shall get an answer from you tonight this evening now during this walk or i shall return tomorrow and never revisit this spot again  oh captain broughton how should we ever manage to live without you  very well he said up to the end of this walk i can hear it all and one word spoken then will mend it all  during the whole of this time she felt that she was illusing him  she knew that she loved him with all her heart that it would nearly kill her to part with him that she had heard his renewed offer with an ecstacy of joy  she acknowledged to herself that he was giving proof of his devotion as strong as any which a girl could receive from her lover  and yet she could hardly bring herself to say the word he longed to hear  that word once said and then she knew that she must succumb to her love for ever  that word once said and there would be nothing for her but to spoil him with her idolatry  that word once said and she must continue to repeat it into his ears till perhaps he might be tired of hearing it  and now he had threatened her and how could she speak after that  she certainly would not speak it unless he asked her again without such threat  and so they walked on in silence  patty he said at last  by the heavens above us you shall answer me  do you love me  she now stood still and almost trembled as she looked up into his face  she stood opposite to him for a moment and then placing her two hands on his shoulders she answered him  i do i do i do she said with all my heart with all my heartwith all my heart and strength  and then her head fell upon his breast      captain broughton was almost as much surprised as delighted by the warmth of the acknowledgment made by the eagerhearted passionate girl whom he now held within his arms  she had said it now the words had been spoken and there was nothing for her but to swear to him over and over again with her sweetest oaths that those words were truetrue as her soul  and very sweet was the walk down from thence to the parsonage gate  he spoke no more of the distance of the ground or the length of his days journey  but he stopped her at every turn that he might press her arm the closer to his own that he might look into the brightness of her eyes and prolong his hour of delight  there were no more gibes now on her tongue no raillery at his london finery no laughing comments on his coming and going  with downright honesty she told him everything  how she had loved him before her heart was warranted in such a passion how with much thinking she had resolved that it would be unwise to take him at his first word and had thought it better that he should return to london and then think over it how she had almost repented of her courage when she had feared during those long summer days that he would forget her and how her heart had leapt for joy when her old friend had told her that he was coming  and yet said he you were not glad to see me  oh was i not glad  you cannot understand the feelings of a girl who has lived secluded as i have done  glad is no word for the joy i felt but it was not seeing you that i cared for so much  it was the knowledge that you were near me once again  i almost wish now that i had not seen you till tomorrow  but as she spoke she pressed his arm and this caress gave the lie to her last words  no do not come in tonight she said when she reached the little wicket that led up to the parsonage  indeed you shall not  i could not behave myself properly if you did  but i dont want you to behave properly  oh  i am to keep that for london am i  but nevertheless captain broughton i will not invite you either to tea or to supper tonight  surely i may shake hands with your father  not tonightnot tilljohn i may tell him may i not  i must tell him at once  certainly said he  and then you shall see him tomorrow  let me seeat what hour shall i bid you come  to breakfast  no indeed  what on earth would your aunt do with her broiled turkey and the cold pie  i have got no cold pie for you  i hate cold pie  what a pity  but john i should be forced to leave you directly after breakfast  come downcome down at two or three and then i will go back with you to aunt penelope  i must see her tomorrow and so at last the matter was settled and the happy captain as he left her was hardly resisted in his attempt to press her lips to his own  when she entered the parlour in which her father was sitting there still were gribbles and poulter discussing some knotty point of devon lore  so patience took off her hat and sat herself down waiting till they should go  for full an hour she had to wait and then gribbles and poulter did go  but it was not in such matters as this that patience woolsworthy was impatient  she could wait and wait and wait curbing herself for weeks and months while the thing waited for was in her eyes good but she could not curb her hot thoughts or her hot words when things came to be discussed which she did not think to be good  papa she said when gribbles longdrawn last word had been spoken at the door  do you remember how i asked you the other day what you would say if i were to leave you  yes surely he replied looking up at her in astonishment  i am going to leave you now she said  dear dearest father how am i to go from you  going to leave me said he thinking of her visit to helpholme and thinking of nothing else  now there had been a story about helpholme  that bedridden old lady there had a stalwart son who was now the owner of the helpholme pastures  but though owner in fee of all those wild acres and of the cattle which they supported he was not much above the farmers around him either in manners or education  he had his merits however for he was honest welltodo in the world and modest withal  how strong love had grown up springing from neighbourly kindness between our patience and his mother it needs not here to tell but rising from it had come another loveor an ambition which might have grown to love the young man after much thought had not dared to speak to miss woolsworthy but he had sent a message by miss le smyrger  if there could be any hope for him he would present himself as a suitoron trial  he did not owe a shilling in the world and had money by him saved  he wouldnt ask the parson for a shilling of fortune  such had been the tenor of his message and miss le smyrger had delivered it faithfully  he does not mean it patience had said with her stern voice  indeed he does my dear  you may be sure he is in earnest miss le smyrger had replied and there is not an honester man in these parts  tell him said patience not attending to the latter portion of her friends last speech that it cannot bemake him understand you knowand tell him also that the matter shall be thought of no more the matter had at any rate been spoken of no more but the young farmer still remained a bachelor and helpholme still wanted a mistress  but all this came back upon the parsons mind when his daughter told him that she was about to leave him  yes dearest she said and as she spoke she now knelt at his knees i have been asked in marriage and i have given myself away  well my love if you will be happy  i hope i shall i think i shall  but you papa  you will not be far from us  oh yes in london  in london  captain broughton lives in london generally  and has captain broughton asked you to marry him  yes papawho else  is he not good  will you not love him  oh papa do not say that i am wrong to love him  he never told her his mistake or explained to her that he had not thought it possible that the highplaced son of the london great man should have fallen in love with his undowered daughter but he embraced her and told her with all his enthusiasm that he rejoiced in her joy and would be happy in her happiness  my own patty he said i have ever known that you were too good for this life of ours here and then the evening wore away into the night with many tears but still with much happiness  captain broughton as he walked back to oxney combe made up his mind that he would say nothing on the matter to his aunt till the next morning  he wanted to think over it all and to think it over if possible by himself  he had taken a step in life the most important that a man is ever called on to take and he had to reflect whether or no he had taken it with wisdom  have you seen her said miss le smyrger very anxiously when he came into the drawingroom  miss woolsworthy you mean said he  yes ive seen her  as i found her out i took a long walk and happened to meet her  do you know aunt i think ill go to bed i was up at five this morning and have been on the move ever since  miss le smyrger perceived that she was to hear nothing that evening so she handed him his candlestick and allowed him to go to his room  but captain broughton did not immediately retire to bed nor when he did so was he able to sleep at once  had this step that he had taken been a wise one  he was not a man who in worldly matters had allowed things to arrange themselves for him as is the case with so many men he had formed views for himself and had a theory of life  money for moneys sake he had declared to himself to be bad  money as a concomitant to things which were in themselves good he had declared to himself to be good also  that concomitant in this affair of his marriage he had now missed  well he had made up his mind to that and would put up with the loss  he had means of living of his own the means not so extensive as might have been desirable  that it would be well for him to become a married man looking merely to the state of life as opposed to his present state he had fully resolved  on that point therefore there was nothing to repent  that patty woolsworthy was good affectionate clever and beautiful he was sufficiently satisfied  it would be odd indeed if he were not so satisfied now seeing that for the last four months he had so declared to himself daily with many inward asseverations  and yet though he repeated now again that he was satisfied i do not think that he was so fully satisfied of it as he had been throughout the whole of those four months  it is sad to say so but i feari fear that such was the case  when you have your plaything how much of the anticipated pleasure vanishes especially if it be won easily  he had told none of his family what were his intentions in this second visit to devonshire and now he had to bethink himself whether they would be satisfied  what would his sister say she who had married the honourable augustus gumbleton goldstickinwaiting to her majestys privy council  would she receive patience with open arms and make much of her about london  and then how far would london suit patience or would patience suit london  there would be much for him to do in teaching her and it would be well for him to set about the lesson without loss of time  so far he got that night but when the morning came he went a step further and began mentally to criticise her manner to himself  it had been very sweet that warm that full that ready declaration of love  yes it had been very sweet butbut when after her little jokes she did confess her love had she not been a little too free for feminine excellence  a man likes to be told that he is loved but he hardly wishes that the girl he is to marry should fling herself at his head  ah me yes it was thus he argued to himself as on that morning he went through the arrangements of his toilet  then he was a brute you say my pretty reader  i have never said that he was not a brute  but this i remark that many such brutes are to be met with in the beaten paths of the worlds highway  when patience woolsworthy had answered him coldly bidding him go back to london and think over his love while it seemed from her manner that at any rate as yet she did not care for him while he was absent from her and therefore longing for her the possession of her charms her talent and bright honesty of purpose had seemed to him a thing most desirable  now they were his own  they had in fact been his own from the first  the heart of this countrybred girl had fallen at the first word from his mouth had she not so confessed to him  she was very nicevery nice indeed he loved her dearly  but had he not sold himself too cheaply  i by no means say that he was not a brute  but whether brute or no he was an honest man and had no remotest dream either then on that morning or during the following days on which such thoughts pressed more quickly on his mindof breaking away from his pledged word  at breakfast on that morning he told all to miss le smyrger and that lady with warm and gracious intentions confided to him her purpose regarding her property  i have always regarded patience as my heir she said and shall do so still  oh indeed said captain broughton  but it is a great great pleasure to me to think that she will give back the little property to my sisters child  you will have your mothers and thus it will all come together again  ah said captain broughton  he had his own ideas about property and did not even under existing circumstances like to hear that his aunt considered herself at liberty to leave the acres away to one who was by blood quite a stranger to the family  does patience know of this he asked  not a word said miss le smyrger  and then nothing more was said upon the subject  on that afternoon he went down and received the parsons benediction and congratulations with a good grace  patience said very little on the occasion and indeed was absent during the greater part of the interview  the two lovers then walked up to oxney combe and there were more benedictions and more congratulations  all went merry as a marriage bell at any rate as far as patience was concerned  not a word had yet fallen from that dear mouth not a look had yet come over that handsome face which tended in any way to mar her bliss  her first day of acknowledged love was a day altogether happy and when she prayed for him as she knelt beside her bed there was no feeling in her mind that any fear need disturb her joy  i will pass over the next three or four days very quickly merely saying that patience did not find them so pleasant as that first day after her engagement  there was something in her lovers manner something which at first she could not definewhich by degrees seemed to grate against her feelings  he was sufficiently affectionate that being a matter on which she did not require much demonstration but joined to his affection there seemed to be she hardly liked to suggest to herself a harsh word but could it be possible that he was beginning to think that she was not good enough for him  and then she asked herself the questionwas she good enough for him  if there were doubt about that the match should be broken off though she tore her own heart out in the struggle  the truth however was thisthat he had begun that teaching which he had already found to be so necessary  now had any one essayed to teach patience german or mathematics with that young ladys free consent i believe that she would have been found a meek scholar  but it was not probable that she would be meek when she found a selfappointed tutor teaching her manners and conduct without her consent  so matters went on for four or five days and on the evening of the fifth day captain broughton and his aunt drank tea at the parsonage nothing very especial occurred but as the parson and miss la smyrger insisted on playing backgammon with devoted perseverance during the whole evening broughton had a good opportunity of saying a word or two about those changes in his ladylove which a life in london would requireand some word he said alsosome single slight word as to the higher station in life to which he would exalt his bride  patience bore itfor her father and miss la smyrger were in the roomshe bore it well speaking no syllable of anger and enduring for the moment the implied scorn of the old parsonage  then the evening broke up and captain broughton walked back to oxney combe with his aunt  patty her father said to her before they went to bed he seems to me to be a most excellent young man  dear papa she answered kissing him and terribly deep in love said mr woolsworthy  oh i dont know about that she answered as she left him with her sweetest smile but though she could thus smile at her fathers joke she had already made up her mind that there was still something to be learned as to her promised husband before she could place herself altogether in his hands  she would ask him whether he thought himself liable to injury from this proposed marriage and though he should deny any such thought she would know from the manner of his denial what his true feelings were  and he too on that night during his silent walk with miss le smyrger had entertained some similar thoughts  i fear she is obstinate he said to himself and then he had half accused her of being sullen also  if that be her temper what a life of misery i have before me  have you fixed a day yet his aunt asked him as they came near to her house  no not yet i dont know whether it will suit me to fix it before i leave  why it was but the other day you were in such a hurry  ahyesi have thought more about it since then  i should have imagined that this would depend on what patty thinks said miss le smyrger standing up for the privileges of her sex  it is presumed that the gentleman is always ready as soon as the lady will consent  yes in ordinary cases it is so but when a girl is taken out of her own sphere  her own sphere  let me caution you master john not to talk to patty about her own sphere  aunt penelope as patience is to be my wife and not yours i must claim permission to speak to her on such subjects as may seem suitable to me  and then they partednot in the best humour with each other  on the following day captain broughton and miss woolsworthy did not meet till the evening  she had said before those few illomened words had passed her lovers lips that she would probably be at miss le smyrgers house on the following morning  those illomened words did pass her lovers lips and then she remained at home  this did not come from sullenness nor even from anger but from a conviction that it would be well that she should think much before she met him again nor was he anxious to hurry a meeting  his thoughthis base thought was this that she would be sure to come up to the combe after him but she did not come and therefore in the evening he went down to her and asked her to walk with him  they went away by the path that led to helpholme and little was said between them till they had walked some mile together  patience as she went along the path remembered almost to the letter the sweet words which had greeted her ears as she came down that way with him on the night of his arrival but he remembered nothing of that sweetness then  had he not made an ass of himself during these last six months  that was the thought which very much had possession of his mind  patience he said at last having hitherto spoken only an indifferent word now and again since they had left the parsonage patience 1 hope you realise the importance of the step which you and i are about to take  of course i do she answered  what an odd question that is for you to ask  because said he sometimes i almost doubt it  it seems to me as though you thought you could remove yourself from here to your new home with no more trouble than when you go from home up to the combe  is that meant for a reproach john  no not for a reproach but for advice  certainly not for a reproach  i am glad of that  but i should wish to make you think how great is the leap in the world which you are about to take  then again they walked on for many steps before she answered him  tell me then john she said when she had sufficiently considered what words she should speak and as she spoke a bright colour suffused her face and her eyes flashed almost with anger  what leap do you mean  do you mean a leap upwards  well yes i hope it will be so  in one sense certainly it would be a leap upwards  to be the wife of the man i loved to have the privilege of holding his happiness in my hand to know that i was his ownthe companion whom he had chosen out of all the worldthat would indeed be a leap upwards a leap almost to heaven if all that were so  but if you mean upwards in any other sense  i was thinking of the social scale  then captain broughton your thoughts were doing me dishonour  doing you dishonour  yes doing me dishonour  that your father is in the worlds esteem a greater man than mine is doubtless true enough  that you as a man are richer than i am as a woman is doubtless also true  but you dishonour me and yourself also if these things can weigh with you now  patiencei think you can hardly know what words you are saying to me  pardon me but i think i do  nothing that you can give meno gifts of that descriptioncan weigh aught against that which i am giving you  if you had all the wealth and rank of the greatest lord in the land it would count as nothing in such a scale  ifas i have not doubtedif in return for my heart you have given me yours thenthen then you have paid me fully  but when gifts such as those are going nothing else can count even as a makeweight  i do not quite understand you he answered after a pause  i fear you are a little highflown  and then while the evening was still early they walked back to the parsonage almost without another word  captain broughton at this time had only one full day more to remain at oxney colne  on the afternoon following that he was to go as far as exeter and thence return to london  of course it was to be expected that the wedding day would be fixed before he went and much had been said about it during the first day or two of his engagement  then he had pressed for an early time and patience with a girls usual diffidence had asked for some little delay  but now nothing was said on the subject and how was it probable that such a matter could be settled after such a conversation as that which i have related  that evening miss le smyrger asked whether the day had been fixed  no said captain broughton harshly nothing has been fixed  but it will be arranged before you go  probably not he said and then the subject was dropped for the time  john she said just before she went to bed if there be anything wrong between you and patience i conjure you to tell me  you had better ask her he replied  i can tell you nothing  on the following morning he was much surprised by seeing patience on the gravel path before miss le smyrgers gate immediately after breakfast  he went to the door to open it for her and she as she gave him her hand told him that she came up to speak to him  there was no hesitation in her manner nor any look of anger in her face but there was in her gait and form in her voice and countenance a fixedness of purpose which he had never seen before or at any rate had never acknowledged  certainly said he  shall i come out with you or will you come up stairs  we can sit down in the summerhouse she said and thither they both went  captain broughton she saidand she began her task the moment that they were both seatedyou and i have engaged ourselves as man and wife but perhaps we have been over rash  how so said he  it may beand indeed i will say moreit is the case that we have made this engagement without knowing enough of each others character  i have not thought so  the time will perhaps come when you will so think but for the sake of all that we most value let it come before it is too late  what would be our fatehow terrible would be our miseryif such a thought should come to either of us after we have linked our lots together  there was a solemnity about her as she thus spoke which almost repressed himwhich for a time did prevent him from taking that tone of authority which on such a subject he would choose to adopt  but he recovered himself  i hardly think that this comes well from you he said  from whom else should it come  who else can fight my battle for me and john who else can fight that same battle on your behalf  i tell you this that with your mind standing towards me as it does stand at present you could not give me your hand at the altar with true words and a happy conscience  am i not true  you have half repented of your bargain already  is it not so  he did not answer her but getting up from his seat walked to the front of the summerhouse and stood there with his back turned upon her  it was not that he meant to be ungracious but in truth he did not know how to answer her  he had half repented of his bargain  john she said getting up and following him so that she could put her hand upon his arm i have been very angry with you  angry with me he said turning sharp upon her  yes angry with you  you would have treated me like a child  but that feeling has gone now  i am not angry now  there is my handthe hand of a friend  let the words that have been spoken between us be as though they had not been spoken  let us both be free  do you mean it  certainly i mean it  as she spoke these words her eyes filled with tears in spite of all the efforts she could make but he was not looking at her and her efforts had sufficed to prevent any sob from being audible  with all my heart he said and it was manifest from his tone that he had no thought of her happiness as he spoke  it was true that she had been angry with himangry as she had herself declared but nevertheless in what she had said and what she had done she had thought more of his happiness than of her own  now she was angry once again  with all your heart captain broughton  well so be it  if with all your heart then is the necessity so much the greater  you go to morrow  shall we say farewell now  patience i am not going to be lectured  certainly not by me  shall we say farewell now  yes if you are determined  i am determined  farewell captain broughton  you have all my wishes for your happiness  and she held out her hand to him  patience he said  and he looked at her with a dark frown as though he would strive to frighten her into submission  if so he might have saved himself any such attempt  farewell captain broughton  give me your hand for i cannot stay he gave her his hand hardly knowing why he did so  she lifted it to her lips and kissed it and then leaving him passed from the summer house down through the wicketgate and straight home to the parsonage  during the whole of that day she said no word to any one of what had occurred  when she was once more at home she went about her household affairs as she had done on that day of his arrival  when she sat down to dinner with her father he observed nothing to make him think that she was unhappy nor during the evening was there any expression in her face or any tone in her voice which excited his attention  on the following morning captain broughton called at the parsonage and the servantgirl brought word to her mistress that he was in the parlour but she would not see him  laws miss you aint a quarrelled with your beau the poor girl said  no not quarrelled she said but give him that  it was a scrap of paper containing a word or two in pencil  it is better that we should not meet again  god bless you and from that day to this now more than ten years they never have met  papa she said to her father that afternoon dear papa do not be angry with me  it is all over between me and john broughton  dearest you and i will not be separated  it would be useless here to tell how great was the old mans surprise and how true his sorrow  as the tale was told to him no cause was given for anger with any one  not a word was spoken against the suitor who had on that day returned to london with a full conviction that now at least he was relieved from his engagement  patty my darling child he said may god grant that it be for the best  it is for the best she answered stoutly  for this place i am fit and i much doubt whether i am fit for any other   on that day she did not see miss le smyrger but on the following morning knowing that captain broughton had gone off having heard the wheels of the carriage as they passed by the parsonage gate on his way to the stationshe walked up to the combe  he has told you i suppose said she  yes said miss le smyrger  and i will never see him again unless he asks your pardon on his knees  i have told him so  i would not even give him my hand as he went  but why so thou kindest one  the fault was mine more than his  i understand  i have eyes in my head said the old maid  i have watched him for the last four or five days  if you could have kept the truth to yourself and bade him keep off from you he would have been at your feet now licking the dust from your shoes  but dear friend i do not want a man to lick dust from my shoes  ah you are a fool  you do not know the value of your own wealth  true i have been a fool  i was a fool to think that one coming from such a life as he has led could be happy with such as i am  i know the truth now  i have bought the lesson dearlybut perhaps not too dearly seeing that it will never be forgotten  there was but little more said about the matter between our three friends at oxney colne  what indeed could be said  miss le smyrger for a year or two still expected that her nephew would return and claim his bride but he has never done so nor has there been any correspondence between them  patience woolsworthy had learned her lesson dearly  she had given her whole heart to the man and though she so bore herself that no one was aware of the violence of the struggle nevertheless the struggle within her bosom was very violent she never told herself that she had done wrong she never regretted her loss but yetyetthe loss was very hard to bear  he also had loved her but he was not capable of a love which could much injure his daily peace  her daily peace was gone for many a day to come  her father is still living but there is a curate now in the parish in conjunction with him and with miss le smyrger she spends her time in the concerns of the parish  in her own eyes she is a confirmed old maid and such is my opinion also  the romance of her life was played out in that summer  she never sits now lonely on the hillside thinking how much she might do for one whom she really loved  but with a large heart she loves many and with no romance she works hard to lighten the burdens of those she loves  as for captain broughton all the world know that he did marry that great heiress with whom his name was once before connected and that he is now a useful member of parliament working on committees three or four days a week with a zeal that is indefatigable  sometimes not often as he thinks of patience woolsworthy a gratified smile comes across his face
