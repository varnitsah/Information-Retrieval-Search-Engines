11165988	madam how and lady why or first lessons in earth lore for children    dedication   to my son grenville arthur and to his schoolfellows at winton house this little book is dedicated     preface   my dear boyswhen i was your age there were no such childrens books as there are now  those which we had were few and dull and the pictures in them ugly and mean while you have your choice of books without number clear amusing and pretty as well as really instructive on subjects which were only talked of fifty years ago by a few learned men and very little understood even by them  so if mere reading of books would make wise men you ought to grow up much wiser than us old fellows but mere reading of wise books will not make you wise men you must use for yourselves the tools with which books are made wise and that isyour eyes and ears and common sense  now among those very stupid oldfashioned boys books was one which taught me that and therefore i am more grateful to it than if it had been as full of wonderful pictures as all the natural history books you ever saw  its name was evenings at home and in it was a story called eyes and no eyes a regular oldfashioned prim sententious story and it began thus  well robert where have you been walking this afternoon said mr andrews to one of his pupils at the close of a holiday  ohrobert had been to broom heath and round by camp mount and home through the meadows  but it was very dull  he hardly saw a single person  he had much rather have gone by the turnpikeroad  presently in comes master william the other pupil dressed i suppose as wretched boys used to be dressed forty years ago in a frill collar and skeleton monkeyjacket and tight trousers buttoned over it and hardly coming down to his ancles and low shoes which always came off in sticky ground and terribly dirty and wet he is but he never he says had such a pleasant walk in his life and he has brought home his handkerchief for boys had no pockets in those days much bigger than key holes full of curiosities  he has got a piece of mistletoe wants to know what it is and he has seen a woodpecker and a wheatear and gathered strange flowers on the heath and hunted a peewit because he thought its wing was broken till of course it led him into a bog and very wet he got  but he did not mind it because he fell in with an old man cutting turf who told him all about turfcutting and gave him a dead adder  and then he went up a hill and saw a grand prospect and wanted to go again and make out the geography of the country from carys old county maps which were the only maps in those days  and then because the hill was called camp mount he looked for a roman camp and found one and then he went down to the river saw twenty things more and so on and so on till he had brought home curiosities enough and thoughts enough to last him a week  whereon mr andrews who seems to have been a very sensible old gentleman tells him all about his curiosities and then it comes outif you will believe itthat master william has been over the very same ground as master robert who saw nothing at all  whereon mr andrews says wisely enough in his solemn oldfashioned way  so it is  one man walks through the world with his eyes open another with his eyes shut and upon this difference depends all the superiority of knowledge which one man acquires over another  i have known sailors who had been in all the quarters of the world and could tell you nothing but the signs of the tipplinghouses and the price and quality of the liquor  on the other hand franklin could not cross the channel without making observations useful to mankind  while many a vacant thoughtless youth is whirled through europe without gaining a single idea worth crossing the street for the observing eye and inquiring mind find matter of improvement and delight in every ramble  you then william continue to use your eyes  and you robert learn that eyes were given to you to use  so said mr andrews and so i say dear boysand so says he who has the charge of youto you  therefore i beg all good boys among you to think over this story and settle in their own minds whether they will be eyes or no eyes whether they will as they grow up look and see for themselves what happens or whether they will let other people look for them or pretend to look and dupe them and lead them aboutthe blind leading the blind till both fall into the ditch  i say good boys not merely clever boys or prudent boys because using your eyes or not using them is a question of doing right or doing wrong  god has given you eyes it is your duty to god to use them  if your parents tried to teach you your lessons in the most agreeable way by beautiful picturebooks would it not be ungracious ungrateful and altogether naughty and wrong to shut your eyes to those pictures and refuse to learn  and is it not altogether naughty and wrong to refuse to learn from your father in heaven the great god who made all things when he offers to teach you all day long by the most beautiful and most wonderful of all picturebooks which is simply all things which you can see hear and touch from the sun and stars above your head to the mosses and insects at your feet  it is your duty to learn his lessons and it is your interest  gods book which is the universe and the reading of gods book which is science can do you nothing but good and teach you nothing but truth and wisdom  god did not put this wondrous world about your young souls to tempt or to mislead them  if you ask him for a fish he will not give you a serpent  if you ask him for bread he will not give you a stone  so use your eyes and your intellect your senses and your brains and learn what god is trying to teach you continually by them  i do not mean that you must stop there and learn nothing more  anything but that there are things which neither your senses nor your brains can tell you and they are not only more glorious but actually more true and more real than any things which you can see or touch  but you must begin at the beginning in order to end at the end and sow the seed if you wish to gather the fruit  god has ordained that you and every child which comes into the world should begin by learning something of the world about him by his senses and his brain and the better you learn what they can teach you the more fit you will be to learn what they cannot teach you  the more you try now to understand things the more you will be able hereafter to understand men and that which is above men  you began to find out that truly divine mystery that you had a mother on earth simply by lying soft and warm upon her bosom and so as our lord told the jews of old it is by watching the common natural things around you and considering the lilies of the field how they grow that you will begin at least to learn that far diviner mystery that you have a father in heaven  and so you will be delivered if you will out of the tyranny of darkness and distrust and fear into gods free kingdom of light and faith and love and will be safe from the venom of that tree which is more deadly than the fabled upas of the east  who planted that tree i know not it was planted so long ago but surely it is none of gods planting neither of the son of god yet it grows in all lands and in all climes and sends its hidden suckers far and wide even unless we be watchful into your hearts and mine  and its name is the tree of unreason whose roots are conceit and ignorance and its juices folly and death  it drops its venom into the finest brains and makes them call sense nonsense and nonsense sense fact fiction and fiction fact it drops its venom into the tenderest hearts alas and makes them call wrong right and right wrong love cruelty and cruelty love  some say that the axe is laid to the root of it just now and that it is already tottering to its fall while others say that it is growing stronger than ever and ready to spread its upasshade over the whole earth  for my part i know not save that all shall be as god wills  the tree has been cut down already again and again and yet has always thrown out fresh shoots and dropped fresh poison from its boughs  but this at least i know that any little child who will use the faculties god has given him may find an antidote to all its poison in the meanest herb beneath his feet  there you do not understand me my boys and the best prayer i can offer for you is perhaps that you should never need to understand me but if that sore need should come and that poison should begin to spread its mist over your brains and hearts then you will be proof against it just in proportion as you have used the eyes and the common sense which god has given you and have considered the lilies of the field how they grow  c kingsley     chapter ithe glen   you find it dull walking up here upon hartford bridge flat this sad november day  well i do not deny that the moor looks somewhat dreary though dull it need never be  though the fog is clinging to the firtrees and creeping among the heather till you cannot see as far as minley corner hardly as far as bramshill woodsand all the berkshire hills are as invisible as if it was a dark midnightyet there is plenty to be seen here at our very feet  though there is nothing left for you to pick and all the flowers are dead and brown except here and there a poor halfwithered scrap of bottleheath and nothing left for you to catch either for the butterflies and insects are all dead too except one poor old daddylonglegs who sits upon that piece of turf boring a hole with her tail to lay her eggs in before the frost catches her and ends her like the rest though all things i say seem dead yet there is plenty of life around you at your feet i may almost say in the very stones on which you tread  and though the place itself be dreary enough a sheet of flat heather and a little glen in it with banks of dead fern and a brown bog between them and a few firtrees struggling upyet if you only have eyes to see it that little bit of glen is beautiful and wonderfulso beautiful and so wonderful and so cunningly devised that it took thousands of years to make it and it is not i believe half finished yet  how do i know all that  because a fairy told it me a fairy who lives up here upon the moor and indeed in most places else if people have but eyes to see her  what is her name  i cannot tell  the best name that i can give her and i think it must be something like her real name because she will always answer if you call her by it patiently and reverently is madam how  she will come in good time if she is called even by a little child  and she will let us see her at her work and what is more teach us to copy her  but there is another fairy here likewise whom we can hardly hope to see  very thankful should we be if she lifted even the smallest corner of her veil and showed us but for a moment if it were but her finger tipso beautiful is she and yet so awful too  but that sight i believe would not make us proud as if we had had some great privilege  no my dear child it would make us feel smaller and meaner and more stupid and more ignorant than we had ever felt in our lives before at the same time it would make us wiser than ever we were in our lives beforethat one glimpse of the great glory of her whom we call lady why  but i will say more of her presently  we must talk first with madam how and perhaps she may help us hereafter to see lady why  for she is the servant and lady why is the mistress though she has a master over her againwhose name i leave for you to guess  you have heard it often already and you will hear it again for ever and ever  but of one thing i must warn you that you must not confound madam how and lady why  many people do it and fall into great mistakes therebymistakes that even a little child if it would think need not commit  but really great philosophers sometimes make this mistake about why and how and therefore it is no wonder if other people make it too when they write childrens books about the wonders of nature and call them why and because or the reason why  the books are very good books and you should read and study them but they do not tell you really why and because but only how and so  they do not tell you the reason why things happen but only the way in which they happen however i must not blame these good folks for i have made the same mistake myself often and may do it again but all the more shame to me for seeyou know perfectly the difference between how and why when you are talking about yourself  if i ask you why did we go out today you would not answer because we opened the door  that is the answer to how did we go out  the answer to why did we go out is because we chose to take a walk  now when we talk about other things beside ourselves we must remember this same difference between how and why  if i ask you why does fire burn you you would answer i suppose being a little boy because it is hot which is all you know about it  but if you were a great chemist instead of a little boy you would be apt to answer me i am afraid fire burns because the vibratory motion of the molecules of the heated substance communicates itself to the molecules of my skin and so destroys their tissue which is i dare say quite true but it only tells us how fire burns the way or means by which it burns it does not tell us the reason why it burns  but you will ask if that is not the reason why fire burns what is  my dear child i do not know  that is lady whys business who is mistress of mrs how and of you and of me and as i think of all things that you ever saw or can see or even dream  and what her reason for making fire burn may be i cannot tell  but i believe on excellent grounds that her reason is a very good one  if i dare to guess i should say that one reason at least why fire burns is that you may take care not to play with it and so not only scorch your finger but set your whole bed on fire and perhaps the house into the bargain as you might be tempted to do if putting your finger in the fire were as pleasant as putting sugar in your mouth  my dear child if i could once get clearly into your head this difference between why and how so that you should remember them steadily in after life i should have done you more good than if i had given you a thousand pounds  but now that we know that how and why are two very different matters and must not be confounded with each other let us look for madam how and see her at work making this little glen for as i told you it is not half made yet  one thing we shall see at once and see it more and more clearly the older we grow i mean her wonderful patience and diligence madam how is never idle for an instant  nothing is too great or too small for her and she keeps her work before her eye in the same moment and makes every separate bit of it help every other bit  she will keep the sun and stars in order while she looks after poor old mrs daddy longlegs there and her eggs  she will spend thousands of years in building up a mountain and thousands of years in grinding it down again and then carefully polish every grain of sand which falls from that mountain and put it in its right place where it will be wanted thousands of years hence and she will take just as much trouble about that one grain of sand as she did about the whole mountain  she will settle the exact place where mrs daddylonglegs shall lay her eggs at the very same time that she is settling what shall happen hundreds of years hence in a stair millions of miles away  and i really believe that madam how knows her work so thoroughly that the grain of sand which sticks now to your shoe and the weight of mrs daddylonglegs eggs at the bottom of her hole will have an effect upon suns and stars ages after you and i are dead and gone  most patient indeed is madam how  she does not mind the least seeing her own work destroyed she knows that it must be destroyed  there is a spell upon her and a fate that everything she makes she must unmake again and yet good and wise woman as she is she never frets nor tires nor fudges her work as we say at school  she takes just as much pains to make an acorn as to make a peach  she takes just as much pains about the acorn which the pig eats as about the acorn which will grow into a tall oak and help to build a great ship  she took just as much pains again about the acorn which you crushed under your foot just now and which you fancy will never come to anything  madam how is wiser than that  she knows that it will come to something  she will find some use for it as she finds a use for everything  that acorn which you crushed will turn into mould and that mould will go to feed the roots of some plant perhaps next year if it lies where it is or perhaps it will be washed into the brook and then into the river and go down to the sea and will feed the roots of some plant in some new continent ages and ages hence and so madam how will have her own again  you dropped your stick into the river yesterday and it floated away  you were sorry because it had cost you a great deal of trouble to cut it and peel it and carve a head and your name on it madam how was not sorry though she had taken a great deal more trouble with that stick than ever you had taken  she had been three years making that stick out of many things sunbeams among the rest  but when it fell into the river madam how knew that she should not lose her sunbeams nor anything else the stick would float down the river and on into the sea and there when it got heavy with the salt water it would sink and lodge and be buried and perhaps ages hence turn into coal and ages after that some one would dig it up and burn it and then out would come as bright warm flame all the sunbeams that were stored away in that stick and so madam how would have her own again  and if that should not be the fate of your stick still something else will happen to it just as useful in the long run for madam how never loses anything but uses up all her scraps and odds and ends somehow somewhere somewhen as is fit and proper for the housekeeper of the whole universe  indeed madam how is so patient that some people fancy her stupid and think that because she does not fall into a passion every time you steal her sweets or break her crockery or disarrange her furniture therefore she does not care  but i advise you as a little boy and still more when you grow up to be a man not to get that fancy into your head for you will find that however goodnatured and patient madam how is in most matters her keeping silence and not seeming to see you is no sign that she has forgotten  on the contrary she bears a grudge if one may so say with all respect to her longer than any one else does because she will always have her own again  indeed i sometimes think that if it were not for lady why her mistress she might bear some of her grudges for ever and ever  i have seen men ere now damage some of madam hows property when they were little boys and be punished by her all their lives long even though she had mended the broken pieces or turned them to some other use  therefore i say to you beware of madam how  she will teach you more kindly patiently and tenderly than any mother if you want to learn her trade  but if instead of learning her trade you damage her materials and play with her tools beware lest she has her own again out of you  some people think again that madam how is not only stupid but illtempered and cruel that she makes earthquakes and storms and famine and pestilences in a sort of blind passion not caring where they go or whom they hurt quite heedless of who is in the way if she wants to do anything or go anywhere  now that madam how can be very terrible there can be no doubt but there is no doubt also that if people choose to learn she will teach them to get out of her way whenever she has business to do which is dangerous to them  but as for her being cruel and unjust those may believe it who like  you my dear boys and girls need not believe it if you will only trust to lady why and be sure that why is the mistress and how the servant now and for ever  that lady why is utterly good and kind i know full well and i believe that in her case too the old proverb holds like mistress like servant and that the more we know of madam how the more we shall be content with her and ready to submit to whatever she does but not with that stupid resignation which some folks preach who do not believe in lady whythat is no resignation at all  that is merely saying     what cant be cured    must be endured  like a donkey when he turns his tail to a hailstormbut the true resignation the resignation which is fit for grown people and children alike the resignation which is the beginning and the end of all wisdom and all religion is to believe that lady why knows best because she herself is perfectly good and that as she is mistress over madam how so she has a master over her whose namei say againi leave you to guess  so now that i have taught you not to be afraid of madam how we will go and watch her at her work and if we do not understand anything we see we will ask her questions  she will always show us one of her lesson books if we give her time  and if we have to wait some time for her answer you need not fear catching cold though it is november for she keeps her lesson books scattered about in strange places and we may have to walk up and down that hill more than once before we can make out how she makes the glen  wellhow was the glen made  you shall guess it if you like and i will guess too  you think perhaps that an earthquake opened it  my dear child we must look before we guess  then after we have looked a little and got some grounds for guessing then we may guess  and you have no ground for supposing there ever was an earthquake here strong enough to open that glen  there may have been one but we must guess from what we do know and not from what we do not  guess again  perhaps it was there always from the beginning of the world  my dear child you have no proof of that either  everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly as you will find out the longer you live and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this glen has changed its shape as everything else on earth has done besides i told you not that madam how had made the glen but that she was making it and as yet has only half finished  that is my first guess and my next guess is that water is making the glenwater and nothing else  you open your young eyes  and i do not blame you  i looked at this very glen for fifteen years before i made that guess and i have looked at it some ten years since to make sure that my guess held good  for man after all is very blind my dear boy and very stupid and cannot see what lies under his own feet all day long and if lady why and he whom lady why obeys were not very patient and gentle with mankind they would have perished off the face of the earth long ago simply from their own stupidity  i at least was very stupid in this case for i had my head full of earthquakes and convulsions of nature and all sorts of prodigies which never happened to this glen and so while i was trying to find what was not there i of course found nothing  but when i put them all out of my head and began to look for what was there i found it at once and lo and behold i had seen it a thousand times before and yet never learnt anything from it like a stupid man as i was though what i learnt you may learn as easily as i did  and what did i find  the pond at the bottom of the glen  you know that pond of course  you dont need to go there  very well then if you do do not you know also that the pond is always filling up with sand and mud and that though we clean it out every three or four years it always fills again  now where does that sand and mud come from  down that stream of course which runs out of this bog  you see it coming down every time there is a flood and the stream fouls  very well  then said madam how to me as soon as i recollected that dont you see you stupid man that the stream has made the glen and the earth which runs down the stream was all once part of the hill on which you stand  i confess i was very much ashamed of myself when she said that  for that is the history of the whole mystery  madam how is digging away with her soft spade water  she has a harder spade or rather plough the strongest and most terrible of all ploughs but that i am glad to say she has laid by in england here  water  but water is too simple a thing to have dug out all this great glen  my dear child the most wonderful part of madam hows work is that she does such great things and so many different things with one and the same tool which looks to you so simple though it really is not so water for instance is not a simple thing but most complicated and we might spend hours in talking about water without having come to the end of its wonders  still madam how is a great economist and never wastes her materials  she is like the sailor who boasted only she never boasts that if he had but a long life and a strong knife he would build st pauls cathedral before he was done  and madam how has a very long life and plenty of time and one of the strongest of all her tools is water  now if you will stoop down and look into the heather i will show you how she is digging out the glen with this very mist which is hanging about our feet  at least so i guess  for see how the mist clings to the points of the heather leaves and makes drops  if the hot sun came out the drops would dry and they would vanish into the air in light warm steam  but now that it is dark and cold they drip or run down the heatherstems to the ground  and whither do they go then  whither will the water gohundreds of gallons of it perhapswhich has dripped and run through the heather in this single day  it will sink into the ground you know  and then what will become of it  madam how will use it as an underground spade just as she uses the rain at least when it rains too hard and therefore the rain runs off the moor instead of sinking into it as a spade above ground  now come to the edge of the glen and i will show you the mist that fell yesterday perhaps coming out of the ground again and hard at work  you know of what an odd and indeed of what a pretty form all these glens are  how the flat moor ends suddenly in a steep rounded bank almost like the crest of a waveready like a wavecrest to fall over and as you know falling over sometimes bit by bit where the soil is bare  oh yes you are very fond of those banks  it is awfully jolly as you say scrambling up and down them in the deep heath and fern besides there are plenty of rabbitholes there because they are all sand while there are no rabbitholes on the flat above because it is all gravel  yes you know all about it but you know too that you must not go too far down these banks much less roll down them because there is almost certain to be a bog at the bottom lying upon a gentle slope and there you get wet through  all round these hills from here to aldershot in one direction and from here to windsor in another you see the same shaped glens the wavecrest along their top and at the foot of the crest a line of springs which run out over the slopes or well up through them in deep sandgalls as you call themshaking quagmires which are sometimes deep enough to swallow up a horse and which you love to dance upon in summer time  now the water of all these springs is nothing but the rain and mist and dew which has sunk down first through the peaty soil and then through the gravel and sand and there has stopped  and why  because under the gravel about which i will tell you a strange story one day and under the sand which is what the geologists call the upper bagshot sand there is an entirely different set of beds which geologists call the bracklesham beds from a place near the new forest and in those beds there is a vein of clay and through that clay the water cannot get as you have seen yourself when we dug it out in the field below to puddle the pondhead and very good fun you thought it and a very pretty mess you made of yourself  well because the water cannot get though this clay and must go somewhere it runs out continually along the top of the clay and as it runs undermines the bank and brings down sand and gravel continually for the next shower to wash into the stream below  now think for one moment how wonderful it is that the shape of these glens of which you are so fond was settled by the particular order in which madam how laid down the gravel and sand and mud at the bottom of the sea ages and ages ago  this is what i told you that the least thing that madam how does today may take effect hundreds and thousands of years hence  but i must tell you i think there was a time when this glen was of a very different shape from what it is now and i dare say according to your notions of a much prettier shape  it was once just like one of those chines which we used to see at bournemouth  you recollect them  how there was a narrow gap in the cliff of striped sands and gravels and out of the mouth of that gap only a few feet across there poured down a great slope of mud and sand the shape of half a bun some wet and some dry up which we used to scramble and get into the chine and call the chine what it was in the truest sense fairyland  you recollect how it was all eaten out into mountain ranges pinnacles steep cliffs of white and yellow and pink standing up against the clear blue sky till we agreed that putting aside the difference of size they were as beautiful and grand as any alps we had ever seen in pictures  and how we saw for there could be no mistake about it there that the chine was being hollowed out by the springs which broke out high up the cliff and by the rain which wore the sand into furrowed pinnacles and peaks  you recollect the beautiful place and how when we looked back down it we saw between the miniature mountain walls the bright blue sea and heard it murmur on the sands outside  so i verily believe we might have done if we had stood somewhere at the bottom of this glen thousands of years ago  we should have seen the sea in front of us or rather an arm of the sea for finchampstead ridges opposite instead of being covered with farms and woodlands and purple heath above would have been steep cliffs of sand and clay just like those you see at bournemouth now andwhat would have spoilt somewhat the beauty of the sightalong the shores there would have floated at least in winter great blocks and floes of ice such as you might have seen in the tideway at kings lynn the winter before last growling and crashing grubbing and ploughing the sand and the gravel and the mud and sweeping them away into seas towards the north which are now all fruitful land  that may seem to you like a dream yet it is true and some day when we have another talk with madam how i will show even a child like you that it was true  but what could change a beautiful chine like that at bournemouth into a wide sloping glen like this of bracknells bottom with a wood like coombs many acres large in the middle of it  well now think  it is a capital plan for finding out madam hows secrets to see what she might do in one place and explain by it what she has done in another  suppose now madam how had orders to lift up the whole coast of bournemouth only twenty or even ten feet higher out of the sea than it is now  she could do that easily enough for she has been doing so on the coast of south america for ages she has been doing so this very summer in what hasty people would call a hasty and violent and ruthless way though i shall not say so for i believe that lady why knows best  she is doing so now steadily on the west coast of norway which is rising quietlyall that vast range of mountain wall and ironbound cliffat the rate of some four feet in a hundred years without making the least noise or confusion or even causing an extra ripple on the sea so light and gentle when she will can madam hows strong finger be  now if the mouth of that chine at bournemouth was lifted twenty feet out of the sea one thing would happenthat the high tide would not come up any longer and wash away the cake of dirt at the entrance as we saw it do so often  but if the mud stopped there the mud behind it would come down more slowly and lodge inside more and more till the chine was half filledup and only the upper part of the cliffs continue to be eaten away above the level where the springs ran out  so gradually the chine instead of being deep and narrow would become broad and shallow and instead of hollowing itself rapidly after every shower of rain as you saw the chine at bournemouth doing would hollow itself out slowly as this glen is doing now  and one thing more would happenwhen the sea ceased to gnaw at the foot of the cliffs outside and to carry away every stone and grain of sand which fell from them the cliffs would very soon cease to be cliffs the rain and the frost would still crumble them down but the dirt that fell would lie at their feet and gradually make a slope of dry land far out where the shallow sea had been and their tops instead of being steep as now would become smooth and rounded and so at last instead of two sharp walls of cliff at the chines mouth you might havejust what you have here at the mouth of this glenour mount and the warren hilllong slopes with sheets of drifted gravel and sand at their feet stretching down into what was once an icy sea and is now the vale of blackwater  and this i really believe madam how has done simply by lifting hartford bridge flat a few more feet out of the sea and leaving the rest to her trusty tool the water in the sky  that is my guess and i think it is a good guess because i have asked madam how a hundred different questions about it in the last ten years and she always answered them in the same way saying water water you stupid man  but i do not want you merely to depend on what i say  if you want to understand madam how you must ask her questions yourself and make up your mind yourself like a man instead of taking things at hearsay or secondhand like the vulgar  mind by the vulgar i do not mean poor people i mean ignorant and uneducated people who do not use their brains rightly though they may be fine ladies kings or popes the bible says prove all things hold fast that which is good  so do you prove my guess and if it proves good hold it fast  and how can i do that  first by direct experiment as it is called  in plain englishgo home and make a little hartford bridge flat in the stableyard and then ask mrs how if she will not make a glen in it like this glen here  we will go home and try that  we will make a great flat cake of clay and put upon it a cap of sand and then we will rain upon it out of a watering pot and see if mrs how does not begin soon to make a glen in the side of the heap just like those on hartford bridge flat  i believe she will and certainly if she does it will be a fresh proof that my guess is right  and then we will see whether water will not make glens of a different shape than these if it run over soils of a different kind  we will make a hartford bridge flat turned upside downa cake of sand with a cap of clay on the top and we will rain on that out of our watering pot and see what sort of glens we make then  i can guess what they will be like because i have seen themsteep overhanging cliffs with very narrow gullies down them but you shall try for yourself and make up your mind whether you think me right or wrong  meanwhile remember that those gullies too will have been made by water  and there is another way of verifying my theory as it is called in plain english seeing if my guess holds good that is to look at other valleysnot merely the valleys round here but valleys in clay in chalk in limestone in the hard slate rock such as you saw in devonshireand see whether my guess does not hold good about them too whether all of them deep or shallow broad or narrow rock or earth may not have been all hollowed out by running water  i am sure if you would do this you would find something to amuse you and something to instruct you whenever you wish  i know that i do  to me the longest railroad journey instead of being stupid is like continually turning over the leaves of a wonderful book or looking at wonderful pictures of old worlds which were made and unmade thousands of years ago  for i keep looking not only at the railway cuttings where the bones of the old worlds are laid bare but at the surface of the ground at the plains and downs banks and knolls hills and mountains and continually asking mrs how what gave them each its shape and i will soon teach you to do the same  when you do i tell you fairly her answer will be in almost every case running water  either water running when soft as it usually is or water running when it is hardin plain words moving ice  about that moving ice which is mrs hows stronger spade i will tell you some other time and show you too the marks of it in every gravel pit about here  but now i see you want to ask a question and what is it  do i mean to say that water has made great valleys such as you have seen paintings and photographs ofvalleys thousands of feet deep among mountains thousands of feet high  yes i do  but as i said before i do not like you to take my word upon trust  when you are older you shall go to the mountains and you shall judge for yourself  still i must say that i never saw a valley however deep or a cliff however high which had not been scooped out by water and that even the mountaintops which stand up miles aloft in jagged peaks and pinnacles against the sky were cut out at first and are being cut and sharpened still by little else save water soft and hard that is by rain frost and ice  water and nothing else has sawn out such a chasm as that through which the ships run up to bristol between leigh wood and st vincents rocks water and nothing else has shaped those peaks of the matterhorn or the weisshorn or the pic du midi of the pyrenees of which you have seen sketches and photographs  just so water might saw out hartford bridge flat if it had time enough into a labyrinth of valleys and hills and peaks standing alone as it has done already by ambarrow and edgbarrow and the folly hill on the other side of the vale  i see you are astonished at the notion that water can make alps  but it was just because i knew you would be astonished at madam hows doing so great a thing with so simple a tool that i began by showing you how she was doing the same thing in a small way here upon these flats  for the safest way to learn madam hows methods is to watch her at work in little corners at commonplace business which will not astonish or frighten us nor put huge hasty guesses and dreams into our heads  sir isaac newton some will tell you found out the great law of gravitation which holds true of all the suns and stars in heaven by watching an apple fall and even if he did not find it out so he found it out we know by careful thinking over the plain and commonplace fact that things have weight  so do you be humble and patient and watch madam how at work on little things  for that is the way to see her at work upon all space and time  what you have a question more to ask  oh  i talked about madam how lifting up hartford bridge flat  how could she do that  my dear child that is a long story and i must tell it you some other time  meanwhile did you ever see the lid of a kettle rise up and shake when the water inside boiled  of course and of course too remember that madam how must have done it  then think over between this and our next talk what that can possibly have to do with her lifting up hartford bridge flat  but you have been longing perhaps all this time to hear more about lady why and why she set madam how to make bracknells bottom  my dear child the only answer i dare give to that is whatever other purposes she may have made it for she made it at least for thisthat you and i should come to it this day and look at and talk over it and become thereby wiser and more earnest and we will hope more humble and better people  whatever else lady why may wish or not wish this she wishes always to make all men wise and all men good  for what is written of her whom as in a parable i have called lady why  the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old  i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was  when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water  before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth  while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world  when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth  when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep  when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth  then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him  rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men  now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways  that we can say for it has been said for us already  but beyond that we can say and need say very little  we were not there as we read in the book of job when god laid the foundations of the earth  we see says st paul as in a glass darkly and only know in part  for who he asks again has known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor    for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever and ever  amen  therefore we must not rashly say this or that is why a thing has happened nor invent what are called final causes which are not lady why herself but only our little notions of what lady why has done or rather what we should have done if we had been in her place  it is not indeed by thinking that we shall find out anything about lady why  she speaks not to our eyes or to our brains like madam how but to that inner part of us which we call our hearts and spirits and which will endure when eyes and brain are turned again to dust  if your heart be pure and sober gentle and truthful then lady why speaks to you without words and tells you things which madam how and all her pupils the men of science can never tell when you lie it may be on a painful sickbed but with your mothers hand in yours when you sit by her looking up into her loving eyes when you gaze out towards the setting sun and fancy golden capes and islands in the clouds and seas and lakes in the blue sky and the infinite rest and peace of the far west sends rest and peace into your young heart till you sit silent and happy you know not why when sweet music fills your heart with noble and tender instincts which need no thoughts or words ay even when you watch the raging thunderstorm and feel it to be in spite of its great awfulness so beautiful that you cannot turn your eyes away at such times as these lady why is speaking to your soul of souls and saying my child this world is a new place and strange and often terrible but be not afraid  all will come right at last  rest will conquer restlessness faith will conquer fear order will conquer disorder health will conquer sickness joy will conquer sorrow pleasure will conquer pain life will conquer death right will conquer wrong  all will be well at last  keep your soul and body pure humble busy piousin one word be good and ere you die or after you die you may have some glimpse of me the everlasting why and hear with the ears not of your body but of your spirit men and all rational beings plants and animals ay the very stones beneath your feet the clouds above your head the planets and the suns away in farthest space singing eternally  thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created     chapter iiearthquakes   so  you have been looking at that beautiful drawing of the ruin of arica in the illustrated london news and it has puzzled you and made you sad  you want to know why god killed all those peoplemothers among them too and little children  alas my dear child who am i that i should answer you that  have you done wrong in asking me  no my dear child no  you have asked me because you are a human being and a child of god and not merely a cleverer sort of animal an ape who can read and write and cast accounts therefore it is that you cannot be content and ought not to be content with asking how things happen but must go on to ask why  you cannot be content with knowing the causes of things and if you knew all the natural science that ever was or ever will be known to men that would not satisfy you for it would only tell you the causes of things while your souls want to know the reasons of things besides and though i may not be able to tell you the reasons of things or show you aught but a tiny glimpse here and there of that which i called the other day the glory of lady why yet i believe that somehow somewhen somewhere you will learn something of the reason of things  for that thirst to know why was put into the hearts of little children by god himself and i believe that god would never have given them that thirst if he had not meant to satisfy it  thereyou do not understand me  i trust that you will understand me some day  meanwhile i thinki only say i thinkyou know i told you how humble we must be whenever we speak of lady whythat we may guess at something like a good reason for the terrible earthquakes in south america  i do not wish to be hard upon poor people in great affliction but i cannot help thinking that they have been doing for hundreds of years past something very like what the bible calls tempting godstaking their property and their lives upon the chances of no earthquakes coming while they ought to have known that an earthquake might come any day  they have fulfilled and little thought i that it would be fulfilled so soon the parable that i told you once of the nation of the doasyoulikes who lived careless and happy at the foot of the burning mountain and would not be warned by the smoke that came out of the top or by the slag and cinders which lay all about them till the mountain blew up and destroyed them miserably  then i think that they ought to have expected an earthquake  wellit is not for us to judge any one especially if they live in a part of the world in which we have not been ourselves  but i think that we know and that they ought to have known enough about earthquakes to have been more prudent than they have been for many a year  at least we will hope that though they would not learn their lesson till this year they will learn it now and will listen to the message which i think madam how has brought them spoken in a voice of thunder and written in letters of flame  and what is that  my dear child if the landlord of our house was in the habit of pulling the roof down upon our heads and putting gunpowder under the foundations to blow us up do you not think we should know what he meant even though he never spoke a word  he would be very wrong in behaving so of course but one thing would be certainthat he did not intend us to live in his house any longer if he could help it and was giving us in a very rough fashion notice to quit  and so it seems to me that these poor spanish americans have received from the landlord of all landlords who can do no wrong such a notice to quit as perhaps no people ever had before which says to them in unmistakable words you must leave this country or perish  and i believe that that message like all lady whys messages is at heart a merciful and loving one that if these spaniards would leave the western coast of peru and cross the andes into the green forests of the eastern side of their own land they might not only live free from earthquakes but if they would only be good and industrious become a great rich and happy nation instead of the idle and useless and i am afraid not over good people which they have been  for in that eastern part of their own land gods gifts are waiting for them in a paradise such as i can neither describe nor you conceiveprecious woods fruits drugs and what notboundless wealth in one wordwaiting for them to send it all down the waters of the mighty river amazon enriching us here in the old world and enriching themselves there in the new  if they would only go and use these gifts of god instead of neglecting them as they have been doing for now three hundred years they would be a blessing to the earth instead of beingthat which they have been  god grant my dear child that these poor people may take the warning that has been sent to them the voice of god revealed in facts as the great lord bacon would have called it and see not only that god has bidden them leave the place where they are now but has prepared for them in their own land a home a thousand times better than that in which they now live  but you ask how ought they to have known that an earthquake would come  well to make you understand that we must talk a little about earthquakes and what makes them and in order to find out that let us try the very simplest cause of which we can think  that is the wise and scientific plan  now whatever makes these earthquakes must be enormously strong that is certain  and what is the strongest thing you know of in the world  think     gunpowder  well gunpowder is strong sometimes but not always  you may carry it in a flask or in your hand and then it is weak enough  it only becomes strong by being turned into gas and steam  but steam is always strong and if you look at a railway engine still more if you had ever seenwhich god forbid you shoulda boiler explosion you would agree with me that the strongest thing we know of in the world is steam  now i think that we can explain almost if not quite all that we know about earthquakes if we believe that on the whole they are caused by steam and other gases expanding that is spreading out with wonderful quickness and strength  of course there must be something to make them expand and that is heat  but we will not talk of that yet  now do you remember that riddle which i put to you the other daywhat had the rattling of the lid of the kettle to do with hartford bridge flat being lifted out of the ancient sea  the answer to the riddle i believe issteam has done both  the lid of the kettle rattles because the expanding steam escapes in little jets and so causes a lidquake  now suppose that there was steam under the earth trying to escape and the earth in one place was loose and yet hard as the lid of the kettle is loose and yet hard with cracks in it it may be like the crack between the edge of the lid and the edge of the kettle itself might not the steam try to escape through the cracks and rattle the surface of the earth and so cause an earthquake  so the steam would escape generally easily and would only make a passing rattle like the earthquake of which the famous jester charles selwyn said that it was quite a young one so tame that you might have stroked it like that which i myself once felt in the pyrenees which gave me very solemn thoughts after a while though at first i did nothing but laugh at it and i will tell you why  i was travelling in the pyrenees and i came one evening to the loveliest spota glen or rather a vast crack in the mountains so narrow that there was no room for anything at the bottom of it save a torrent roaring between walls of polished rock  high above the torrent the road was cut out among the cliffs and above the road rose more cliffs with great black cavern mouths hundreds of feet above our heads out of each of which poured in foaming waterfalls streams large enough to turn a mill and above them mountains piled on mountains all covered with woods of box which smelt rich and hot and musky in the warm spring air  among the boxtrees and fallen boulders grew hepaticas blue and white and red such as you see in the garden and little stars of gentian more azure than the azure sky  but out of the boxwoods above rose giant silver firs clothing the cliffs and glens with tall black spires till they stood out at last in a jagged sawedge against the purple evening sky along the mountain ranges thousands of feet aloft and beyond them again at the head of the valley rose vast cones of virgin snow miles away in reality but looking so brilliant and so near that one fancied at the first moment that one could have touched them with ones hand  snow white they stood the glorious things seven thousand feet into the air and i watched their beautiful white sides turn rosecolour in the evening sun and when he set fade into dull cold gray till the bright moon came out to light them up once more  when i was tired of wondering and admiring i went into bed and there i had a dreamsuch a dream as alice had when she went into wonderlandsuch a dream as i dare say you may have had ere now  some noise or stir puts into your fancy as you sleep a whole long dream to account for it and yet that dream which seems to you to be hours long has not taken up a second of time for the very same noise which begins the dream wakes you at the end of it and so it was with me  i dreamed that some english people had come into the hotel where i was and were sleeping in the room underneath me and that they had quarrelled and fought and broke their bed down with a tremendous crash and that i must get up and stop the fight and at that moment i woke and heard coming up the valley from the north such a roar as i never heard before or since as if a hundred railway trains were rolling underground and just as it passed under my bed there was a tremendous thump and i jumped out of bed quicker than i ever did in my life and heard the roaring sound die away as it rolled up the valley towards the peaks of snow  still i had in my head this notion of the englishmen fighting in the room below  but then i recollected that no englishmen had come in the night before and that i had been in the room below and that there was no bed in it  then i opened my windowa woman screamed a dog barked some cocks and hens cackled in a very disturbed humour and then i could hear nothing but the roaring of the torrent a hundred feet below  and then it flashed across me what all the noise was about and i burst out laughing and said it is only an earthquake and went to bed  next morning i inquired whether any one had heard a noise  no nobody had heard anything  and the driver who had brought me up the valley only winked but did not choose to speak  at last at breakfast i asked the pretty little maid who waited what was the meaning of the noise i heard in the night and she answered to my intense amusement ah bah ce netait quun tremblement de terre il y en a ici toutes les six semaines  now the secret was out  the little maid i found came from the lowland far away and did not mind telling the truth but the good people of the place were afraid to let out that they had earthquakes every six weeks for fear of frightening visitors away and because they were really very good people and very kind to me i shall not tell you what the name of the place is  of course after that i could do no less than ask madam how very civilly how she made earthquakes in that particular place hundreds of miles away from any burning mountain  and this was the answer i thought she gave though i am not so conceited as to say i am sure  as i had come up the valley i had seen that the cliffs were all beautiful gray limestone marble but just at this place they were replaced by granite such as you may see in london bridge or at aberdeen  i do not mean that the limestone changed to granite but that the granite had risen up out of the bottom of the valley and had carried the limestone i suppose up on its back hundreds of feet into the air  those caves with the waterfalls pouring from their mouths were all on one level at the top of the granite and the bottom of the limestone  that was to be expected for as i will explain to you some day water can make caves easily in limestone but never i think in granite  but i knew that besides these cold springs which came out of the caves there were hot springs also full of curious chemical salts just below the very house where i was in  and when i went to look at them i found that they came out of the rock just where the limestone and the granite joined  ah i said now i think i have madam hows answer  the lid of one of her great steam boilers is rather shaky and cracked just here because the granite has broken and torn the limestone as it lifted it up and here is the hot water out of the boiler actually oozing out of the crack and the earthquake i heard last night was simply the steam rumbling and thumping inside and trying to get out  and then my dear child i fell into a more serious mood  i said to myself if that stream had been a little only a little stronger or if the rock above it had been only a little weaker it would have been no laughing matter then the village might have been shaken to the ground the rocks hurled into the torrent jets of steam and of hot water mixed it may be with deadly gases have roared out of the riven ground that might have happened here in short which has happened and happens still in a hundred places in the world whenever the rocks are too weak to stand the pressure of the steam below and the solid earth bursts as an engine boiler bursts when the steam within it is too strong  and when those thoughts came into my mind i was in no humour to jest any more about young earthquakes or madam hows boilers but rather to say with the wise man of old it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed  most strange most terrible also are the tricks which this underground steam plays  it will make the ground which seems to us so hard and firm roll and rock in waves till people are seasick as on board a ship and that rocking motion which is the most common will often when it is but slight set the bells ringing in the steeples or make the furniture and things on shelves jump about quaintly enough  it will make trees bend to and fro as if a wind was blowing through them open doors suddenly and shut them again with a slam make the timbers of the floors and roofs creak as they do in a ship at sea or give men such frights as one of the dockkeepers at liverpool got in the earthquake in 1863 when his watchbox rocked so that he thought some one was going to pitch him over into the dock  but these are only little hints and warnings of what it can do  when it is strong enough it will rock down houses and churches into heaps of ruins or if it leaves them standing crack them from top to bottom so that they must be pulled down and rebuilt  you saw those pictures of the ruins of arica about which our talk began and from them you can guess well enough for yourself what a town looks like which has been ruined by an earthquake  of the misery and the horror which follow such a ruin i will not talk to you nor darken your young spirit with sad thoughts which grown people must face and ought to face  but the strangeness of some of the tricks which the earthquake shocks play is hardly to be explained even by scientific men  sometimes it would seem the force runs round making the solid ground eddy as water eddies in a brook  for it will make straight rows of trees crooked it will twist whole walls roundor rather the ground on which the walls standwithout throwing them down it will shift the stones of a pillar one on the other sideways as if a giant had been trying to spin it like a teetotum and so screwed it half in pieces  there is a story told by a wise man who saw the place himself of the whole furniture of one house being hurled away by an earthquake and buried under the ruins of another house and of things carried hundreds of yards off so that the neighbours went to law to settle who was the true owner of them sometimes again the shock seems to come neither horizontally in waves nor circularly in eddies but vertically that is straight up from below and then thingsand people alas sometimesare thrown up off the earth high into the air just as things spring up off the table if you strike it smartly enough underneath  by that same law for there is a law for every sort of motion it is that the earthquake shock sometimes hurls great rocks off a cliff into the valley below  the shock runs through the mountain till it comes to the cliff at the end of it and then the face of the cliff if it be at all loose flies off into the air  you may see the very same thing happen if you will put marbles or billiardballs in a row touching each other and strike the one nearest you smartly in the line of the row  all the balls stand still except the last one and that flies off  the shock like the earthquake shock has run through them all but only the end one which had nothing beyond it but soft air has been moved and when you grow old and learn mathematics you will know the law of motion according to which that happens and learn to apply what the billiardballs have taught you to explain the wonders of an earthquake  for in this case as in so many more you must watch madam how at work on little and common things to find out how she works in great and rare ones  that is why solomon says that a fools eyes are in the ends of the earth because he is always looking out for strange things which he has not seen and which he could not understand if he saw instead of looking at the petty commonplace matters which are about his feet all day long and getting from them sound knowledge and the art of getting more sound knowledge still  another terrible destruction which the earthquake brings when it is close to the seaside is the wash of a great sea wave such as swept in last year upon the island of st thomas in the west indies such as swept in upon the coast of peru this year  the sea moans and sinks back leaving the shore dry and then comes in from the offing a mighty wall of water as high as or higher than many a tall house sweeps far inland washing away quays and houses and carrying great ships in with it and then sweeps back again leaving the ships high and dry as ships were left in peru this year  now how is that wave made  let us think  perhaps in many ways  but two of them i will tell you as simply as i can because they seem the most likely and probably the most common  suppose as the earthquake shock ran on making the earth under the sea heave and fall in long earthwaves the seabottom sank down  then the water on it would sink down too and leave the shore dry till the sea bottom rose again and hurled the water up again against the land  this is one way of explaining it and it may be true  for certain it is that earthquakes do move the bottom of the sea and certain too that they move the water of the sea also and with tremendous force  for ships at sea during an earthquake feel such a blow from it though it does them no harm that the sailors often rush upon deck fancying that they have struck upon a rock and the force which could give a ship floating in water such a blow as that would be strong enough to hurl thousands of tons of water up the beach and on to the land  but there is another way of accounting for this great sea wave which i fancy comes true sometimes  suppose you put an empty indiarubber ball into water and then blow into it through a pipe  of course you know as the ball filled the upper side of it would rise out of the water  now suppose there were a party of little ants moving about upon that ball and fancying it a great island or perhaps the whole worldwhat would they think of the balls filling and growing bigger  if they could see the sides of the basin or tub in which the ball was and were sure that they did not move then they would soon judge by them that they themselves were moving and that the ball was rising out of the water  but if the ants were so shortsighted that they could not see the sides of the basin they would be apt to make a mistake because they would then be like men on an island out of sight of any other land  then it would be impossible further to tell whether they were moving up or whether the water was moving down whether their ball was rising out of the water or the water was sinking away from the ball  they would probably say the water is sinking and leaving the ball dry  do you understand that  then think what would happen if you pricked a hole in the ball  the air inside would come hissing out and the ball would sink again into the water  but the ants would probably fancy the very opposite  their little heads would be full of the notion that the ball was solid and could not move just as our heads are full of the notion that the earth is solid and cannot move and they would say ah here is the water rising again  just so i believe when the sea seems to ebb away during the earthquake the land is really being raised out of the sea hundreds of miles of coast perhaps or a whole island at once by the force of the steam and gas imprisoned under the ground  that steam stretches and strains the solid rocks below till they can bear no more and snap and crack with frightful roar and clang then out of holes and chasms in the ground rush steam gasesoften foul and poisonous oneshot water mud flame strange stonesall signs that the great boiler down below has burst at last  then the strain is eased  the earth sinks together again as the ball did when it was pricked and sinks lower perhaps than it was before and back rushes the sea which the earth had thrust away while it rose and sweeps in destroying all before it  of course there is a great deal more to be said about all this but i have no time to tell you now  you will read it i hope for yourselves when you grow up in the writings of far wiser men than i  or perhaps you may feel for yourselves in foreign lands the actual shock of a great earthquake or see its work fresh done around you  and if ever that happens and you be preserved during the danger you will learn for yourself i trust more about earthquakes than i can teach you if you will only bear in mind the simple general rules for understanding the how of them which i have given you here  but you do not seem satisfied yet  what is it that you want to know  oh  there was an earthquake here in england the other night while you were asleep and that seems to you too near to be pleasant  will there ever be earthquakes in england which will throw houses down and bury people in the ruins  my dear child i think you may set your heart at rest upon that point  as far as the history of england goes back and that is more than a thousand years there is no account of any earthquake which has done any serious damage or killed i believe a single human being  the little earthquakes which are sometimes felt in england run generally up one line of country from devonshire through wales and up the severn valley into cheshire and lancashire and the southwest of scotland and they are felt more smartly there i believe because the rocks are harder there than here and more tossed about by earthquakes which happened ages and ages ago long before man lived on the earth  i will show you the work of these earthquakes some day in the tilting and twisting of the layers of rock and in the cracks faults as they are called which run through them in different directions  i showed you some once if you recollect in the chalk cliff at ramsgatetwo set of cracks sloping opposite ways which i told you were made by two separate sets of earthquakes long long ago perhaps while the chalk was still at the bottom of a deep sea but even in the rocky parts of england the earthquakeforce seems to have all but died out  perhaps the crust of the earth has become too thick and solid there to be much shaken by the gases and steam below  in this eastern part of england meanwhile there is but little chance that an earthquake will ever do much harm because the ground here for thousands of feet down is not hard and rocky but softsands clays chalk and sands again clays soft limestones and clays againwhich all act as buffers to deaden the earthquake shocks and deaden too the earthquake noise  and how  put your ear to one end of a soft bolster and let some one hit the other end  you will hear hardly any noise and will not feel the blow at all put your ear to one end of a hard piece of wood and let some one hit the other  you will hear a smart tap and perhaps feel a smart tap too when you are older and learn the laws of sound and of motion among the particles of bodies you will know why  meanwhile you may comfort yourself with the thought that madam how has doubtless by command of lady why prepared a safe soft bed for this good people of britainnot that they may lie and sleep on it but work and till plant and build and manufacture and thrive in peace and comfort we will trust and pray for many a hundred years to come  all that the steam inside the earth is likely to do to us is to raise parts of this island as hartford bridge flats were raised ages ago out of the old icy sea so slowly probably that no man can tell whether they are rising or not  or again the steam power may be even now dying out under our island and letting parts of it sink slowly into the sea as some wise friends of mine think that the fens in norfolk and cambridgeshire are sinking now  i have shown you where that kind of work has gone on in norfolk how the brow of sandringham hill was once a seacliff and dersingham bog at its foot a shallow sea and therefore that the land has risen there  how again at hunstanton station there is a beach of seashells twenty feet above high water mark showing that the land has risen there likewise  and how farther north again at brancaster there are forests of oak and fir and alder with their roots still in the soil far below highwater mark and only uncovered at low tide which is a plain sign that there the land has sunk  you surely recollect the sunken forest at brancaster and the beautiful shells we picked up in its gullies and the millions of live pholases boring into the clay and peat which once was firm dry land fed over by giant oxen and giant stags likewise and perhaps by the mammoth himself the great woolly elephant whose teeth the fishermen dredge up in the sea outside  you recollect that  then remember that as that norfolk shore has changed so slowly but surely is the whole world changing around us  hartford bridge flat here for instance how has it changed ages ago it was the gravelly bottom of a sea  then the steampower underground raised it up slowly through long ages till it became dry land  and ages hence perhaps it will have become a seabottom once more  washed slowly by the rain or sunk by the dying out of the steam power underground it will go down again to the place from whence it came  seas will roll where we stand now and new lands will rise where seas now roll  for all things on this earth from the tiniest flower to the tallest mountain change and change all day long  every atom of matter moves perpetually and nothing continues in one stay  the solid seeming earth on which you stand is but a heaving bubble bursting ever and anon in this place and in that  only above all and through all and with all is one who does not move nor change but is the same yesterday today and for ever  and on him my child and not on this bubble of an earth do you and i and all mankind depend  but i have not yet told you why the peruvians ought to have expected an earthquake  true  i will tell you another time     chapter iiivolcanos   you want to know why the spaniards in peru and ecuador should have expected an earthquake  because they had had so many already  the shaking of the ground in their country had gone on perpetually till they had almost ceased to care about it always hoping that no very heavy shock would come and being now and then terribly mistaken  for instance in the province of quito in the year 1797 from thirty to forty thousand people were killed at once by an earthquake  one would have thought that warning enough but the warning was not taken and now this very year thousands more have been killed in the very same country in the very same way  they might have expected as much  for their towns are built most of them close to volcanossome of the highest and most terrible in the world  and wherever there are volcanos there will be earthquakes  you may have earthquakes without volcanos now and then but volcanos without earthquakes seldom or never  how does that come to pass  does a volcano make earthquakes  no we may rather say that earthquakes are trying to make volcanos  for volcanos are the holes which the steam underground has burst open that it may escape into the air above  they are the chimneys of the great blastfurnaces underground in which madam how pounds and melts up the old rocks to make them into new ones and spread them out over the land above  and are there many volcanos in the world  you have heard of vesuvius of course in italy and etna in sicily and hecla in iceland  and you have heard too of kilauea in the sandwich islands and of peles hairthe yellow threads of lava like fine spun glass which are blown from off its pools of fire and which the sandwich islanders believed to be the hair of a goddess who lived in the craterand you have read too i hope in miss yonges book of golden deeds the noble story of the christian chieftainess who in order to persuade her subjects to become christians also went down into the crater and defied the goddess of the volcano and came back unhurt and triumphant  but if you look at the map you will see that there are many many more get keith johnstons physical atlas from the schoolroomof course it is there for a schoolroom without a physical atlas is like a needle without an eyeand look at the map which is called phenomena of volcanic action  you will see in it many red dots which mark the volcanos which are still burning and black dots which mark those which have been burning at some time or other not very long ago scattered about the world  sometimes they are single like the red dot at otaheite or at easter island in the pacific  sometimes the are in groups or clusters like the cluster at the sandwich islands or in the friendly islands or in new zealand  and if we look in the atlantic we shall see four clusters one in poor half destroyed iceland in the far north one in the azores one in the canaries and one in the cape de verds  and there is one dot in those canaries which we must not overlook for it is no other than the famous peak of teneriffe a volcano which is hardly burnt out yet and may burn up again any day standing up out of the sea more than 12000 feet high still and once it must have been double that height  some think that it is perhaps the true mount atlas which the old greeks named when first they ventured out of the straits of gibraltar down the coast of africa and saw the great peak far to the westward with the clouds cutting off its top and said that it was a mighty giant the brother of the evening star who held up the sky upon his shoulders in the midst of the fortunate islands the gardens of the daughter of the evening star full of strange golden fruits and that perseus had turned him into stone when he passed him with the gorgons head  but you will see too that most of these red and black dots run in crooked lines and that many of the clusters run in lines likewise  look at one line by far the largest on the earth  you will learn a good deal of geography from it  the red dots begin at a place called the terribles on the east side of the bay of bengal  they run on here and there along the islands of sumatra and java and through the spice islands and at new guinea the line of red dots forks  one branch runs southeast through islands whose names you never heard to the friendly islands and to new zealand the other runs north through the philippines through japan through kamschatka and then there is a little break of sea between asia and america but beyond it the red dots begin again in the aleutian islands and then turn down the whole west coast of america down from mount elias in what was till lately russian america towards british columbia then after a long gap there are one or two in lower california and we must not forget the terrible earthquake which has just shaken san francisco between those two last places and when we come down to mexico we find the red dots again plentiful and only too plentiful for they mark the great volcanic line of mexico of which you will read i hope some day in humboldts works  but the line does not stop there after the little gap of the isthmus of panama it begins again in quito the very country which has just been shaken and in which stand the huge volcanos chimborazo pasto antisana cotopaxi pichincha tunguraguasmooth cones from 15000 to 20000 feet high shining white with snow till the heat inside melts it off and leaves the cinders of which the peaks are made all black and ugly among the clouds ready to burst in smoke and fire  south of them again there is a long gap and then another line of red dotsarequiba chipicani gualatieri atacamaas high as or higher than those in quito and this remember is the other country which has just been shaken  on the seashore below those volcanos stood the hapless city of arica whose ruins we saw in the picture  then comes another gap and then a line of more volcanos in chili at the foot of which happened that fearful earthquake of 1835 besides many more of which you will read some day in that noble book the voyage of the beagle and so the line of dots runs down to the southernmost point of america  what a line we have traced  long enough to go round the world if it were straight  a line of holes out of which steam and heat and cinders and melted stones are rushing up perpetually in one place and another  now the holes in this line which are near each other have certainly something to do with each other  for instance when the earth shook the other day round the volcanos of quito it shook also round the volcanos of peru though they were 600 miles away  and there are many stories of earthquakes being felt or awful underground thunder heard while volcanos were breaking out hundreds of miles away  i will give you a very curious instance of that  if you look at the west indies on the map you will see a line of red dots runs through the windward islands there are two volcanos in them one in guadaloupe and one in st vincent i will tell you a curious story presently about that last and little volcanos if they have ever been real volcanos at all which now only send out mud in trinidad  there the red dots stop but then begins along the north coast of south america a line of mountain country called cumana and caraccas which has often been horribly shaken by earthquakes  now once when the volcano in st vincent began to pour out a vast stream of melted lava a noise like thunder was heard underground over thousands of square miles beyond those mountains in the plains of calabozo and on the banks of the apure more than 600 miles away from the volcanoa plain sign that there was something underground which joined them together perhaps a long crack in the earth  look for yourselves at the places and you will see that as humboldt says it is as strange as if an eruption of mount vesuvius was heard in the north of france  so it seems as if these lines of volcanos stood along cracks in the rind of the earth through which the melted stuff inside was for ever trying to force its way and that as the crack got stopped up in one place by the melted stuff cooling and hardening again into stone it was burst in another place and a fresh volcano made or an old one reopened  now we can understand why earthquakes should be most common round volcanos and we can understand too why they would be worst before a volcano breaks out because then the steam is trying to escape and we can understand too why people who live near volcanos are glad to see them blazing and spouting because then they have hope that the steam has found its way out and will not make earthquakes any more for a while but still that is merely foolish speculation on chance  volcanos can never be trusted  no one knows when one will break out or what it will do and those who live close to themas the city of naples is close to mount vesuviusmust not be astonished if they are blown up or swallowed up as that great and beautiful city of naples may be without a warning any day  for what happened to that same mount vesuvius nearly 1800 years ago in the old roman times  for ages and ages it had been lying quiet like any other hill  beautiful cities were built at its foot filled with people who were as handsome and as comfortable and i am afraid as wicked as people ever were on earth  fair gardens vineyards oliveyards covered the mountain slopes  it was held to be one of the paradises of the world  as for the mountains being a burning mountain who ever thought of that  to be sure on the top of it was a great round crater or cup a mile or more across and a few hundred yards deep  but that was all overgrown with bushes and wild vines full of boars and deer  what sign of fire was there in that  to be sure also there was an ugly place below by the seashore called the phlegraen fields where smoke and brimstone came out of the ground and a lake called avernus over which poisonous gases hung and which old stories told was one of the mouths of the nether pit  but what of that  it had never harmed any one and how could it harm them  so they all lived on merrily and happily enough till in the year ad 79 that was eight years you know after the emperor titus destroyed jerusalem there was stationed in the bay of naples a roman admiral called pliny who was also a very studious and learned man and author of a famous old book on natural history  he was staying on shore with his sister and as he sat in his study she called him out to see a strange cloud which had been hanging for some time over the top of mount vesuvius  it was in shape just like a pinetree not of course like one of our branching scotch firs here but like an italian stone pine with a long straight stem and a flat parasolshaped top  sometimes it was blackish sometimes spotted and the good admiral pliny who was always curious about natural science ordered his cutter and went away across the bay to see what it could be  earthquake shocks had been very common for the last few days but i do not suppose that pliny had any notion that the earthquakes and the cloud had aught to do with each other  however he soon found out that they had and to his cost  when he got near the opposite shore some of the sailors met him and entreated him to turn back  cinders and pumicestones were falling down from the sky and flames breaking out of the mountain above  but pliny would go on he said that if people were in danger it was his duty to help them and that he must see this strange cloud and note down the different shapes into which it changed  but the hot ashes fell faster and faster the sea ebbed out suddenly and left them nearly dry and pliny turned away to a place called stabiae to the house of his friend pomponianus who was just going to escape in a boat  brave pliny told him not to be afraid ordered his bath like a true roman gentleman and then went into dinner with a cheerful face  flames came down from the mountain nearer and nearer as the night drew on but pliny persuaded his friend that they were only fires in some villages from which the peasants had fled and then went to bed and slept soundly  however in the middle of the night they found the courtyard being fast filled with cinders and if they had not woke up the admiral in time he would never have been able to get out of the house  the earthquake shocks grew stronger and fiercer till the house was ready to fall and pliny and his friend and the sailors and the slaves all fled into the open fields amid a shower of stones and cinders tying pillows over their heads to prevent their being beaten down  the day had come by this time but not the dawnfor it was still pitch dark as night  they went down to their boats upon the shore but the sea raged so horribly that there was no getting on board of them then pliny grew tired and made his men spread a sail for him and lay down on it but there came down upon them a rush of flames and a horrible smell of sulphur and all ran for their lives  some of the slaves tried to help the admiral upon his legs but he sank down again overpowered with the brimstone fumes and so was left behind  when they came back again there he lay dead but with his clothes in order and his face as quiet as if he had been only sleeping  and that was the end of a brave and learned mana martyr to duty and to the love of science  but what was going on in the meantime  under clouds of ashes cinders mud lava three of those happy cities were buried at onceherculaneum pompeii stabiae  they were buried just as the people had fled from them leaving the furniture and the earthenware often even jewels and gold behind and here and there among them a human being who had not had time to escape from the dreadful deluge of dust  the ruins of herculaneum and pompeii have been dug into since and the paintings especially in pompeii are found upon the walls still fresh preserved from the air by the ashes which have covered them in  when you are older you perhaps will go to naples and see in its famous museum the curiosities which have been dug out of the ruined cities and you will walk i suppose along the streets of pompeii and see the wheeltracks in the pavement along which carts and chariots rumbled 2000 years ago meanwhile if you go nearer home to the crystal palace and to the pompeian court as it is called you will see an exact model of one of these old buried houses copied even to the very paintings on the wells and judge for yourself as far as a little boy can judge what sort of life these thoughtless luckless people lived 2000 years ago  and what had become of vesuvius the treacherous mountain  half or more than half of the side of the old crater had been blown away and what was left which is now called the monte somma stands in a half circle round the new cone and new crater which is burning at this very day  true after that eruption which killed pliny vesuvius fell asleep again and did not awake for 134 years and then again for 269 years but it has been growing more and more restless as the ages have passed on and now hardly a year passes without its sending out smoke and stones from its crater and streams of lava from its sides  and now i suppose you will want to know what a volcano is like and what a cone and a crater and lava are  what a volcano is like it is easy enough to show you for they are the most simply and beautifully shaped of all mountains and they are alike all over the world whether they be large or small  almost every volcano in the world i believe is or has been once of the shape which you see in the drawing opposite even those volcanos in the sandwich islands of which you have often heard which are now great lakes of boiling fire upon flat downs without any cone to them at all  they i believe are volcanos which have fallen in ages ago just as in java a whole burning mountain fell in on the night of the 11th of august in the year 1772 then after a short and terrible earthquake a bright cloud suddenly covered the whole mountain  the people who dwelt around it tried to escape but before the poor souls could get away the earth sunk beneath their feet and the whole mountain fell in and was swallowed up with a noise as if great cannon were being fired  forty villages and nearly 3000 people were destroyed and where the mountain had been was only a plain of redhot stones  in the same way in the year 1698 the top of a mountain in quito fell in in a single night leaving only two immense peaks of rock behind and pouring out great floods of mud mixed with dead fish for there are underground lakes among those volcanos which swarm with little fish which never see the light  but most volcanos as i say are or have been the shape of the one which you see here  this is cotopaxi in quito more than 19000 feet in height  all those sloping sides are made of cinders and ashes braced together i suppose by bars of solid lavastone inside which prevent the whole from crumbling down  the upper part you see is white with snow as far down as a line which is 15000 feet above the sea for the mountain is in the tropics close to the equator and the snow will not lie in that hot climate any lower down  but now and then the snow melts off and rushes down the mountain side in floods of water and of mud and the cindery cone of cotopaxi stands out black and dreadful against the clear blue sky and then the people of that country know what is coming the mountain is growing so hot inside that it melts off its snowy covering and soon it will burst forth with smoke and steam and redhot stones and earthquakes which will shake the ground and roars that will be heard it may be hundreds of miles away  and now for the words cone crater lava  if i can make you understand those words you will see why volcanos must be in general of the shape of cotopaxi  cone crater lava those words make up the alphabet of volcano learning the cone is the outside of a huge chimney the crater is the mouth of it the lava is the ore which is being melted in the furnace below that it may flow out over the surface of the old land and make new land instead  and where is the furnace itself  who can tell that  under the roots of the mountains under the depths of the sea down the path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultures eye hath not seen the lions whelp hath not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by it  there he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the mountain by the roots he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every precious thingwhile we like little ants run up and down outside the earth scratching like ants a few feet down and calling that a deep ravine or peeping a few feet down into the crater of a volcano unable to guess what precious things may lie belowbelow even the fire which blazes and roars up through the thin crust of the earth  for of the inside of this earth we know nothing whatsoever we only know that it is on an average several times as heavy as solid rock but how that can be we know not  so let us look at the chimney and what comes out of it for we can see very little more  why is a volcano like a cone  for the same cause for which a molehill is like a cone though a very rough one and that the little heaps which the burrowing beetles make on the moor or which the antlions in france make in the sand are all something in the shape of a cone with a hole like a crater in the middle  what the beetle and the antlion do on a very little scale the steam inside the earth does on a great scale  when once it has forced a vent into the outside air it tears out the rocks underground grinds them small against each other often into the finest dust and blasts them out of the hole which it has made  some of them fall back into the hole and are shot out again but most of them fall round the hole most of them close to it and fewer of them farther off till they are piled up in a ring round it just as the sand is piled up round a beetles burrow  for days and weeks and months this goes on even it may be for hundreds of years till a great cone is formed round the steam vent hundreds or thousands of feet in height of dust and stones and of cinders likewise  for recollect that when the steam has blown away the cold earth and rock near the surface of the ground it begins blowing out the hot rocks down below redhot whitehot and at last actually melted  but these as they are hurled into the cool air above become ashes cinders and blocks of stone again making the hill on which they fall bigger and bigger continually  and thus does wise madam how stand in no need of bricklayers but makes her chimneys build themselves  and why is the mouth of the chimney called a crater  crater as you know is greek for a cup  and the mouth of these chimneys when they have become choked and stopped working are often just the shape of a cup or as the germans call them kessels which means kettles or caldrons  i have seen some of them as beautifully and exactly rounded as if a cunning engineer had planned them and had them dug out with the spade  at first of course their sides and bottom are nothing but loose stones cinders slag ashes such as would be thrown out of a furnace  but madam how who whenever she makes an ugly desolate place always tries to cover over its ugliness and set something green to grow over it and make it pretty once more does so often and often by her wornout craters  i have seen them covered with short sweet turf like so many chalk downs  i have seen them too filled with bushes which held woodcocks and wild boars  once i came on a beautiful round crater on the top of a mountain which was filled at the bottom with a splendid crop of potatoes  though madam how had not put them there herself she had at least taught the honest germans to put them there  and often madam how turns her wornout craters into beautiful lakes  there are many such craterlakes in italy as you will see if ever you go there as you may see in english galleries painted by wilson a famous artist who died before you were born  you recollect lord macaulays ballad the battle of the lake regillus  then that lake regillus if i recollect right is one of these round crater lakes many such deep clear blue lakes have i seen in the eifel in germany and many a curious plant have i picked on their shores where once the steam blasted and the earthquake roared and the ashclouds rushed up high into the heaven and buried all the land around in dust which is now fertile soil  and long did i puzzle to find out why the water stood in some craters while others within a mile of them perhaps were perfectly dry  that i never found out for myself  but learned men tell me that the ashes which fall back into the crater if the bottom of it be wet from rain will sometimes set as it is called into a hard cement and so make the bottom of the great bowl waterproof as if it were made of earthenware  but what gives the craters this cupshape at first  thinkwhile the steam and stones are being blown out the crater is an open funnel with more or less upright walls inside  as the steam grows weaker fewer and fewer stones fall outside and more and more fall back again inside  at last they quite choke up the bottom of the great round hole  perhaps too the lava or melted rock underneath cools and grows hard and that chokes up the hole lower down  then down from the round edge of the crater the stones and cinders roll inward more and more  the rains wash them down the wind blows them down  they roll to the middle and meet each other and stop  and so gradually the steep funnel becomes a round cup  you may prove for yourself that it must be so if you will try  do you not know that if you dig a round hole in the ground and leave it to crumble in it is sure to become cupshaped at last though at first its sides may have been quite upright like those of a bucket if you do not know get a trowel and make your little experiment  and now you ought to understand what cone and crater mean  and more if you will think for yourself you may guess what would come out of a volcano when it broke out in an eruption as it is usually called first clouds of steam and dust what you would call smoke then volleys of stones some cool some burning hot and at the last because it lies lowest of all the melted rock itself which is called lava  and where would that come out  at the top of the chimney  at the top of the cone  no  madam how as i told you usually makes things make themselves  she has made the chimney of the furnace make itself and next she will make the furnacedoor make itself  the melted lava rises in the craterthe funnel inside the conebut it never gets to the top  it is so enormously heavy that the sides of the cone cannot bear its weight and give way low down  and then through ashes and cinders the melted lava burrows out twisting and twirling like an enormous fiery earthworm till it gets to the air outside and runs off down the mountain in a stream of fire  and so you may see as are to be seen on vesuvius now two eruptions at onceone of burning stones above and one of melted lava below  and what is lava  that i think i must tell you another time  for when i speak of it i shall have to tell you more about madam how and her ways of making the ground on which you stand than i can say just now  but if you want to know as i dare say you do what the eruption of a volcano is like you may read what follows  i did not see it happen for i never had the good fortune of seeing a mountain burning though i have seen many and many a one which has been burntextinct volcanos as they are called  the man who saw ita very good friend of mine and a very good man of science alsowent last year to see an eruption on vesuvius not from the main crater but from a small one which had risen up suddenly on the outside of it and he gave me leave when i told him that i was writing for children to tell them what he saw  this new cone he said was about 200 feet high and perhaps 80 or 100 feet across at the top  and as he stood below it it was not safe to go up it smoke rolled up from its top rosy pink below from the glare of the caldron and above faint greenish or blueish silver of indescribable beauty from the light of the moon  but moreby good chance the cone began to send out not smoke only but brilliant burning stones  each explosion he says was like a vast girandole of rockets with a noise such as rockets would make like the waves on a beach or the wind blowing through shrouds  the mountain was trembling the whole time  so it went on for two hours and more sometimes eight or ten explosions in a minute and more than 1000 stones in each some as large as two bricks end to end  the largest ones mostly fell back into the crater but the smaller ones being thrown higher and more acted on by the wind fell in immense numbers on the leeward slope of the cone of course making it bigger and bigger as i have explained already to you and of course as they were intensely hot and bright making the cone look as if it too was redhot  but it was not so he says really  the colour of the stones was rather golden and they spotted the black cone over with their golden showers the smaller ones stopping still the bigger ones rolling down and jumping along just like hares  a wonderful pedestal he says for the explosion which surmounted it  how high the stones flew up he could not tell  there was generally one which went much higher than the rest and pierced upwards towards the moon who looked calmly down mocking such vain attempts to reach her  the large stones of course did not rise so high and some he says only just appeared over the rim of the cone above which they came floating leisurely up to show their brilliant forms and intense white light for an instant and then subside again  try and picture that to yourselves remembering that this was only a little side eruption of no more importance to the whole mountain than the fall of a slate off the roof is of importance to the whole house  and then think how mean and weak mans fireworks and even mans heaviest artillery are compared with the terrible beauty and terrible strength of madam hows artillery underneath our feet                   c                  \                   \           a  \  e                     \            \  e ground           b    \      ground               \           d     d   d                                                     now look at this figure  it represents a section of a volcano that is one cut in half to show you the inside  a is the cone of cinders  b the black line up through the middle is the funnel or crack through which steam ashes lava and everything else rises  c is the crater mouth  d d d which looks broken are the old rocks which the steam heaved up and burst before it could get out  and what are the black lines across marked e e e  they are the streams of lava which have burrowed out some covered up again in cinders some lying bare in the open air some still inside the cone bracing it together holding it up something like this is the inside of a volcano     chapter ivthe transformations of a grain of soil   why you ask are there such terrible things as volcanos  of what use can they be  they are of use enough my child and of many more uses doubt not than we know as yet or ever shall know  but of one of their uses i can tell you  they make or help to make divers and sundry curious things from gunpowder to your body and mine  what  i can understand their helping to make gunpowder because the sulphur in it is often found round volcanos and i know the story of the brave spaniard who when his fellows wanted materials for gunpowder had himself lowered in a basket down the crater of a south american volcano and gathered sulphur for them off the burning cliffs but how can volcanos help to make me  am i made of lava  or is there lava in me  my child i did not say that volcanos helped to make you  i said that they helped to make your body which is a very different matter as i beg you to remember now and always  your body is no more you yourself than the hoop which you trundle or the pony which you ride  it is like them your servant your tool your instrument your organ with which you work and a very useful trusty cunninglycontrived organ it is and therefore i advise you to make good use of it for you are responsible for it  but you yourself are not your body or your brain but something else which we call your soul your spirit your life  and that you yourself would remain just the same if it were taken out of your body and put into the body of a bee or of a lion or any other body or into no body at all  at least so i believe and so i am happy to say nine hundred and ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine people out of every million have always believed because they have used their human instincts and their common sense and have obeyed without knowing it the warning of a great and good philosopher called herder that the organ is in no case the power which works by it which is as much as to say that the engine is not the enginedriver nor the spade the gardener  there have always been and always will be a few people who cannot see that  they think that a mans soul is part of his body and that he himself is not one thing but a great number of things  they think that his mind and character are only made up of all the thoughts and feelings and recollections which have passed through his brain and that as his brain changes he himself must change and become another person and then another person again continually  but do you not agree with them but keep in mind wise herders warning that you are not to confound the organ with the power or the engine with the driver or your body with yourself and then we will go on and consider how a volcano and the lava which flows from it helps to make your body  now i know that the scotch have a saying that you cannot make broth out of whinstones which is their name for lava  but though they are very clever people they are wrong there  i never saw any broth in scotland as far as i know but what whinstones had gone to the making of it nor a scotch boy who had not eaten many a bit of whinstone and been all the better for it  of course if you simply put the whinstones into a kettle and boiled them you would not get much out of them by such rough cookery as that but madam how is the best and most delicate of all cooks and she knows how to pound and soak and stew whinstones so delicately that she can make them sauce and seasoning for meat vegetables puddings and almost everything that you eat and can put into your veins things which were spouted up redhot by volcanos ages and ages since perhaps at the bottom of ancient seas which are now firm dry land  this is very strangeas all madam hows doings are  and you would think it stranger still if you had ever seen the flowing of a lava stream  out of a cave of slag and cinders in the black hillside rushes a golden river flowing like honey and yet so tough that you cannot thrust a stick into it and so heavy that great stones if you throw them on it float on the top and are carried down like corks on water  it is so hot that you cannot stand near it more than a few seconds hotter perhaps than any fire you ever saw but as it flows the outside of it cools in the cool air and gets covered with slag and cinders something like those which you may see thrown out of the furnaces in the black country of staffordshire  sometimes these cling together above the lava stream and make a tunnel through the cracks in which you may see the fiery river rushing and roaring down below  but mostly they are kept broken and apart and roll and slide over each other on the top of the lava crashing and clanging as they grind together with a horrid noise  of course that stream like all streams runs towards the lower grounds  it slides down glens and fills them up down the beds of streams driving off the water in hissing steam and sometimes as it did in iceland a few years ago falls over some cliff turning what had been a waterfall into a firefall and filling up the pool below with blocks of lava suddenly cooled with a clang and roar like that of chains shaken or brazen vessels beaten which is heard miles and miles away  of course woe to the crops and gardens which stand in its way  it crawls over them all and eats them up  it shoves down houses it sets woods on fire and sends the steam and gas out of the treetrunks hissing into the air  and curiously enough it does this often without touching the trees themselves  it flows round the trunks it did so in a wood in the sandwich islands a few years ago and of course sets them on fire by its heat till nothing is left of them but blackened posts  but the moisture which comes out of the poor tree in steam blows so hard against the lava round that it can never touch the tree and a round hole is left in the middle of the lava where the tree was  sometimes too the lava will spit out liquid fire among the branches of the trees which hangs down afterwards from them in tassels of slag and yet by the very same means the steam in the branches will prevent the liquid fire burning them off or doing anything but just scorch the bark  but i can tell you a more curious story still  the lava stream you must know is continually sending out little jets of gas and steam some of it it may have brought up from the very inside of the earth most of it i suspect comes from the damp herbage and damp soil over which it runs  be that as it may a lava stream out of mount etna in sicily came once down straight upon the town of catania  everybody thought that the town would be swallowed up and the poor people there who knew no better began to pray to st agathaa famous saint who they say was martyred there ages agoand who they fancy has power in heaven to save them from the lava stream  and really what happened was enough to make ignorant people such as they were think that st agatha had saved them the lava stream came straight down upon the town wall  another foot and it would have touched it and have begun shoving it down with a force compared with which all the batteringrams that you ever read of in ancient histories would be childs toys  but lo and behold when the lava stream got within a few inches of the wall it stopped and began to rear itself upright and build itself into a wall beside the wall  it rose and rose till i believe in one place it overtopped the wall and began to curl over in a crest  all expected that it would fall over into the town at last but no there it stopped and cooled and hardened and left the town unhurt  all the inhabitants said of course that st agatha had done it but learned men found out that as usual madam how had done it by making it do itself  the lava was so full of gas which was continually blowing out in little jets that when it reached the wall it actually blew itself back from the wall and as the wall was luckily strong enough not to be blown down the lava kept blowing itself back till it had time to cool  and so my dear child there was no miracle at all in the matter and the poor people of catania had to thank not st agatha and any interference of hers but simply him who can preserve just as he can destroy by those laws of nature which are the breath of his mouth and the servants of his will  but in many a case the lava does not stop  it rolls on and on over the downs and through the valleys till it reaches the seashore as it did in hawaii in the sandwich islands this very year  and then it cools of course but often not before it has killed the fish by its sulphurous gases and heat perhaps for miles around  and there is good reason to believe that the fossil fish which we so often find in rocks perfect in every bone lying sometimes in heaps and twisted as i have seen them as if they had died suddenly and violently were killed in this very way either by heat from lava streams or else by the bursting up of gases poisoning the water in earthquakes and eruptions in the bottom of the sea  i could tell you many stories of fish being killed in thousands by earthquakes and volcanos during the last few years  but we have not time to tell about everything  and now you will ask me with more astonishment than ever what possible use can there be in these destroying streams of fire  and certainly if you had ever seen a lava stream even when cool and looked down as i have done at the great river of rough black blocks streaming away far and wide over the land you would think it the most hideous and the most useless thing you ever saw  and yet my dear child there is one who told men to judge not according to the appearance but to judge righteous judgment  he said that about matters spiritual and human but it is quite as true about matters natural which also are his work and all obey his will  now if you had seen as i have seen close round the edges of these lava streams and sometimes actually upon them or upon the great bed of dust and ashes which have been hurled far and wide out of ancient volcanos happy homesteads rich crops hemp and flax and wheat tobacco lucerne roots and vineyards laden with white and purple grapes you would have begun to suspect that the lava streams were not after all such very bad neighbours  and when i tell you that volcanic soils as they are called that is soil which has at first been lava or ashes are generally the richest soils in the worldthat for instance as some one told me the other day there is soil in the beautiful island of madeira so thin that you cannot dig more than two or three inches down without coming to the solid rock of lava or what is harder even obsidian which is the black glass which volcanos sometimes make and which the old mexicans used to chip into swords and arrows because they had no steeland that this soil thin as it is is yet so fertile that in it used to be grown the grapes of which the famous madeira wine was madewhen you remember this and when you remember too the lothians of scotland about which i shall have to say a little to you just now then you will perhaps agree with me that lady why has not been so very wrong in setting madam how to pour out lava and ashes upon the surface of the earth  for seedown below under the roots of the mountains madam how works continually like a chemist in his laboratory melting together all the rocks which are the bones and leavings of the old worlds  if they stayed down below there they would be of no use while they will be of use up here in the open air  for year by yearby the washing of rain and rivers and also i am sorry to say by the ignorant and foolish waste of mankindthousands and millions of tons of good stuff are running into the sea every year which would if it could be kept on land make food for men and animals plants and trees  so in order to supply the continual waste of this upper world madam how is continually melting up the under world and pouring it out of the volcanos like manure to renew the face of the earth  in these lava rocks and ashes which she sends up there are certain substances without which men cannot livewithout which a stalk of corn or grass cannot grow  without potash without magnesia both of which are in your veins and minewithout silicates as they are called which give flint to the stems of corn and of grass and so make them stiff and hard and able to stand uprightand very probably without the carbonic acid gas which comes out of the volcanos and is taken up by the leaves of plants and turned by madam hows cookery into solid woodwithout all these things and i suspect without a great many more things which come out of volcanosi do not see how this beautiful green world could get on at all  of course when the lava first cools on the surface of the ground it is hard enough and therefore barren enough  but madam how sets to work upon it at once with that delicate little waterspade of hers which we call rain and with that alone century after century and age after age she digs the lava stream down atom by atom and silts it over the country round in rich manure  so that if madam how has been a rough and hasty workwoman in pumping her treasures up out of her mine with her great steampumps she shows herself delicate and tender and kindly enough in giving them away afterwards  nay even the fine dust which is sometimes blown out of volcanos is useful to countries far away  so light it is that it rises into the sky and is wafted by the wind across the seas  so in the year 1783 ashes from the skaptar jokull in iceland were carried over the north of scotland and even into holland hundreds of miles to the south  so again when in the year 1812 the volcano of st vincent in the west india islands poured out torrents of lava after mighty earthquakes which shook all that part of the world a strange thing happened about which i have often heard from those who saw it in the island of barbados several hundred miles away  for when the sun rose in the morning it was a sunday morning the sky remained more dark than any night and all the poor negroes crowded terrified out of their houses into the streets fancying the end of the world was come  but a learned man who was there finding that though the sun was risen it was still pitchy dark opened his window and found that it was stuck fast by something on the ledge outside and when he thrust it open found the ledge covered deep in soft red dust and he instantly said like a wise man as he was the volcano of st vincent must have broken out and these are the ashes from it  then he ran down stairs and quieted the poor negroes telling them not to be afraid for the end of the world was not coming just yet  but still the dust went on falling till the whole island i am told was covered an inch thick and the same thing happened in the other islands round  people thoughtand they had reason to think from what had often happened elsewherethat though the dust might hurt the crops for that year it would make them richer in years to come because it would act as manure upon the soil and so it did after a few years but it did terrible damage at the time breaking off the boughs of trees and covering up the crops and in st vincent itself whole estates were ruined  it was a frightful day but i know well that behind that how there was a why for its happening and happening too about that very time which all who know the history of negro slavery in the west indies can guess for themselves and confess i hope that in this case as in all others when lady why seems most severe she is often most just and kind  ah my dear child that i could go on talking to you of this for hours and days  but i have time now only to teach you the alphabet of these mattersand indeed i know little more than the alphabet myself but if the very letters of madam hows book and the mere a b ab of it which i am trying to teach you are so wonderful and so beautiful what must its sentences be and its chapters  and what must the whole book be like but that last none can read save he who wrote it before the worlds were made  but now i see you want to ask a question  let us have it out  i would sooner answer one question of yours than tell you ten things without your asking  is there potash and magnesia and silicates in the soil here  and if there is where did they come from  for there are no volcanos in england  yes  there are such things in the soil and little enough of them as the farmers here know too well  for we here in windsor forest are on the very poorest and almost the newest soil in england and when madam how had used up all her good materials in making the rest of the island she carted away her dry rubbish and shot it down here for us to make the best of and i do not think that we and our forefathers have done so very ill with it  but where the rich part or staple of our soils came from first it would be very difficult to say so often has madam how made and unmade and remade england and sifted her materials afresh every time but if you go to the lowlands of scotland you may soon see where the staple of the soil came from there and that i was right in saying that there were atoms of lava in every scotch boys broth  not that there were ever as far as i know volcanos in scotland or in england  madam how has more than one string to her bow or two strings either so when she pours out her lavas she does not always pour them out in the open air  sometimes she pours them out at the bottom of the sea as she did in the north of ireland and the southwest of scotland when she made the giants causeway and fingals cave in staffa too at the bottom of the old chalk ocean ages and ages since  sometimes she squirts them out between the layers of rock or into cracks which the earthquakes have made in what are called trap dykes of which there are plenty to be seen in scotland and in wales likewise  and then she lifts the earth up from the bottom of the sea and sets the rain to wash away all the soft rocks till the hard lava stands out in great hills upon the surface of the ground  then the rain begins eating away those lavahills likewise and manuring the earth with them and wherever those lavahills stand up whether great or small there is pretty sure to be rich land around them if you look at the geological map of england and ireland and the red spots upon it which will show you where those old lavas are you will see how much of them there is in england at the lizard point in cornwall and how much more in scotland and the north of ireland  in south devon in shropshirewith its beautiful wrekin and caradoc and lawleyin wales round snowdon where some of the soil is very rich and above all in the lowlands of scotland you see these red marks showing the old lavas which are always fertile except the poor old granite which is of little use save to cut into building stone because it is too full of quartzthat is flint  think of this the next time you go through scotland in the railway especially when you get near edinburgh  as you run through the lothians with their noble crops of corn and roots and grassesand their great homesteads each with its engine chimney which makes steam do the work of menyou will see rising out of the plain hills of dark rock sometimes in single knobs like berwick law or stirling cragsometimes in noble ranges like arthurs seat or the sidlaws or the ochils  think what these black bare lumps of whinstone are and what they do  remember they are minesnot gold mines but something richer stillfood mines which madam how thrust into the inside of the earth ages and ages since as molten lava rock and then cooled them and lifted them up and pared them away with her iceplough and her rainspade and spread the stuff of them over the wide carses round to make in that bleak northern climate which once carried nothing but firtrees and heather a soil fit to feed a great people to cultivate in them industry and science and valiant selfdependence and selfhelp and to gather round the heart of midlothian and the castle rock of edinburgh the stoutest and the ablest little nation which lady why has made since she made the greeks who fought at salamis  of those greeks you have read or ought to read in mr coxs tales of the persian war  some day you will read of them in their own books written in their grand old tongue  remember that lady why made them as she has made the scotch by first preparing a country for them which would call out all their courage and their skill and then by giving them the courage and the skill to make use of the land where she had put them  and now think what a wonderful fairy tale you might write for yourselfand every word of it trueof the adventures of one atom of potash or some other salt no bigger than a needles point in such a lava stream as i have been telling of  how it has run round and round and will run round age after age in an endless chain of change  how it began by being molten fire underground how then it became part of a hard cold rock lifted up into a cliff beaten upon by rain and storm and washed down into the soil of the plain till perhaps the little atom of mineral met with the rootlet of some great tree and was taken up into its sap in spring through tiny veins and hardened the next year into a piece of solid wood  and then how that tree was cut down and its logs it may be burnt upon the hearth till the little atom of mineral lay among the woodashes and was shovelled out and thrown upon the field and washed into the soil again and taken up by the roots of a clover plant and became an atom of vegetable matter once more  and then how perhaps a rabbit came by and ate the clover and the grain of mineral became part of the rabbit and then how a hawk killed that rabbit and ate it and so the grain became part of the hawk and how the farmer shot the hawk and it fell perchance into a stream and was carried down into the sea and when its body decayed the little grain sank through the water and was mingled with the mud at the bottom of the sea  but do its wanderings stop there  not so my child  nothing upon this earth as i told you once before continues in one stay  that grain of mineral might stay at the bottom of the sea a thousand or ten thousand years and yet the time would come when madam how would set to work on it again  slowly perhaps she would sink that mud so deep and cover it up with so many fresh beds of mud or sand or lime that under the heavy weight and perhaps too under the heat of the inside of the earth that mud would slowly change to hard slate rock and ages after it may be madam how might melt that slate rock once more and blast it out and then through the mouth of a volcano the little grain of mineral might rise into the open air again to make fresh soil as it had done thousands of years before  for madam how can manufacture many different things out of the same materials  she may have so wrought with that grain of mineral that she may have formed it into part of a precious stone and men may dig it out of the rock or pick it up in the riverbed and polish it and set it and wear it  think of thatthat in the jewels which your mother or your sisters wear or in your fathers signet ring there may be atoms which were part of a live plant or a live animal millions of years ago and may be parts of a live plant or a live animal millions of years hence  think over again and learn by heart the links of this endless chain of change fire turned into stonestone into soilsoil into plantplant into animalanimal into soilsoil into stonestone into fire againand then fire into stone again and the old thing run round once more  so it is and so it must be  for all things which are born in time must change in time and die in time till that last day of this our little earth in which     like to the baseless fabric of a vision    the cloudcapped towers the gorgeous palaces    the solemn temples the great globe itself    yea all things which inherit shall dissolve    and like an unsubstantial pageant faded    leave not a rack behind  so all things change and die and so your body too must change and diebut not yourself  madam how made your body and she must unmake it again as she unmakes all her works in time and space but you child your soul and life and self she did not make and over you she has no power  for you were not like your body created in time and space and you will endure though time and space should be no more because you are the child of the living god who gives to each thing its own body and can give you another body even as seems good to him     chapter vthe iceplough   you want to know why i am so fond of that little bit of limestone no bigger than my hand which lies upon the shelf why i ponder over it so often and show it to all sensible people who come to see me  i do so not only for the sake of the person who gave it to me but because there is written on it a letter out of madam hows alphabet which has taken wise men many a year to decipher  i could not decipher that letter when first i saw the stone  more shame for me for i had seen it often before and understood it well enough in many another page of madam hows great book  take the stone and see if you can find out anything strange about it  well it is only a bit of marble as big as my hand that looks as if it had been and really has been broken off by a hammer  but when you look again you see there is a smooth scraped part on one edge that seems to have been rubbed against a stone  now look at that rubbed part and tell me how it was done  you have seen men often polish one stone on another or scour floors with a bath brick and you will guess at first that this was polished so but if it had been then the rubbed place would have been flat but if you put your fingers over it you will find that it is not flat  it is rolled fluted channelled so that the thing or things which rubbed it must have been somewhat round  and it is covered too with very fine and smooth scratches or grooves all running over the whole in the same line  now what could have done that  of course a man could have done it if he had taken a large round stone in his hand and worked the large channellings with that and then had taken fine sand and gravel upon the points of his fingers and worked the small scratches with that  but this stone came from a place where man had perhaps never stood beforeay which perhaps had never seen the light of day before since the world was made and as i happen to know that no man made the marks upon that stone we must set to work and think again for some tool of madam hows which may have made them  and now i think you must give up guessing and i must tell you the answer to the riddle  those marks were made by a hand which is strong and yet gentle tough and yet yielding like the hand of a man a hand which handles and uses in a grip stronger than a giants its own carving tools from the great boulder stone as large as this whole room to the finest grain of sand  and that is ice  that piece of stone came from the side of the rosenlaui glacier in switzerland and it was polished by the glacier ice  the glacier melted and shrank this last hot summer farther back than it had done for many years and left bare sheets of rock which it had been scraping at for ages with all the marks fresh upon them  and that bit was broken off and brought to me who never saw a glacier myself to show me how the marks which the ice makes in switzerland are exactly the same as those which the ice has made in snowdon and in the highlands and many another place where i have traced them and written a little too about them in years gone by  and so i treasure this as a sign that madam hows ways do not change nor her laws become broken that as that great philosopher sir charles lyell will tell you when you read his books madam how is making and unmaking the surface of the earth now by exactly the same means as she was making and unmaking ages and ages since and that what is going on slowly and surely in the alps in switzerland was going on once here where we stand  it is very difficult i know for a little boy like you to understand how ice and much more how soft snow should have such strength that it can grind this little stone much more such strength as to grind whole mountains into plains  you have never seen ice and snow do harm  you cannot even recollect the crimean winter as it was called then and well for you you cannot considering all the misery it brought at home and abroad  you cannot i say recollect the crimean winter when the thames was frozen over above the bridges and the ice piled in little bergs ten to fifteen feet high which lay some of them stranded on the shores about london itself and did not melt if i recollect until the end of may  you never stood as i stood in the great winter of 18378 on battersea bridge to see the ice break up with the tide and saw the great slabs and blocks leaping and piling upon each others backs and felt the bridge tremble with their shocks and listened to their horrible grind and roar till one got some little picture in ones mind of what must be the breaking up of an icefloe in the arctic regions and what must be the danger of a ship nipped in the ice and lifted up on high like those in the pictures of arctic voyages which you are so fond of looking through  you cannot recollect how that winter even in our little blackwater brook the alder stems were all peeled white and scarred as if they had been gnawed by hares and deer simply by the rushing and scraping of the icea sight which gave me again a little picture of the destruction which the ice makes of quays and stages and houses along the shore upon the coasts of north america when suddenly setting in with wind and tide it jams and piles up high inland as you may read for yourself some day in a delightful book called frost and fire  you recollect none of these things  ice and snow are to you mere playthings and you long for winter that you may make snowballs and play hockey and skate upon the ponds and eat ice like a foolish boy till you make your stomach ache  and i dare say you have said like many another boy on a bright cheery ringing frosty day oh that it would be always winter you little knew for what you asked  you little thought what the earth would soon be like if it were always winterif one sheet of ice on the pond glued itself on to the bottom of the last sheet till the whole pond was a solid massif one snowfall lay upon the top of another snowfall till the moor was covered many feet deep and the snow began sliding slowly down the glen from coombss burying the green fields tearing the trees up by their roots burying gradually house church and village and making this place for a few thousand years what it was many thousand years ago  goodbye then after a very few winters to bees and butterflies and singingbirds and flowers and goodbye to all vegetables and fruit and bread goodbye to cotton and woollen clothes you would have if you were left alive to dress in skins and eat fish and seals if any came near enough to be caught  you would have to live in a word if you could live at all as esquimaux live now in arctic regions and as people had to live in england ages since in the times when it was always winter and icebergs floated between here and finchampstead  oh no my child thank heaven that it is not always winter and remember that winter ice and snow though it is a very good tool with which to make the land must leave the land year by year if that land is to be fit to live in  i said that if the snow piled high enough upon the moor it would come down the glen in a few years through coombss wood and i said then you would have a small glacier heresuch a glacier to compare small things with great as now comes down so many valleys in the alps or has come down all the valleys of greenland and spitzbergen till they reach the sea and there end as cliffs of ice from which great icebergs snap off continually and fall and float away wandering southward into the atlantic for many a hundred miles  you have seen drawings of such glaciers in captain cooks voyages and you may see photographs of swiss glaciers in any good london printshop and therefore you have seen almost as much about them as i have seen and may judge for yourself how you would like to live where it is always winter  now you must not ask me to tell you what a glacier is like for i have never seen one at least those which i have seen were more than fifty miles away looking like white clouds hanging on the gray mountain sides and it would be an impertinencethat means a meddling with things which i have no businessto picture to you glaciers which have been pictured so well and often by gentlemen who escape every year from their hard work in town to find among the glaciers of the alps health and refreshment and sound knowledge and that most wholesome and strengthening of all medicines toil  so you must read of them in such books as peaks passes and glaciers and mr willess wanderings in the high alps and professor tyndalls different works or you must look at them as i just now said in photographs or in pictures  but when you do that or when you see a glacier for yourself you must bear in mind what a glacier meansthat it is a river of ice fed by a lake of snow  the lake from which it springs is the eternal snowfield which stretches for miles and miles along the mountain tops fed continually by fresh snowstorms falling from the sky that snow slides off into the valleys hour by hour and as it rushes down is ground and pounded and thawed and frozen again into a sticky paste of ice which flows slowly but surely till it reaches the warm valley at the mountain foot and there melts bit by bit  the long black lines which you see winding along the white and green ice of the glacier are the stones which have fallen from the cliffs above  they will be dropped at the end of the glacier and mixed with silt and sand and other stones which have come down inside the glacier itself and piled up in the field in great mounds which are called moraines such as you may see and walk on in scotland many a time though you might never guess what they are  the river which runs out at the glacier foot is you must remember all foul and milky with the finest mud and that mud is the grinding of the rocks over which the glacier has been crawling down and scraping them as it scraped my bit of stone with pebbles and with sand  and this is the alphabet which if you learn by heart you will learn to understand how madam how uses her great iceplough to plough down her old mountains and spread the stuff of them about the valleys to make rich straths of fertile soil  nay so immensely strong because immensely heavy is the share of this her great iceplough that some will tell you and it is not for me to say that they are wrong that with it she has ploughed out all the mountain lakes in europe and in north america that such lakes for instance as ullswater or windermere have been scooped clean out of the solid rock by ice which came down these glaciers in old times  and be sure of this that next to madam hows steampump and her rainspade her great iceplough has had and has still the most to do with making the ground on which we live  do i mean that there were ever glaciers here  no i do not  there have been glaciers in scotland in plenty  and if any scotch boy shall read this book it will tell him presently how to find the marks of them far and wide over his native land  but as you my child care most about this country in which you live i will show you in any gravelpit or hollow lane upon the moor the marks not of a glacier which is an ice river but of a whole sea of ice  let us come up to the pit upon the top of the hill and look carefully at what we see there  the lower part of the pit of course is a solid rock of sand  on the top of that is a cap of gravel five six ten feet thick  now the sand was laid down there by water at the bottom of an old sea and therefore the top of it would naturally be flat and smooth as the sands at hunstanton or at bournemouth are and the gravel if it was laid down by water would naturally lie flat on it again but it does not  see how the top of the sand is dug out into deep waves and pits filled up with gravel  and see too how over some of the gravel you get sand again and then gravel again and then sand again till you cannot tell where one fairly begins and the other ends  why here are little dots of gravel six or eight feet down in what looks the solid sand rock yet the sand must have been opened somehow to put the gravel in  you say you have seen that before  you have seen the same curious twisting of the gravel and sand into each other on the top of farley hill and in the new cutting on minley hill and best of all in the railway cutting between ascot and sunningdale where upon the top the white sand and gravel is arranged in red and brown waves and festoons and curlicues almost like prince of waless feathers  yes that last is a beautiful section of icework so beautiful that i hope to have it photographed some day  now how did ice do this  well i was many a year before i found out that and i dare say i never should have found it out for myself  a gentleman named trimmer who alas is now dead was i believe the first to find it out  he knew that along the coast of labrador and other cold parts of north america and on the shores too of the great river st lawrence the stranded icebergs and the icefoot as it is called which is continually forming along the freezing shores grub and plough every tide into the mud and sand and shove up before them like a ploughshare heaps of dirt and that too the ice itself is full of dirt of sand and stones which it may have brought from hundreds of miles away and that as this ploughshare of dirty ice grubs onward the nose of the plough is continually being broken off and left underneath the mud and that when summer comes and the ice melts the mud falls back into the place where the ice had been and covers up the gravel which was in the ice  so what between the grubbing of the iceplough into the mud and the dirt which it leaves behind when it melts the stones and sand and mud upon the shore are jumbled up into curious curved and twisted layers exactly like those which mr trimmer saw in certain gravelpits  and when i first read about that i said and exactly like what i have been seeing in every gravelpit round here and trying to guess how they could have been made by currents of water and yet never could make any guess which would do  but after that it was all explained to me and i said honour to the man who has let madam how teach him what she had been trying to teach me for fifteen years while i was too stupid to learn it now i am certain as certain as i can be of any earthly thing that the whole of these windsor forest flats were ages ago ploughed and harrowed over and over again by icefloes and icebergs drifting and stranding in a shallow sea  and if you say my dear child as some people will say that it is like building a large house upon a single brick to be sure that there was an iceberg sea here just because i see a few curlicues in the gravel and sandthen i must tell you that there are sometimesnot often but sometimespages in madam hows book in which one single letter tells you as much as a whole chapter in which if you find one little fact and know what it really means it makes you certain that a thousand other great facts have happened  you may be astonished but you cannot deny your own eyes and your own common sense  you feel like robinson crusoe when walking along the shore of his desert island he saw for the first time the print of a mans foot in the sand  how it could have got there without a miracle he could not dream  but there it was  one footprint was as good as the footprints of a whole army would have been  a man had been there and more men might come  and in fear of the savagesand if you have read robinson crusoe you know how just his fears werehe went home trembling and loaded his muskets and barricaded his cave and passed sleepless nights watching for the savages who might come and who came after all  and so there are certain footprints in geology which there is no mistaking and the prints of the iceplough are among them  for instancewhen they were trenching the new plantation close to wellington college station the men turned up out of the ground a great many sarsden stones that is pieces of hard sugary sand such as stonehenge is made of  and when i saw these i said i suspect these were brought here by icebergs but i was not sure and waited  as the men dug on they dug up a great many large flints with bottlegreen coats  now i said i am sure  for i know where these flints must have come from  and for reasons which would be too long to tell you here i said some time or other icebergs have been floating northward from the hogs back over aldershot and farnborough and have been trying to get into the vale of thames by the slope at wellington college station and they have stranded and dropped these flints  and i am so sure of that that if i found myself out wrong after all i should be at my wits end for i should know that i was wrong about a hundred things besides  or again if you ever go up deeside in scotland towards balmoral and turn up glen muick towards altnaguisach of which you may see a picture in the queens last book you will observe standing on your right hand just above birk hall three pretty rounded knolls which they call the coile hills  you may easily know them by their being covered with beautiful green grass instead of heather  that is because they are made of serpentine or volcanic rock which as you have seen often cuts into beautiful red and green marble and which also carries a very rich soil because it is full of magnesia  if you go up those hills you get a glorious viewthe mountains sweeping round you where you stand up to the top of lochnagar with its bleak walls a thousand feet perpendicular and gullies into which the sun never shines and round to the dark fir forests of the ballochbuie  that is the arc of the bow and the cord of the bow is the silver dee more than a thousand feet below you and in the centre of the cord where the arrow would be fitted in stands balmoral with its castle and its gardens and its park and pleasant cottages and homesteads all around  and when you have looked at the beautiful amphitheatre of forest at your feet and looked too at the great mountains to the westward and benaun and bennabuird and benna muicdhui with their bright patches of eternal snow i should advise you to look at the rock on which you stand and see what you see there  and you will see that on the side of the coiles towards lochnagar and between the knolls of them are scattered streams as it were of great round boulder stoneswhich are not serpentine but granite from the top of lochnagar five miles away  and you will see that the knolls of serpentine rock or at least their backs and shoulders towards lochnagar are all smoothed and polished till they are as round as the backs of sheep roches moutonnees as the french call icepolished rocks and then if you understand what that means you will say as i said i am perfectly certain that this great basin between me and lochnagar which is now 3000 feet deep of empty air was once filled up with ice to the height of the hills on which i standabout 1700 feet highand that that ice ran over into glen muick between these pretty knolls and covered the ground where birk hall now stands  and morewhen you see growing on those knolls of serpentine a few pretty little alpine plants which have no business down there so low you will have a fair right to say as i said the seeds of these plants were brought by the ice ages and ages since from off the mountain range of lochnagar and left here nestling among the rocks to found a fresh colony far from their old mountain home  if i could take you with me up to scotlandtake you for instance along the tay up the pass of dunkeld or up strathmore towards aberdeen or up the dee towards braemari could show you signs which cannot be mistaken of the time when scotland was just like spitzbergen or like greenland now covered in one vast sheet of snow and ice from years end to years end when glaciers were ploughing out its valleys icebergs were breaking off the icy cliffs and floating out to sea when not a bird perhaps was to be seen save seafowl not a plant upon the rocks but a few lichens and alpine saxifrages and such likedesolation and cold and lifeless everywhere  that icetime went on for ages and for ages and yet it did not go on in vain  through it madam how was ploughing down the mountains of scotland to make all those rich farms which stretch from the north side of the frith of forth into sutherlandshire  i could show you everywhere the green banks and knolls of earth which scotch people call kames and tomansperhaps brought down by ancient glaciers or dropped by ancient icebergsnow so smooth and green through summer and through winter among the wild heath and the rough peatmoss that the old scots fancied and i dare say scotch children fancy still fairies dwelt inside  if you laid your ear against the mounds you might hear the fairy music sweet and faint beneath the ground  if you watched the mound at night you might see the fairies dancing the turf short and smooth or riding out on fairy horses with green silk clothes and jingling bells  but if you fell asleep upon the mounds the fairy queen came out and carried you for seven years into fairyland till you awoke again in the same place to find all changed around you and yourself grown thin and old  these are all dreams and fanciesuntrue not because they are too strange and wonderful but because they are not strange and wonderful enough for more wonderful sure than any fairy tale it is that madam how should make a rich and pleasant land by the brute force of ice  and were there any men and women in that old age of ice  that is a long story and a dark one too we will talk of it next time     chapter vithe true fairy tale   you asked if there were men in england when the country was covered with ice and snow  look at this and judge for yourself  what is it a piece of old mortar  yes  but mortar which was made madam how herself and not by any man  and what is in it  a piece of flint and some bits of bone  but look at that piece of flint  it is narrow thin sharpedged quite different in shape from any bit of flint which you or i ever saw among the hundreds of thousands of broken bits of gravel which we tread on here all day long and here are some more bits like it which came from the same placeall very much the same shape like rough knives or razor blades and here is a core of flint the remaining part of a large flint from which as you may see blades like those have been split off  those flakes of flint my child were split off by men even your young eyes ought to be able to see that  and here are other pieces of flintpearshaped but flattened sharp at one end and left rounded at the other which look like spearheads or arrowheads or pointed axes or pointed hatchetseven your young eyes can see that these must have been made by man  and they are i may tell you just like the tools of flint or of obsidian which is volcanic glass and which savages use still where they have not iron  there is a great obsidian knife you know in a house in this very parish which came from mexico and your eye can tell you how like it is to these flint ones  but these flint tools are very old  if you crack a fresh flint you will see that its surface is gray and somewhat rough so that it sticks to your tongue  these tools are smooth and shiny and the edges of some of them are a little rubbed from being washed about in gravel while the iron in the gravel has stained them reddish which it would take hundreds and perhaps thousands of years to do  there are little rough markings too upon some of them which if you look at through a magnifying glass are iron crystallised into the shape of little sea weeds and treesanother sign that they are very very old  and what is more near the place where these flint flakes come from there are no flints in the ground for hundreds of miles so that men must have brought them there ages and ages since  and to tell you plainly these are scrapers such as the esquimaux in north america still use to scrape the flesh off bones and to clean the insides of skins  but did these people savages perhaps live when the country was icy cold  look at the bits of bone  they have been split you see lengthways that i suppose was to suck the marrow out of them as savages do still  but to what animal do the bones belong  that is the question and one which i could not have answered you if wiser men than i am could not have told me  they are the bones of reindeersuch reindeer as are now found only in lapland and the halffrozen parts of north america close to the arctic circle where they have six months day and six months night  you have read of laplanders and how they drive reindeer in their sledges and live upon reindeer milk and you have read of esquimaux who hunt seals and walrus and live in houses of ice lighted by lamps fed with the same blubber on which they feed themselves  i need not tell you about them  now comes the questionwhence did these flints and bones come  they came out of a cave in dordogne in the heart of sunny francefar away to the south where it is hotter every summer than it was here even this summer from among woods of box and evergreen oak and vineyards of rich red wine  in that warm land once lived savages who hunted amid ice and snow the reindeer and with the reindeer animals stranger still  and now i will tell you a fairy tale to make you understand it at all i must put it in the shape of a tale  i call it a fairy tale because it is so strange indeed i think i ought to call it the fairy tale of all fairy tales for by the time we get to the end of it i think it will explain to you how our forefathers got to believe in fairies and trolls and elves and scratlings and all strange little people who were said to haunt the mountains and the caves  well once upon a time so long ago that no man can tell when the land was so much higher that between england and ireland and what is more between england and norway was firm dry land  the country then must have lookedat least we know it looked so in norfolkvery like what our moors look like here  there were forests of scotch fir and of spruce too which is not wild in england now though you may see plenty in every plantation  there were oaks and alders yews and sloes just as there are in our woods now  there was buckbean in the bogs as there is in larmers and heath pond and white and yellow waterlilies hornwort and pondweeds just as there are now in our ponds  there were wild horses wild deer and wild oxen those last of an enormous size  there were little yellow roedeer which will not surprise you for there are hundreds and thousands in scotland to this day and as you know they will thrive well enough in our woods now  there were beavers too but that must not surprise you for there were beavers in south wales long after the norman conquest and there are beavers still in the mountain glens of the southeast of france  there were honest little waterrats too who i dare say sat up on their hind legs like monkeys nibbling the waterlily pods thousands of years ago as they do in our ponds now well so far we have come to nothing strange but now begins the fairy tale  mixed with all these animals there wandered about great herds of elephants and rhinoceroses not smoothskinned mind but covered with hair and wool like those which are still found sticking out of the everlasting ice cliffs at the mouth of the lena and other siberian rivers with the flesh and skin and hair so fresh upon them that the wild wolves tear it off and snarl and growl over the carcase of monsters who were frozen up thousands of years ago  and with them stranger still were great hippopotamuses who came perhaps northward in summer time along the seashore and down the rivers having spread hither all the way from africa for in those days you must understand sicily and italy and maltalook at your mapwere joined to the coast of africa and so it may be was the rock of gibraltar itself and over the sea where the straits of gibraltar now flow was firm dry land over which hyaenas and leopards elephants and rhinoceroses ranged into spain for their bones are found at this day in the gibraltar caves  and this is the first chapter of my fairy tale  now while all this was going on and perhaps before this began the climate was getting colder year by yearwe do not know how and what is more the land was sinking and it sank so deep that at last nothing was left out of the water but the tops of the mountains in ireland and scotland and wales  it sank so deep that it left beds of shells belonging to the arctic regions nearly two thousand feet high upon the mountain side  and so        it grew wondrous cold    and ice masthigh came floating by       as green as emerald  but there were no masts then to measure the icebergs by nor any ship nor human being there  all we know is that the icebergs brought with them vast quantities of mud which sank to the bottom and covered up that pleasant old forestland in what is called boulderclay clay full of bits of broken rock and of blocks of stone so enormous that nothing but an iceberg could have carried them  so all the animals were drowned or driven away and nothing was left alive perhaps except a few little hardy plants which clung about cracks and gullies in the mountain tops and whose descendants live there still  that was a dreadful time the worst perhaps of all the age of ice and so ends the second chapter of my fairy tale  now for my third chapter  when things come to the worst says the proverb they commonly mend and so did this poor frozen and drowned land of england and france and germany though it mended very slowly  the land began to rise out of the sea once more and rose till it was perhaps as high as it had been at first and hundreds of feet higher than it is now but still it was very cold covered in scotland at least with one great sea of ice and glaciers descending down into the sea as i said when i spoke to you about the iceplough  but as the land rose and grew warmer too while it rose the wild beasts who had been driven out by the great drowning came gradually back again  as the bottom of the old icy sea turned into dry land and got covered with grasses and weeds and shrubs once more elephants rhinoceroses hippopotamuses oxensometimes the same species sometimes slightly different onesreturned to france and then to england for there was no british channel then to stop them and with them came other strange animals especially the great irish elk as he is called as large as the largest horse with horns sometimes ten feet across  a pair of those horns with the skull you have seen yourself and can judge what a noble animal he must have been  enormous bears came too and hyaenas and a tiger or lion i cannot say which as large as the largest bengal tiger now to be seen in india  and in those dayswe cannot of course exactly say whenthere camefirst i suppose into the south and east of france and then gradually onward into england and scotland and irelandcreatures without any hair to keep them warm or scales to defend them without horns or tusks to fight with or teeth to worry and bite the weakest you would have thought of the beasts and yet stronger than all the animals because they were men with reasonable souls  whence they came we cannot tell nor why perhaps from mere hunting after food and love of wandering and being independent and alone  perhaps they came into that icy land for fear of stronger and cleverer people than themselves for we have no proof my child none at all that they were the first men that trod this earth  but be that as it may they came and so cunning were these savage men and so brave likewise though they had no iron among them only flint and sharpened bones yet they contrived to kill and eat the mammoths and the giant oxen and the wild horses and the reindeer and to hold their own against the hyaenas and tigers and bears simply because they had wits and the dumb animals had none  and that is the strangest part to me of all my fairy tale  for what a mans wits are and why he has them and therefore is able to invent and to improve while even the cleverest ape has none and therefore can invent and improve nothing and therefore cannot better himself but must remain from father to son and father to son again a stupid pitiful ridiculous ape while men can go on civilising themselves and growing richer and more comfortable wiser and happier year by yearhow that comes to pass i say is to me a wonder and a prodigy and a miracle stranger than all the most fantastic marvels you ever read in fairy tales  you may find the flint weapons which these old savages used buried in many a gravelpit up and down france and the south of england but you will find none here for the gravel here was made i am told at the beginning of the icetime before the north of england sunk into the sea and therefore long long before men came into this land  but most of their remains are found in caves which water has eaten out of the limestone rocks like that famous cave of kents hole at torquay  in it and in many another cave lie the bones of animals which the savages ate and cracked to get the marrow out of them mixed up with their flintweapons and bone harpoons and sometimes with burnt ashes and with round stones used perhaps to heat water as savages do now all baked together into a hard paste or breccia by the lime  these are in the water and are often covered with a floor of stalagmite which has dripped from the roof above and hardened into stone  of these caves and their beautiful wonders i must tell you another day  we must keep now to our fairy tale  but in these caves no doubt the savages lived for not only have weapons been found in them but actually drawings scratched i suppose with flint on bone or mammoth ivorydrawings of elk and bull and horse and ibexand one which was found in france of the great mammoth himself the woolly elephant with a mane on his shoulders like a lions mane  so you see that one of the earliest fancies of this strange creature called man was to draw as you and your schoolfellows love to draw and copy what you see you know not why  remember that  you like to draw but why you like it neither you nor any man can tell  it is one of the mysteries of human nature and that poor savage clothed in skins dirty it may be and more ignorant than you happily can conceive when he sat scratching on ivory in the cave the figures of the animals he hunted was proving thereby that he had the same wonderful and mysterious human nature as youthat he was the kinsman of every painter and sculptor who ever felt it a delight and duty to copy the beautiful works of god  sometimes again especially in denmark these savages have left behind upon the shore mounds of dirt which are called there kjokkenmoddingskitchenmiddens as they would say in scotland kitchendirtheaps as we should say here down southand a very good name for them that is for they are made up of the shells of oysters cockles mussels and periwinkles and other shoreshells besides on which those poor creatures fed and mingled with them are broken bones of beasts and fishes and birds and flint knives and axes and sling stones and here and there hearths on which they have cooked their meals in some rough way  and that is nearly all we know about them but this we know from the size of certain of the shells and from other reasons which you would not understand that these mounds were made an enormous time ago when the water of the baltic sea was far more salt than it is now  but what has all this to do with my fairy tale  this  suppose that these people after all had been fairies  i am in earnest  of course i do not mean that these folk could make themselves invisible or that they had any supernatural powersany more at least than you and i haveor that they were anything but savages but this i do think that out of old stories of these savages grew up the stories of fairies elves and trolls and scratlings and cluricaunes and ogres of which you have read so many  when stronger and bolder people like the irish and the highlanders of scotland and the gauls of france came northward with their bronze and iron weapons and still more when our own forefathers the germans and the norsemen came these poor little savages with their flint arrows and axes were no match for them and had to run away northward or to be all killed out for people were fierce and cruel in those old times and looked on every one of a different race from themselves as a natural enemy  they had not learntalas too many have not learned it yetthat all men are brothers for the sake of jesus christ our lord  so these poor savages were driven out till none were left save the little lapps up in the north of norway where they live to this day  but stories of them and of how they dwelt in caves and had strange customs and used poisoned weapons and how the elfbolts as their flint arrowheads are still called belonged to them lingered on and were told round the fire on winter nights and added to and played with half in fun till a hundred legends sprang up about them which used once to be believed by grownup folk but which now only amuse children  and because some of these savages were very short as the lapps and esquimaux are now the story grew of their being so small that they could make themselves invisible and because others of them were but probably only a few very tall and terrible the story grew that there were giants in that old world like that famous gogmagog whom brutus and his britons met so old fables tell when they landed first at plymouth and fought him and threw him over the cliff  ogres tooof whom you read in fairy talesi am afraid that there were such people once even here in europe strong and terrible savages who ate human beings  of course the legends and tales about them became ridiculous and exaggerated as they passed from mouth to mouth over the christmas fire in the days when no one could read or write  but that the tales began by being true any one may well believe who knows how many cannibal savages there are in the world even now  i think that if ever there was an ogre in the world he must have been very like a certain person who lived or was buried in a cave in the neanderthal between elberfeld and dusseldorf on the lower rhine  the skull and bones which were found there and which are very famous now among scientific men belonged to a personage whom i should have been very sorry to meet and still more to let you meet in the wild forest to a savage of enormous strength of limb and i suppose of jaw likewise     like an ape    with forehead villainous low  who could have eaten you if he would and i fear also would have eaten you if he could  such savages may have lingered i believe from the old ballads and romances that they did linger for a long time in lonely forests and mountain caves till they were all killed out by warriors who wore mailarmour and carried steel sword and battleaxe and lance  but had these people any religion  my dear child we cannot know and need not know  but we know thisthat god beholds all the heathen  he fashions the hearts of them and understandeth all their works  and we know also that he is just and good  these poor folks were i doubt not happy enough in their way and we are bound to believe for we have no proof against it that most of them were honest and harmless enough likewise  of course ogres and cannibals and cruel and brutal persons if there were any among them deserved punishmentand punishment i do not doubt they got  but of course again none of them knew things which you know but for that very reason they were not bound to do many things which you are bound to do for those to whom little is given of them shall little be required  what their religion was like or whether they had any religion at all we cannot tell  but this we can tell that known unto god are all his works from the creation of the world and that his mercy is over all his works and he hateth nothing that he has made  these men and women whatever they were were gods work and therefore we may comfort ourselves with the certainty that whether or not they knew god god knew them  and so ends my fairy tale  but is it not a wonderful tale  more wonderful if you will think over it than any story invented by man  but so it always is  truth wise men tell us is stranger than fiction  even a child like you will see that it must be so if you will but recollect who makes fiction and who makes facts  man makes fiction he invents stories pretty enough fantastical enough but out of what does he make them up  out of a few things in this great world which he has seen and heard and felt just as he makes up his dreams  but who makes truth  who makes facts  who but god  then truth is as much larger than fiction as god is greater than man as much larger as the whole universe is larger than the little corner of it that any man even the greatest poet or philosopher can see and as much grander and as much more beautiful and as much more strange  for one is the whole and the other is one a few tiny scraps of the whole  the one is the work of god the other is the work of man  be sure that no man can ever fancy anything strange unexpected and curious without finding if he had eyes to see a hundred things around his feet more strange more unexpected more curious actually readymade already by god  you are fond of fairy tales because they are fanciful and like your dreams  my dear child as your eyes open to the true fairy tale which madam how can tell you all day long nursery stories will seem to you poor and dull  all those feelings in you which your nursery tales call outimagination wonder awe pity and i trust too hope and lovewill be called out i believe by the tale of all tales the true marchen allen marchen so much more fully and strongly and purely that you will feel that novels and storybooks are scarcely worth your reading as long as you can read the great green book of which every bud is a letter and every tree a page  wonder if you will  you cannot wonder too much  that you might wonder all your life long god put you into this wondrous world and gave you that faculty of wonder which he has not given to the brutes which is at once the mother of sound science and a pledge of immortality in a world more wondrous even than this  but wonder at the right thing not at the wrong at the real miracles and prodigies not at the sham  wonder not at the world of man  waste not your admiration interest hope on it its pretty toys gay fashions fine clothes tawdry luxuries silly amusements  wonder at the works of god  you will not perhaps take my advice yet  the world of man looks so pretty that you will needs have your peep at it and stare into its shop windows and if you can go to a few of its stage plays and dance at a few of its balls  ahwellafter a wild dream comes an uneasy wakening and after too many sweet things comes a sick headache  and one morning you will awake i trust and pray from the world of man to the world of god and wonder where wonder is due and worship where worship is due  you will awake like a child who has been at a pantomime over night staring at the fairy halls which are all paint and canvas and the dazzling splendours which are gas and oil and the magic transformations which are done with ropes and pulleys and the brilliant elves who are poor little children out of the next foul alley and the harlequin and clown who through all their fun are thinking wearily over the old debts which they must pay and the hungry mouths at home which they must feed and so having thought it all wondrously glorious and quite a fairy land slips tired and stupid into bed and wakes next morning to see the pure light shining in through the delicate frostlace on the windowpane and looks out over fields of virgin snow and watches the rosy dawn and cloudless blue and the great sun rising to the music of cawing rooks and piping stares and says this is the true wonder  this is the true glory  the theatre last night was the fairy land of man but this is the fairy land of god     chapter viithe chalkcarts   what do you want to know about next  more about the caves in which the old savages livedhow they were made and how the curious things inside them got there and so forth  well we will talk about that in good time but nowwhat is that coming down the hill  oh only some chalkcarts  only some chalkcarts  it seems to me that these chalkcarts are the very things we want that if we follow them far enoughi do not mean with our feet along the public road but with our thoughts along a road which i am sorry to say the public do not yet know much aboutwe shall come to a cave and understand how a cave is made  meanwhile do not be in a hurry to say only a chalkcart or only a mouse or only a dead leaf  chalkcarts like mice and dead leaves and most other matters in the universe are very curious and odd things in the eyes of wise and reasonable people  whenever i hear young men saying only this and only that i begin to suspect them of belonging not to the noble army of sagesmuch less to the most noble army of martyrsbut to the ignoble army of noodles who think nothing interesting or important but dinners and balls and races and backbiting their neighbours and i should be sorry to see you enlisting in that regiment when you grow up but thinkare not chalkcarts very odd and curious things  i think they are  to my mind it is a curious question how men ever thought of inventing wheels and again when they first thought of it  it is a curious question too how men ever found out that they could make horses work for them and so began to tame them instead of eating them and a curious question which i think we shall never get answered when the first horsetamer lived and in what country  and a very curious and to me a beautiful sight it is to see those two noble horses obeying that little boy whom they could kill with a single kick  but beside all this there is a question which ought to be a curious one to you for i suspect you cannot answer itwhy does the farmer take the trouble to send his cart and horses eight miles and more to draw in chalk from odiham chalkpit  oh he is going to put it on the land of course  they are chalking the bit at the top of the next field where the copse was grubbed  but what good will he do by putting chalk on it  chalk is not rich and fertile like manure it is altogether poor barren stuff you know that or ought to know it  recollect the chalk cuttings and banks on the railway between basingstoke and winchesterhow utterly barren they are though they have been open these thirty years not a blade of grass hardly a bit of moss has grown on them or will grow perhaps for centuries  come let us find out something about the chalk before we talk about the caves  the chalk is here and the caves are not and learn from the thing that lies nearest you is as good a rule as do the duty which lies nearest you  let us come into the grubbed bit and ask the farmerthere he is in his gig  well old friend and how are you  here is a little boy who wants to know why you are putting chalk on your field  does he then  if he ever tries to farm round here he will have to learn for his first ruleno chalk no wheat  but why  why is more than i can tell young squire  but if you want to see how it comes about look here at this freshlygrubbed landhow sour it is you can see that by the colour of itsome black some red some green some yellow all full of sour iron which will let nothing grow  after the chalk has been on it a year or two those colours will have all gone out of it and it will turn to a nice wholesome brown like the rest of the field and then you will know that the land is sweet and fit for any crop  now do you mind what i tell you and then ill tell you something more  we put on the chalk because beside sweetening the land it will hold water  you see the land about here though it is often very wet from springs is sandy and hungry and when we drain the bottom water out of it the top water that is the rain is apt to run through it too fast and then it dries and burns up and we get no plant of wheat nor of turnips either  so we put on chalk to hold water and keep the ground moist  but how can these lumps of chalk hold water  they are not made like cups  no but they are made like sponges which serves our turn better still just take up that lump young squire and youll see water enough in it or rather looking out of it and staring you in the face  why one side of the lump is all over thick ice  so it is  all that water was inside the chalk last night till it froze and then it came squeezing out of the holes in the chalk in strings as you may see it if you break the ice across  now you may judge for yourself how much water a load of chalk will hold even on a dry summers day  and now if youll excuse me sir i must be off to market  was it all true that the farmer said  quite true i believe  he is not a scientific manthat is he does not know the chemical causes of all these things but his knowledge is sound and useful because it comes from long experience  he and his forefathers perhaps for a thousand years and more have been farming this country reading madam hows books with very keen eyes experimenting and watching very carefully and rationally making mistakes often and failing and losing their crops and their money but learning from their mistakes till their empiric knowledge as it is called helps them to grow sometimes quite as good crops as if they had learned agricultural chemistry  what he meant by the chalk sweetening the land you would not understand yet and i can hardly tell you for chemists are not yet agreed how it happens  but he was right and right too what he told you about the water inside the chalk which is more important to us just now for if we follow it out we shall surely come to a cave at last  so now for the water in the chalk  you can see now why the chalkdowns at winchester are always green even in the hottest summer because madam how has put under them her great chalk sponge  the winter rains soak into it and the summer heat draws that rain out of it again as invisible steam coming up from below to keep the roots of the turf cool and moist under the blazing sun  you love that short turf well  you love to run and race over the downs with your butterflynet and hunt chalkhill blues and marbled whites and spotted burnets till you are hot and tired and then to sit down and look at the quiet little old city below with the long cathedral roof and the tower of st cross and the gray old walls and buildings shrouded by noble trees all embosomed among the soft rounded lines of the chalkhills and then you begin to feel very thirsty and cry oh if there were but springs and brooks in the downs as there are at home  but all the hollows are as dry as the hill tops  there is not a brook or the mark of a watercourse in one of them  you are like the ancient mariner in the poem with     water water every where    nor any drop to drink  to get that you must go down and down hundreds of feet to the green meadows through which silver itchen glides toward the sea  there you stand upon the bridge and watch the trout in water so crystalclear that you see every weed and pebble as if you looked through air  if ever there was pure water you think that is pure  is it so  drink some wash your hands in it and tryyou feel that the water is rough hard as they call it quite different from the water at home which feels as soft as velvet  what makes it so hard  because it is full of invisible chalk  in every gallon of that water there are perhaps fifteen grains of solid chalk which was once inside the heart of the hills above  day and night year after year the chalk goes down to the sea and if there were such creatures as waterfairiesif it were true as the old greeks and romans thought that rivers were living things with a nymph who dwelt in each of them and was its goddess or its queenthen if your ears were opened to hear her the nymph of itchen might say to you  so child you think that i do nothing but as your sister says when she sings mr tennysons beautiful song     i chatter over stony ways    in little sharps and trebles    i bubble into eddying bays    i babble on the pebbles  yes  i do that and i love as the nymphs loved of old men who have eyes to see my beauty and ears to discern my song and to fit their own song to it and tell how     i wind about and in and out    with here a blossom sailing    and here and there a lusty trout    and here and there a grayling     and here and there a foamy flake    upon me as i travel    with many a silvery waterbreak    above the golden gravel     and draw them all along and flow    to join the brimming river    for men may come and men may go    but i go on for ever  yes  that is all true but if that were all i should not be let to flow on for ever in a world where lady why rules and madam how obeys  i only exist like everything else from the sun in heaven to the gnat which dances in his beam on condition of working whether we wish it or not whether we know it or not  i am not an idle stream only fit to chatter to those who bathe or fish in my waters or even to give poets beautiful fancies about me  you little guess the work i do  for i am one of the daughters of madam how and like her work night and day we know not why though lady why must know  so day by day and night by night while you are sleeping for i never sleep i carry delicate and soft as i am a burden which giants could not bear and yet i am never tired  every drop of rain which the southwest wind brings from the west indian seas gives me fresh life and strength to bear my burden and it has need to do so for every drop of rain lays a fresh burden on me every root and weed which grows in every field every dead leaf which falls in the highwoods of many a parish from the grange and woodmancote round to farleigh and preston and so to brighton and the alresford downsay every atom of manure which the farmers put on the landfoul enough then but pure enough before it touches meeach of these giving off a tiny atom of what men call carbonic acid melts a tiny grain of chalk and helps to send it down through the solid hill by one of the million pores and veins which at once feed and burden my springs  ages on ages i have worked on thus carrying the chalk into the sea  and ages on ages it may be i shall work on yet till i have done my work at last and levelled the high downs into a flat seashore with beds of flint gravel rattling in the shallow waves  she might tell you that and when she had told you you would surely think of the clumsy chalkcart rumbling down the hill and then of the graceful stream bearing silently its invisible load of chalk and see how much more delicate and beautiful as well as vast and wonderful madam hows work is than that of man  but if you asked the nymph why she worked on for ever she could not tell you  for like the nymphs of old and the hamadryads who lived in trees and undine and the little seamaiden she would have no soul no reason no power to say why  it is for you who are a reasonable being to guess why or at least listen to me if i guess for you and say perhapsi can only say perhapsthat chalk may be going to make layers of rich marl in the sea between england and france and those marlbeds may be upheaved and grow into dry land and be ploughed and sowed and reaped by a wiser race of men in a betterordered world than this or the chalk may have even a nobler destiny before it  that may happen to it which has happened already to many a grain of lime  it may be carried thousands of miles away to help in building up a coral reef what that is i must tell you afterwards  that coral reef may harden into limestone beds  those beds may be covered up pressed and it may be heated till they crystallise into white marble and out of it fairer statues be carved and grander temples built than the world has ever yet seen  and if that is not the reason why the chalk is being sent into the sea then there is another reason and probably a far better one  for as i told you at first lady whys intentions are far wiser and better than our fancies and shelike him whom she obeysis able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think  but you will say now that we have followed the chalkcart a long way without coming to the cave  you are wrong  we have come to the very mouth of the cave  all we have to do is to saynot open sesame like ali baba in the tale of the forty thievesbut some word or two which madam why will teach us and forthwith a hill will open and we shall walk in and behold rivers and cascades underground stalactite pillars and stalagmite statues and all the wonders of the grottoes of adelsberg antiparos or kentucky  am i joking  yes and yet no for you know that when i joke i am usually most in earnest  at least i am now  but there are no caves in chalk  no not that i ever heard of  there are though in limestone which is only a harder kind of chalk  madam how could turn this chalk into hard limestone i believe even now and in more ways than one but in ways which would not be very comfortable or profitable for us southern folk who live on it  i am afraid thatwhat between squeezing and heatingshe would flatten us all out into phosphatic fossils about an inch thick and turn winchester city into a breccia which would puzzle geologists a hundred thousand years hence  so we will hope that she will leave our chalk downs for the itchen to wash gently away while we talk about caves and how madam how scoops them out by water underground just in the same way only more roughly as she melts the chalk  suppose then that these hills instead of being soft spongy chalk were all hard limestone marble like that of which the font in the church is made  then the rainwater instead of sinking through the chalk as now would run over the ground downhill and if it came to a crack a fault as it is called it would run down between the rock and as it ran it would eat that hole wider and wider year by year and make a swallow holesuch as you may see in plenty if you ever go up whernside or any of the high hills in yorkshireunfathomable pits in the green turf in which you may hear the water tinkling and trickling far far underground  and now before we go a step farther you may understand why the bones of animals are so often found in limestone caves  down such swallowholes how many beasts must fall either in hurry and fright when hunted by lions and bears and such cruel beasts or more often still in time of snow when the holes are covered with drift or again if they died on the open hillsides their bones might be washed in in floods along with mud and stones and buried with them in the cave below and beside that lions and bears and hyaenas might live in the caves below as we know they did in some caves and drag in bones through the caves mouths or again savages might live in that cave and bring in animals to eat like the wild beasts and so those bones might be mixed up as we know they were with things which the savages had left behindlike flint tools or beads and then the whole would be hardened by the dripping of the limestone water into a paste of breccia just like this in my drawer but the bones of the savages themselves you would seldom or never find mixed in itunless some one had fallen in by accident from above  and why  for there is a why to that question and not merely a how simply because they were men and because god has put into the hearts of all men even of the lowest savages some sort of reverence for those who are gone and has taught them to bury or in some other way take care of their bones  but how is the swallowhole sure to end in a cave  because it cannot help making a cave for itself if it has time  think and you will see that it must be so  for that water must run somewhere and so it eats its way out between the beds of the rock making underground galleries and at last caves and lofty halls  for it always eats remember at the bottom of its channel leaving the roof alone  so it eats and eats more in some places and less in others according as the stone is harder or softer and according to the different direction of the rockbeds what we call their dip and strike till at last it makes one of those wonderful caverns about which you are so fond of readingsuch a cave as there actually is in the rocks of the mountain of whernside fed by the swallowholes around the mountaintop a cave hundreds of yards long with halls and lakes and waterfalls and curtains and festoons of stalactite which have dripped from the roof and pillars of stalagmite which have been built up on the floor below  these stalactites those tell me who have seen them are among the most beautiful of all madam hows work sometimes like branches of roses or of grapes sometimes like statues sometimes like delicate curtains and i know not what other beautiful shapes  i have never seen them i am sorry to say and therefore i cannot describe them  but they are all made in the same way just in the same way as those little straight stalactites which you may have seen hanging like icicles in vaulted cellars or under the arches of a bridge  the water melts more lime than it can carry and drops some of it again making fresh limestone grain by grain as it drips from the roof above and fresh limestone again where it splashes on the floor below till if it dripped long enough the stalactite hanging from above would meet the stalagmite rising from below and join in one straight round white graceful shaft which would seem but only seem to support the roof of the cave  and out of that cavethough not always out of the mouth of itwill run a stream of water which seems to you clear as crystal though it is actually like the itchen at winchester full of lime so full of lime that it makes beds of fresh limestone which are called travertinewhich you may see in italy and greece and asia minor or perhaps it petrifies as you call it the weeds in its bed like that droppingwell at knaresborough of which you have often seen a picture  and the cause is this the water is so full of lime that it is forced to throw away some of it upon everything it touches and so incrusts with stonethough it does not turn to stonealmost anything you put in it  you have seen or ought to have seen petrified moss and birds nests and such things from knaresborough well and now you know a little though only a very little of how the pretty toys are made  now if you can imagine for yourself though i suppose a little boy cannot the amount of lime which one of these subterranean rivers would carry away gnawing underground centuries after centuries day and night summer and winter then you will not be surprised at the enormous size of caverns which may be seen in different parts of the worldbut always i believe in limestone rock  you would not be surprised though you would admire them at the caverns of adelsberg in carniola in the south of austria near the top of the adriatic which runs i believe for miles in length and in the lakes of which in darkness from its birth until its death lives that strange beast the proteus a sort of long newt which never comes to perfectioni suppose for want of the genial sunlight which makes all things grow  but he is blind and more he keeps all his life the same feathery gills which newts have when they are babies and which we have so often looked at through the microscope to see the bloodglobules run round and round inside  you would not wonder either at the czirknitz lake near the same place which at certain times of the year vanishes suddenly through chasms under water sucking the fish down with it and after a certain time boils suddenly up again from the depths bringing back with it the fish who have been swimming comfortably all the time in a subterranean lake and bringing back too and extraordinary as this story is there is good reason to believe it true live wild ducks who went down small and unfledged and come back fullgrown and fat with waterweeds and small fish in their stomachs showing they have had plenty to feed on underground  butand this is the strangest part of the story if truethey come up unfledged just as they went down and are moreover blind from having been so long in darkness  after a while however folks say their eyes get right their feathers grow and they fly away like other birds  neither would you be surprised if you recollect that madam how is a very old lady indeed and that some of her work is very old likewise at that mammoth cave in kentucky the largest cave in the known world through which you may walk nearly ten miles on end and in which a hundred miles of gallery have been explored already and yet no end found to the cave in it the guides will tell you there are 226 avenues 47 domes 8 cataracts 23 pits and several rivers and if that fact is not very interesting to you as it certainly is not to me i will tell you something which ought to interest you that this cave is so immensely old that various kinds of little animals who have settled themselves in the outer parts of it have had time to change their shape and to become quite blind so that blind fathers and mothers have blind children generation after generation  there are blind rats there with large shining eyes which cannot seeblind landcrabs who have the footstalks of their eyes you may see them in any crab still left but the eyes which should be on the top of them are gone  there are blind fish too in the cave and blind insects for if they have no use for their eyes in the dark why should madam how take the trouble to finish them off  one more cave i must tell you of to show you how old some caves must be and then i must stop and that is the cave of caripe in venezuela which is the most northerly part of south america  there in the face of a limestone cliff crested with enormous flowering trees and festooned with those lovely creepers of which you have seen a few small ones in hothouses there opens an arch as big as the west front of winchester cathedral and runs straight in like a cathedral nave for more than 1400 feet  out of it runs a stream and along the banks of that stream as far as the sunlight strikes in grow wild bananas and palms and lords and ladies as you call them which are not like ours one foot but many feet high  beyond that the cave goes on with subterranean streams cascades and halls no man yet knows how far  a friend of mine last year went in farther i believe than any one yet has gone but instead of taking indian torches made of bark and resin or even torches made of spanish wax such as a brave bishop of those parts used once when he went in farther than any one before him he took with him some of that beautiful magnesium light which you have seen often here at home  and in one place when he lighted up the magnesium he found himself in a hall full 300 feet highhigher far that is than the dome of st paulsand a very solemn thought it was to him he said that he had seen what no other human being ever had seen and that no ray of light had ever struck on that stupendous roof in all the ages since the making of the world but if he found out something which he did not expect he was disappointed in something which he did expect  for the indians warned him of a hole in the floor which they told him was an unfathomable abyss  and lo and behold when he turned the magnesium light upon it the said abyss was just about eight feet deep  but it is no wonder that the poor indians with their little smoky torches should make such mistakes no wonder too that they should be afraid to enter far into those gloomy vaults that they should believe that the souls of their ancestors live in that dark cave and that they should say that when they die they will go to the guacharos as they call the birds that fly with doleful screams out of the cave to feed at night and in again at daylight to roost and sleep  now it is these very guacharo birds which are to me the most wonderful part of the story  the indians kill and eat them for their fat although they believe they have to do with evil spirits  but scientific men who have studied these birds will tell you that they are more wonderful than if all the indians fancies about them were true  they are great birds more than three feet across the wings somewhat like owls somewhat like cuckoos somewhat like goatsuckers but on the whole unlike anything in the world but themselves and instead of feeding on moths or mice they feed upon hard dry fruits which they pick off the trees after the set of sun  and wise men will tell you that in making such a bird as that and giving it that peculiar way of life and settling it in that cavern and a few more caverns in that part of the world and therefore in making the caverns ready for them to live in madam how must have taken ages and ages more than you can imagine or count  but that is among the harder lessons which come in the latter part of madam hows book  children need not learn them yet and they can never learn them unless they master her alphabet and her short and easy lessons for beginners some of which i am trying to teach you now  but i have just recollected that we are a couple of very stupid fellows we have been talking all this time about chalk and limestone and have forgotten to settle what they are and how they were made  we must think of that next time  it will not do for us at least if we mean to be scientific men to use terms without defining them in plain english to talk aboutwe dont know what     chapter viiimadam hows two grandsons   you want to know then what chalk is  i suppose you mean what chalk is made of  yes  that is it  that we can only help by calling in the help of a very great giant whose name is analysis  a giant  yes  and before we call for him i will tell you a very curious story about him and his younger brother which is every word of it true  once upon a time certainly as long ago as the first man or perhaps the first rational being of any kind was created madam how had two grandsons  the elder is called analysis and the younger synthesis  as for who their father and mother were there have been so many disputes on that question that i think children may leave it alone for the present for my part i believe that they are both like st patrick gentlemen and come of decent people and i have a great respect and affection for them both as long as each keeps in his own place and minds his own business  now you must understand that as soon as these two baby giants were born lady why who sets everything to do that work for which it is exactly fitted set both of them their work  analysis was to take to pieces everything he found and find out how it was made  synthesis was to put the pieces together again and make something fresh out of them  in a word analysis was to teach men science and synthesis to teach them art  but because analysis was the elder madam how commanded synthesis never to put the pieces together till analysis had taken them completely apart and my child if synthesis had obeyed that rule of his good old grandmothers the world would have been far happier wealthier wiser and better than it is now  but synthesis would not  he grew up a very noble boy  he could carve he could paint he could build he could make music and write poems but he was full of conceit and haste  whenever his elder brother tried to do a little patient work in taking things to pieces synthesis snatched the work out of his hands before it was a quarter done and began putting it together again to suit his own fancy and of course put it together wrong  then he went on to bully his elder brother and locked him up in prison and starved him till for many hundred years poor analysis never grew at all but remained dwarfed and stupid and all but blind for want of light while synthesis and all the hasty conceited people who followed him grew stout and strong and tyrannous and overspread the whole world and ruled it at their will  but the fault of all the work of synthesis was just this that it would not work  his watches would not keep time his soldiers would not fight his ships would not sail his houses would not keep the rain out  so every time he failed in his work he had to go to poor analysis in his dungeon and bully him into taking a thing or two to pieces and giving him a few sound facts out of them just to go on with till he came to grief again boasting in the meantime that he and not analysis had found out the facts  and at last he grew so conceited that he fancied he knew all that madam how could teach him or lady why either and that he understood all things in heaven and earth while it was not the real heaven and earth that he was thinking of but a sham heaven and a sham earth which he had built up out of his guesses and his own fancies  and the more synthesis waxed in pride and the more he trampled upon his poor brother the more reckless he grew and the more willing to deceive himself  if his real flowers would not grow he cut out paper flowers and painted them and said that they would do just as well as natural ones  if his dolls would not work he put strings and wires behind them to make them nod their heads and open their eyes and then persuaded other people and perhaps halfpersuaded himself that they were alive if the hand of his weatherglass went down he nailed it up to insure a fine day and tortured burnt or murdered every one who said it did not keep up of itself  and many other foolish and wicked things he did which little boys need not hear of yet  but at last his punishment came according to the laws of his grandmother madam how which are like the laws of the medes and persians and alter not as you and all mankind will sooner or later find for he grew so rich and powerful that he grew careless and lazy and thought about nothing but eating and drinking till people began to despise him more and more  and one day he left the dungeon of analysis so ill guarded that analysis got out and ran away  great was the hue and cry after him and terribly would he have been punished had he been caught  but lo and behold folks had grown so disgusted with synthesis that they began to take the part of analysis  poor men hid him in their cottages and scholars in their studies  and when war arose about himand terrible wars did arisegood kings wise statesmen gallant soldiers spent their treasure and their lives in fighting for him  all honest folk welcomed him because he was honest and all wise folk used him for instead of being a conceited tyrant like synthesis he showed himself the most faithful diligent humble of servants ready to do every mans work and answer every mans questions  and among them all he got so well fed that he grew very shortly into the giant that he ought to have been all along and was and will be for many a year to come perfectly able to take care of himself  as for poor synthesis he really has fallen so low in these days that one cannot but pity him  he now goes about humbly after his brother feeding on any scraps that are thrown to him and is snubbed and rapped over the knuckles and told one minute to hold his tongue and mind his own business and the next that he has no business at all to mind till he has got into such a poor way that some folks fancy he will die and are actually digging his grave already and composing his epitaph  but they are trying to wear the bears skin before the bear is killed for synthesis is not dead nor anything like it and he will rise up again some day to make good friends with his brother analysis and by his help do nobler and more beautiful work than he has ever yet done in the world  so now analysis has got the upper hand so much so that he is in danger of being spoilt by too much prosperity as his brother was before him in which case he too will have his fall and a great deal of good it will do him  and that is the end of my story and a true story it is  now you must remember whenever you have to do with him that analysis like fire is a very good servant but a very bad master  for having got his freedom only of late years or so he is like young men when they come suddenly to be their own masters apt to be conceited and to fancy that he knows everything when really he knows nothing and can never know anything but only knows about things which is a very different matter  indeed nowadays he pretends that he can teach his old grandmother madam how not only how to suck eggs but to make eggs into the bargain while the good old lady just laughs at him kindly and lets him run on because she knows he will grow wiser in time and learn humility by his mistakes and failures as i hope you will from yours  however analysis is a very clever young giant and can do wonderful work as long as he meddles only with dead things like this bit of lime  he can take it to pieces and tell you of what things it is made or seems to be made and take them to pieces again and tell you what each of them is made of and so on till he gets conceited and fancies that he can find out some one thing of all things which he calls matter of which all other things are made and some way of all ways which he calls force by which all things are made but when he boasts in that way old madam how smiles and says my child before you can say that you must remember a hundred things which you are forgetting and learn a hundred thousand things which you do not know and then she just puts her hand over his eyes and master analysis begins groping in the dark and talking the saddest nonsense  so beware of him and keep him in his own place and to his own work or he will flatter you and get the mastery of you and persuade you that he can teach you a thousand things of which he knows no more than he does why a ducks egg never hatches into a chicken  and remember if master analysis ever grows saucy and conceited with you just ask him that last riddle and you will shut him up at once  and why  because analysis can only explain to you a little about dead things like stonesinorganic things as they are called  living thingsorganisms as they are calledhe cannot explain to you at all  when he meddles with them he always ends like the man who killed his goose to get the golden eggs  he has to kill his goose or his flower or his insect before he can analyse it and then it is not a goose but only the corpse of a goose not a flower but only the dead stuff of the flower  and therefore he will never do anything but fail when he tries to find out the life in things  how can he when he has to take the life out of them first  he could not even find out how a plumpudding is made by merely analysing it  he might part the sugar and the flour and the suet he might even for he is very clever and very patient too the more honour to him take every atom of sugar out of the flour with which it had got mixed and every atom of brown colour which had got out of the plums and currants into the body of the pudding and then for aught i know put the colouring matter back again into the plums and currants and then for aught i know turn the boiled pudding into a raw one againfor he is a great conjurer as madam hows grandson is bound to be but yet he would never find out how the pudding was made unless some one told him the great secret which the sailors in the old story forgotthat the cook boiled it in a cloth  this is analysiss weak pointdont let it be yoursthat in all his calculations he is apt to forget the cloth and indeed the cook likewise no doubt he can analyse the matter of things but he will keep forgetting that he cannot analyse their form  do i mean their shape  no my child no  i mean something which makes the shape of things and the matter of them likewise but which folks have lost sight of nowadays and do not seem likely to get sight of again for a few hundred years  so i suppose that you need not trouble your head about it but may just follow the fashions as long as they last  about this piece of lime however analysis can tell us a great deal  and we may trust what he says and believe that he understands what he says  why  think now  if you took your watch to pieces you would probably spoil it for ever you would have perhaps broken and certainly mislaid some of the bits and not even a watchmaker could put it together again  you would have analysed the watch wrongly  but if a watchmaker took it to pieces then any other watchmaker could put it together again to go as well as ever because they both understand the works how they fit into each other and what the use and the power of each is  its being put together again rightly would be a proof that it had been taken to pieces rightly  and so with master analysis  if he can take a thing to pieces so that his brother synthesis can put it together again you may be sure that he has done his work rightly  now he can take a bit of chalk to pieces so that it shall become several different things none of which is chalk or like chalk at all  and then his brother synthesis can put them together again so that they shall become chalk as they were before  he can do that very nearly but not quite  there is in every average piece of chalk something which he cannot make into chalk again when he has once unmade it  what that is i will show you presently and a wonderful tale hangs thereby  but first we will let analysis tell us what chalk is made of as far as he knows  he will saychalk is carbonate of lime  but what is carbonate of lime made of  lime and carbonic acid  and what is lime  the oxide of a certain metal called calcium  what do you mean  that quicklime is a certain metal mixed with oxygen gas and slacked lime is the same mixed with water  so lime is a metal  what is a metal  nobody knows  and what is oxygen gas  nobody knows  well analysis stops short very soon  he does not seem to know much about the matter  nay nay you are wrong there  it is just about the matter that he does know and knows a great deal and very accurately what he does not know is the matter itself  he will tell you wonderful things about oxygen gashow the air is full of it the water full of it every living thing full of it how it changes hard bright steel into soft foul rust how a candle cannot burn without it or you live without it  but what it is he knows not  will he ever know  that is lady whys concern and not ours  meanwhile he has a right to find out if he can  but what do you want to ask him next  what  oh  what carbonic acid is  he can tell you that  carbon and oxygen gas  but what is carbon  nobody knows  why here is this stupid analysis at fault again  nay nay again  be patient with him  if he cannot tell you what carbon is he can tell you what is carbon which is well worth knowing  he will tell you for instance that every time you breathe or speak what comes out of your mouth is carbonic acid and that if your breath comes on a bit of slacked lime it will begin to turn it back into the chalk from which it was made and that if your breath comes on the leaves of a growing plant that leaf will take the carbon out of it and turn it into wood  and surely that is worth knowingthat you may be helping to make chalk or to make wood every time you breathe  well that is very curious  but now ask him what is carbon  and he will tell you that many things are carbon  a diamond is carbon and so is blacklead and so is charcoal and coke and coal in part and wood in part  what  does analysis say that a diamond and charcoal are the same thing  yes  then his way of taking things to pieces must be a very clumsy one if he can find out no difference between diamond and charcoal  well perhaps it is but you must remember that though he is very oldas old as the first man who ever livedhe has only been at school for the last three hundred years or so  and remember too that he is not like you who have some one else to teach you  he has had to teach himself and find out for himself and make his own tools and work in the dark besides  and i think it is very much to his credit that he ever found out that diamond and charcoal were the same things  you would never have found it out for yourself you will agree  no but how did he do it  he taught a very famous chemist lavoisier about ninety years ago how to burn a diamond in oxygenand a very difficult trick that is and lavoisier found that the diamond when burnt turned almost entirely into carbonic acid and water as blacklead and charcoal do and more that each of them turned into the same quantity of carbonic acid and so he knew as surely as man can know anything that all these things however different to our eyes and fingers are really made of the same thingpure carbon  but what makes them look and feel so different  that analysis does not know yet  perhaps he will find out some day for he is very patient and very diligent as you ought to be  meanwhile be content with him remember that though he cannot see through a milestone yet he can see farther into one than his neighbours  indeed his neighbours cannot see into a milestone at all but only see the outside of it and know things only by rote like parrots without understanding what they mean and how they are made  so now remember that chalk is carbonate of lime and that it is made up of three things calcium oxygen and carbon and that therefore its mark is caco3 in analysiss language which i hope you will be able to read some day  but how is it that analysis and synthesis cannot take all this chalk to pieces and put it together again  look here what is that in the chalk  oh a shepherds crown such as we often find in the gravel only fresh and white  well you know what that was once  i have often told youa live sea egg covered with prickles which crawls at the bottom of the sea  well i am sure that master synthesis could not put that together again and equally sure that master analysis might spend ages in taking it to pieces before he found out how it was made  andwe are lucky today for this lower chalk to the south has very few fossils in ithere is something else which is not mere carbonate of lime  look at it  a little cockle something like a wrinkled hazelnut  no that is no cockle  madam how invented that ages and ages before she thought of cockles and the animal which lived inside that shell was as different from a cockleanimal as a sparrow is from a dog  that is a terebratula a gentleman of a very ancient and wornout family  he and his kin swarmed in the old seas even as far back as the time when the rocks of the welsh mountains were soft mud as you will know when you read that great book of sir roderick murchisons siluria  but as the ages rolled on they got fewer and fewer these terebratulae and now there are hardly any of them left only six or seven sorts are left about these islands which cling to stones in deep water and the first time i dredged two of them out of loch fyne i looked at them with awe as on relics from another world which had lasted on through unnumbered ages and changes such as ones fancy could not grasp  but you will agree that if master analysis took that shell to pieces master synthesis would not be likely to put it together again much less to put it together in the right way in which madam how made it  and what was that  by making a living animal which went on growing that is making itself and making as it grew its shell to live in  synthesis has not found out yet the first step towards doing that and as i believe he never will  but there would be no harm in his trying  of course not  let everybody try to do everything they fancy  even if they fail they will have learnt at least that they cannot do it  but nowand this is a secret which you would never find out for yourself at least without the help of a microscopethe greater part of this lump of chalk is made up of things which neither analysis can perfectly take to pieces nor synthesis put together again  it is made of dead organisms that is things which have been made by living creatures  if you washed and brushed that chalk into powder you would find it full of little things like the dentalina in this drawing and many other curious forms  i will show you some under the microscope one day  they are the shells of animals called foraminifera because the shells of some of them are full of holes through which they put out tiny arms  so small they are and so many that there may be it is said forty thousand of them in a bit of chalk an inch every way  in numbers past counting some whole some broken some ground to the finest powder they make up vast masses of england which are now chalk downs and in some foreign countries they make up whole mountains  part of the building stone of the great pyramid in egypt is composed i am told entirely of them  and how did they get into the chalk  ah  how indeed  let us think  the chalk must have been laid down at the bottom of a sea because there are seashells in it  besides we find little atomies exactly like these alive now in many seas and therefore it is fair to suppose these lived in the sea also  besides they were not washed into the chalk by any sudden flood  the water in which they settled must have been quite still or these little delicate creatures would have been ground into powderor rather into paste  therefore learned men soon made up their minds that these things were laid down at the bottom of a deep sea so deep that neither wind nor tide nor currents could stir the everlasting calm  ah it is worth thinking over for it shows how shrewd a giant analysis is and how fast he works in these days now that he has got free and well fedworth thinking over i say how our notions about these little atomies have changed during the last forty years  we used to find them sometimes washed up among the seasand on the wild atlantic coast and we were taught in the days when old dr turton was writing his book on british shells at bideford to call them nautili because their shells were like nautilus shells  men did not know then that the animal which lives in them is no more like a nautilus animal than it is like a cow  for a nautilus you must know is made like a cuttlefish with eyes and strong jaws for biting and arms round them and has a heart and gills and a stomach and is altogether a very wellmade beast and i suspect a terrible tyrant to little fish and seaslugs just as the cuttlefish is  but the creatures which live in these little shells are about the least finished of madam hows works  they have neither mouth nor stomach eyes nor limbs  they are mere live bags full of jelly which can take almost any shape they like and thrust out armsor what serve for armsthrough the holes in their shells and then contract them into themselves again as this globigerina does  what they feed on how they grow how they make their exquisitelyformed shells whether indeed they are strictly speaking animals or vegetables analysis has not yet found out  but when you come to read about them you will find that they in their own way are just as wonderful and mysterious as a butterfly or a rose and just as necessary likewise to madam hows work for out of them as i told you she makes whole sheets of down whole ranges of hills  no one knew anything i believe about them save that two or three kinds of them were found in chalk till a famous frenchman called dorbigny just thirty years ago told the world how he had found many beautiful fresh kinds and more strange still that some of these kinds were still alive at the bottom of the adriatic and of the harbour of alexandria in egypt  then in 1841 a gentleman named edward forbesnow with godwhose name will be for ever dear to all who love science and honour genius and virtuefound in the aegean sea a bed of chalk he said full of foraminifera and shells of pteropods forming at the bottom of the sea  and what are pteropods  what you might call seamoths though they are not really moths which swim about on the surface of the water while the rightwhales suck them in tens of thousands into the great whalebone net which fringes their jaws  here are drawings of them  1 limacina on which the whales feed and 2 hyalea a lovely little thing in a glass shell which lives in the mediterranean  but since then strange discoveries have been made especially by the naval officers who surveyed the bottom of the great atlantic ocean before laying down the electric cable between ireland and america  and this is what they found  that at the bottom of the atlantic were vast plains of soft mud in some places 2500 fathoms 15000 feet deep that is as deep as the alps are high  and more they found out to their surprise that the oozy mud of the atlantic floor was made up almost entirely of just the same atomies as make up our chalk especially globigerinas that in fact a vast bed of chalk was now forming at the bottom of the atlantic with living shells and seaanimals of the most brilliant colours crawling about on it in black darkness and beds of sponges growing out of it just as the sponges grew at the bottom of the old chalk ocean and were all generation after generation turned into flints  and for reasons which you will hardly understand men are beginning now to believe that the chalk has never ceased to be made somewhere or other for many thousand years ever since the winchester downs were at the bottom of the sea and that the globigerinamud is not merely a chalk formation but a continuation of the chalk formation so that we may be said to be still living in the age of chalk 1  ah my little man what would i not give to see you before i die add one such thought as that to the sum of human knowledge  so there the little creatures have been lying making chalk out of the lime in the seawater layer over layer the young over the old the dead over the living year after year age after agefor how long  who can tell  how deep the layer of new chalk at the bottom of the atlantic is we can never know  but the layer of live atomies on it is not an inch thick probably not a tenth of an inch  and if it grew a tenth of an inch a year or even a whole inch how many years must it have taken to make the chalk of our downs which is in some parts 1300 feet thick  how many inches are there in 1300 feet  do that sum and judge for yourself  one difference will be found between the chalk now forming at the bottom of the ocean if it ever become dry land and the chalk on which you tread on the downs  the new chalk will be full of the teeth and bones of whaleswarmblooded creatures who suckle their young like cows instead of laying eggs like birds and fish  for there were no whales in the old chalk ocean but our modern oceans are full of cachalots porpoises dolphins swimming in shoals round any ship and their bones and teeth and still more their earbones will drop to the bottom as they die and be found ages hence in the mud which the live atomies make along with wrecks of mighty ships     great anchors heaps of pearl  and all that man has lost in the deep seas  and sadder fossils yet my child will be scattered on those white plains     to them the love of woman hath gone down    dark roll their waves oer manhoods noble head    oer youths bright locks and beautys flowing crown    yet shall they hear a voice restore the dead    earth shall reclaim her precious things from thee    give back the dead thou sea     chapter ixthe coralreef   now you want to know what i meant when i talked of a bit of lime going out to sea and forming part of a coral island and then of a limestone rock and then of a marble statue  very good  then look at this stone  what a curious stone  did it come from any place near here  no  it came from near dudley in staffordshire where the soils are worlds on worlds older than they are here though they were made in the same way as these and all other soils  but you are not listening to me  why the stone is full of shells and bits of coral and what are these wonderful things coiled and tangled together like the snakes in medusas hair in the picture  are they snakes  if they are then they must be snakes who have all one head for see they are joined together at their larger ends and snakes which are branched too which no snake ever was  yes  i suppose they are not snakes  and they grow out of a flower too and it has a stalk jointed too as plants sometimes are and as fishes backbones are too  is it a petrified plant or flower  no though i do not deny that it looks like one  the creature most akin to it which you ever saw is a starfish  what one of the red starfishes which one finds on the beach  its arms are not branched  no  but there are starfishes with branched arms still in the sea  you know that pretty book and learned book too forbess british star fishes  you like to look it through for the sake of the vignettesthe mermaid and her child playing in the sea  oh yes and the kind bogie who is piping while the sandstars dance and the other who is trying to pull out the starfish which the oyster has caught  yes  but do you recollect the drawing of the medusas head with its curling arms branched again and again without end  here it is  no you shall not look at the vignettes now  we must mind business  now look at this one the featherstar with arms almost like fernfronds  and in foreign seas there are many other branched starfish beside  but they have no stalks  do not be too sure of that  this very featherstar soon after it is born grows a tiny stalk by which it holds on to corallines and seaweeds and it is not till afterwards that it breaks loose from that stalk and swims away freely into the wide water  and in foreign seas there are several starfish still who grow on stalks all their lives as this fossil one did  how strange that a live animal should grow on a stalk like a flower  not quite like a flower  a flower has roots by which it feeds in the soil  these things grow more like seaweeds which have no roots but only hold on to the rock by the foot of the stalk as a ship holds on by her anchor  but as for its being strange that live animals should grow on stalks if it be strange it is common enough like many far stranger things  for under the water are millions on millions of creatures spreading for miles on miles building up at last great reefs of rocks and whole islands which all grow rooted first to the rock like seaweeds and what is more they grow most of them from one common root branching again and again and every branchlet bearing hundreds of living creatures so that the whole creation is at once one creature and many creatures  do you not understand me  no  then fancy to yourself a bush like that hawthorn bush with numberless blossoms and every blossom on that bush a separate living thing with its own mouth and arms and stomach budding and growing fresh live branches and fresh live flowers as fast as the old ones die and then you will see better what i mean  how wonderful  yes but not more wonderful than your finger for it too is made up of numberless living things  my finger made of living things  what else can it be  when you cut your finger does not the place heal  of course  and what is healing but growing again  and how could the atoms of your fingers grow and make fresh skin if they were not each of them alive there i will not puzzle you with too much at once you will know more about all that some day  only remember now that there is nothing wonderful in the world outside you but has its counterpart of something just as wonderful and perhaps more wonderful inside you  man is the microcosm the little world said the philosophers of old and philosophers nowadays are beginning to see that their old guess is actual fact and true  but what are these curious seacreatures called which are animals yet grow like plants  they have more names than i can tell you or you remember  those which helped to make this bit of stone are called coralinsects but they are not really insects and are no more like insects than you are coralpolypes is the best name for them because they have arms round their mouths something like a cuttlefish which the ancients called polypus  but the animal which you have seen likest to most of them is a seaanemone  look now at this piece of fresh coralfor coral it is though not like the coral which your sister wears in her necklace  you see it is full of pipes in each of those pipes has lived what we will call for the time being a tiny seaanemone joined on to his brothers by some sort of flesh and skin and all of them together have built up out of the lime in the seawater this common house or rather town of lime  but is it not strange and wonderful  of course it is but so is everything when you begin to look into it and if i were to go on and tell you what sort of young ones these coralpolypes have and what becomes of them you would hear such wonders that you would be ready to suspect that i was inventing nonsense or talking in my dreams  but all that belongs to madam hows deepest book of all which is called the book of kind the book which children cannot understand and in which only the very wisest men are able to spell out a few words not knowing and of course not daring to guess what wonder may come next  now we will go back to our stone and talk about how it was made and how the stalked starfish which you mistook for a flower ever got into the stone  then do you think me silly for fancying that a fossil starfish was a flower  i should be silly if i did  there is no silliness in not knowing what you cannot know  you can only guess about new things which you have never seen before by comparing them with old things which you have seen before and you had seen flowers and snakes and fishes backbones and made a very fair guess from them  after all some of these stalked star fish are so like flowers lilies especially that they are called encrinites and the whole family is called crinoids or lilylike creatures from the greek work krinon a lily and as for corals and corallines learned men in spite of all their care and shrewdness made mistake after mistake about them which they had to correct again and again till now i trust they have got at something very like the truth no i shall only call you silly if you do what some little boys are apt to docall other boys and still worse servants or poor people silly for not knowing what they cannot know  but are not poor people often very silly about animals and plants  the boys at the village school say that slowworms are poisonous is not that silly  not at all  they know that adders bite and so they think that slowworms bite too  they are wrong and they must be told that they are wrong and scolded if they kill a slowworm  but silly they are not  but is it not silly to fancy that swallows sleep all the winter at the bottom of the pond  i do not think so  the boys cannot know where the swallows go and if you told themwhat is truethat the swallows find their way every autumn through france through spain over the straits of gibraltar into morocco and some i believe over the great desert of zahara into negroland and if you told themwhat is true alsothat the young swallows actually find their way into africa without having been along the road before because the old swallows go south a week or two first and leave the young ones to guess out the way for themselves if you told them that then they would have a right to say do you expect us to believe that  that is much more wonderful than that the swallows should sleep in the pond  but is it  yes to them  they know that bats and dormice and other things sleep all the winter so why should not swallows sleep  they see the swallows about the water and often dipping almost into it  they know that fishes live under water and that many insectslike mayflies and caddisflies and waterbeetleslive sometimes in the water sometimes in the open air and they cannot knowyou do not knowwhat it is which prevents a birds living under water  so their guess is really a very fair one no more silly than that of the savages who when they first saw the white mens ships with their huge sails fancied they were enormous seabirds and when they heard the cannons fire said that the ships spoke in thunder and lightning  their guess was wrong but not silly for it was the best guess they could make  but i do know of one old woman who was silly  she was a boys nurse and she gave the boy a thing which she said was one of the snakes which st hilda turned into stone and told him that they found plenty of them at whitby where she was born all coiled up but what was very odd their heads had always been broken of  and when he took it to his father he told him it was only a fossil shellan ammonite  and he went back and laughed at his nurse and teased her till she was quite angry  then he was very lucky that she did not box his ears for that was what he deserved  i dare say that though his nurse had never heard of ammonites she was a wise old dame enough and knew a hundred things which he did not know and which were far more important than ammonites even to him  how  because if she had not known how to nurse him well he would perhaps have never grown up alive and strong  and if she had not known how to make him obey and speak the truth he might have grown up a naughty boy  but was she not silly  no  she only believed what the whitby folk i understand have some of them believed for many hundred years  and no one can be blamed for thinking as his forefathers did unless he has cause to know better  surely she might have known better  how  what reason could she have to believe the ammonite was a shell  it is not the least like cockles or whelks or any shell she ever saw  what reason either could she have to guess that whitby cliff had once been coralmud at the bottom of the sea  no more reason my dear child than you would have to guess that this stone had been coralmud likewise if i did not teach you soor rather try to make you teach yourself so  no  i say it again  if you wish to learn i will only teach you on condition that you do not laugh at or despise those good and honest and able people who do not know or care about these things because they have other things to think of like old john out there ploughing  he would not believe youhe would hardly believe meif we told him that this stone had been once a swarm of living things of exquisite shapes and glorious colours  and yet he can plough and sow and reap and mow and fell and strip and hedge and ditch and give his neighbours sound advice and take the measure of a mans worth from ten minutes talk and say his prayers and keep his temper and pay his debtswhich last three things are more than a good many folks can do who fancy themselves a whole world wiser than john in the smockfrock  oh but i want to hear about the exquisite shapes and glorious colours  of course you do little man  a few fine epithets take your fancy far more than a little common sense and common humility but in that you are no worse than some of your elders  so now for the exquisite shapes and glorious colours  i have never seen them though i trust to see them ere i die  so what they are like i can only tell from what i have learnt from mr darwin and mr wallace and mr jukes and mr gosse and last but not least from one whose soul was as beautiful as his face lucas barretttoo soon lost to sciencewho was drowned in exploring such a coralreef as this stone was once  then there are such things alive now  yes and no  the descendants of most of them live on altered by time which alters all things and from the beauty of the children we can guess at the beauty of their ancestors just as from the coralreefs which exist now we can guess how the coralreefs of old were made  and that this stone was once part of a coralreef the corals in it prove at first sight  and what is a coralreef like  you have seen the room in the british museum full of corals madrepores brainstones corallines and seaferns  oh yes  then fancy all those alive  not as they are now white stone but covered in jelly and out of every pore a little polype like a flower peeping out  fancy them of every gaudy colour you choose  no bed of flowers they say can be more brilliant than the corals as you look down on them through the clear sea  fancy again growing among them and crawling over them strange seaanemones shells starfish seaslugs and seacucumbers with feathery gills crabs and shrimps and hundreds of other animals all as strange in shape and as brilliant in colour you may let your fancy run wild  nothing so odd nothing so gay even entered your dreams or a poets as you may find alive at the bottom of the sea in the live flowergardens of the seafairies  there will be shoals of fish too playing in and out as strange and gaudy as the restparrotfish who browse on the live coral with their beaklike teeth as cattle browse on grass and at the bottom it may be larger and uglier fish who eat the crabs and shellfish shells and all grinding them up as a dog grinds a bone and so turning shells and corals into fine soft mud such as this stone is partly made of  but what happens to all the delicate little corals if a storm comes on  what indeed  madam how has made them so well and wisely that like brave and good men the more trouble they suffer the stronger they are day and night week after week the tradewind blows upon them hurling the waves against them in furious surf knocking off great lumps of coral grinding them to powder throwing them over the reef into the shallow water inside  but the heavier the surf beats upon them the stronger the polypes outside grow repairing their broken houses and building up fresh coral on the dead coral below because it is in the fresh seawater that beats upon the surf that they find most lime with which to build  and as they build they form a barrier against the surf inside of which in water still as glass the weaker and more delicate things can grow in safety just as these very encrinites may have grown rooted in the limemud and waving their slender arms at the bottom of the clear lagoon  such mighty builders are these little coral polypes that all the works of men are small compared with theirs  one single reef for instance which is entirely made by them stretches along the northeast coast of australia for nearly a thousand miles  of this you must read some day in mr jukess voyage of hms fly  every island throughout a great part of the pacific is fringed round each with its coralreef and there are hundreds of islands of strange shapes and of atolls as they are called or ringislands which are composed entirely of coral and of nothing else  a ringisland  how can an island be made in the shape of a ring  ah it was a long time before men found out that riddle  mr darwin was the first to guess the answer as he has guessed many an answer beside these islands are each a ring or nearly a ring of coral with smooth shallow water inside but their outsides run down like a mountain wall sheer into seas hundreds of fathoms deep  people used to believe and reasonably enough that the coral polypes began to build up the islands from the very bottom of the deep sea  but that would not account for the top of them being of the shape of a ring and in time it was found out that the corals would not build except in shallow water twenty or thirty fathoms deep at most and men were at their wits ends to find out the riddle  then said mr darwin suppose one of those beautiful south sea islands like tahiti the queen of isles with its ring of coralreef all round its shore began sinking slowly under the sea  the land as it sunk would be gone for good and all but the coralreef round it would not because the coral polypes would build up and up continually upon the skeletons of their dead parents to get to the surface of the water and would keep close to the top outside however much the land sunk inside and when the island had sunk completely beneath the sea what would be left  what must be left but a ring of coral reef around the spot where the last mountain peak of the island sank beneath the sea  and so mr darwin explained the shapes of hundreds of coral islands in the pacific and proved too some strange things besides he proved and other men like mr wallace whose excellent book on the east indian islands you must read some day have proved in other ways that there was once a great continent joined perhaps to australia and to new guinea in the pacific ocean where is now nothing but deep sea and coralreefs which mark the mountain ranges of that sunken world  but how does the coral ever rise above the surface of the water and turn into hard stone  of course the coral polypes cannot build above the hightide mark but the surf which beats upon them piles up their broken fragments just as a seabeach is piled up and hammers them together with that water hammer which is heavier and stronger than any you have ever seen in a smiths forge  and then as is the fashion of lime the whole mass sets and becomes hard as you may see mortar set and so you have a low island a few feet above the sea  then seabirds come to it and rest and build and seeds are floated thither from far lands and among them almost always the cocoanut which loves to grow by the seashore and groves of cocoa palms grow up upon the lonely isle  then perhaps trees and bushes are drifted thither before the tradewind and entangled in their roots are seeds of other plants and eggs or cocoons of insects and so a few flowers and a few butterflies and beetles set up for themselves upon the new land  and then a bird or two caught in a storm and blown away to sea finds shelter in the cocoagrove and so a little new world is set up in which you must remember always there are no fourfooted beasts nor snakes nor lizards nor frogs nor any animals that cannot cross the sea  and on some of those islands they may live indeed there is reason to believe they have lived so long that some of them have changed their forms according to the laws of madam how who sooner or later fits each thing exactly for the place in which it is meant to live till upon some of them you may find such strange and unique creatures as the famous cocoanut crab which learned men call birgus latro  a great crab he is who walks upon the tips of his toes a foot high above the ground  and because he has often nothing to eat but cocoanuts or at least they are the best things he can find cocoanuts he has learned to eat and after a fashion which it would puzzle you to imitate  some say that he climbs up the stems of the cocoanut trees and pulls the fruit down for himself but that it seems he does not usually do  what he does is this when he finds a fallen cocoanut he begins tearing away the thick husk and fibre with his strong claws and he knows perfectly well which end to tear it from namely from the end where the three eyeholes are which you call the monkeys face out of one of which you know the young cocoanut tree would burst forth  and when he has got to the eyeholes he hammers through one of them with the point of his heavy claw  so far so good but how is he to get the meat out  he cannot put his claw in he has no proboscis like a butterfly to insert and suck with  he is as far off from his dinner as the fox was when the stork offered him a feast in a longnecked jar  what then do you think he does  he turns himself round puts in a pair of his hind pincers which are very slender and with them scoops the meat out of the cocoanut and so puts his dinner into his mouth with his hind feet  and even the cocoanut husk he does not waste for he lives in deep burrows which he makes like a rabbit and being a luxurious crab and liking to sleep soft in spite of his hard shell he lines them with a quantity of cocoanut fibre picked out clean and fine just as if he was going to make cocoanut matting of it  and being also a clean crab as i hope you are a clean little boy he goes down to the sea every night to have his bath and moisten his gills and so lives happy all his days and gets so fat in his old age that he carries about his body nearly a quart of pure oil  that is the history of the cocoanut crab  and if any one tells me that that crab acts only on what is called instinct and does not think and reason just as you and i think and reason though of course not in words as you and i do then i shall be inclined to say that that person does not think nor reason either  then were there many coralreefs in britain in old times  yes many and many again and again some whole ages older than this a bit of which you see and some again whole ages newer  but look then judge for yourself  look at this geological map  wherever you see a bit of blue which is the mark for limestone you may say there is a bit of old coralreef rising up to the surface  but because i will not puzzle your little head with too many things at once you shall look at one set of coralreefs which are far newer than this bit of dudley limestone and which are the largest i suppose that ever were in this country or at least there is more of them left than of any others  look first at ireland  you see that almost all the middle of ireland is coloured blue  it is one great sheet of old coralreef and coralmud which is now called the carboniferous limestone  you see red and purple patches rising out of it like islandsand islands i suppose they were of hard and ancient rock standing up in the middle of the coral sea  but look again and you will see that along the west coast of ireland except in a very few places like galway bay the blue limestone does not come down to the sea the shore is coloured purple and brown and those colours mark the ancient rocks and high mountains of mayo and galway and kerry which stand as barriers to keep the raging surf of the atlantic from bursting inland and beating away as it surely would in course of time the low flat limestone plain of the middle of ireland  but the same coralreefs once stretched out far to the westward into the atlantic ocean and you may see the proof upon that map  for in the western bays in clew bay with its hundred islands and galway bay with its isles of arran and beautiful kenmare and beautiful bantry you see little blue spots which are low limestone islands standing in the sea overhung by mountains far aloft  you have often heard those islands in kenmare bay talked of and how some whom you know go to fish round them by night for turbot and conger and when you hear them spoken of again you must recollect that they are the last fragments of a great fringing coralreef which will in a few thousand years follow the fate of the rest and be eaten up by the waves while the mountains of hard rock stand round them still unchanged  now look at england and there you will see patches at least of a great coralreef which was forming at the same time as that irish one and on which perhaps some of your schoolfellows have often stood  you have heard of st vincents rocks at bristol and the marble cliffs 250 feet in height covered in part with rich wood and rare flowers and the avon running through the narrow gorge and the stately ships sailing far below your feet from bristol to the severn sea  and you may see for here they are corals from st vincents rocks cut and polished showing too that they also like the dudley limestone are made up of corals and of coral mud  now whenever you see st vincents rocks as i suspect you very soon will recollect where you are and use your fancy to paint for yourself a picture as strange as it is true  fancy that those rocks are what they once were a coralreef close to the surface of a shallow sea fancy that there is no gorge of the avon no wide severn seafor those were eaten out by water ages and ages afterwards  but picture to yourself the coral sea reaching away to the north to the foot of the welsh mountains and then fancy yourself if you will in a canoe paddling up through the coralreefs north and still north up the valley down which the severn now flows up through what is now worcestershire then up through staffordshire then through derbyshire into yorkshire and so on through durham and northumberland till your find yourself stopped by the ettrick hills in scotland while all to the westward of you where is now the greater part of england was open sea  you may say if you know anything of the geography of england impossible  that would be to paddle over the tops of high mountains over the top of the peak in derbyshire over the top of high craven and whernside and peny gent and cross fell and to paddle too over the cheviot hills which part england and scotland  i know it my child i know it  but so it was once on a time  the high limestone mountains which part lancashire and yorkshirethe very chine and backbone of englandwere once coralreefs at the bottom of the sea  they are all made up of the carboniferous limestone so called as your little knowledge of latin ought to tell you because it carries the coal because the coalfields usually lie upon it  it may be impossible in your eyes but remember always that nothing is impossible with god  but you said that the coal was made from plants and trees and did plants and trees grow on this coralreef  that i cannot say  trees may have grown on the dry parts of the reef as cocoanuts grow now in the pacific  but the coal was not laid down upon it till long afterwards when it had gone through many and strange changes  for all through the chine of england and in a part of ireland too there lies upon the top of the limestone a hard gritty rock in some places three thousand feet thick which is commonly called the millstone grit  and above that again the coal begins  now to make that 3000 feet of hard rock what must have happened  the seabottom must have sunk slowly no doubt carrying the coralreefs down with it 3000 feet at least  and meanwhile sand and mud made from the wearing away of the old lands in the north must have settled down upon it  i say from the northfor there are no fossils as far as i know or sign of life in these rocks of millstone grit and therefore it is reasonable to suppose that they were brought from a cold current at the pole too cold to allow seabeasts to livequite cold enough certainly to kill coral insects who could only thrive in warm water coming from the south  then to go on with my story upon the top of these millstone grits came sand and mud and peat and trees and plants washed out to sea as far as we can guess from the mouths of vast rivers flowing from the west rivers as vast as the amazon the mississippi or the orinoco are now and so in long ages upon the top of the limestone and upon the top of the millstone grit were laid down those beds of coal which you see burnt now in every fire  but how did the coralreefs rise till they became cliffs at bristol and mountains in yorkshire  the earthquake steam i suppose raised them  one earthquake indeed or series of earthquakes there was running along between lancashire and yorkshire which made that vast crack and upheaval in the rocks the craven fault running i believe for more than a hundred miles and lifting the rocks in some places several hundred feet  that earthquake helped to make the high hills which overhang manchester and preston and all the manufacturing county of lancashire  that earthquake helped to make the perpendicular cliff at malham cove and many another beautiful bit of scenery  and that and other earthquakes by heating the rocks from the fires below may have helped to change them from soft coral into hard crystalline marble as you see them now just as volcanic heat has hardened and purified the beautiful white marbles of pentelicus and paros in greece and carrara in italy from which statues are carved unto this day  or the same earthquake may have heated and hardened the limestones simply by grinding and squeezing them or they may have been heated and hardened in the course of long ages simply by the weight of the thousands of feet of other rock which lay upon them  for pressure you must remember produces heat  when you strike flint and steel together the pressure of the blow not only makes bits of steel fly off but makes them fly off in redhot sparks  when you hammer a piece of iron with a hammer you will soon find it get quite warm  when you squeeze the air together in your popgun you actually make the air inside warmer till the pellet flies out and the air expands and cools again  nay i believe you cannot hold up a stone on the palm of your hand without that stone after a while warming your hand because it presses against you in trying to fall and you press against it in trying to hold it up  and recollect above all the great and beautiful example of that law which you were lucky enough to see on the night of the 14th of november 1867 how those falling stars as i told you then were coming out of boundless space colder than any ice on earth and yet simply by pressing against the air above our heads they had their motion turned into heat till they burned themselves up into trains of fiery dust  so remember that wherever you have pressure you have heat and that the pressure of the upper rocks upon the lower is quite enough some think to account for the older and lower rocks being harder than the upper and newer ones  but why should the lower rocks be older and the upper rocks newer  you told me just now that the high mountains in wales were ages older than windsor forest upon which we stand but yet how much lower we are here than if we were on a welsh mountain  ah my dear child of course that puzzles you and i am afraid it must puzzle you still till we have another talk or rather it seems to me that the best way to explain that puzzle to you would be for you and me to go a journey into the far west and look into the matter for ourselves and from here to the far west we will go either in fancy or on a real railroad and steamboat before we have another talk about these things  now it is time to stop  is there anything more you want to know for you look as if something was puzzling you still  were there any men in the world while all this was going on  i think not  we have no proof that there were not but also we have no proof that there were the cavemen of whom i told you lived many ages after the coal was covered up  you seem to be sorry that there were no men in the world then  because it seems a pity that there was no one to see those beautiful coralreefs and coalforests  no one to see them my child  who told you that  who told you there are not and never have been any rational beings in this vast universe save certain weak ignorant shortsighted creatures shaped like you and me but even if it were so and no created eye had ever beheld those ancient wonders and no created heart ever enjoyed them is there not one uncreated who has seen them and enjoyed them from the beginning  were not these creatures enjoying themselves each after their kind  and was there not a father in heaven who was enjoying their enjoyment and enjoying too their beauty which he had formed according to the ideas of his eternal mind  recollect what you were told on trinity sundaythat this world was not made for man alone but that man and this world and the whole universe was made for god for he created all things and for his pleasure they are and were created     chapter xfield and wild   where were we to go next  into the far west to see how all the way along the railroads the new rocks and soils lie above the older and yet how when we get westward the oldest rocks rise highest into the air  well we will go but not i think today  indeed i hardly know how we could get as far as reading for all the world is in the hayfield and even the old horse must go thither too and take his turn at the haycart  well the rocks have been where they are for many a year and they will wait our leisure patiently enough but midsummer and the hay field will not wait  let us take what god gives when he sends it and learn the lesson that lies nearest to us  after all it is more to my old mind and perhaps to your young mind too to look at things which are young and fresh and living rather than things which are old and worn and dead  let us leave the old stones and the old bones and the old shells the wrecks of ancient worlds which have gone down into the kingdom of death to teach us their grand lessons some other day and let us look now at the world of light and life and beauty which begins here at the open door and stretches away over the hayfields over the woods over the southern moors over sunny france and sunnier spain and over the tropic seas down to the equator and the palmgroves of the eternal summer  if we cannot find something even at starting from the open door to teach us about why and how we must be very shortsighted or very shallowhearted  there is the old cock starling screeching in the eaves because he wants to frighten us away and take a worm to his children without our finding out whereabouts his hole is  how does he know that we might hurt him and how again does he not know that we shall not hurt him we who for fiveandtwenty years have let him and his ancestors build under those eaves in peace  how did he get that quantity of halfwit that sort of stupid cunning into his little brain and yet get no more  and why for this is a question of why and not of how does he labour all day long hunting for worms and insects for his children while his wife nurses them in the nest  why too did he help her to build that nest with toil and care this spring for the sake of a set of nestlings who can be of no gain or use to him but only take the food out of his mouth  simply out ofwhat shall i call it my childlove that same sense of love and duty coming surely from that one fountain of all duty and all love which makes your father work for you  that the mother should take care of her young is wonderful enough but that at least among many birds the father should help likewise is as you will find out as you grow older more wonderful far  so there already the old starling has set us two fresh puzzles about how and why neither of which we shall get answered at least on this side of the grave  come on up the field under the great generous sun who quarrels with no one grudges no one but shines alike upon the evil and the good  what a gay picture he is painting now with his lightpencils for in them remember and not in the things themselves the colour lies  see how where the hay has been already carried he floods all the slopes with yellow light making them stand out sharp against the black shadows of the wood while where the grass is standing still he makes the sheets of sorrelflower blush rosy red or dapples the field with white oxeyes  but is not the sorrel itself red and the oxeyes white  what colour are they at night when the sun is gone  dark  that is no colour  the very grass is not green at night  oh but it is if you look at it with a lantern  no no  it is the light of the lantern which happens to be strong enough to make the leaves look green though it is not strong enough to make a geranium look red  not red  no the geranium flowers by a lantern look black while the leaves look green  if you dont believe me we will try  but why is that  why i cannot tell and how you had best ask professor tyndall if you ever have the honour of meeting him  but nowhark to the mowingmachine humming like a giant nightjar  come up and look at it and see how swift and smooth it shears the long grass down so that in the middle of the swathe it seems to have merely fallen flat and you must move it before you find that it has been cut off  ah there is a proof to us of what men may do if they will only learn the lessons which madam how can teach them  there is that boy fresh from the national school cutting more grass in a day than six strong mowers could have cut and cutting it better too for the mowingmachine goes so much nearer to the ground than the scythe that we gain by it two hundredweight of hay on every acre  and see too how persevering old madam how will not stop her work though the machine has cut off all the grass which she has been making for the last three months for as fast as we shear it off she makes it grow again  there are fresh blades here at our feet a full inch long which have sprung up in the last two days for the cattle when they are turned in next week  but if the machine cuts all the grass the poor mowers will have nothing to do  not so  they are all busy enough elsewhere  there is plenty of other work to be done thank god and wholesomer and easier work than mowing with a burning sun on their backs drinking gallons of beer and getting first hot and then cold across the loins till they lay in a store of lumbago and sciatica to cripple them in their old age  you delight in machinery because it is curious you should delight in it besides because it does good and nothing but good where it is used according to the laws of lady why with care moderation and mercy and fairplay between man and man  for example just as the mowingmachine saves the mowers the threshingmachine saves the threshers from rheumatism and chest complaintswhich they used to catch in the draught and dust of the unhealthiest place in the whole parish which is the oldfashioned barns floor  and so we may hope in future years all heavy drudgery and dirty work will be done more and more by machines and people will have more and more chance of keeping themselves clean and healthy and more and more time to read and learn and think and be true civilised men and women instead of being mere live ploughs or live manurecarts such as i have seen ere now  a live manurecart  yes child  if you had seen as i have seen in foreign lands poor women haggard dirty grown old before their youth was over toiling up hill with baskets of foul manure upon their backs you would have said as i have said oh for madam how to cure that ignorance  oh for lady why to cure that barbarism  oh that madam how would teach them that machinery must always be cheaper in the long run than human muscles and nerves  oh that lady why would teach them that a woman is the most precious thing on earth and that if she be turned into a beast of burden lady whyand madam how likewisewill surely avenge the wrongs of their human sister  there you do not quite know what i mean and i do not care that you should  it is good for little folk that big folk should now and then talk over their heads as the saying is and make them feel how ignorant they are and how many solemn and earnest questions there are in the world on which they must make up their minds some day though not yet  but now we will talk about the hay or rather do you and the rest go and play in the hay and gather it up build forts of it storm them pull them down build them up again shout laugh and scream till you are hot and tired  you will please madam how thereby and lady why likewise  how  because madam how naturally wants her work to succeed and she is at work now making you  making me  of course  making a man of you out of a boy  and that can only be done by the lifeblood which runs through and through you  and the more you laugh and shout the more pure air will pass into your blood and make it red and healthy and the more you romp and playunless you overtire yourselfthe quicker will that blood flow through all your limbs to make bone and muscle and help you to grow into a man  but why does lady why like to see us play  she likes to see you happy as she likes to see the trees and birds happy  for she knows well that there is no food nor medicine either like happiness  if people are not happy enough they are often tempted to do many wrong deeds and to think many wrong thoughts and if by gods grace they know the laws of lady why and keep from sin still unhappiness if it goes on too long wears them out body and mind and they grow ill and die of broken hearts and broken brains my child and so at last poor souls find rest beneath the cross  children too who are unhappy children who are bullied and frightened and kept dull and silent never thrive  their bodies do not thrive for they grow up weak  their minds do not thrive for they grow up dull their souls do not thrive for they learn mean sly slavish ways which god forbid you should ever learn  well said the wise man the human plant like the vegetables can only flower in sunshine  so do you go and enjoy yourself in the sunshine but remember thisyou know what happiness is  then if you wish to please lady why and lady whys lord and king likewise you will never pass a little child without trying to make it happier even by a passing smile  and now be off and play in the hay and come back to me when you are tired        let us lie down at the foot of this old oak and see what we can see  and hear what we can hear too  what is that humming all round us now that the noisy mowingmachine has stopped  and as much softer than the noise of mowingmachine hum as the machines which make it are more delicate and more curious  madam how is a very skilful workwoman and has eyes which see deeper and clearer than all microscopes as you would find if you tried to see what makes that midsummer hum of which the haymakers are so fond because it promises fair weather  why it is only the gnats and flies  only the gnats and flies  you might study those gnats and flies for your whole life without finding out allor more than a very littleabout them  i wish i knew how they move those tiny wings of theirsa thousand times in a second i dare say some of them  i wish i knew how far they know that they are happyfor happy they must be whether they know it or not  i wish i knew how they live at all  i wish i even knew how many sorts there are humming round us at this moment  how many kinds  three or four  more probably thirty or forty round this single tree  but why should there be so many kinds of living things  would not one or two have done just as well  why indeed  why should there not have been only one sort of butterfly and he only of one colour a plain brown or a plain white  and why should there be so many sorts of birds all robbing the garden at once  thrushes and blackbirds and sparrows and chaffinches and greenfinches and bullfinches and tomtits  and there are four kinds of tomtits round here remember but we may go on with such talk for ever  wiser men than we have asked the same question but lady why will not answer them yet  however there is another question which madam how seems inclined to answer just now which is almost as deep and mysterious  what  how all these different kinds of things became different  oh do tell me  not i  you must begin at the beginning before you can end at the end or even make one step towards the end  what do you mean  you must learn the differences between things before you can find out how those differences came about  you must learn madam hows alphabet before you can read her book  and madam hows alphabet of animals and plants is species kinds of things  you must see which are like and which unlike what they are like in and what they are unlike in  you are beginning to do that with your collection of butterflies  you like to arrange them and those that are most like nearest to each other and to compare them  you must do that with thousands of different kinds of things before you can read one page of madam hows natural history book rightly  but it will take so much time and so much trouble  god grant that you may not spend more time on worse matters and take more trouble over things which will profit you far less  but so it must be willynilly  you must learn the alphabet if you mean to read  and you must learn the value of the figures before you can do a sum  why what would you think of any one who sat down to play at cardsfor money too which i hope and trust you never will dobefore he knew the names of the cards and which counted highest and took the other  of course he would be very foolish  just as foolish are those who make up theories as they call them about this world and how it was made before they have found out what the world is made of  you might as well try to find out how this hay field was made without finding out first what the hay is made of  how the hayfield was made  was it not always a hayfield  ah yes the old story my child was not the earth always just what it is now  let us see for ourselves whether this was always a hayfield  how  just pick out all the different kinds of plants and flowers you can find round us here  how many do you think there are  ohthere seem to be four or five  just as there were three or four kinds of flies in the air  pick them child and count  let us have facts  how many  what a dozen already  yesand here is another and another  why i have got i dont know how many  why not  bring them here and let us see  nine kinds of grasses and a rush  six kinds of clovers and vetches and besides dandelion and rattle and oxeye and sorrel and plantain and buttercup and a little stitchwort and pignut and mouseear hawkweed too which nobody wants  why  because they are a sign that i am not a good farmer enough and have not quite turned my wild into field  what do you mean  look outside the boundary fence at the moors and woods they are forest wildwald as the germans would call it  inside the fence is fieldfeld as the germans would call it  guess why  is it because the trees inside have been felled  well some say so who know more than i  but now go over the fence and see how many of these plants you can find on the moor  oh i think i know  i am so often on the moor  i think you would find more kinds outside than you fancy  but what do you know  that beside some short fine grass about the cattlepaths there are hardly any grasses on the moor save deers hair and gladegrass and all the rest is heath and moss and furze and fern  softlynot all you have forgotten the bog plants and there are as i said many more plants beside on the moor than you fancy  but we will look into that another time  at all events the plants outside are on the whole quite different from the hayfield  of course that is what makes the field look green and the moor brown  not a doubt  they are so different that they look like bits of two different continents  scrambling over the fence is like scrambling out of europe into australia  now how was that difference made  think dont guess but think  why does the rich grass come up to the bank and yet not spread beyond it  i suppose because it cannot get over  not get over  would not the wind blow the seeds and the birds carry them  they do get over in millions i dont doubt every summer  then why do they not grow  think  is there any difference in the soil inside and out  a very good guess  but guesses are no use without facts  look  oh i remember now  i know now the soil of the field is brown like the garden and the soil of the moor all black and peaty  yes  but if you dig down two or three feet you will find the soils of the moor and the field just the same  so perhaps the top soils were once both alike  i know  well and what do you think about it now  i want you to look and think i want every one to look and think  half the misery in the world comes first from not looking and then from not thinking  and i do not want you to be miserable  but shall i be miserable if i do not find out such little things as this  you will be miserable if you do not learn to understand little things because then you will not be able to understand great things when you meet them  children who are not trained to use their eyes and their common sense grow up the more miserable the cleverer they are  why  because they grow up what men call dreamers and bigots and fanatics causing misery to themselves and to all who deal with them  so i say again think  well i suppose men must have altered the soil inside the bank  well done  but why do you think so  because of course some one made the bank and the brown soil only goes up to it  well that is something like common sense  now you will not say any more as the cows or the butterflies might that the hayfield was always there  and how did men change the soil  by tilling it with the plough to sweeten it and manuring it to make it rich  and then did all these beautiful grasses grow up of themselves  you ought to know that they most likely did not  you know the new enclosures  yes  well then do rich grasses come up on them now that they are broken up  oh no nothing but groundsel and a few weeds  just what i dare say came up here at first  but this land was tilled for corn for hundreds of years i believe  and just about one hundred years ago it was laid down in grass that is sown with grass seeds  and where did men get the grass seeds from  ah that is a long story and one that shows our forefathers though they knew nothing about railroads or electricity were not such simpletons as some folks think  the way it must have been done was this  men watched the natural pastures where cattle get fat on the wild grass as they do in the fens and many other parts of england  and then they saved the seeds of those fattening wild grasses and sowed them in fresh spots often they made mistakes  they were careless and got weeds among the seedlike the buttercups which do so much harm to this pasture  or they sowed on soil which would not suit the seed and it died  but at last after many failures they have grown so careful and so clever that you may send to certain shops saying what sort of soil yours is and they will send you just the seeds which will grow there and no other and then you have a good pasture for as long as you choose to keep it good  and how is it kept good  look at all those loads of hay which are being carried off the field  do you think you can take all that away without putting anything in its place  why not  if i took all the butter out of the churn what must i do if i want more butter still  put more cream in  so if i want more grass to grow i must put on the soil more of what grass is made of  but the butter dont grow and the grass does  what does the grass grow in  the soil  yes  just as the butter grows in the churn  so you must put fresh grass stuff continually into the soil as you put fresh cream into the churn you have heard the farm men say that crop has taken a good deal out of the land  yes  then they spoke exact truth  what will that hay turn into by christmas cant you tell  into milk of course which you will drink and into horseflesh too which you will use  use horseflesh  not eat it  no we have not got as far as that  we did not even make up our minds to taste the cambridge donkey  but every time the horse draws the carriage he uses up so much muscle and that muscle he must get back again by eating hay and corn and that hay and corn must be put back again into the land by manure or there will be all the less for the horse next year  for one cannot eat ones cake and keep it too and no more can one eat ones grass  so this field is a truly wonderful place  it is no ugly pile of brick and mortar with a tall chimney pouring out smoke and evil smells with unhealthy haggard people toiling inside  why do you look surprised  becausebecause nobody ever said it was  you mean a manufactory  well and this hayfield is a manufactory only like most of madam hows workshops infinitely more beautiful as well as infinitely more crafty than any manufactory of mans building  it is beautiful to behold and healthy to work in a joy and blessing alike to the eye and the mind and the body and yet it is a manufactory  but a manufactory of what  of milk of course and cows and sheep and horses and of your body and minefor we shall drink the milk and eat the meat  and therefore it is a flesh and milk manufactory  we must put into it every year yardstuff tankstuff guano bones and anything and everything of that kin that madam how may cook it for us into grass and cook the grass again into milk and meat  but if we dont give madam how material to work on we cannot expect her to work for us  and what do you think will happen then  she will set to work for herself  the rich grasses will dwindle for want of ammonia that is smelling salts and the rich clovers for want of phosphates that is boneearth and in their places will come over the bank the old weeds and grass off the moor which have not room to get in now because the ground is coveted already  they want no ammonia nor phosphatesat all events they have none and that is why the cattle on the moor never get fat  so they can live where these rich grasses cannot  and then they will conquer and thrive and the field will turn into wild once more  ah my child thank god for your forefathers when you look over that boundary mark  for the difference between the field and the wild is the difference between the old england of madam hows making and the new england which she has taught man to make carrying on what she had only begun and had not time to finish  that moor is a pattern bit left to show what the greater part of this land was like for long ages after it had risen out of the sea when there was little or nothing on the flat upper moors save heaths and ling and clubmosses and soft gorse and needlewhin and creeping willows and furze and fern upon the brows and in the bottoms oak and ash beech and alder hazel and mountain ash holly and thorn with here and there an aspen or a buckthorn berrybearing alder as you call it and everywherewhere he could thrust down his long root and thrust up his long shootsthat intruding conqueror and insolent tyrant the bramble there were sedges and rushes too in the bogs and coarse grass on the forest pasturesor leas as we call them to this day round herebut no real green fields and i suspect very few gay flowers save in spring the sheets of golden gorse and in summer the purple heather  such was old englandor rather such was this land before it was england a far sadder damper poorer land than now  for one man or one cow or sheep which could have lived on it then a hundred can live now  and yet what it was once that it might become againit surely would round here if this brave english people died out of it and the land was left to itself once more  what would happen then you may guess for yourself from what you see happen whenever the land is left to itself as it is in the wood above in that wood you can still see the grass ridges and furrows which show that it was once ploughed and sown by man perhaps as late as the time of henry the eighth when a great deal of poor land as you will read some day was thrown out of tillage to become forest and down once more  and what is the mount now  a jungle of oak and beech cherry and holly young and old all growing up together with the mountain ash and bramble and furze coming up so fast beneath them that we have to cut the paths clear again year by year  why even the little cowwheat a very old world plant which only grows in ancient woods has found its way back again i know not whence and covers the open spaces with its pretty yellow and white flowers  man had conquered this mount you see from madam how hundreds of years ago  and she always lets man conquer her because lady why wishes man to conquer only he must have a fair fight with madam how first and try his strength against hers to the utmost  so man conquered the wood for a while and it became cornfield instead of forest but he was not strong and wise enough three hundred years ago to keep what he had conquered and back came madam how and took the place into her own hands and bade the old forest trees and plants come back againas they would come if they were not stopped year by year down from the wood over the pastureskilling the rich grasses as they went till they met another forest coming up from below and fought it for many a year till both made peace and lived quietly side by side for ages  another forest coming up from below  where would it come from  from where it is now  come down and look along the brook and every drain and grip which runs into the brook  what is here  seedling alders and some withies among them  very well  you know how we pull these alders up and cut them down and yet they continually come again  now if we and all human beings were to leave this pasture for a few hundred years would not those alders increase into a wood  would they not kill the grass and spread right and left seeding themselves more and more as the grass died and left the ground bare till they met the oaks and beeches coming down the hill and then would begin a great fight for years and years between oak and beech against alder and willow  but how can trees fight  could they move or beat each other with their boughs  not quite that though they do beat each other with their boughs fiercely enough in a gale of wind and then the trees who have strong and stiff boughs wound those who have brittle and limp boughs and so hurt them and if the storms come often enough kill them  but among these trees in a sheltered valley the larger and stronger would kill the weaker and smaller by simply overshadowing their tops and starving their roots starving them indeed so much when they grow very thick that the poor little acorns and beech mast and alder seeds would not be able to sprout at all  so they would fight killing each others children till the war endedi think i can guess how  how  the beeches are as dainty as they are beautiful and they do not like to get their feet wet  so they would venture down the hill only as far as the dry ground lasts and those who tried to grow any lower would die but the oaks are hardy and do not care much where they grow  so they would fight their way down into the wet ground among the alders and willows till they came to where their enemies were so thick and tall that the acorns as they fell could not sprout in the darkness  and so you would have at last along the hillside a forest of beech and oak lower down a forest of oak and alder and along the streamside alders and willows only  and that would be a very fair example of the great law of the struggle for existence which causes the competition of species  what is that  madam how is very stern though she is always perfectly just and therefore she makes every living thing fight for its life and earn its bread from its birth till its death and rewards it exactly according to its deserts and neither more nor less  and the competition of species means that each thing and kind of things has to compete against the things round it and to see which is the stronger and the stronger live and breed and spread and the weaker die out  but that is very hard  i know it my child i know it  but so it is  and madam how no doubt would be often very clumsy and very cruel without meaning it because she never sees beyond her own nose or thinks at all about the consequences of what she is doing  but lady why who does think about consequences is her mistress and orders her about for ever  and lady why is i believe as loving as she is wise and therefore we must trust that she guides this great war between living things and takes care that madam how kills nothing which ought not to die and takes nothing away without putting something more beautiful and something more useful in its place and that even if england were which god forbid overrun once more with forests and bramblebrakes that too would be of use somehow somewhere somewhen in the long ages which are to come hereafter  and you must remember too that since men came into the world with rational heads on their shoulders lady why has been handing over more and more of madam hows work to them and some of her own work too and bids them to put beautiful and useful things in the place of ugly and useless ones so that now it is mens own fault if they do not use their wits and do by all the world what they have done by these pastureschange it from a barren moor into a rich hayfield by copying the laws of madam how and making grass compete against heath  but you look thoughtful what is it you want to know  why you say all living things must fight and scramble for what they can get from each other and must not i too  for i am a living thing  ah that is the old question which our lord answered long ago and said be not anxious what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink or wherewithal you shall be clothed  for after all these things do the heathen seek and your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of these things  but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you  a few very few people have taken that advice  but they have been just the salt of the earth which has kept mankind from decaying  but what has that to do with it  see  you are a living thing you say  are you a plant  no  are you an animal  i do not know  yes  i suppose i am  i eat and drink and sleep just as dogs and cats do  yes  there is no denying that  no one knew that better than st paul when he told men that they had a flesh that is a body and an animals nature in them  but st paul told themof course he was not the first to say so for all the wise heathens have known thatthat there was something more in us which he called a spirit  some call it now the moral sentiment some one thing some another but we will keep to the old word we shall not find a better  yes i know that i have a spirit a soul  better to say that you are a spirit  but what does st paul say  that our spirit is to conquer our flesh and keep it down  that the man in us in short which is made in the likeness of god is to conquer the animal in us which is made in the likeness of the dog and the cat and sometimes i fear in the likeness of the ape or the pig  you would not wish to be like a cat much less like an ape or a pig  of course not  then do not copy them by competing and struggling for existence against other people  what do you mean  did you never watch the pigs feeding  yes and how they grudge and quarrel and shove each others noses out of the trough and even bite each other because they are so jealous which shall get most  that is it  and how the biggest pig drives the others away and would starve them while he got fat if the man did not drive him off in his turn  oh yes i know  then no wiser than those pigs are worldly men who compete and grudge and struggle with each other which shall get most money most fame most power over their fellowmen  they will tell you my child that that is the true philosophy and the true wisdom that competition is the natural law of society and the source of wealth and prosperity  do not you listen to them  that is the wisdom of this world which the flesh teaches the animals and those who follow it like the animals will perish  such men are not even as wise as sweep the retriever  not as wise as sweep  not they  sweep will not take away victors bone though he is ten times as big as victor and could kill him in a moment and when he catches a rabbit does he eat it himself  of course not he brings it and lays it down at our feet  because he likes better to do his duty and be praised for it than to eat the rabbit dearly as he longs to eat it  but he is only an animal  who taught him to be generous and dutiful and faithful  who indeed  not we you know that for he has grown up with us since a puppy  how he learnt it and his parents before him is a mystery of which we can only say god has taught them we know not how  but see what has happenedthat just because dogs have learnt not to be selfish and to competethat is have become civilised and tametherefore we let them live with us and love them  because they try to be good in their simple way therefore they too have all things added to them and live far happier and more comfortable lives than the selfish wolf and fox  but why have not all animals found out that  i cannot tell there may be wise animals and foolish animals as there are wise and foolish men  indeed there are  i see a very wise animal there who never competes for she has learned something of the golden lessonthat it is more blessed to give than to receive and she acts on what she has learnt all day long  which do you mean  why that is a bee  yes it is a bee and i wish i were as worthy in my place as that bee is in hers  i wish i could act up as well as she does to the true wisdom which is selfsacrifice  for whom is that bee working  for herself  if that was all she only needs to suck the honey as she goes  but she is storing up the wax under her stomach and beebread in her thighsfor whom  not for herself only or even for her own children but for the children of another bee her queen  for them she labours all day long builds for them feeds them nurses them spends her love and cunning on them  so does that ant on the path  she is carrying home that stick to build for other ants children  so do the white ants in the tropics they have learnt not to compete but to help each other not to be selfish but to sacrifice themselves and therefore they are strong  but you told me once that ants would fight and plunder each others nests  and once we saw two hives of bees fighting in the air and falling dead by dozens  my child do not men fight and kill each other by thousands with sharp shot and cold steel because though they have learnt the virtue of patriotism they have not yet learnt that of humanity  we must not blame the bees and ants if they are no wiser than men  at least they are wise enough to stand up for their country that is their hive and work for it and die for it if need be and that makes them strong  but how does that make them strong  how is a deep question and one i can hardly answer yet  but that it has made them so there is no doubt  look at the solitary beesthe governors as we call them who live in pairs in little holes in the banks  how few of them there are and they never seem to increase in numbers  then look at the hive bees how just because they are civilisedthat is because they help each other and feed each other instead of being solitary and selfishthey breed so fast and get so much food that if they were not killed for their honey they would soon become a nuisance and drive us out of the parish  but then we give them their hives ready made  true  but in old forest countries where trees decay and grow hollow the bees breed in them  yes  i remember the bee tree in the fir avenue  well then in many forests in hot countries the bees swarm in hollow trees and they and the ants and the white ants have it all their own way and are lords and masters driving the very wild beasts before them while the ants and white ants eat up all gardens and plantations and clothes and furniture till it is a serious question whether in some hot countries man will ever be able to settle so strong have the ants grown by ages of civilisation and not competing against their brothers and sisters  but may i not compete for prizes against the other boys  well there is no harm in that for you do not harm the others even if you win  they will have learnt all the more while trying for the prize and so will you even if you dont get it  but i tell you fairly trying for prizes is only fit for a child and when you become a man you must put away childish thingscompetition among the rest  but surely i may try to be better and wiser and more learned than everybody else  my dearest child why try for that  try to be as good and wise and learned as you can and if you find any man or ten thousand men superior to you thank god for it  do you think that there can be too much wisdom in the world  of course not but i should like to be the wisest man in it  then you would only have the heaviest burden of all men on your shoulders  why  because you would be responsible for more foolish people than any one else  remember what wise old moses said when some one came and told him that certain men in the camp were prophesyingwould god all the lords people did prophesy  yes it would have saved moses many a heartache and many a sleepless night if all the jews had been wise as he was and wiser still  so do not you compete with good and wise men but simply copy them and whatever you do do not compete with the wolves and the apes and the swine of this world for that is a game at which you are sure to be beaten  why  because lady why if she loves you as i trust she does will take care that you are beaten lest you should fancy it was really profitable to live like a cunning sort of animal and not like a true man  and how she will do that i can tell you  she will take care that you always come across a worse man than you are trying to bea more apish man who can tumble and play monkeytricks for peoples amusement better than you can or a more swinish man who can get at more of the pigswash than you can or a more wolfish man who will eat you up if you do not get out of his way and so she will disappoint and disgust you my child with that greedy selfish vain animal life till you turn round and see your mistake and try to live the true human life which also is divineto be just and honourable gentle and forgiving generous and usefulin one word to fear god and keep his commandments and as you live that life you will find that by the eternal laws of lady why all other things will be added to you that people will be glad to know you glad to help you glad to employ you because they see that you will be of use to them and will do them no harm  and if you meet as you will meet with people better and wiser than yourself then so much the better for you for they will love you and be glad to teach you when they see that you are living the unselfish and harmless life and that you come to them not as foolish critias came to socrates to learn political cunning and become a selfish and ambitious tyrant but as wise plato came that he might learn the laws of lady why and love them for her sake and teach them to all mankind  and so you like the plants and animals will get your deserts exactly without competing and struggling for existence as they do  and all this has come out of looking at the hayfield and the wild moor  why not  there is an animal in you and there is a man in you  if the animal gets the upper hand all your character will fall back into wild useless moor if the man gets the upper hand all your character will be cultivated into rich and fertile field  choose  now come down home  the haymakers are resting under the hedge  the horses are dawdling home to the farm  the sun is getting low and the shadows long  come home and go to bed while the house is fragrant with the smell of hay and dream that you are still playing among the haycocks  when you grow old you will have other and sadder dreams     chapter xithe worlds end   hullo hi wake up  jump out of bed and come to the window and see where you are  what a wonderful place  so it is though it is only poor old ireland  dont you recollect that when we started i told you we were going to ireland and through it to the worlds end and here we are now safe at the end of the old world and beyond us the great atlantic and beyond that again thousands of miles away the new world which will be rich and prosperous civilised and noble thousands of years hence when this old world it may be will be dead and little children there will be reading in their history books of ancient england and of ancient france as you now read of greece and rome  but what a wonderful place it is  what are those great green things standing up in the sky all over purple ribs and bars with their tops hid in the clouds  those are mountains the bones of some old world whose poor bare sides madam how is trying to cover with rich green grass  and how far off are they  how i should like to walk up to the top of that one which looks quite close  you will find it a long walk up there three miles i dare say over black bogs and banks of rock and up corries and cliffs which you could not climb  there are plenty of cows on that mountain and yet they look so small you could not see them nor i either without a glass  that long white streak zigzagging down the mountain side is a roaring cataract of foam five hundred feet high full now with last nights rain but by this afternoon it will have dwindled to a little thread and to morrow when you get up if no more rain has come down it will be gone madam how works here among the mountains swiftly and hugely and sometimes terribly enough as you shall see when you have had your breakfast and come down to the bridge with me  but what a beautiful place it is  flowers and woods and a lawn and what is that great smooth patch in the lawn just under the window  is it an empty flowerbed  ah thereby hangs a strange tale  we will go and look at it after breakfast and then you shall see with your own eyes one of the wonders which i have been telling you of  and what is that shining between the trees  water  is it a lake  not a lake though there are plenty round here that is salt water not fresh  look away to the right and you see it through the opening of the woods again and again and now look above the woods  you see a faint blue line and gray and purple lumps like clouds which rest upon it far away  that child is the great atlantic ocean and those are islands in the far west  the water which washes the bottom of the lawn was but a few months ago pouring out of the gulf of mexico between the bahamas and florida and swept away here as the great ocean river of warm water which we call the gulf stream bringing with it out of the open ocean the shoals of mackerel and the porpoises and whales which feed upon them some fine afternoon we will run down the bay and catch strange fishes such as you never saw before and very likely see a living whale  what such a whale as they get whalebone from and which eats seamoths  no they live far north in the arctic circle these are grampuses and bottlenoses which feed on fish not so big as the right whales but quite big enough to astonish you if one comes up and blows close to the boat  get yourself dressed and come down and then we will go out we shall have plenty to see and talk of at every step  now you have finished your breakfast at last so come along and we shall see what we shall see  first run out across the gravel and scramble up that bank of lawn and you will see what you fancied was an empty flowerbed  why it is all hard rock  ah you are come into the land of rocks now out of the land of sand and gravel out of a soft young corner of the world into a very hard old weatherbeaten corner and you will see rocks enough and too many for the poor farmers before you go home again  but how beautifully smooth and flat the rock is and yet it is all rounded  what is it like  likelike the half of a shell  not badly said but think again  likelikei know what it is like  like the back of some great monster peeping up through the turf  you have got it  such rocks as these are called in switzerland roches moutonnees because they are people fancy like sheeps backs  now look at the cracks and layers in it  they run across the stone they have nothing to do with the shape of it  you see that  yes but here are cracks running across them all along the stone till the turf hides them  look at them again they are no cracks they do not go into the stone  i see  they are scratched something like those on the elderstem at home where the cats sharpen their claws  but it would take a big cat to make them  do you recollect what i told you of madam hows hand more flexible than any hand of man and yet strong enough to grind the mountains into paste  i know  ice ice ice  but are these really icemarks  child on the place where we now stand over rich lawns and warm woods and shining lochs lay once on a time hundreds it may be thousands of feet of solid ice crawling off yonder mountaintops into the ocean there outside and this is one of its tracks  see how the scratches all point straight down the valley and straight out to sea  those mountains are 2000 feet high but they were much higher once for the ice has planed the tops off them  then it seems to me the ice sank and left the mountains standing out of it about half their height and at that level it stayed till it had planed down all those lower moors of smooth bare rock between us and the western ocean and then it sank again and dwindled back leaving moraines that is heaps of dirt and stones all up these valleys here and there till at the last it melted all away and poor old ireland became fit to live in again  we will go down the bay some day and look at those moraines some of them quite hills of earth and then you will see for yourself how mighty a chisel the icechisel was and what vast heaps of chips it has left behind  now then down over the lawn towards the bridge  listen to the river louder and louder every step we take  what a roar  is there a waterfall there  no  it is only the flood  and underneath the roar of that flood do you not hear a deeper notea dull rumbling as if from underground  yes  what is it  the rolling of great stones under water which are being polished against each other as they hurry toward the sea  now up on the parapet of the bridge  i will hold you tight  look and see madam hows rainspade at work  look at the terrible yellow torrent below us almost filling up the arches of the bridge and leaping high in waves and crests of foam  oh the bridge is falling into the water  not a bit  you are not accustomed to see water running below you at ten miles an hour  never mind that feeling  it will go off in a few seconds  look the water is full six feet up the trunks of the trees over the grass and the king fern and the tall purple loosestrife  oh  here comes a tree dancing down  and there are some turfs which have been cut on the mountain  and there is a really sad sight  look what comes now  onetwothree  why they are sheep  yes  and a sad loss they will be to some poor fellow in the glen above  and oh  look at the pig turning round and round solemnly in the corner under the rock  poor piggy  he ought to have been at home safe in his stye and not wandering about the hills  and what are these coming now  butter firkins i think  yes  this is a great flood  it is well if there are no lives lost  but is it not cruel of madam how to make such floods  welllet us ask one of these men who are looking over the bridge  why what does he say  i cannot understand one word  is he talking irish  irishenglish at least but what he said was that it was a mighty fine flood entirely praised be god and would help on the potatoes and oats after the drought and set the grass growing again on the mountains  and what is he saying now  that the river will be full of salmon and white trout after this  what does he mean  that under our feet now if we could see through the muddy water dozens of salmon and seatrout are running up from the sea  what up this furious stream  yes  what would be death to you is pleasure and play to them  up they are going to spawn in the little brooks among the mountains and all of them are the best of food fattened on the herrings and sprats in the sea outside madam hows free gift which does not cost man a farthing save the expense of nets and rods to catch them  how can that be  i will give you a bit of political economy  suppose a pound of salmon is worth a shilling and a pound of beef is worth a shilling likewise before we can eat the beef it has cost perhaps tenpence to make that pound of beef out of turnips and grass and oilcake and so the country is only twopence a pound richer for it  but mr salmon has made himself out of what he eats in the sea and so has cost nothing and the shilling a pound is all clear gain  thereyou dont quite understand that piece of political economy  indeed it is only in the last two or three years that older heads than yours have got to understand it and have passed the wise new salmon laws by which the rivers will be once more as rich with food as the land is just as they were hundreds of years ago  but now look again at the river  what do you think makes it so yellow and muddy  dirt of course  and where does that come from  off the mountains  yes  tons on tons of white mud are being carried down past us now and where will they go  into the sea  yes and sink there in the still water to make new strata at the bottom and perhaps in them ages hence some one will find the bones of those sheep and of poor mr pig too fossil  and the butter firkins too  what fun to find a fossil butter firkin  but now lift up your eyes to the jagged mountain crests and their dark sides all laced with silver streams  out of every crack and cranny there aloft the rain is bringing down dirt and stones too which have been split off by the winters frosts deepening every little hollow and sharpening every peak and making the hills more jagged and steep year by year  when the ice went away the hills were all scraped smooth and round by the glaciers like the flat rock upon the lawn and ugly enough they must have looked most like great brown buns  but ever since then madam how has been scooping them out again by her waterchisel into deep glens mighty cliffs sharp peaks such as you see aloft and making the old hills beautiful once more  why even the alps in switzerland have been carved out by frost and rain out of some great flat  the very peak of the matterhorn of which you have so often seen a picture is but one single point left of some enormous bun of rock  all the rest has been carved away by rain and frost and some day the matterhorn itself will be carved away and its last stone topple into the glacier at its foot  see as we have been talking we have got into the woods  oh what beautiful woods just like our own  not quite  there are some things growing here which do not grow at home as you will soon see  and there are no rocks at home either as there are here  how strange to see trees growing out of rocks  how do their roots get into the stone  there is plenty of rich mould in the cracks for them to feed on     health to the oak of the mountains he trusts to the might of the    rockclefts    deeply he mines and in peace feeds on the wealth of the stone  how many sorts of trees there areoak and birch and nuts and mountain ash and holly and furze and heather  and if you went to some of the islands in the lake up in the glen you would find wild arbutusstrawberrytree as you call it  we will go and get some one day or other  how long and green the grass is even on the rocks and the ferns and the moss too  everything seems richer here than at home  of course it is  you are here in the land of perpetual spring where frost and snow seldom or never comes  oh look at the ferns under this rock  i must pick some  pick away  i will warrant you do not pick all the sorts  yes  i have got them all now  not so hasty child there is plenty of a beautiful fern growing among that moss which you have passed over  look here  what that little thing a fern  hold it up to the light and see  what a lovely little thing like a transparent seaweed hung on black wire  what is it  film fern hymenophyllum  but what are you staring at now with all your eyes  oh that rock covered with green stars and a cloud of little white and pink flowers growing out of them  aha my good little dog  i thought you would stand to that game when you found it  what is it though  you must answer that yourself  you have seen it a hundred times before  why it is london pride that grows in the garden at home  of course it is but the irish call it st patricks cabbage though it got here a long time before st patrick and st patrick must have been very short of gardenstuff if he ever ate it  but how did it get here from london  no no  how did it get to london from hence  for from this country it came  i suppose the english brought it home in queen besss or james the firsts time  but if it is wild here and will grow so well in england why do we not find it wild in england too  for the same reason that there are no toads or snakes in ireland  they had not got as far as ireland before ireland was parted off from england and st patricks cabbage and a good many other plants had not got as far as england  but why  why i dont know  but this i know that when madam how makes a new sort of plant or animal she starts it in one single place and leaves it to take care of itself and earn its own livingas she does you and me and every oneand spread from that place all round as far as it can go  so st patricks cabbage got into this southwest of ireland long long ago and was such a brave sturdy little plant that it clambered up to the top of the highest mountains and over all the rocks  but when it got to the rich lowlands to the eastward in county cork it found all the ground taken up already with other plants and as they had enough to do to live themselves they would not let st patricks cabbage settle among them and it had to be content with living here in the farwestand what was very sad had no means of sending word to its brothers and sisters in the pyrenees how it was getting on  what do you mean  are you making fun of me  not the least  i am only telling you a very strange story which is literally true  come and sit down on this bench  you cant catch that great butterfly he is too strong on the wing for you  but oh what a beautiful one  yes orange and black silver and green a glorious creature  but you may see him at home sometimes that plant close to you you cannot see at home  why it is only great spurge such as grows in the woods at home  no  it is irish spurge which grows here and sometimes in devonshire and then again in the west of europe down to the pyrenees  dont touch it  our wood spurge is poisonous enough but this is worse still if you get a drop of its milk on your lip or eye you will be in agonies for half a day  that is the evil plant with which the poachers kill the salmon  how do they do that  when the salmon are spawning up in the little brooks and the water is low they take that spurge and grind it between two stones under water and let the milk run down into the pool and at that all the poor salmon turn up dead  then comes the waterbailiff and catches the poachers then comes the policeman with his sword at his side and his truncheon under his arm and then comes a cheap journey to tralee gaol in which those foolish poachers sit and reconsider themselves and determine not to break the salmon lawsat least till next time  but why is it that this spurge and st patricks cabbage grow only here in the west  if they got here of themselves where did they come from all outside there is sea and they could not float over that  come i say and sit down on this bench and i will tell you a talethe story of the old atlantis the sunken land in the far west  old plato the greek told legends of it which you will read some day and now it seems as if those old legends had some truth in them after all  we are standing now on one of the last remaining scraps of the old atlantic land  look down the bay  do you see far away under the mountains little islands long and low  oh yes  some of these are old slate like the mountains others are limestone bits of the old coralreef to the west of ireland which became dry land  i know  you told me about it  then that land which is all eaten up by the waves now once joined ireland to cornwall and to spain and to the azores and i suspect to the cape of good hope and what is stranger to labrador on the coast of north america  oh  how can you know that  listen and i will give you your first lesson in what i call biogeology  what a long word  if you can find a shorter one i shall be very much obliged to you for i hate long words  but what it means istelling how the land has changed in shape by the plants and animals upon it  and if you ever read as you will mr wallaces new book on the indian archipelago you will see what wonderful discoveries men may make about such questions if they will but use their common sense  you know the common pink heatherling as we call it  of course  then that ling grows not only here and in the north and west of europe but in the azores too and what is more strange in labrador  now as ling can neither swim nor fly does not common sense tell you that all those countries were probably joined together in old times  well but it seems so strange  so it is my child and so is everything  but as the fool says in shakespeare     a long time ago the world began    with heigh ho the wind and the rain  and the wind and the rain have made strange work with the poor old world ever since  and that is about all that we who are not very much wiser than shakespeares fool can say about the matter  but againthe london pride grows here and so does another saxifrage very like it which we call saxifraga geum  now when i saw those two plants growing in the western pyrenees between france and spain and with them the beautiful blue butterwort which grows in these kerry bogswe will go and find somewhat could i say but that spain and ireland must have been joined once  i suppose it must be so  again  there is a little pink butterwort here in the bogs which grows too in dear old devonshire and cornwall and also in the southwest of scotland  now when i found that too in the bogs near biarritz close to the pyrenees and knew that it stretched away along the spanish coast and into portugal what could my common sense lead me to say but that scotland and ireland and cornwall and spain were all joined once those are only a few examples  i could give you a dozen more  for instance on an island away there to the west and only in one spot there grows a little sort of lily which is found i believe in brittany and on the spanish and portuguese heaths and even in northwest africa and that africa and spain were joined not so very long ago at the straits of gibraltar there is no doubt at all  but where did the mediterranean sea run out then  perhaps it did not run out at all but was a saltwater lake like the caspian or the dead sea  perhaps it ran out over what is now the sahara the great desert of sand for that was a seabottom not long ago  but then how was this land of atlantis joined to the cape of good hope  i cannot say how or when either  but this is plain the place in the world where the most beautiful heaths grow is the cape of good hope  you know i showed you cape heaths once at the nursery gardeners at home  oh yes pink and yellow and white so much larger than ours  then it seems i only say it seems as if there must have been some land once to the westward from which the different sorts of heath spread southeastward to the cape and northeastward into europe  and that they came northeastward into europe seems certain for there are no heaths in america or asia  but how northeastward  think  stand with your face to the south and think  if a thing comes from the southwestfrom there it must go to the northeasttowards there  must it not  oh yes i see  now thenthe farther you go southwest towards spain the more kinds of heath there are and the handsomer as if their original home from which they started was somewhere down there  more sorts  what sorts  how many sorts of heath have we at home  three of course ling and purple heath and bottle heath  and there are no more in all england or wales or scotland exceptnow listen  in the very farthest end of cornwall there are two more sorts the cornish heath and the orangebell and they say though i never saw it that the orangebell grows near bournemouth  well  that is south and west too  so it is but that makes five heaths  now in the south and west of ireland all these five heaths grow and two more the great irish heath with purple bells and the mediterranean heath which flowers in spring  oh i know them  they grow in the rhododendron beds at home  of course  now again  if you went down to spain you would find all those seven heaths and other sorts with them and those which are rare in england and ireland are common there  about biarritz on the spanish frontier all the moors are covered with cornish heath and the bogs with orangebell and lovely they are to see and growing among them is a tall heath six feet high which they call there bruyere or broomheath because they make brooms of it and out of its roots the briarroot pipes are made  there are other heaths about that country too whose names i do not know so that when you are there you fancy yourself in the very home of the heaths but you are not  they must have come from some land near where the azores are now or how could heaths have got past africa and the tropics to the cape of good hope  it seems very wonderful to be able to find out that there was a great land once in the ocean all by a few little heaths  not by them only child  there are many other plants and animals too which make one think that so it must have been  and now i will tell you something stranger still  there may have been a timesome people say that there mustwhen africa and south america were joined by land  africa and south america  was that before the heaths came here or after  i cannot tell but i think probably after  but this is certain that there must have been a time when figs and bamboos and palms and sarsaparillas and many other sorts of plants could get from africa to america or the other way and indeed almost round the world  about the south of france and italy you will see one beautiful sarsaparilla with hooked prickles zigzagging and twining about over rocks and ruins trunks and stems and when you do if you have understanding it will seem as strange to you as it did to me to remember that the home of the sarsaparillas is not in europe but in the forests of brazil and the river plate  oh i have heard about their growing there and staining the rivers brown and making them good medicine to drink but i never thought there were any in europe  there are only one or two and how they got there is a marvel indeed  but nowif there was not dry land between africa and south america how did the cats get into america  for they cannot swim  cats  people might have brought them over  jaguars and pumas which you read of in captain mayne reids books are cats and so are the ocelots or tiger cats  oh i saw them at the zoological gardens  but no one would bring them over i should think except to put them in the zoo  not unless they were very foolish  and much stronger and cleverer than the savages of south america  no those jaguars and pumus have been in america for ages and there are those who will tell youand i think they have some reason on their sidethat the jaguar with his round patches of spots was once very much the same as the african and indian leopard who can climb trees well  so when he got into the tropic forests of america he took to the trees and lived among the branches feeding on sloths and monkeys and never coming to the ground for weeks till he grew fatter and stronger and far more terrible than his forefathers  and they will tell you too that the puma was perhapsi only say perhapssomething like the lion who you know has no spots  but when he got into the forests he found very little food under the trees only a very few deer and so he was starved and dwindled down to the poor little sheepstealing rogue he is now of whom nobody is afraid  oh yes  i remember now a said he and his men killed six in one day but do you think it is all true about the pumas and jaguars  my child i dont say that it is true but only that it is likely to be true  in science we must be cautious and modest and ready to alter our minds whenever we learn fresh facts only keeping sure of one thing that the truth when we find it out will be far more wonderful than any notions of ours  see  as we have been talking we have got nearly home and luncheon must be ready        why are you opening your eyes at me like the dog when he wants to go out walking  because i want to go out  but i dont want to go out walking  i want to go in the yacht  in the yacht  it does not belong to me  oh that is only fun  i know everybody is going out in it to see such a beautiful island full of ferns and have a picnic on the rocks and i know you are going  then you know more than i do myself  but i heard them say you were going  then they know more than i do myself  but would you not like to go  i might like to go very much indeed but as i have been knocked about at sea a good deal and perhaps more than i intend to be again it is no novelty to me and there might be other things which i liked still better for instance spending the afternoon with you  then am i not to go  i think not  dont pull such a long face but be a man and make up your mind to it as the geese do to going barefoot  but why may i not go  because i am not madam how but your daddy  what can that have to do with it  if you asked madam how do you know what she would answer in a moment as civilly and kindly as could be  she would sayoh yes go by all means and please yourself my pretty little man  my world is the paradise which the irishman talked of in which a man might do what was right in the sight of his own eyes and what was wrong too as he liked it  then madam how would let me go in the yacht  of course she would or jump overboard when you were in it or put your finger in the fire and your head afterwards or eat irish spurge and die like the salmon or anything else you liked  nobody is so indulgent as madam how and she would be the dearest old lady in the world but for one ugly trick that she has  she never tells any one what is coming but leaves them to find it out for themselves  she lets them put their fingers in the fire and never tells them that they will get burnt  but that is very cruel and treacherous of her  my boy our business is not to call hard names but to take things as we find them as the highlandman said when he ate the braxy mutton  now shall i because i am your daddy tell you what madam how would not have told you  when you get on board the yacht you will think it all very pleasant for an hour as long as you are in the bay  but presently you will get a little bored and run about the deck and disturb people and want to sit here there and everywhere which i should not like  and when you get beyond that headland you will find the great rollers coming in from the atlantic and the cutter tossing and heaving as you never felt before under a burning sun  and then my merry little young gentleman will begin to feel a little sick and then very sick and more miserable than he ever felt in his life and wish a thousand times over that he was safe at home even doing sums in long division and he will give a great deal of trouble to various kind ladieswhich no one has a right to do if he can help it  of course i do not wish to be sick only it looks such beautiful weather  and so it is but dont fancy that last nights rain and wind can have passed without sending in such a swell as will frighten you when you see the cutter climbing up one side of a wave and running down the other madam how tells me that though she will not tell you yet  then why do they go out  because they are accustomed to it  they have come hither all round from cowes past the lands end and past cape clear and they are not afraid or sick either  but shall i tell you how you would end this eveningat least so i suspect  lying miserable in a stuffy cabin on a sofa and not quite sure whether you were dead or alive till you were bundled into a boat about twelve oclock at night when you ought to be safe asleep and come home cold and wet and stupid and ill and lie in bed all to morrow  but will they be wet and cold  i cannot be sure but from the look of the sky there to westward i think some of them will be  so do you make up your mind to stay with me  but if it is fine and smooth tomorrow perhaps we may row down the bay and see plenty of wonderful things  but why is it that madam how will not tell people beforehand what will happen to them as you have told me  now i will tell you a great secret which alas every one has not found out yet  madam how will teach you but only by experience  lady why will teach you but by something very differentby something which has been calledand i know no better names for itgrace and inspiration by putting into your heart feelings which no man not even your father and mother can put there by making you quick to love what is right and hate what is wrong simply because they are right and wrong though you dont know why they are right and wrong by making you teachable modest reverent ready to believe those who are older and wiser than you when they tell you what you could never find out for yourself and so you will be prudent that is provident foreseeing and know what will happen if you do soandso and therefore what is really best and wisest for you  but why will she be kind enough to do that for me  for the very same reason that i do it  for gods sake  because god is your father in heaven as i am your father on earth and he does not wish his little child to be left to the hard teaching of nature and law but to be helped on by many many unsought and undeserved favours such as are rightly called means of grace and above all by the gospel and good news that you are gods child and that god loves you and has helped and taught you and will help you and teach you in a thousand ways of which you are not aware if only you will be a wise child and listen to lady why when she cries from her palace of wisdom and the feast which she has prepared whoso is simple let him turn in hither and says to him who wants understandingcome eat of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled  counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have strength by me kings reign and princes decree justice  by me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth  i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me  riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and righteousness  yes i will try and listen to lady why but what will happen if i do not  that will happen to you my childbut god forbid it ever should happenwhich happens to wicked kings and rulers and all men even the greatest and cleverest if they do not choose to reign by lady whys laws and decree justice according to her eternal ideas of what is just but only do what seems pleasant and profitable to themselves  on them lady why turns round and saysfor she too can be awful ay dreadful when she needs  because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would have none of my reproof  and then come words so terrible that i will not speak them here in this happy place but what they mean is this  that these foolish people are handed overas you and i shall be if we do wrong wilfullyto madam how and her terrible schoolhouse which is called nature and the law to be treated just as the plants and animals are treated because they did not choose to behave like men and children of god  and there they learn whether they like or not what they might have learnt from lady why all along  they learn the great law that as men sow so they will reap as they make their bed so they will lie on it and madam how can teach that as no one else can in earth or heaven only unfortunately for her scholars she is apt to hit so hard with her rod which is called experience that they never get over it and therefore most of those who will only be taught by nature and law are killed poor creatures before they have learnt their lesson as many a savage tribe is destroyed ay and great and mighty nations toothe old roman empire among them  and the poor jews who were carried away captive to babylon  yes they would not listen to lady why and so they were taken in hand by madam how and were seventy years in her terrible schoolhouse learning a lesson which to do them justice they never forgot again  but now we will talk of something pleasanter  we will go back to lady why and listen to her voice  it sounds gentle and cheerful enough just now listen  what is she speaking to us now  hush open your eyes and ears once more for you are growing sleepy with my long sermon  watch the sleepy shining water and the sleepy green mountains  listen to the sleepy lapping of the ripple and the sleepy sighing of the woods and let lady why talk to you through them in songs without words because they are deeper than all words till you too fall asleep with your head upon my knee  but what does she say  she saysbe still  the fulness of joy is peace  there you are fast asleep and perhaps that is the best thing for you for sleep will so i am informed though i never saw it happen nor any one else put fresh gray matter into your brain or save the wear and tear of the old gray matter or something elsewhen they have settled what it is to do and if so you will wake up with a fresh fiddlestring to your little fiddle of a brain on which you are playing new tunes all day long  so much the better but when i believe that your brain is you pretty boy then i shall believe also that the fiddler is his fiddle     chapter xiihomeward bound   come i suppose you consider yourself quite a good sailor by now  oh yes  i have never been ill yet though it has been quite rough again and again  what you call rough little man  but as you are grown such a very good sailor and also as the sea is all but smooth i think we will have a sail in the yacht today and that a tolerably long one  oh how delightful but i thought we were going home and the things are all packed up  and why should we not go homewards in the yacht things and all  what all the way to england  no not so far as that but these kind people when they came into the harbour last night offered to take us up the coast to a town where we will sleep and start comfortably home tomorrow morning  so now you will have a chance of seeing something of the great sea outside and of seeing perhaps the whale himself  i hope we shall see the whale  the men say he has been outside the harbour every day this week after the fish  very good  now do you keep quiet and out of the way while we are getting ready to go on board and take a last look at this pretty place and all its dear kind people  and the dear kind dogs too and the cat and the kittens        now come along and bundle into the boat if you have done bidding every one goodbye and take care you dont slip down in the icegroovings as you did the other day  there we are off at last  oh look at them all on the rock watching us and waving their handkerchiefs and harper and paddy too and little jimsy and isy with their fat bare feet and their arms round the dogs necks  i am so sorry to leave them all  not sorry to go home  no butthey have been so kind and the dogs were so kind  i am sure they knew we were going and were sorry too  perhaps they were  they knew we were going away at all events  they know what bringing out boxes and luggage means well enough  sam knew i am sure but he did not care for us  he was only uneasy because he thought harper was going and he should lose his shooting and as soon as he saw harper was not getting into the boat he sat down and scratched himself quite happy  but do dogs think  of course they do only they do not think in words as we do  but how can they think without words  that is very difficult for you and me to imagine because we always think in words  they must think in pictures i suppose by remembering things which have happened to them  you and i do that in our dreams  i suspect that savages who have very few words to express their thoughts with think in pictures like their own dogs  but that is a long story  we must see about getting on board now and under way        well and what have you been doing  oh i looked all over the yacht at the ropes and curious things and then i looked at the mountains till i was tired and then i heard you and some gentleman talking about the land sinking and i listened  there was no harm in that  none at all  but what did you hear him say  that the land must be sinking here because there were peatbogs everywhere below highwater mark  is that true  quite true and that peat would never have been formed where the salt water could get at it as it does now every tide  but what was it he said about that cliff over there  he said that cliff on our right a hundred feet high was plainly once joined on to that low island on our left  what that long bank of stones with a house on it  that is no house  that is a square lump of mud the last remaining bit of earth which was once the moraine of a glacier  every year it crumbles into the sea more and more and in a few years it will be all gone and nothing left but the great round boulderstones which the ice brought down from the glaciers behind us  but how does he know that it was once joined to the cliff  because that cliff and the down behind it where the cows are fed is made up like the island of nothing but loose earth and stones and that is why it is bright and green beside the gray rocks and brown heather of the moors at its foot  he knows that it must be an old glacier moraine and he has reason to think that moraine once stretched right across the bay to the low island and perhaps on to the other shore and was eaten out by the sea as the land sank down  but how does he know that the land sank  of that he says he is quite certain and this is what he sayssuppose there was a glacier here where we are sailing now it would end in an ice cliff such as you have seen a picture of in captain cooks voyages of which you are so fond  you recollect the pictures of christmas sound and possession bay  oh yes and pictures of greenland and spitzbergen too with glaciers in the sea  then icebergs would break off from that cliff and carry all the dirt and stones out to sea perhaps hundreds of miles away instead of letting it drop here in a heap and what did fall in a heap here the sea would wash down at once and smooth it over the seabottom and never let it pile up in a huge bank like that  do you understand  i think i do  therefore he says that great moraine must have been built upon dry land in the open air and must have sunk since into the sea which is gnawing at it day and night and will some day eat it all up as it would eat up all the dry land in the world if madam how was not continually lifting up fresh land to make up for what the sea has carried off  oh look there some one has caught a fish and is hauling it up  what a strange creature  it is not a mackerel nor a gurnet nor a pollock  how do you know that  why it is running along the top of the water like a snake and they never do that  here it comes  it has got a long beak like a snipe  oh let me see  see if you like but dont get in the way  remember you are but a little boy  what is it a snake with a birds head  no a snake has no fins and look at its beak it is full of little teeth which no bird has  but a very curious fellow he is nevertheless and his name is garfish  some call him greenbone because his bones are green  but what kind of fish is he  he is like nothing i ever saw  i believe he is nearest to a pike though his backbone is different from a pike and from all other known fishes  but is he not very rare  oh no he comes to devonshire and cornwall with the mackerel as he has come here and in calm weather he will swim on the top of the water and play about and catch flies and stand bolt upright with his long nose in the air and when the fisherboys throw him a stick he will jump over it again and again and play with it in the most ridiculous way  and what will they do with him  cut him up for bait i suppose for he is not very good to eat  certainly he does smell very nasty  have you only just found out that  sometimes when i have caught one he has made the boat smell so that i was glad to throw him overboard and so he saved his life by his nastiness  but they will catch plenty of mackerel now for where he is they are and where they are perhaps the whale will be for we are now well outside the harbour and running across the open bay and lucky for you that there are no rollers coming in from the atlantic and spouting up those cliffs in columns of white foam        hoch  ah  who was that coughed just behind the ship  who indeed look round and see  there is nobody  there could not be in the sea  lookthere a quarter of a mile away  oh  what is that turning over in the water like a great black wheel and a great tooth on it andoh it is gone  never mind  it will soon show itself again  but what was it  the whale one of them at least for the men say there are two different ones about the bay  that black wheel was part of his back as he turned down and the tooth on it was his backfin  but the noise like a giants cough  rather like the blast of a locomotive just starting  that was his breath  what as loud as that  why not  he is a very big fellow and has big lungs  how big is he  i cannot say perhaps thirty or forty feet long  we shall be able to see better soon  he will come up again and very likely nearer us where those birds are  i dont want him to come any nearer  you really need not be afraid  he is quite harmless  but he might run against the yacht  he might and so might a hundred things happen which never do  but i never heard of one of these whales running against a vessel so i suppose he has sense enough to know that the yacht is no concern of his and to keep out of its way  but why does he make that tremendous noise only once and then go under water again  you must remember that he is not a fish  a fish takes the water in through his mouth continually and it runs over his gills and out behind through his gillcovers  so the gills suckup the air out of the water and send it into the fishs blood just as they do in the newtlarva  yes i know  but the whale breathes with lungs like you and me and when he goes under water he has to hold his breath as you and i have  what a long time he can hold it  yes  he is a wonderful diver  some whales they say will keep under for an hour  but while he is under mind the air in his lungs is getting foul and full of carbonic acid just as it would in your lungs if you held your breath  so he is forced to come up at last and then out of his blowers which are on the top of his head he blasts out all the foul breath and with it the water which has got into his mouth in a cloud of spray  then he sucks in fresh air as much as he wants and dives again as you saw him do just now  and what does he do under water  lookand you will see  look at those birds  we will sail up to them for mr whale will probably rise among them soon  oh what a screaming and what a fighting  how many sorts there are  what are those beautiful little ones like great white swallows with crested heads and forked tails who hover and then dip down and pick up something  ternsseaswallows  and there are gulls in hundreds you see large and small graybacked and blackbacked and over them all two or three great gannets swooping round and round  oh one has fallen into the sea  yes with a splash just like a cannon ball  and here he comes up again with a fish in his beak  if he had fallen on your head with that beak of his he would have split it open  i have heard of men catching gannets by tying a fish on a board and letting it float and when the gannet strikes at it he drives his bill into the board and cannot get it out  but is not that cruel  i think so  gannets are of no use for eating or anything else  what a noise  it is quite deafening  and what are those black birds about who croak like crows or parrots  look at them  some have broad bills with a white stripe on it and cry something like the moorhens at home  those are razorbills  and what are those who say marrock something like a parrot  the ones with thin bills they are guillemots murres as we call them in devon but in some places they call them marrocks from what they say  and each has a little baby bird swimming behind it  oh there the mother has cocked up her tail and dived and the little one is swimming about looking for her  how it cries  it is afraid of the yacht  and there she comes up again and cries marrock to call it  look at it swimming up to her and cuddling to her quite happy  quite happy  and do you not think that any one who took a gun and shot either that mother or that child would be both cowardly and cruel  but they might eat them  these seabirds are not good to eat  they taste too strong of fishoil they are of no use at all except that the gulls and terns feathers are put into girls hats  well they might find plenty of other things to put in their hats  so i think  yes it would be very cruel very cruel indeed to do what some do shoot at these poor things and leave them floating about wounded till they die  but i suppose if one gave them ones mind about such doings and threatened to put the new sea fowl act in force against them and fine them and show them up in the newspapers they would say they meant no harm and had never thought about its being cruel  then they ought to think  they ought and so ought you  half the cruelty in the world like half the misery comes simply from peoples not thinking and boys are often very cruel from mere thoughtlessness  so when you are tempted to rob birds nests or to set the dogs on a moorhen or pelt wrens in the hedge think and sayhow should i like that to be done to me  i know but what are all the birds doing  look at the water how it sparkles  it is alive with tiny fish fry brett as we call them in the west which the mackerel are driving up to the top  poor little things  how hard on them  the big fish at them from below and the birds at them from above  and what is that  thousands of fish leaping out of the water scrambling over each others backs  what a curious soft rushing roaring noise they make  aha  the eaters are going to be eaten in turn  those are the mackerel themselves and i suspect they see mr whale and are scrambling out of the way as fast as they can lest he should swallow them down a dozen at a time  look out sharp for him now  i hope he will not come very near  no  the fish are going from us and past us  if he comes up he will come up astern of us so look back  there he is  that  i thought it was a boat  yes  he does look very like a boat upside down  but that is only his head and shoulders  he will blow next  hoch  oh  what a jet of spray like the geysers  and the sun made a rainbow on the top of it  he is quite still now  yes he is taking a long breath or two  you need not hold my hand so tight  his head is from us and when he goes down he will go right away  oh he is turning head over heels  there is his back fin again  andah was that not a slap  how the water boiled and foamed and what a tail he had  and how the mackerel flew out of the water  yes  you are a lucky boy to have seen that  i have not seen one of those gentlemen show his flukes as they call them since i was a boy on the cornish coast  where is he gone  hunting mackerel away out at sea  but did you notice something odd about his tail as you call itthough it is really none  it looked as if it was set on flat and not upright like a fishs  but why is it not a tail  just because it is set on flat not upright and learned men will tell you that those two flukes are the rudimentsthat is either the beginning or more likely the last remainsof two hind feet  but that belongs to the second volume of madam hows book of kind and you have not yet learned any of the first volume you know except about a few butterflies  look here  here are more whales coming  dont be frightened  they are only little ones mackerelhunting like the big one  what pretty smooth things turning head over heels and saying hush hush  they dont really turn clean over and that hush is their way of breathing  are they the young ones of that great monster  no they are porpoises  that big one is i believe a bottlenose  but if you want to know about the kinds of whales you must ask dr flower at the royal college of surgeons and not me and he will tell you wonderful things about themhow some of them have mouths full of strong teeth like these porpoises and others like the great sperm whale in the south sea have huge teeth in their lower jaws and in the upper only holes into which those teeth fit others like the bottlenose only two teeth or so in the lower jaw and others like the narwhal two straight tusks in the upper jaw only one of which grows and is what you call a narwhals horn  oh yes  i know of a walkingstick made of one  and strangest of all how the rightwhales have a few little teeth when they are born which never come through the gums but instead they grow all along their gums an enormous curtain of clotted hair which serves as a net to keep in the tiny seaanimals on which they feed and let the water strain out  you mean whalebone  is whalebone hair  so it seems  and so is a rhinoceross horn  a rhinoceros used to be hairy all over in old times but now he carries all his hair on the end of his nose except a few bristles on his tail  and the rightwhale not to be done in oddity carries all his on his gums  but have no whales any hair  no real whales but the manati which is very nearly a whale has long bristly hair left  dont you remember ms letter about the one he saw at rio janeiro  this is all very funny but what is the use of knowing so much about things teeth and hair  what is the use of learning latin and greek and a dozen things more which you have to learn  you dont know yet but wiser people than you tell you that they will be of use some day  and i can tell you that if you would only study that garfish long enough and compare him with another fish something like him who has a long beak to his lower jaw and none to his upperand how he eats i cannot guessand both of them again with certain fishes like them which m agassiz has found lately not in the sea but in the river amazon and then think carefully enough over their bones and teeth and their history from the time they are hatchedwhy you would find out i believe a story about the river amazon itself more wonderful than all the fairy tales you ever read  now there is luncheon ready  come down below and dont tumble down the companionstairs and by the time you have eaten your dinner we shall be very near the shore        so  here is my little man on deck after a good nights rest  and he has not been the least sick i hear  not a bit but the cabin was so stuffy and hot i asked leave to come on deck  what a huge steamer  but i do not like it as well as the yacht it smells of oil and steam and  and pigs and bullocks too i am sorry to say  dont go forward above them but stay here with me and look round  where are we now  what are those high hills far away to the left above the lowlands and woods  those are the shore of the old worldthe welsh mountains  and in front of us i can see nothing but flat land  where is that  that is the mouth of the severn and avon where we shall be in half an hour more  and there on the right over the low hills i can see higher ones blue and hazy  those are an island of the old world called now the mendip hills and we are steaming along the great strait between the mendips and the welsh mountains which once was coral reef and is now the severn sea and by the time you have eaten your breakfast we shall steam in through a crack in that coralreef and you will see what you missed seeing when you went to ireland because you went on board at night        oh  where have we got to now  where is the wide severn sea  two or three miles beyond us and here we are in narrow little avon  narrow indeed  i wonder that the steamer does not run against those rocks  but how beautiful they are and how the trees hang down over the water and are all reflected in it  yes  the gorge of the avon is always lovely  i saw it first when i was a little boy like you and i have seen it many a time since in sunshine and in storm and thought it more lovely every time  look there is something curious  what  those great rusty rings fixed into the rock  yes  those may be as old for aught i know as queen elizabeths or jamess reign  but why were they put there  for ships to hold on by if they lost the tide  what do you mean  it is high tide now  that is why the water is almost up to the branches of the trees  but when the tide turns it will all rush out in a torrent which would sweep ships out to sea again if they had not steam as we have to help them up against the stream  so sailing ships in old times fastened themselves to those rings and rode against the stream till the tide turned and carried them up to bristol  but what is the tide  and why does it go up and down  and why does it alter with the moon as i heard you all saying so often in ireland  that is a long story which i must tell you something about some other time  now i want you to look at something else and that is the rocks themselves in which the rings are  they are very curious in my eyes and very valuable for they taught me a lesson in geology when i was quite a boy and i want them to teach it to you now  what is there curious in them  this  you will soon see for yourself even from the steamers deck that they are not the same rock as the high limestone hills above  they are made up of red sand and pebbles and they are a whole world younger indeed some say two worlds younger than the limestone hills above and lie upon the top of the limestone  now you may see what i meant when i said that the newer rocks though they lie on the top of the older were often lower down than they are  but how do you know that they lie on the limestone  look into that corner of the river as we turn round and you will see with your own eyes  there are the sandstones lying flat on the turned up edges of another rock  yes i see  the layers of it are almost upright  then that upright rock underneath is part of the great limestone hill above  so the hill must have been raised out of the sea ages ago and eaten back by the waves and then the sand and pebbles made a beach at its foot and hardened into stone and there it is  and when you get through the limestone hills to bristol you will see more of these same red sandstone rocks spread about at the foot of the limestonehills on the other side  but why is the sandstone two worlds newer than the limestone  because between that sandstone and that limestone come hundreds of feet of rock which carry in them all the coal in england  dont you remember that i told you that once before  oh yes  but i see no coal between them there  no  but there is plenty of coal between them over in wales and plenty too between them on the other side of bristol  what you are looking at there is just the lip of a great coalbox where the bottom and the lid join  the bottom is the mountain limestone and the lid is the new red sandstone or trias as they call it now but the coal you cannot see  it is stowed inside the box miles away from here  but now look at the cliffs and the downs which they tell me are just like the downs in the holy land and the woods and villas high over your head  and what is that in the air  a bridge  yesthat is the famous suspension bridgeand a beautiful work of art it is  ay stare at it and wonder at it little man of course  but is it not wonderful  yes it was a clever trick to get those chains across the gulf high up in the air but not so clever a trick as to make a single stone of which those piers are built or a single flower or leaf in those woods  the more you see of madam hows masonry and carpentry the clumsier mans work will look to you  but now we must get ready to give up our tickets and go ashore and settle ourselves in the train and then we shall have plenty to see as we run home more curious to my mind than any suspension bridge  and you promised to show me all the different rocks and soils as we went home because it was so dark when we came from reading  very good        now we are settled in the train  and what do you want to know first  more about the new rocks being lower than the old ones though they lie on the top of them  well look here at this sketch  a boy piling up slates  what has that to do with it  i saw you in ireland piling slates against a rock just in this way  and i thought to myselfthat is something like madam hows work  how  why see  the old rock stands for the mountains of the old world like the welsh mountains or the mendip hills  the slates stand for the new rocks which have been piled up against these one over the other  but you see each slate is lower than the one before it and slopes more till the last slate which you are putting on is the lowest of all though it overlies all  i see now  i see now  then look at the sketch of the rocks between this and home  it is only a rough sketch of course but it will make you understand something more about the matter  now  you see the lump marked a  with twisted lines in it  that stands for the mendip hills to the west which are made of old red sandstone very much the same rock to speak roughly as the kerry mountains  and why are the lines in it twisted  to show that the strata the layers in it are twisted and set up at quite different angles from the limestone  but how was that done  by old earthquakes and changes which happened in old worlds ages on ages since  then the edges of the old red sandstone were eaten away by the seaand some think by ice too in some earlier age of ice and then the limestone coral reef was laid down on them unconformably as geologists sayjust as you saw the new red sandstone laid down on the edges of the limestone and so one world is built up on the edge of another world out of its scraps and ruins  then do you see b  with a notch in it  that means these limestone hills on the shoulder of the mendips and that notch is the gorge of the avon which we have steamed through  and what is that black above it  that is the coal a few miles off marked c  and what is this d which comes next  that is what we are on now  new red sandstone lying unconformably on the coal  i showed it you in the bed of the river as we came along in the cab  we are here in a sort of amphitheatre or half a one with the limestone hills around us and the new red sandstone plastered on as it were round the bottom of it inside  but what is this high bit with e against it  those are the high hills round bath which we shall run through soon they are newer than the soil here and they are for an exception higher too for they are so much harder than the soil here that the sea has not eaten them away as it has all the lowlands from bristol right into the somersetshire flats        there  we are off at last and going to run home to reading through one of the loveliest lines as i think of old england  and between the intervals of eating fruit we will geologize on the way home with this little bit of paper to show us where we are  what pretty rocks  yes  they are a boss of the coal measures i believe shoved up with the lias the lias lying round them  but i warn you i may not be quite right because i never looked at a geological map of this part of the line and have learnt what i know just as i want you to learn simply by looking out of the carriage window  look  here is lias rock in the side of the cutting layers of hard blue limestone and then layers of blue mud between them in which if you could stop to look you would find fossils in plenty and along that lias we shall run to bath and then all the rocks will change        now here we are at bath and here are the handsome fruitwomen waiting for you to buy  and oh what strawberries and cherries  yes  all this valley is very rich and very sheltered too and very warm for the soft southwestern air sweeps up it from the bristol channel so the slopes are covered with fruitorchards as you will see as you get out of the station  why we are above the tops of the houses  yes  we have been rising ever since we left bristol and you will soon see why  now we have laid in as much fruit as is safe for you and away we go  oh what high hills over the town  and what beautiful stone houses  even the cottages are built of stone  all that stone comes out of those high hills into which we are going now  it is called bathstone freestone or oolite and it lies on the top of the lias which we have just left  here it is marked f  what steep hills and cliffs too and with quarries in them  what can have made them so steep  and what can have made this little narrow valley  madam hows rainspade from above i suppose and perhaps the sea gnawing at their feet below  those freestone hills once stretched high over our heads and far away i suppose to the westward  now they are all gnawed out into cliffsindeed gnawed clean through in the bottom of the valley where the famous hot springs break out in which people bathe  is that why the place is called bath  of course  but the old romans called the place aquae solisthe waters of the sun and curious old roman remains are found here which we have not time to stop and see  now look out at the pretty clear limestone stream running to meet us below and the great limestone hills closing over us above  how do you think we shall get out from among them  shall we go over their tops  no  that would be too steep a climb for even such a great engine as this  then there is a crack which we can get through  look and see  why we are coming to a regular wall of hill and  and going right through it in the dark  we are in the box tunnel        there is the light again and now i suppose you will find your tongue  how long it seemed before we came out  yes because you were waiting and watching with nothing to look at but the tunnel is only a mile and a quarter long after all i believe  if you had been looking at fields and hedgerows all the while you would have thought no time at all had passed  what curious sandy rocks on each side of the cutting in lines and layers  those are the freestone still and full of fossils they are  but do you see that they dip away from us  remember that  all the rocks are sloping eastward the way we are going and each new rock or soil we come to lies on the top of the one before it  now we shall run down hill for many a mile down the back of the oolites past pretty chippenham and woottonbassett towards swindon spire  look at the country child and thank god for this fair english land in which your lot is cast  what beautiful green fields and such huge elm trees and orchards and flowers in the cottage gardens  ay and what crops too what wheat and beans turnips and mangold  all this land is very rich and easily worked and hereabouts is some of the best farming in england  the agricultural college at cirencester of which you have so often heard lies thereaway a few miles to our left and there lads go to learn to farm as no men in the world save english and scotch know how to farm  but what rock are we on now  on rock that is much softer than that on the other side of the oolite hills much softer because it is much newer  we have got off the oolites on to what is called the oxford clay and then i believe on to the coral rag and on that again lies what we are coming to now  do you see the red sand in that field  then that is the lowest layer of a fresh world so to speak a world still younger than the oolitesthe chalk world  but that is not chalk or anything like it  no that is what is called greensand  but it is not green it is red  i know but years ago it got the name from one green vein in it in which the coprolites as you learnt to call them at cambridge are found and that and a little layer of blue clay called gault between the upper greensand and lower greensand runs along everywhere at the foot of the chalk hills  i see the hills now  are they chalk  yes chalk they are so we may begin to feel near home now  see how they range away to the south toward devizes and westbury and warminster a goodly land and large  at their feet everywhere run the rich pastures on which the wiltshire cheese is made and here and there as at westbury there is good ironore in the greensand which is being smelted now as it used to be in the weald of surrey and kent ages since  i must tell you about that some other time  but are there coprolites here  i believe there are i know there are some at swindon and i do not see why they should not be found here and there all the way along the foot of the downs from here to cambridge  but do these downs go to cambridge  of course they do  we are now in the great valley which runs right across england from southwest to northeast from axminster in devonshire to hunstanton in norfolk with the chalk always on your right hand and the oolite hills on your left till it ends by sinking into the sea among the fens of lincolnshire and norfolk  but what made that great valley  i am not learned enough to tell  only this i think we can saythat once on a time these chalk downs on our right reached high over our heads here and far to the north and that madam how pared them away whether by icebergs or by seawaves or merely by rain i cannot tell  well those downs do look very like seacliffs  so they do very like an old shoreline  be that as it may after the chalk was eaten away madam how began digging into the soils below the chalk on which we are now and because they were mostly soft clays she cut them out very easily till she came down or nearly down to the harder freestone rocks which run along on our left hand miles away and so she scooped out this great vale which we call here the vale of white horse and further on the vale of aylesbury and then the bedford level and then the dear ugly old fens  is this the vale of white horse  oh i know about it i have read the scouring of the white horse  of course you have and when you are older you will read a jollier book stilltom browns school daysand when we have passed swindon we shall see some of the very places described in it close on our right        there is the white horse hill  the white horse hill  but where is the horse  i can see a bit of him but he does not look like a horse from here or indeed from any other place he is a very old horse indeed and a thousand years of wind and rain have spoilt his anatomy a good deal on the top of that wild down  and is that really where alfred fought the danes  as certainly boy i believe as that waterloo is where the duke fought napoleon  yes you may well stare at it with all your eyes the noble down  it is one of the most sacred spots on english soil  ah it is gone now  the train runs so fast  so it does too fast to let you look long at one thing but in return it lets you see so many more things in a given time than the slow old coaches and posters didwell what is it  i wanted to ask you a question but you wont listen to me  wont i  i suppose i was dreaming with my eyes open  you see i have been so often along this lineand through this country too long before the line was madethat i cannot pass it without its seeming full of memoriesperhaps of ghosts  of real ghosts  as real ghosts i suspect as any one on earth ever saw faces and scenes which have printed themselves so deeply on ones brain that when one passes the same place long years after they start up again out of fields and roadsides as if they were alive once more and need sound sense to send them back again into their place as things which are past for ever for good and ill  but what did you want to know  why i am so tired of looking out of the window  it is all the same fields and hedges hedges and fields and i want to talk  fields and hedges hedges and fields  peace and plenty plenty and peace  however it may seem dull now that the grass is cut but you would not have said so two months ago when the fields were all golden green with buttercups and the whitethorn hedges like crested waves of snow  i should like to take a foreigner down the vale of berkshire in the end of may and ask him what he thought of old england  but what shall we talk about  i want to know about coprolites if they dig them here as they do at cambridge  i dont think they do  but i suspect they will some day  but why do people dig them  because they are rational men and want manure for their fields  but what are coprolites  well they were called coprolites at first because some folk fancied they were the leavings of fossil animals such as you may really find in the lias at lynn in dorsetshire  but they are not that and all we can say is that a long time ago before the chalk began to be made there was a shallow sea in england the shore of which was so covered with dead animals that the boneearth the phosphate of lime out of them crusted itself round every bone and shell and dead seabeast on the shore and got covered up with fresh sand and buried for ages as a mine of wealth  but how many millions of dead creatures there must have been  what killed them  we do not know  no more do we know how it comes to pass that this thin band often only a few inches thick of dead creatures should stretch all the way from dorsetshire to norfolk and i believe up through lincolnshire  and what is stranger still this same boneearth bed crops out on the south side of the chalk at farnham and stretches along the foot of those downs right into kent making the richest hop lands in england through surrey and away to tunbridge  so that it seems as if the bed lay under the chalk everywhere if once we could get down to it  but how does it make the hop lands so rich  because hops like tobacco and vines take more phosphorus out of the soil than any other plants which we grow in england and it is the washings of this boneearth bed which make the lower lands in farnham so unusually rich that in some of themthe garden for instance under the bishops castlehave grown hops without resting i believe for three hundred years  but who found out all this about the coprolites  ahi will tell you and show you how scientific men whom ignorant people sometimes laugh at as dreamers and mere pickers up of useless weeds and old stones may do real service to their country and their countrymen as i hope you will some day  there was a clergyman named henslow now with god honoured by all scientific men a kind friend and teacher of mine loved by every little child in his parish  his calling was botany but he knew something of geology  and some of these coprolites were brought him as curiosities because they had fossils in them  but he so the tale goes had the wit to see that they were not like other fossils carbonate of lime but phosphate of limebone earth  whereon he told the neighbouring farmers that they had a mine of wealth opened to them if they would but use them for manure  and after a while he was listened to  then others began to find them in the eastern counties and then another man as learned and wise as he was good and noblejohn paine of farnham also now with godfound them on his own estate and made much use and much money of them and now tens of thousands of pounds worth of valuable manure are made out of them every year in cambridgeshire and bedfordshire by digging them out of land which was till lately only used for common farmers crops  but how do they turn coprolites into manure  i used to see them in the railway trucks at cambridge and they were all like what i have at homehard pebbles  they grind them first in a mill  then they mix them with sulphuric acid and water and that melts them down and parts them into two things  one is sulphate of lime gypsum as it is commonly called and which will not dissolve in water and is of little use  but the other is what is called superphosphate of lime which will dissolve in water so that the roots of the plants can suck it up and that is one of the richest of manures  oh i know you put superphosphate on the grass last year  yes  but not that kind a better one still  the superphosphate from the copiolites is good but the superphosphate from fresh bones is better still and therefore dearer because it has in it the fibrine of the bones which is full of nitrogen like gristle or meat and all that has been washed out of the boneearth bed ages and ages ago  but you must learn some chemistry to understand that  i should like to be a scientific man if one can find out such really useful things by science  child there is no saying what you might find out or of what use you may be to your fellowmen  a man working at science however dull and dirty his work may seem at times is like one of those chiffoniers as they call them in parispeople who spend their lives in gathering rags and sifting refuse but who may put their hands at any moment upon some precious jewel  and not only may you be able to help your neighbours to find out what will give them health and wealth but you may if you can only get them to listen to you save them from many a foolish experiment which ends in losing money just for want of science  i have heard of a man who for want of science was going to throw away great sums i believe he luckily for him never could raise the money in boring for coal in our bagshot sands at home  the man thought that because there was coal under the heather moors in the north there must needs be coal here likewise when a geologist could have told him the contrary  there was another man at hennequins lodge near the wellington college who thought he would make the poor sands fertile by manuring them with whale oil of all things in the world  so he not only lost all the cost of his whale oil but made the land utterly barren as it is unto this day and all for want of science  and i knew a manufacturer too who went to bore an artesian well for water and hired a regular wellborer to do it  but meanwhile he was wise enough to ask a geologist of those parts how far he thought it was down to the water  the geologist made his calculations and said  you will go through so many feet of bagshot sand and so many feet of london clay and so many feet of the thanet beds between them and the chalk and then you will win water at about 412 feet but not i think till then  the wellsinker laughed at that and said he had no opinion of geologists and suchlike  he never found any clay in england but what he could get through in 150 feet  so he began to bore150 feet 200 300 and then he began to look rather silly at last at 405only seven feet short of what the geologist had foretoldup came the water in a regular spout  but lo and behold not expecting to have to bore so deep he had made his bore much too small and the sand out of the thanet beds blew up into the bore and closed it  the poor manufacturer spent hundreds of pounds more in trying to get the sand out but in vain and he had at last to make a fresh and much larger well by the side of the old one bewailing the day when he listened to the wellsinker and not to the geologist and so threw away more than a thousand pounds  and there is an answer to what you asked on board the yachtwhat use was there in learning little matters of natural history and science which seemed of no use at all  and now look out again  do you see any change in the country  what  why there to the left  there are high hills there now as well as to the right  what are they  chalk hills too  the chalk is on both sides of us now  these are the chilterns all away to ipsden and nettlebed and so on across oxfordshire and buckinghamshire and into hertfordshire and on again to royston and cambridge while below them lies the vale of aylesbury you can just see the beginning of it on their left  a pleasant land are those hills and wealthy full of noble houses buried in the deep beechwoods which once were a great forest stretching in a ring round the north of london full of deer and boar and of wild bulls too even as late as the twelfth century according to the old legend of thomas a beckets father and the fair saracen which you have often heard  i know  but how are you going to get through the chalk hills  is there a tunnel as there is at box and at micheldever  no  something much prettier than a tunnel and something which took a great many years longer in making  we shall soon meet with a very remarkable and famous old gentleman who is a great adept at digging and at landscape gardening likewise and he has dug out a path for himself through the chalk which we shall take the liberty of using also  and his name if you wish to know it is father thames  i see him  what a great river  yes  here he comes gleaming and winding down from oxford over the lowlands past wallingford but where he is going to it is not so easy to see  ah here is chalk in the cutting at last  and what a high bridge  and the river far under our feet  why we are crossing him again  yes he winds more sharply than a railroad can  but is not this prettier than a tunnel  oh what hangingwoods and churches and such great houses and pretty cottages and gardensall in this narrow crack of a valley  ay  old father thames is a good landscape gardener as i said  there is basildonand hurleyand pangbourne with its roaring lasher  father thames has had to work hard for many an age before he could cut this trench right through the chalk and drain the water out of the flat vale behind us  but i suspect the sea helped him somewhat or perhaps a great deal just where we are now  the sea  yes  the sea was onceand that not so very long agoright up here beyond reading  this is the uppermost end of the great thames valley which must have been an estuarya tide flat like the mouth of the severn with the sea eating along at the foot of all the hills  and if the land sunk only some fifty feetwhich is a very little indeed child in this huge everchanging worldthen the tide would come up to reading again and the greater part of london and the county of middlesex be drowned in salt water  how dreadful that would be  dreadful indeed  god grant that it may never happen  more terrible changes of land and water have happened and are happening still in the world but none i think could happen which would destroy so much civilisation and be such a loss to mankind as that the thames valley should become again what it was geologically speaking only the other day when these gravel banks over which we are running to reading were being washed out of the chalk cliffs up above at every tide and rolled on a beach as you have seen them rolling still at ramsgate  now here we are at reading  there is the carriage waiting and away we are off home and when we get home and have seen everybody and everything we will look over our section once more  but remember that when you ran through the chalk hills to reading you passed from the bottom of the chalk to the top of it on to the thames gravels which lie there on the chalk and on to the london clay which lies on the chalk also with the thames gravels always over it  so that you see the newest layers the london clay and the gravels are lower in height than the limestone cliffs at bristol and much lower than the old mountain ranges of devonshire and wales though in geological order they are far higher and there are whole worlds of strata rocks and clays one on the other between the thames gravels and the devonshire hills  but how about our moors  they are newer still you said than the london clay because they lie upon it and yet they are much higher than we are here at reading  very well said so they are two or three hundred feet higher  but our part of them was left behind standing up in banks while the valley of the thames was being cut out by the sea  once they spread all over where we stand now and away behind us beyond newbury in berkshire and away in front of us all over where london now stands  how can you tell that  because there are little capslittle patchesof them left on the tops of many hills to the north of london just remnants which the sea and the thames and the rain have not eaten down  probably they once stretched right out to sea sloping slowly under the waves where the mouth of the thames is now  you know the sandcliffs at bournemouth  of course  then those are of the same age as the bagshot sands and lie on the london clay and slope down off the new forest into the sea which eats them up as you know year by year and day by day  and here were once perhaps cliffs just like them where london bridge now stands        there we are rumbling away home at last over the dear old heathermoors  how far we have travelledin our fancy at leastsince we began to talk about all these things upon the foggy november day and first saw madam how digging at the sandbanks with her waterspade  how many countries we have talked of and what wonderful questions we have got answered which all grew out of the first question how were the heathermoors made  and yet we have not talked about a hundredth part of the things about which these very heathermoors ought to set us thinking but so it is child  those who wish honestly to learn the laws of madam how which we call nature by looking honestly at what she does which we call fact have only to begin by looking at the very smallest thing pins head or pebble at their feet and it may lead themwhither they cannot tell  to answer any one question you find you must answer another and to answer that you must answer a third and then a fourth and so on for ever and ever  for ever and ever  of course  if we thought and searched over the universeay i believe only over this one little planet called earthfor millions on millions of years we should not get to the end of our searching  the more we learnt the more we should find there was left to learn  all things we should find are constituted according to a divine and wonderful order which links each thing to every other thing so that we cannot fully comprehend any one thing without comprehending all things and who can do that save he who made all things  therefore our true wisdom is never to fancy that we do comprehend never to make systems and theories of the universe as they are called as if we had stood by and looked on when time and space began to be but to remember that those who say they understand show simply by so saying that they understand nothing at all that those who say they see are sure to be blind while those who confess that they are blind are sure some day to see  all we can do is to keep up the childlike heart humble and teachable though we grew as wise as newton or as humboldt and to follow as good socrates bids us reason whithersoever it leads us sure that it will never lead us wrong unless we have darkened it by hasty and conceited fancies of our own and so have become like those foolish men of old of whom it was said that the very light within them was darkness  but if we love and reverence and trust fact and nature which are the will not merely of madam how or even of lady why but of almighty god himself then we shall be really loving and reverencing and trusting god and we shall have our reward by discovering continually fresh wonders and fresh benefits to man and find it as true of science as it is of this life and of the life to comethat eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive what god has prepared for those who love him     footnotes   1  i could not resist the temptation of quoting this splendid generalisation from dr carpenters preliminary report of
