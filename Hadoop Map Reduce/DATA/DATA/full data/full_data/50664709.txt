       nathaniel hawthorne    on the evening of thanksgiving day john inglefield the blacksmith sat in his elbowchair among those who had been keeping festival at his board  being the central figure of the domestic circle the fire threw its strongest light on his massive and sturdy frame reddening his rough visage so that it looked like the head of an iron statue all aglow from his own forge and with its features rudely fashioned on his own anvil  at john inglefields right hand was an empty chair  the other places round the hearth were filled by the members of the family who all sat quietly while with a semblance of fantastic merriment their shadows danced on the wall behind then  one of the group was john inglefields son who had been bred at college and was now a student of theology at andover  there was also a daughter of sixteen whom nobody could look at without thinking of a rosebud almost blossomed  the only other person at the fireside was robert moore formerly an apprentice of the blacksmith but now his journeyman and who seemed more like an own son of john inglefield than did the pale and slender student  only these four had kept new englands festival beneath that roof  the vacant chair at john inglefields right hand was in memory of his wife whom death had snatched from him since the previous thanksgiving  with a feeling that few would have looked for in his rough nature the bereaved husband had himself set the chair in its place next his own and often did his eye glance thitherward as if he deemed it possible that the cold grave might send back its tenant to the cheerful fireside at least for that one evening  thus did he cherish the grief that was dear to him but there was another grief which he would fain have torn from his heart or since that could never be have buried it too deep for others to behold or for his own remembrance  within the past year another member of his household had gone from him but not to the grave  yet they kept no vacant chair for her  while john inglefield and his family were sitting round the hearth with the shadows dancing behind them on the wall the outer door was opened and a light footstep came along the passage  the latch of the inner door was lifted by some familiar hand and a young girl came in wearing a cloak and hood which she took off and laid on the table beneath the lookingglass  then after gazing a moment at the fireside circle she approached and took the seat at john inglefields right hand as if it had been reserved on purpose for her  here i am at last father said she  you ate your thanksgiving dinner without me but i have come back to spend the evening with you  yes it was prudence inglefield  she wore the same neat and maidenly attire which she had been accustomed to put on when the household work was over for the day and her hair was parted from her brow in the simple and modest fashion that became her best of all  if her cheek might otherwise have been pale yet the glow of the fire suffused it with a healthful bloom  if she had spent the many months of her absence in guilt and infamy yet they seemed to have left no traces on her gentle aspect  she could not have looked less altered had she merely stepped away from her fathers fireside for half an hour and returned while the blaze was quivering upwards from the same brands that were burning at her departure  and to john inglefield she was the very image of his buried wife such as he remembered her on the first thanksgiving which they had passed under their own roof  therefore though naturally a stern and rugged man he could not speak unkindly to his sinful child nor yet could he take her to his bosom  you are welcome home prudence said he glancing sideways at her and his voice faltered  your mother would have rejoiced to see you but she has been gone from us these four months  i know it father i know it replied prudence quickly  and yet when i first came in my eyes were so dazzled by the firelight that she seemed to be sitting in this very chair  by this time the other members of the family had begun to recover from their surprise and became sensible that it was no ghost from the grave nor vision of their vivid recollections but prudence her own self  her brother was the next that greeted her  he advanced and held out his hand affectionately as a brother should yet not entirely like a brother for with all his kindness he was still a clergyman and speaking to a child of sin  sister prudence said he earnestly i rejoice that a merciful providence hath turned your steps homeward in time for me to bid you a last farewell  in a few weeks sister i am to sail as a missionary to the far islands of the pacific  there is not one of these beloved faces that i shall ever hope to behold again on this earth  o may i see all of themyours and allbeyond the grave  a shadow flitted across the girls countenance  the grave is very dark brother answered she withdrawing her hand somewhat hastily from his grasp  you must look your last at me by the light of this fire  while this was passing the twingirlthe rosebud that had grown on the same stem with the castawaystood gazing at her sister longing to fling herself upon her bosom so that the tendrils of their hearts might intertwine again  at first she was restrained by mingled grief and shame and by a dread that prudence was too much changed to respond to her affection or that her own purity would be felt as a reproach by the lost one  but as she listened to the familiar voice while the face grew more and more familiar she forgot everything save that prudence had come back  springing forward she would have clasped her in a close embrace  at that very instant however prudence started from her chair and held out both her hands with a warning gesture  no maryno my sister cried she do not you touch me  your bosom must not be pressed to mine  mary shuddered and stood still for she felt that something darker than the grave was between prudence and herself though they seemed so near each other in the light of their fathers hearth where they had grown up together  meanwhile prudence threw her eyes around the room in search of one who had not yet bidden her welcome  he had withdrawn from his seat by the fireside and was standing near the door with his face averted so that his features could be discerned only by the flickering shadow of the profile upon the wall  but prudence called to him in a cheerful and kindly tone  come robert said she wont you shake hands with your old friend  robert moore held back for a moment but affection struggled powerfully and overcame his pride and resentment he rushed towards prudence seized her hand and pressed it to his bosom  there there robert said she smiling sadly as she withdrew her hand you must not give me too warm a welcome  and now having exchanged greetings with each member of the family prudence again seated herself in the chair at john inglefields right hand  she was naturally a girl of quick and tender sensibilities gladsome in her general mood but with a bewitching pathos interfused among her merriest words and deeds  it was remarked of her too that she had a faculty even from childhood of throwing her own feelings like a spell over her companions  such as she had been in her days of innocence so did she appear this evening  her friends in the surprise and bewilderment of her return almost forgot that she had ever left them or that she had forfeited any of her claims to their affection  in the morning perhaps they might have looked at her with altered eyes but by the thanksgiving fireside they felt only that their own prudence had come back to them and were thankful  john ingleflelds rough visage brightened with the glow of his heart as it grew warm and merry within him once or twice even he laughed till the room rang again yet seemed startled by the echo of his own mirth  the grave young minister became as frolicsome as a schoolboy  mary too the rosebud forgot that her twinblossom had ever been torn from the stem and trampled in the dust and as for robert moore he gazed at prudence with the bashful earnestness of love newborn while she with sweet maiden coquetry half smiled upon and half discouraged him  in short it was one of those intervals when sorrow vanishes in its own depth of shadow and joy starts forth in transitory brightness  when the clock struck eight prudence poured out her fathers customary draught of herbtea which had been steeping by the fireside ever since twilight  god bless you child said john inglefield as he took the cup from her hand you have made your old father happy again  but we miss your mother sadly prudence sadly  it seems as if she ought to be here now  now father or never replied prudence  it was now the hour for domestic worship  but while the family were making preparations for this duty they suddenly perceived that prudence had put on her cloak and hood and was lifting the latch of the door  prudence prudence where are you going cried they all with one voice  as prudence passed out of the door she turned towards them and flung back her hand with a gesture of farewell  but her face was so changed that they hardly recognized it  sin and evil passions glowed through its comeliness and wrought a horrible deformity a smile gleamed in her eyes as of triumphant mockery at their surprise and grief  daughter cried john inglefield between wrath and sorrow stay and be your fathers blessing or take his curse with you  for an instant prudence lingered and looked back into the firelighted room while her countenance wore almost the expression as if she were struggling with a fiend who had power to seize his victim even within the hallowed precincts of her fathers hearth  the fiend prevailed and prudence vanished into the outer darkness  when the family rushed to the door they could see nothing but heard the sound of wheels rattling over the frozen ground  that same night among the painted beauties at the theatre of a neighboring city there was one whose dissolute mirth seemed inconsistent with any sympathy for pure affections and for the joys and griefs which are hallowed by them  yet this was prudence inglefield  her visit to the thanksgiving fireside was the realization of one of those waking dreams in which the guilty soul will sometimes stray back to its innocence  but sin alas is careful of her bondslaves they hear her voice perhaps at the holiest moment and are constrained to go whither she summons them  the same dark power that drew prudence inglefleld from her fathers hearththe same in its nature though heightened then to a dread necessitywould snatch a guilty soul from the gate of heaven and make its sin and its punishment alike eternal
