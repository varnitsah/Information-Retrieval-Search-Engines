   in lowestoft a boat was laid       mark well what i do say     and she was built for the herring trade       but she has gone arovin arovin arovin       the lord knows where      they gave her government coal to burn     and a qf gun at bow and stern     and sent her out arovin etc      her skipper was mate of a bucko ship     which always killed one man per trip     so he is used to rovin etc      her mate was skipper of a chapel in wales     and so he fights in topper and tails     religious tho rovin etc      her engineer is fiftyeight     so hes prepared to meet his fate     which aint unlikely rovin etc      her leadingstokers seventeen     so he dont know what the judgments mean     unless he cops em rovin etc      her cook was chef in the lost dogs home       mark well what i do say     and im sorry for fritz when they all come       arovin arovin aroarin and arovin       round the north sea rovin       the lord knows where     the auxiliaries  i   the navy is very old and very wise much of her wisdom is on record and available for reference but more of it works in the unconscious blood of those who serve her she has a thousand years of experience and can find precedent or parallel for any situation that the force of the weather or the malice of the kings enemies may bring about  the main principles of seawarfare hold good throughout all ages and so far as the navy has been allowed to put out her strength these principles have been applied over all the seas of the world for matters of detail the navy to whom all days are alike has simply returned to the practice and resurrected the spirit of old days  in the late french wars a merchant sailing out of a channel port might in a few hours find himself laid by the heels and under way for a french prison his majestys ships of the line and even the big frigates took little part in policing the waters for him unless he were in convoy the sloops cutters gunbrigs and local craft of all kinds were supposed to look after that while the line was busy elsewhere so the merchants passed resolutions against the inadequate protection afforded to the trade and the narrow seas were full of singleship actions mailpackets west country brigs and fat east indiamen fighting for their own hulls and cargo anything that the watchful french ports sent against them the sloops and cutters bearing a hand if they happened to be within reach   the oldest navy  it was a brutal age ministered to by hardfisted men and we had put it a hundred decent years behind us whenit all comes back again today there are no prisons for the crews of merchantmen but they can go to the bottom by mine and torpedo even more quickly than their ancestors were run into le havre the submarine takes the place of the privateer the line as in the old wars is occupied bombarding and blockading elsewhere but the seaborne traffic must continue and that is being looked after by the lineal descendants of the crews of the long extinct cutters and sloops and gunbrigs the hour struck and they reappeared to the tune of fifty thousand odd men in more than two thousand ships of which i have seen a few hundred words of command may have changed a little the tools are certainly more complex but the spirit of the new crews who come to the old job is utterly unchanged it is the same fierce hardliving heavyhanded very cunning service out of which the navy as we know it today was born it is called indifferently the trawler and auxiliary fleet it is chiefly composed of fishermen but it takes in every one who may have maritime tastesfrom retired admirals to the sons of the seacook it exists for the benefit of the traffic and the annoyance of the enemy its doings are recorded by flags stuck into charts its casualties are buried in obscure corners of the newspapers the grand fleet knows it slightly the restless light cruisers who chaperon it from the background are more intimate the destroyers working off unlighted coasts over unmarked shoals come as you might say in direct contact with it the submarine alternately praises andsince one periscope is very like anothercurses its activities but the steady procession of traffic in home waters liner and tramp six every sixty minutes blesses it altogether  since this most christian war includes laying mines in the fairways of traffic and since these mines may be laid at any time by german submarines especially built for the work or by neutral ships all fairways must be swept continuously day and night when a nest of mines is reported traffic must be hung up or deviated till it is cleared out when traffic comes up channel it must be examined for contraband and other things and the examining tugs lie out in a blaze of lights to remind ships of this months ago when the war was young the tugs did not know what to look for specially now they do all this minesearching and reporting and sweeping plus the direction and examination of the traffic plus the laying of our own evershifting minefields is part of the trawler fleets work because the navyasweknewit is busy elsewhere and there is always the enemy submarine with a price on her head whom the trawler fleet hunts and traps with zeal and joy add to this that there are boats fishing for real fish to be protected in their work at sea or chased off dangerous areas whither because they are strictly forbidden to go they naturally repair and you will begin to get some idea of what the trawler and auxiliary fleet does   the ships and the men  now imagine the acreage of several dockbasins crammed gunwale to gunwale with brown and umber and ochre and rustred steamtrawlers tugs harbourboats and yachts once clean and respectable now dirty and happy throw in fishsteamers surprisepackets of unknown lines and indescribable junks sampans lorchas catamarans and general service stinkpontoons filled with indescribable apparatus manned by men no dozen of whom seem to talk the same dialect or wear the same clothes the mustardcoloured jersey who is cleaning a sixpounder on a hull boat clips his words between his teeth and would be happier in gaelic the whitish singlet and grey trousers held up by what is obviously his soldier brothers spare regimental belt is pure lowestoft the complete bluesergeandsoot suit passing a wire down a hatch is glasgow as far as you can hear him which is a fair distance because he wants something done to the other end of the wire and the flatfaced boy who should be attending to it hails from the remoter hebrides and is looking at a girl on the dockedge the bowlegged man in the ulster and greenworsted comforter is a warm grimsby skipper worth several thousands he and his crew who are mostly his own relations keep themselves to themselves and save their money the pirate with the red beard barking over the rail at a friend with gold earrings comes from skye the friend is west country the noticeably insignificant man with the soft and deprecating eye is skipper and partowner of the big slashing iceland trawler on which he droops like a flower she is built to almost western ocean lines carries a little boatdeck aft with tremendous stanchions has a nose cocked high against ice and sweeping seas and resembles a hawkmoth at rest the small sniffing man is reported to be a holy terror at sea   hunters and fishers  the child in the pullmancar uniform just going ashore is a wireless operator aged nineteen he is attached to a flagship at least 120 feet long under an admiral aged twentyfive who was till the other day third mate of a north atlantic tramp but who now leads a squadron of six trawlers to hunt submarines the principle is simple enough its application depends on circumstances and surroundings one class of german submarines meant for murder off the coasts may use a winding and rabbitlike track between shoals where the choice of water is limited their career is rarely long but while it lasts moderately exciting others told off for deepsea assassinations are attended to quite quietly and without any excitement at all others again work the inside of the north sea making no distinction between neutrals and allied ships these carry guns and since their work keeps them a good deal on the surface the trawler fleet as we know engages them therethe submarine firing sinking and rising again in unexpected quarters the trawler firing dodging and trying to ram the trawlers are strongly built and can stand a great deal of punishment yet again other german submarines hang about the skirts of fishingfleets and fire into the brown of them when the war was young this gave splendidly frightful results but for some reason or other the game is not as popular as it used to be  lastly there are german submarines who perish by ways so curious and inexplicable that one could almost credit the whispered idea it must come from the scotch skippers that the ghosts of the women they drowned pilot them to destruction but what form these shadows takewhether of the lusitania ladies or humbler stewardesses and hospital nursesand what lights or sounds the thing fancies it sees or hears before it is blotted out no man will ever know the main fact is that the work is being done whether it was necessary or politic to reawaken by violence every sporting instinct of a seagoing people is a question which the enemy may have to consider later on      dawn off the forelandthe young flood making       jumbled and short and steep     black in the hollows and bright where its breaking       awkward water to sweep       mines reported in

fairplay but with the torpedo it is otherwise a yarmouth man lay on his hatch his gear neatly stowed away below and told me that another yarmouth boat had gone up with all hands except one twas a submarine not a mine said he they never gave our boys no chance na she was a yarmouth boatwe knew em all they never gave the boys no chance he was a submarine hunter and he illustrated by means of matches placed at various angles how the blindfold business is conducted and then he ended theres always what hell do youve got to think that out for yourselfwhile youre working above himsame as if twas fish i should not care to be hunted for the life in shallow waters by a man who knows every bank and pothole of them even if i had not killed his friends the week before being nearly all fishermen they discuss their work in terms of fish and put in their leisure fishing overside when they sometimes pull up ghastly souvenirs but they all want guns those who have threepounders clamour for sixes sixes for twelves and the twelvepound aristocracy dream of fourinchers on antiaircraft mountings for the benefit of roving zeppelins they will all get them in time and i fancy it will be long ere they give them up one west country mate announced that a gun is a handy thing to have aboardalways but in peacetime i said wouldnt it be in the way  wem used to em now was the smiling answer niver go to sea again without a guni wouldntif i had my way it keeps all hands pleasedlike  they talk about men in the army who will never willingly go back to civil life what of the fishermen who have tasted something sharper than salt waterand what of the young third and fourth mates who have held independent commands for nine months past one of them said to me quite irrelevantly i used to be the animal that got up the trunks for the women on baggagedays in the old bodiam castle and he mimicked their requests for the large brown box or the black dress basket as a freed soul might scoff at his old life in the flesh   a common sweeper  my sponsor and chaperon in this elizabethan world of eighteenthcentury seamen was an ab who had gone down in the landrail assisted at the heligoland fight seen the blücher sink and the bombs dropped on our boats when we tried to save the drowning whereby as he said those germans died gottstrafin their own country because we didnt wait to be strafed and has now found more peaceful days in an office ashore he led me across many decks from craft to craft to study the various appliances that they specialise in almost our last was what a north country trawler called a common sweeper that is to say a minesweeper she was at tea in her shirtsleeves and she protested loudly that there was nothing in sweeping see that wire rope she said well it leads through that lead to the ship which youre sweepin with she makes her end fast and you make yourn then you sweep together at whichever depth youve agreed upon between you by means of that arrangement there which regulates the depth they give you a glass sort o thing for keepin your distance from the other ship but thats not wanted if you know each other well then you sweep as the sayin is theres nothin in it you sweep till this wire rope fouls the bloomin mines then you go on till they appear on the surface so to say and then you explodes them by means of shootin at em with that rifle in the galley there theres nothin in sweepin more than that  and if you hit a mine i asked  you go upbut you hadnt ought to hit em if youre careful the thing is to get hold of the first mine all right and then you go on to the next and so on in a way o speakin  and you can fish too tween times said a voice from the next boat a man leaned over and returned a borrowed mug they talked about fishingnotably that once they caught some red mullet which the common sweeper and his neighbour both agreed was not natural in those waters as for mere sweeping it bored them profoundly to talk about it i only learned later as part of the natural history of mines that if you rake the trinitrotoluol by hand out of a german mine you develop eruptions and skinpoisoning but on the authority of two experts there is nothing in sweeping nothing whatever   a block in the traffic  now imagine not a pistolshot from these crowded quays a little office hung round with charts that are pencilled and noted over various shoals and soundings there is a movable list of the boats at work with quaint and domestic names outside the window lies the packed harbouroutside that again the line of traffic up and downa stately cinemashow of six ships to the hour for the moment the film sticks a boatprobably a common sweeperreports an obstruction in a traffic lane a few miles away she has found and exploded one mine the office heard the dull boom of it before the wireless report came in in all likelihood there is a nest of them there it is possible that a submarine may have got in last night between certain shoals and laid them out the shoals are being shepherded in case she is hidden anywhere but the boundaries of the newly discovered minearea must be fixed and the traffic deviated there is a tramp outside with tugs in attendance she has hit something and is leaking badly where shall she go the office gives her her destinationthe harbour is too full for her to settle down here she swings off between the faithful tugs down coast some one asks by wireless if they shall hold up their traffic it is exactly like a signaller offering a train to the next block yes the office replies wait a while if its what we think there will be a little delay if it isnt what we think there will be a little longer delay meantime sweepers are nosing round the suspected arealooking for cuckoos eggs as a voice suggests and a patrolboat lathers her way down coast to catch and stop anything that may be on the move for skippers are sometimes rather careless words begin to drop out of the air into the charthung office six and a half cables south fifteen east of something or other mark it well and tell them to work up from there is the order another mine exploded yes and we heard that too says the office what about the submarine elizabeth huggins reports  elizabeths scandal must be fairly high flavoured for a torpedoboat of immoral aspect slings herself out of harbour and hastens to share it if elizabeth has not spoken the truth there may be words between the parties for the present a pencilled suggestion seems to cover the case together with a demand as far as one can make out for more common sweepers they will be forthcoming very shortly those at work have got the run of the mines now and are busily howking them up a trawlerskipper wishes to speak to the office they have ordered him out but his boiler most of it is on the quay at the present time and yell remember its the same wi my foremast an port rigging sir the office does not precisely remember but if boiler and foremast are on the quay the rest of the ship had better stay alongside the skipper falls away relieved he scraped a tramp a few nights ago in a bit of a sea there is a little mutter of gunfire somewhere across the grey water where a fleet is at work a monitor as broad as she is long comes back from wherever the trouble is slips through the harbour mouth all wreathed with signals is received by two motherly lighters and to all appearance goes to sleep between them the office does not even look up for that is not in their department they have found a trawler to replace the boilerless one her name is slid into the rack the immoral torpedoboat flounces back to her moorings evidently what elizabeth huggins said was not evidence the messages and replies begin again as the day closes   the night patrol  return now to the inner harbour at twilight there was a stir among the packed craft like the separation of dried tealeaves in water the swingbridge across the basin shut against us a boat shot out of the jam took the narrow exit at a fair seven knots and rounded in the outer harbour with all the pomp of a flagship which was exactly what she was others followed breaking away from every quarter in silence boat after boat fell into linegear stowed away spars and buoys in order on their clean decks guns cast loose and ready wheelhouse windows darkened and everything in order for a day or a week or a month out there was no word anywhere the interrupted foottraffic stared at them as they slid past below a woman beside me waved her hand to a man on one of them and i saw his face light as he waved back the boat where they had demonstrated for me with matches was the last her skipper hadnt thought it worth while to tell me that he was going that evening then the line straightened up and stood out to sea  you never said this was going to happen i said reproachfully to my ab  no more i did said he its the nightpatrol going out fact is im so used to the bloomin evolution that it never struck me to mention it as you might say  next morning i was at service in a manofwar and even as we came to the prayer that the navy might be a safeguard to such as pass upon the sea on their lawful occasions i saw the long procession of traffic resuming up and down the channelsix ships to the hour it has been hung up for a bit they said      farewell and adieu to you greenwich ladies     farewell and adieu to you ladies ashore     for weve received orders to work to the eastward     where we hope in a short time to strafe em some more      well duck and well dive like little tin turtles     well duck and well dive underneath the north seas     until we strike something that doesnt expect us     from here to cuxhaven its go as you please      the first thing we did was to dock in a minefield     which isnt a place where repairs should be done     and there we lay doggo in twelvefathom water     with trinitrotoluol hogging our run      the next thing we did we rose under a zeppelin     with his shiny big belly half blocking the sky     but what in theheavens can you do with sixpounders     so we fired what we had and we bade him goodbye     submarines  i   the chief business of the trawler fleet is to attend to the traffic the submarine in her sphere attends to the enemy like the destroyer the submarine has created its own type of officer and manwith language and traditions apart from the rest of the service and yet at heart unchangingly of the service their business is to run monstrous risks from earth air and water in what to be of any use must be the coldest of cold blood  the commanders is more a oneman job as the crews is more teamwork than any other employment afloat that is why the relations between submarine officers and men are what they are they play hourly for each others lives with death the umpire always at their elbow on tiptoe to give them out  there is a stretch of water once dear to amateur yachtsmen now given over to scouts submarines destroyers and of course contingents of trawlers we were waiting the return of some boats which were due to report a couple surged up the still harbour in the afternoon light and tied up beside their sisters there climbed out of them three or four highbooted sunkeneyed pirates clad in sweaters under jackets that a stoker of the last generation would have disowned this was their first chance to compare notes at close hand together they lamented the loss of a zeppelina perfect mug of a zepp who had come down very low and offered one of them a sitting shot but what can you do with our guns i gave him what i had and then he started bombing  i know he did another said i heard him thats what brought me down to you i thought he had you that last time  no i was forty foot under when he hove out the big un what happened to you  my steeringgear jammed just after i went down and i had to go round in circles till i got it straightened out but wasnt he a mug  was he the brute with the patch on his port side a sisterboat demanded  no this fellow had just been hatched he was almost sitting on the water heaving bombs over  and my blasted steeringgear went and chose then to go wrong the other commander mourned i thought his last little egg was going to get me  half an hour later i was formally introduced to three or four quite strange quite immaculate officers freshly shaved and a little tired about the eyes whom i thought i had met before   labour and refreshment  meantime it was on the hour of evening drinks one of the boats was still unaccounted for no one talked of her they rather discussed motorcars and admiralty constructors butit felt like that queer twilight watch at the front when the homing aeroplanes drop in presently a signaller entered v 42 outside sir wants to know which channel she shall use oh thank you tell her to take soandso  mine remember was vermouth and bitters and later on v 42 himself found a soft chair and joined the committee of instruction those next for duty as well as those in training wished to hear what was going on and who had shifted what to where and how certain arrangements had worked they were told in language not to be found in any printable book questions and answers were alike hebrew to one listener but he gathered that every boat carried a second in commanda strong persevering youth who seemed responsible for everything that went wrong from a motor cylinder to a torpedo then somebody touched on the mercantile marine and its habits  said one philosopher they cant be expected to take any more risks than they do i wouldnt if i was a skipper id loose off at any blessed periscope i saw  thats all very fine you wait till youve had a patriotic tramp trying to strafe you at your own backdoor said another  some one told a tale of a man with a voice notable even in a service where men are not trained to whisper he was coming back emptyhanded dirty tired and best left alone from the peace of the german side he had entered our hectic homewaters where the usual tramp shelled and by miraculous luck crumpled his periscope another man might have dived but boanerges kept on rising majestic and wrathful he rose personally through his main hatch and at 2000 yards have i said it was a still day addressed the tramp even at that distance she gathered it was a naval officer with a grievance and by the time he ran alongside she was in a state of coma but managed to stammer well sir at least youll admit that our shooting was pretty good  and that said my informant put the lid on boanerges went down lest he should be tempted to murder and the tramp affirms she heard him rumbling beneath her like an inverted thunderstorm for fifteen minutes  all those tramps ought to be disarmed and we ought to have all their guns said a voice out of a corner  what still worrying over your mug some one replied  he was a mug went on the man of one idea if id had a couple of twelves even i could have strafed him proper i dont know whether i shall mutiny or desert or write to the first sea lord about it  strafe all admiralty constructors to begin with i could build a better boat with a 4inch lathe and a sardinetin than  the speaker named her by letter and number  thats pure jealousy her commander explained to the company ever since i installedahemmy patent electric washbasin hes been intriguin to get her why we know he doesnt wash hed only use the basin to keep beer in   underwater works  however often one meets it as in this war one meets it at every turn one never gets used to the holy spirit of man at his job the common sweeper growling over his mug of tea that there was nothing in sweepin and these idly chaffing men new shaved and attired from the gates of death which had let them through for the fiftieth time were all of the same fabricincomprehensible i should imagine to the enemy and the stuff held good throughout all the worldfrom the dardanelles to the baltic where only a little while ago another batch of submarines had slipped in and begun to be busy i had spent some of the afternoon in looking through reports of submarine work in the sea of marmora they read like the diary of energetic weasels in an overcrowded chickenrun and the results for each boat were tabulated something like a cricket score there were no maiden overs one came across jewels of price set in the flat official phraseology for example one man who was describing some steps he was taking to remedy certain defects interjected casually at this point i had to go under for a little as a man in a boat was trying to grab my periscope with his hand no reference before or after to the said man or his fate again came across a dhow with a turkish skipper he seemed so miserable that i let him go and elsewhere in those waters a submarine overhauled a steamer full of turkish passengers some of whom arguing on their allies lines promptly leaped overboard our boat fished them out and returned them for she was not killing civilians in another affair which included several ships now at the bottom and one submarine the commander relaxes enough to note that the men behaved very well under direct and flanking fire from rifles at about fifteen yards this was not i believe the submarine that fought the turkish cavalry on the beach and in addition to matters much more marvellous than any i have hinted at the reports deal with repairs and shifts and contrivances carried through in the face of dangers that read like the last delirium of romance one boat went down the straits and found herself rather canted over to one side a mine and chain had jammed under her forward divingplane so far as i made out she shook it off by standing on her head and jerking backwards or it may have been for the thing has occurred more than once she merely rose as much as she could when she could and then released it by hand as the official phrase goes   four nightmares  and who a few months ago could have invented or having invented would have dared to print such a nightmare as this there was a boat in the north sea who ran into a net and was caught by the nose she rose still entangled meaning to cut the thing away on the surface but a zeppelin in waiting saw and bombed her and she had to go down again at oncebut not too wildly or she would get herself more wrapped up than ever she went down and by slow working and weaving and wriggling guided only by guesses at the meaning of each scrape and grind of the net on her blind forehead at last she drew clear then she sat on the bottom and thought the question was whether she should go back at once and warn her confederates against the trap or wait till the destroyers which she knew the zeppelin would have signalled for should come out to finish her still entangled as they would suppose in the net it was a simple calculation of comparative speeds and positions and when it was worked out she decided to try for the double event within a few minutes of the time she had allowed for them she heard the twitter of four destroyers screws quartering above her rose got her shot in saw one destroyer crumple hung round till another took the wreck in tow said goodbye to the spare brace she was at the end of her supplies and reached the rendezvous in time to turn her friends  and since we are dealing in nightmares here are two moreone genuine the other mercifully false there was a boat not only at but in the mouth of a riverwell home in german territory she was spotted and went under her commander perfectly aware that there was not more than five feet of water over her conningtower so that even a torpedoboat let alone a destroyer would hit it if she came over but nothing hit anything the search was conducted on scientific principles while they sat on the silt and suffered then the commander heard the rasp of a wire trawl sweeping over his hull it was not a nice sound but there happened to be a couple of gramophones aboard and he turned them both on to drown it and in due time that boat got home with everybodys hair of just the same colour as when they had started  the other nightmare arose out of silence and imagination a boat had gone to bed on the bottom in a spot where she might reasonably expect to be looked for but it was a convenient jumpingoff or up place for the work in hand about the bad hour of 230 am the commander was waked by one of his men who whispered to him theyve got the chains on us sir whether it was pure nightmare an hallucination of long wakefulness something relaxing and releasing in that packed box of machinery or the disgustful reality the commander could not tell but it had all the makings of panic in it so the lord and long training put it into his head to reply have they well we shant be coming up till nine oclock this morning well see about it then turn out that light please  he did not sleep but the dreamer and the others did and when morning came and he gave the order to rise and she rose unhampered and he saw the grey smeared seas from above once again he said it was a very refreshing sight  lastly which is on all fours with the gamble of the chase a man was coming home rather bored after an uneventful trip it was necessary for him to sit on the bottom for awhile and there he played patience of a sudden it struck him as a vow and an omen that if he worked out the next game correctly he would go up and strafe something the cards fell all in order he went up at once and found himself alongside a german whom as he had promised and prophesied to himself he destroyed she was a minelayer and needed only a jar to dissipate like a cracked electriclight bulb he was somewhat impressed by the contrast between the singlehanded game fifty feet below the ascent the attack the amazing result and when he descended again his cards just as he had left them      the ships destroy us above       and ensnare us beneath     we arise we lie down and we move       in the belly of death      the ships have a thousand eyes       to mark where we come      and the mirth of a seaport dies       when our blow gets home     submarines  ii   i was honoured by a glimpse into this veiled life in a boat which was merely practising between trips submarines are like cats they never tell who they were with last night and they sleep as much as they can if you board a submarine off duty you generally see a perspective of foreshortened fattish men laid all along the men say that except at certain times it is rather an easy life with relaxed regulations about smoking calculated to make a man put on flesh one requires wellpadded nerves many of the men do not appear on deck throughout the whole trip after all why should they if they dont want to they know that they are responsible in their department for their comrades lives as their comrades are responsible for theirs whats the use of flapping about better lay in some magazines and cigarettes  when we set forth there had been some trouble in the fairway and a mined neutral whose misfortune all bore with exemplary calm was careened on a nearby shoal  suppose there are more mines knocking about i suggested  well hope there arent was the soothing reply mines are all joss you either hit em or you dont and if you do they dont always go off they scrape alongside  whats the etiquette then  shut off both propellers and hope  we were dodging various craft down the harbour when a squadron of trawlers came out on our beam at that extravagant rate of speed which unlimited government coal always leads to they were led by an ugly upstanding blacksided buccaneer with twelvepounders  ah thats the king of the trawlers isnt he carrying dog too give him room one said  we were all in the narrowed harbour mouth together  theres my youngest daughter take a look at her some one hummed as a punctilious navy cap slid by on a very near bridge  well fall in behind him theyre going over to the neutral then theyll sweep by the bye did you hear about one of the passengers in the neutral yesterday he was taken off of course by a destroyer and the only thing he said was twentyfive time i ave insured but not this time ang it  the trawlers lunged ahead toward the forlorn neutral our destroyer nipped past us with that highshouldered terrierlike pouncing action of the newer boats and went ahead a tramp in ballast her propeller half out of water threshed along through the sallow haze  lord what a shot somebody said enviously the men on the little deck looked across at the slowmoving silhouette one of them a cigarette behind his ear smiled at a companion  then we went downnot as they go when they are pressed the record i believe is 50 feet in 50 seconds from top to bottom but genteelly to an orchestra of appropriate sounds roarings and blowings and after the orders which come from the commander alone utter silence and peace  theres the bottom we bumped at fiftyfiftytwo he said  i didnt feel it  well try again watch the gauge and youll see it flick a little   the practice of the art  it may have been so but i was more interested in the faces and above all the eyes all down the length of her it was to them of course the simplest of manoeuvres they dropped into gear as no machine could but the training of years and the experience of the year leaped up behind those steady eyes under the electrics in the shadow of the tall motors between the pipes and the curved hull or glued to their special gauges one forgot the bodies altogetherbut one will never forget the eyes or the ennobled faces one man i remember in particular on deck his was no more than a grave rather striking countenance cast in the unmistakable petty officers mould below as i saw him in profile handling a vital control he looked like the doge of venice the prior of some sternlyruled monastic order an oldtime popeanything that signifies trained and stored intellectual power utterly and ascetically devoted to some vast impersonal end and so with a much younger man who changed into such a monk as frank dicksee used to draw only a couple of torpedomen not being in gear for the moment read an illustrated paper their time did not come till we went up and got to business which meant firing at our destroyer and i think keeping out of the light of a friends torpedoes  the attack and everything connected with it is solely the commanders affair he is the only one who gets any fun at allsince he is the eye the brain and the hand of the wholethis single figure at the periscope the second in command heaves sighs and prays that the dummy torpedo there is less trouble about the live ones will go off all right or hell be told about it the others wait and follow the quick run of orders it is if not a convention a fairly established custom that the commander shall inferentially give his world some idea of what is going on at least i only heard of one man who says nothing whatever and doesnt even wriggle his shoulders when he is on the sight the others soliloquise etc according to their temperament and the periscope is as revealing as golf  submarines nowadays are expected to look out for themselves more than at the old practices when the destroyers walked circumspectly we dived and circulated under water for a while and then rose for a sightsomething like this up a littleup up still where the deuce has he got toah half a dozen orders as to helm and depth of descent and a pause broken by a drumming noise somewhere above which increases and passes away thats better up again this refers to the periscope yes ah no we dont think all right keep her down damn it umm that ought to be nineteen knots dirty trick hes changing speed no he isnt hes all right ready forward there a valve sputters and drips the torpedomen crouch over their tubes and nod to themselves their faces have changed now he hasnt spotted us yet well juustmore helm and depth orders but specially helmwish we were working a beamtube neer mind up a last string of orders six hundred and he doesnt see us fire  the dummy left the second in command cocked one ear and looked relieved up we rose the wet air and spray spattered through the hatch the destroyer swung off to retrieve the dummy  careless brutes destroyers are said one officer that fellow nearly walked over us just now did you notice  the commander was playing his game out over againstroke by stroke with a beamtube id ha strafed him amidships he concluded  why didnt you then i asked  there were loads of shiny reasons which reminded me that we were at war and cleared for action and that the interlude had been merely play a companion rose alongside and wanted to know whether we had seen anything of her dummy  no but we heard it was the short answer  i was rather annoyed because i had seen that particular daughter of destruction on the stocks only a short time ago and here she was grown up and talking about her missing children  in the harbour again one found more submarines all patterns and makes and sizes with rumours of yet more and larger to follow naturally their men say that we are only at the beginning of the submarine we shall have them presently for all purposes   the man and the work  now here is a mystery of the service  a man gets a boat which for two years becomes his very self      his morning hope his evening dream     his joy throughout the day  with him is a second in command an engineer and some others they prove each others souls habitually every few days by the direct test of peril till they act think and endure as a unit in and with the boat that commander is transferred to another boat he tries to take with him if he can which he cant as many of his other selves as possible he is pitched into a new type twice the size of the old one with three times as many gadgets an unexplored temperament and unknown leanings after his first trip he comes back clamouring for the head of her constructor of his own second in command his engineer his cox and a few other ratings they for their part wish him dead on the beach because last commission with soandso nothing ever went wrong anywhere a fortnight later you can remind the commander of what he said and he will deny every word of it shes not he says so very vilethings consideredbarring her fiveton torpedoderricks the abominations of her wireless and the tropical temperature of her beerlockers all of which signifies that the new boat has found her soul and her commander would not change her for battlecruisers therefore that he may remember he is the service and not a branch of it he is after certain seasons shifted to a battlecruiser where he lives in a blaze of admirals and aiguillettes responsible for vast decks and cryptlike flats a student of extended abovewater tactics thinking in tens of thousands of yards instead of his modest but deadly three to twelve hundred  and the man who takes his place straightway forgets that he ever looked down on great rollers from a sixtyfoot bridge under the whole breadth of heaven but crawls and climbs and dives through conningtowers with those same waves wet in his neck and when the cruisers pass him tearing the deep open in half a gale thanks god he is not as they are and goes to bed beneath their distracted keels                                        expert opinions  but submarine work is coldblooded business  this was at a little session in a greencurtained wardroom cum owners cabin  then theres no truth in the yarn that you can feel when the torpedos going to get home i asked  not a word you sometimes see it get home or miss as the case may be of course its never your fault if it misses its all your secondincommand  thats true too said the second i catch it all round thats what i am here for  and what about the third man there was one aboard at the time  he generally comes from a smaller boat to pick up real workif he can suppress his intellect and doesnt talk last commission  the third hand promptly denied the possession of any intellect and was quite dumb about his last boat  and the men  they train on too they train each other yes one gets to know em about as well as they get to know us up topside a man can take you intake himself infor months for half a commission prhaps down below he cant its all in cold bloodnot like at the front where they have something exciting all the time  then bumping mines isnt exciting  not one little bit you cant bump back at em even with a zepp  oh now and then one interrupted and they laughed as they explained  yes that was rather funny one of our boats came up slap underneath a low zepp looked for the sky you know and couldnt see anything except this fat shining belly almost on top of em luckily it wasnt the zepps stingin end so our boat went to windward and kept just awash there was a bit of a sea and the zepp had to work against the wind they dont like that our boat sent a man to the gun he was pretty well drowned of course but he hung on choking and spitting and held his breath and got in shots where he could this zepp was strafing bombs about for all she was worth andwho was itmacartney i think potting at her between dives and naturally all hands wanted to look at the performance so about half the north sea flopped down below andoh they had a charlie chaplin time of it well somehow macartney managed to rip the zepp a bit and she went to leeward with a list on her we saw her a fortnight later with a patch on her port side oh if fritz only fought clean this wouldnt be half a bad show but fritz cant fight clean  and we cant do what he doeseven if we were allowed to one said  no we cant tisnt done we have to fish fritz out of the water dry him and give him cocktails and send him to donnington hall  and what does fritz do i asked  he sputters and clicks and bows he has all the correct motions you know but of course when hes your prisoner you cant tell him what he really is  and do you suppose fritz understands any of it i went on  no or he wouldnt have lusitaniaed this war was his first chance of making his name and he chucked it all away for the sake of showin off as a foul gottstrafer  and they talked of that hour of the night when submarines come to the top like mermaids to get and give information of boats whose business it is to fire as much and to splash about as aggressively as possible and of other boats who avoid any sort of displaydumb boats watching and relieving watch with their periscope just showing like a crocodiles eye at the back of islands and the mouths of channels where something may some day move out in procession to its doom      be well assured that on our side       our challenged oceans fight     though headlong wind and heaping tide       make us their sport tonight     through force of weather not of war       in jeopardy we steer     then welcome fates discourtesy       whereby it shall appear         how in all time of our distress         as in our triumph too         the game is more than the player of the game         and the ship is more than the crew      be well assured though wave and wind       have mightier blows in store     that we who keep the watch assigned       must stand to it the more     and as our streaming bows dismiss       each billows baulked career     sing welcome fates discourtesy       whereby it is made clear         how in all time of our distress         as in our triumph too         the game is more than the player of the game         and the ship is more than the crew      be well assured though in our power       is nothing left to give     but time and place to meet the hour       and leave to strive to live     till these dissolve our order holds       our service binds us here     then welcome fates discourtesy       whereby it is made clear         how in all time of our distress         and our deliverance too         the game is more than the player of the game         and the ship is more than the crew     patrols  i   on the edge of the north sea sits an admiral in charge of a stretch of coast without lights or marks along which the traffic moves much as usual in front of him there is nothing but the east wind the enemy and some few our ships behind him there are towns with mps attached who a little while ago didnt see the reason for certain lighting orders when a zeppelin or two came they saw left and right of him are enormous docks with vast crowded sheds miles of stonefaced quayedges loaded with all manner of supplies and crowded with mixed shipping  in this exalted world one met staffcaptains staffcommanders stafflieutenants and secretaries with paymasters so senior that they almost ranked with admirals there were warrant officers too who long ago gave up splashing about decks barefoot and now check and issue stores to the ravenous untruthful fleets said one of these guarding a collection of desirable things to a cross between a sickbay attendant and a junior writer but he was really an expert burglar no an you can tell mr soandso with my compliments that the storekeepers gone awayright awaywith the key of these stores in his pocket understand me in his trousers pocket  he snorted at my next question  do i know any destroyerlootenants said he this coasts rank with em destroyerlootenants are born stealing its a mercy theys too busy to practise forgery or id be in gaol engineercommanders engineerlootenants theyre worse look here if my own mother was to come to me beggin brass screws for her own coffin idid think twice before id oblige the old lady wars war i grant you that but what ive got to contend with is crime  i referred to him a case of conscience in which every one concerned acted exactly as he should and it nearly ended in murder during a lengthy action the working of a gun was hampered by some empty cartridgecases which the lieutenant in charge made signs no man could hear his neighbour speak just then should be hove overboard upon which the gunner rushed forward and made other signs that they were on charge and must be tallied and accounted for he too was trained in a strict school upon which the lieutenant but that he was busy would have slain the gunner for refusing orders in action afterwards he wanted him shot by courtmartial but every one was voiceless by then and could only mouth and croak at each other till somebody laughed and the pedantic gunner was spared  well thats what you might fairly call a naval crux said my friend among the stores the lootenant was right mustnt refuse orders in action the gunner was right empty cases are on charge no one ought to chuck em away that way but damn it they were all of em right it ought to ha been a marine then they could have killed him and preserved discipline at the same time   a little theory  the problem of this coast resolves itself into keeping touch with the enemys movements in preparing matters to trap and hinder him when he moves and in so entertaining him that he shall not have time to draw clear before a blow descends on him from another quarter there are then three lines of defence the outer the inner and the home waters the traffic and fishing are always with us  the blackboard idea of it is always to have stronger forces more immediately available everywhere than those the enemy can send x german submarines draw a english destroyers then x calls x  y to deal with a who in turn calls up b a scout and possibly a² with a fair chance that if x  y  z a zeppelin carry on they will run into a²  b²  c cruisers at this point the equation generally stops if it continued it would end mathematically in the whole of the german fleet coming out then another factor which we may call the grand fleet would come from another place to change the comparisons the grand fleet is the strong left ready to give the knockout blow on the point of the chin when the head is thrown up the other fleets and other arrangements threaten the enemys solar plexus and stomach somewhere in relation to the grand fleet lies the blockading cordon which examines neutral traffic it could be drawn as tight as a turkish bowstring but for reasons which we may arrive at after the war it does not seem to have been so drawn up to date  the enemy lies behind his mines and ours raids our coasts when he sees a chance and kills seagoing civilians at sight or guess with intent to terrify most sailormen are mixed up with a woman or two a fair percentage of them have seen men drown they can realise what it is when women go down choking in horrible tangles and heavings of draperies to say that the enemy has cut himself from the fellowship of all who use the seas is rather understating the case as a man observed thoughtfully you cant look at any water now without seeing lusitania sprawlin all across it and just think of those words northgerman lloyd hamburgamerika and such things in the time to come they simply mustnt be  he was an elderly trawler respectable as they make them who after many years of fishing had discovered his real vocation i never thought id like killin men he reflected never seemed to be any o my dooty but it isand i do  a great deal of the east coast work concerns minefieldsours and the enemysboth of which shift as occasion requires we search for and root out the enemys mines they do the like by us it is a perpetual game of finding springing and laying traps on the least as well as the most likely runaways that ships usesuch sea snaring and wiring as the world never dreamt of we are hampered in this because our navy respects neutrals and spends a great deal of its time in making their path safe for them the enemy does not he blows them up because that cows and impresses them and so adds to his prestige   death and the destroyer  the easiest way of finding a minefield is to steam into it on the edge of night for choice with a steep sea running for that brings the bows down like a chopper on the detonatorhorns some boats have enjoyed this experience and still live there was one destroyer and there may have been others since who came through twentyfour hours of highlycompressed life she had an idea that there was a minefield somewhere about and left her companions behind while she explored the weather was dead calm and she walked delicately she saw one scandinavian steamer blow up a couple of miles away rescued the skipper and some hands saw another neutral which she could not reach till all was over skied in another direction and between her lifesaving efforts and her natural curiosity got herself as thoroughly mixed up with the field as a camel among tentropes a destroyers bows are very fine and her sides are very straight this causes her to cleave the wave with the minimum of disturbance and this boat had no desire to cleave anything else none the less from time to time she heard a mine grate or tinkle or jar i could not arrive at the precise note it strikes but they say it is unpleasant on her plates sometimes she would be free of them for a long while and began to hope she was clear at other times they were numerous but when at last she seemed to have worried out of the danger zone lieutenant and sub together left the bridge for a cup of tea in those days we took mines very seriously you know as they were in act to drink they heard the hateful sound again just outside the wardroom both put their cups down with extreme care little fingers extended we felt as if they might blow up too and tiptoed on deck where they met the focsle also on tiptoe they pulled themselves together and asked severely what the focsle thought it was doing beg pardon sir but theres another of those blighters taptapping alongside our end they all waited and listened to their common coffin being nailed by death himself but the things bumped away at this point they thought it only decent to invite the rescued skipper warm and blanketed in one of their bunks to step up and do any further perishing in the open  no thank you said he last time i was blown up in my bunk too that was all right so i think now too i stay in my bunk here it is cold upstairs  somehow or other they got out of the mess after all yes we used to take mines awfully seriously in those days one comfort is fritzll take them seriously when he comes out fritz dont like mines  who does i wanted to know  if youd been here a little while ago youd seen a commander comin in with a big un slung under his counter he brought the beastly thing in to analyse the rest of his squadron followed at twoknot intervals and everything in harbour that had steam up scattered   the admirable commander  presently i had the honour to meet a lieutenantcommanderadmiral who had retired from the service but like others had turned out again at the first flash of the guns and now commandshe who had great ships erupting at his least signala squadron of trawlers for the protection of the dogger bank fleet at present priceslet alone the chance of the paying submarinemen would fish in much warmer places his flagship was once a multimillionaires private yacht in her mixture of stark carpetless curtainless carbolised present with voluptuously curved broaddecked easystairwayed past she might be queen guinevere in the convent at amesbury and her lieutenantcommander most careful to pay all due compliments to admirals who were midshipmen when he was a commander leads a congregation of very hard men indeed they do precisely what he tells them to and with him go through strange experiences because they love him and because his language is volcanic and wonderfulwhat you might call popocatapocalyptic i saw the old navy making ready to lead out the new under a grey sky and a falling glassthe wisdom and cunning of the old man backed up by the passion and power of the younger breed and the discipline which had been his soul for half a century binding them all  whatll he do this time i asked of one who might know  hell cruise between two and three east but if youll tell me what he wont do it ud be more to the point hes minehunting i expect just now   wasted material  here is a digression suggested by the sight of a man i had known in other scenes despatchriding round a fleet in a petrollaunch there are many of his type yachtsmen of sorts accustomed to take chances who do not hold masters certificates and cannot be given seagoing commands like my friend they do general utility workoften in their own boats this is a waste of good material nobody wants amateur navigatorsthe traffic lanes are none too wide as it is but these gentlemen ought to be distributed among the trawler fleet as strictly combatant officers a trawler skipper may be an excellent seaman but slow with a submarine shelling and diving or in cutting out enemy trawlers the young ones who can master qf gun work in a very short time wouldthough there might be friction a courtmartial or two and probably losses at firstpay for their keep even a hundred or so of amateurs more or less controlled by their squadron commanders would make a happy beginning and i am sure they would all be extremely grateful      where the east wind is brewed fresh and fresh every morning       and the balmy nightbreezes blow straight from the pole     i heard a destroyer sing what an enjoyable life does one               lead on the north sea patrol      to blow things to bits is our business and fritzs       which means there are minefields wherever you stroll     unless youve particular wish to die quick youll avoid steering               close to the north sea patrol      we warn from disaster the mercantile master       who takes in high dudgeon our lifesaving rôle     for every ones grousing at docking and dowsing       the marks and the lights on the north sea patrol      twelve verses omitted      so swept but surviving half drowned but still driving     i watched her head out through the swell off the shoal     and i heard her propellers roar write to poor fellers       who run such a hell as the north sea patrol     patrols  ii   the great basins were crammed with craft of kinds never known before on any navy list some were as they were born others had been converted and a multitude have been designed for special cases the navy prepares against all contingencies by land sea and air it was a relief to meet a batch of comprehensible destroyers and to drop again into the little mousetrap wardrooms which are as largehearted as all our oceans the men one used to know as destroyerlieutenants born stealing are serious commanders and captains today but their sons lieutenants in command and lieutenantcommanders do follow them the sea in peace is a hard life war only sketches an extra line or two round the young mouths the routine of ships always ready for action is so part of the blood now that no one notices anything except the absence of formality and of the crimes of peace what warrant officers used to say at length is cut down to a grunt what the sailorman did not know and expected to have told him does not exist he has done it all too often at sea and ashore  i watched a little party working under a leading hand at a job which eighteen months ago would have required a gunner in charge it was comic to see his orders trying to overtake the execution of them ratings coming aboard carried themselves with a to me new swingnot swank but consciousness of adequacy the high dark focsles which thank goodness are only washed twice a week received them and their bags and they turnedto on the instant as a man picks up his life at home like the submarine crew they come to be a breed apartdoublejointed extratoed with brazen bowels and no sort of nerves  it is the same in the engineroom when the ships come in for their regular lookingover those who love them which you would never guess from the language know exactly what they need and get it without fuss everything that steams has her individual peculiarity and the great thing is at overhaul to keep to it and not develop a new one if for example through some trick of her screws not synchronising a destroyer always casts to port when she goes astern do not let any zealous soul try to make her run true or you will have to learn her helm all over again and it is vital that you should know exactly what your ship is going to do three seconds before she does it similarly with men if any one from lieutenantcommander to stoker changes his personal trick or habiteven the manner in which he clutches his chin or caresses his nose at a crisisthe matter must be carefully considered in this world where each is trustee for his neighbours life and vastly more important the corporate honour  what are the destroyers doing just now i asked  ohrunning aboutmuch the same as usual  the navy hasnt the least objection to telling one everything that it is doing unfortunately it speaks its own language which is incomprehensible to the civilian but you will find it all in the channel pilot and the riddle of the sands  it is a foul coast hairy with currents and rips and mottled with shoals and rocks practically the same men hold on here in the same ships with much the same crews for months and months a most senior officer told me that they were good boyson reflection quite good boysbut neither he nor the flags on his chart explained how they managed their lightless unmarked navigations through black night blinding rain and the crazy rebounding north sea gales they themselves ascribe it to joss that they have not piled up their ships a hundred times  i expect it must be because were always dodging about over the same ground one gets to smell it weve bumped pretty hard of course but we havent expended much up to date you never know your luck on patrol though   the nature of the beast  personally though they have been true friends to me i loathe destroyers and all the raw racking ricochetting life that goes with themthe smell of the wet lammies and damp wardroom cushions the galleychimney smoking out the bridge the obstaclestrewn deck and the pervading beastliness of oil grit and greasy iron even at moorings they shiver and sidle like halfbacked horses at sea they will neither rise up and fly clear like the hydroplanes nor dive and be done with it like the submarines but imitate the vices of both a scientist of the lower deck describes them as half switchback half waterchute and hell continuous their only merit from a landsmans point of view is that they can crumple themselves up from stem to bridge and i have seen it still get home but one does not breathe these compliments to their commanders other destroyers may bethey will point them out to youpoisonous bags of tricks but their own commandnever is she highbowed that is the only type which overrides the seas instead of smothering is she low low bows glide through the water where those colliernosed brutes smash it open is she mucked up with submarinecatchers they rather improve her trim no other ship has them have they been denied to her thank heaven we go to sea without a fishcuring plant on deck does she roll even for her class she is drier than dreadnoughts is she permanently and infernally wet stiff sirstiff the first requisite of a gunplatform   service as requisite  thus the cæsars and their fortunes put out to sea with their subs and their sadeyed engineers and their longsuffering signallersi do not even know the technical name of the sin which causes a man to be born a destroyersignaller in this lifeand the little yellow shells stuck all about where they can be easiest reached the rest of their acts is written for the information of the proper authorities it reads like a page of todhunter but the masters of merchantships could tell more of eyeless shapes barely outlined on the foam of their own arrest who shout orders through the thick gloom alongside the strayed and anxious neutral knows them when their searchlights pin him across the deep or their syrens answer the last yelp of his as steam goes out of his torpedoed boilers they stand by to catch and soothe him in his pyjamas at the gangway collect his scattered lifeboats and see a warm drink into him before they turn to hunt the slayer the drifters punching and reeling up and down their tenmile line of traps the outer trawlers drawing the very teeth of death with watersodden fingers are grateful for their low guarded signals and when the zeppelins revealing starshell cracks darkness open above him the answering crack of the invisible destroyers guns comforts the busy minelayers big cruisers talk to them too and what is more they talk back to the cruisers sometimes they draw firepinkish spurts of lighta long way off where fritz is trying to coax them over a minefield he has just laid or they steal on fritz in the midst of his job and the horizon rings with barking which the inevitable neutral who saw it all reports as a heavy fleet action in the north sea the sea after dark can be as alive as the woods of summer nights everything is exactly where you dont expect it and the shyest creatures are the farthest away from their holes things boom overhead like bitterns or scutter alongside like hares or arise dripping and hissing from below like otters it is the destroyers business to find out what their business may be through all the long night and to help or hinder accordingly dawn sees them pitchpoling insanely between headseas or hanging on to bridges that sweep like scythes from one forlorn horizon to the other a homewardbound submarine chooses this hour to rise very ostentatiously and signals by hand to a lieutenant in command they were the same term at dartmouth and same first ship  whats he sayin secure that gun will you cant hear oneself speak the gun is a bit noisy on its mountings but that isnt the reason for the destroyerlieutenants short temper  says hes goin down sir the signaller replies what the submarine had spelt out and everybody knows it was cannot approve of this extremely frightful weather am going to byebye  well snaps the lieutenant to his signaller what are you grinning at the submarine has hung on to ask if the destroyer will kiss her and whisper goodnight a breaking sea smacks her tower in the middle of the insult she closes like an oyster butjust too late habet there must be a quarter of a ton of water somewhere down below on its way to her ticklish batteries  what a wag says the signaller dreamily well e cant say e didnt get is little kiss  the lieutenant in command smiles the sea is a beast but a just beast   racial untruths  this is trivial enough but what would you have if admirals will not strike the proper attitudes nor lieutenants emit the appropriate sentiments one is forced back on the truth which is that the men at the heart of the great matters in our empire are mostly of an even simplicity from the advertising point of view they are stupid but the breed has always been stupid in this department it may be due as our enemies assert to our racial snobbery or as others hold to a certain godgiven lack of imagination which saves us from being overconcerned at the effects of our appearances on others either way it deceives the enemies people more than any calculated lie when you come to think of it though the english are the worst paperwork and viva voce liars in the world they have been rigorously trained since their early youth to live and act lies for the comfort of the society in which they move and so for their own comfort the result in this war is interesting  it is no lie that at the present moment we hold all the seas in the hollow of our hands for that reason we shuffle over them shamefaced and apologetic making arrangements here and flagrant compromises there in order to give substance to the lie that we have dropped fortuitously into this high seat and are looking round the world for some one to resign it to nor is it any lie that had we used the navys bare fist instead of its gloved hand from the beginning we could in all likelihood have shortened the war that being so we elected to dab and peck at and halfstrangle the enemy to let him go and choke him again it is no lie that we continue on our inexplicable path animated we will try to believe till other proof is given by a cloudy idea of alleviating or mitigating something for somebodynot ourselves here of course is where our racial snobbery comes in which makes the german gibber i cannot understand why he has not accused us to our allies of having secret commercial understandings with him for that reason we shall finish the german eagle as the merciful lady killed the chicken it took her the whole afternoon and then you will remember the carcase had to be thrown away  meantime there is a large and unlovely water inhabited by plain men in severe boats who endure cold exposure wet and monotony almost as heavy as their responsibilities charge them with heroismbut that needs heroism indeed accuse them of patriotism they become ribald examine into the records of the miraculous work they have done and are doing they will assist you but with perfect sincerity they will make as light of the valour and forethought shown as of the ends they have gained for mankind the service takes all work for granted it knew long ago that certain things would have to be done and it did its best to be ready for them when it disappeared over the skyline for manoeuvres it was practisingalways practising trying its men and stuff and throwing out what could not take the strain that is why when war came only a few names had to be changed and those chiefly for the sake of the body not of the spirit and the seniors who hold the key to our plans and know what will be done if things happen and what lines wear thin in the many chains they are of one fibre and speech with the juniors and the lower deck and all the rest who come out of the undemonstrative households ashore here is the situation as it exists now say the seniors this is what we do to meet it look and count and measure and judge for yourself and then you will know  it is a safe offer the civilian only sees that the sea is a vast place divided between wisdom and chance he only knows that the uttermost oceans have been swept clear and the traderoutes purged one by one even as our armies were being convoyed along them that there was no island nor key left unsearched on any waters that might hide an enemys craft between the arctic circle and the horn he only knows that less than a days run to the eastward of where he stands the enemys fleets have been held for a year and four months in order that civilisation may go about its business on all our waters     tales of the trade  1916     the trade      they bear in place of classic names       letters and numbers on their skin     they play their grisly blindfold games       in little boxes made of tin       sometimes they stalk the zeppelin     sometimes they learn where mines are laid       or where the baltic ice is thin     that is the custom of the trade      few prizecourts sit upon their claims       they seldom tow their targets in     they follow certain secret aims       down under far from strife or din       when they are ready to begin     no flag is flown no fuss is made       more than the shearing of a pin     that is the custom of the trade      the scouts quadruple funnel flames       a mark from sweden to the swin     the cruisers thundrous screw proclaims       her comings out and goings in       but only whiffs of paraffin     or creamy rings that fizz and fade       show where the oneeyed death has been     that is the custom of the trade      their feats their fortunes and their fames       are hidden from their nearest kin     no eager public backs or blames       no journal prints the yarns they spin       the censor would not let it in     when they return from run or raid       unheard they work unseen they win     that is the custom of the trade     i  some work in the baltic   no one knows how the title of the trade came to be applied to the submarine service some say that the cruisers invented it because they pretend that submarine officers look like unwashed chauffeurs others think it sprang forth by itself which means that it was coined by the lower deck where they always have the proper names for things whatever the truth the submarine service is now the trade and if you ask them why they will answer what else could you call it the trades the trade of course  it is a close corporation yet it recruits its men and officers from every class that uses the sea and engines as well as from many classes that never expected to deal with either it takes them they disappear for a while and return changed to their very souls for the trade lives in a world without precedents of which no generation has had any previous experiencea world still being made and enlarged daily it creates and settles its own problems as it goes along and if it cannot help itself no one else can so the trade lives in the dark and thinks out inconceivable and impossible things which it afterwards puts into practice  it keeps books too as honest traders should they are almost as bald as ledgers and are written up hour by hour on a little sliding table that pulls out from beneath the commanders bunk in due time they go to my lords of the admiralty who presently circulate a few carefully watered extracts for the confidential information of the junior officers of the trade that these may see what things are done and how the juniors read but laugh they have heard the stories with all the flaming detail and much of the language either from a chief actor while they perched deferentially on the edge of a messroom fender or from his subordinate in which case they were not so deferential or from some returned member of the crew present on the occasion who between halfshut teeth at the wheel jerks out what really happened there is very little going on in the trade that the trade does not know within a reasonable time but the outside world must wait until my lords of the admiralty release the records some of them have been released now   submarine and icebreaker  let us take almost at random an episode in the life of hm submarine e9 it is true that she was commanded by commander max horton but the utter impersonality of the tale makes it as though the boat herself spoke also never having met or seen any of the gentlemen concerned in the matter the writer can be impersonal too some time ago e9 was in the baltic in the deeps of winter where she used to be taken to her hunting grounds by an icebreaker obviously a submarine cannot use her sensitive nose to smash heavy ice with so the broadbeamed pushing chaperone comes along to see her clear of the thick harbour and shore ice in the open sea apparently she is left to her own devices in company of the icebreaker then e9 proceeded neither in the senior nor the junior service does any one officially go anywhere to a certain position  hereit is not stated in the book but the trade knows every aching single detail of what is left outshe spent a certain time in testing arrangements and apparatus which may or may not work properly when immersed in a mixture of blockice and dirty icecream in a temperature well towards zero this is a pleasant job made the more delightful by the knowledge that if you slip off the superstructure the deadly baltic chill will stop your heart long before even your heavy clothes can drown you hence and this is not in the book either the remark of the highly trained sailorman in these latitudes who on being told by his superior officer in the execution of his duty to go to hell did insubordinately and enviously reply dyou think id be here if i could whereby he caused the entire personnel beginning with the commander to say amen or words to that effect e9 evidently made things work  next day she reports as circumstances were favourable decided to attempt to bag a destroyer her certain position must have been near a wellused destroyerrun for shortly afterwards she sees three of them but too far off to attack and later as the light is failing a fourth destroyer towards which she manoeuvres depthkeeping she notes very difficult owing to heavy swell an observation balloon on a gusty day is almost as stable as a submarine pumping in a heavy swell and since the baltic is shallow the submarine runs the chance of being let down with a whack on the bottom none the less e9 works her way to within 600 yards of the quarry fires and waits just long enough to be sure that her torpedo is running straight and that the destroyer is holding her course then she dips to avoid detection the rest is deadly simple at the correct moment after firing 45 to 50 seconds heard the unmistakable noise of torpedo detonating four minutes later she rose and found destroyer had disappeared then for reasons probably connected with other destroyers who too may have heard that unmistakable sound she goes to bed below in the chill dark till it is time to turn homewards when she rose she met storm from the north and logged it accordingly spray froze as it struck and bridge became a mass of ice experienced considerable difficulty in keeping the conningtower hatch free from ice found it necessary to keep a man continuously employed on this work bridge screen immovable ice six inches thick on it telegraphs frozen in this state she forges ahead till midnight and any one who pleases can imagine the thoughts of the continuous employee scraping and hammering round the hatch as well as the delight of his friends below when the iceslush spattered down the conningtower at last she considered it advisable to free the boat of ice so went below   as requisite  in the senior service the two words as requisite cover everything that need not be talked about e9 next day proceeded as requisite through a series of snowstorms and recurring deposits of ice on the bridge till she got in touch with her friend the icebreaker and in her company ploughed and rooted her way back to the work we know there is nothing to show that it was a near thing for e9 but somehow one has the idea that the icebreaker did not arrive any too soon for e9s comfort and progress but what happens in the baltic when the icebreaker does not arrive  that was in winter in summer quite the other way e9 had to go to bed by day very often under the longlasting northern light when the baltic is as smooth as a carpet and one cannot get within a mile and a half of anything with eyes in its head without being put down there was one time when e9 evidently on information received took up a certain position and reported the sea glassy she had to suffer in silence while three heavily laden german ships went by for an attack would have given away her position her reward came next day when she sighted the words run like marryats enemy squadron coming up fast from eastward proceeding inshore of us they were two heavy battleships with an escort of destroyers and e9 turned to attack she does not say how she crept up in that smooth sea within a quarter of a mile of the leading ship a threefunnel ship of either the deutschland or braunschweig class but she managed it and fired both bow torpedoes at her  no 1 torpedo was seen and heard to strike her just before foremost funnel smoke and débris appeared to go as high as masthead that much e9 saw before one of the guardian destroyers ran at her so says she observing her i took my periscope off the battleship this was excusable as the destroyer was coming up with intent to kill and e9 had to flood her tanks and get down quickly even so the destroyer only just missed her and she struck bottom in 43 feet but says e9 who if she could not see kept her ears open at the correct interval the 45 or 50 seconds mentioned in the previous case the second torpedo was heard to explode though not actually seen e9 came up twenty minutes later to make sure the destroyer was waiting for her a couple of hundred yards away and again e9 dipped for the life but just had time to see one large vessel approximately four or five miles away  putting courage aside think for a moment of the mere drill of it allthat last dive for that attack on the chosen battleship the eye at the periscope watching no 1 torpedo get home the rush of the vengeful destroyer the instant orders for flooding everything the swift descent which had to be arranged for with full knowledge of the shallow seafloors waiting below and a guess at the course that might be taken by the seeking bows above for assuming a destroyer to draw 10 feet and a submarine on the bottom to stand 25 feet to the top of her conningtower there is not much clearance in 43 feet salt water specially if the boat jumps when she touches bottom and through all these and half a hundred other simultaneous considerations imagine the trained minds below counting as only torpedomen can count the run of the merciless seconds that should tell when that second shot arrived then at the correct interval as laid down in the table of distances the boom and the jar of no 2 torpedo the relief the exhaled breath and untightened lips the impatient waiting for a second peep and when that had been taken and the eye at the periscope had reported one little niggerboy in place of two on the waters perhaps cigarettes c while the destroyer sickled about at a venture overhead  certainly they give men rewards for doing such things but what reward can there be in any gift of kings or peoples to match the enduring satisfaction of having done them not alone but with and through and by trusty and proven companions   defeated by darkness  e1 also a baltic boat her commander fn laurence had her experiences too she went out one summer day and latetoo latein the evening sighted three transports the first she hit while she was arranging for the second the third inconsiderately tried to ram her before her sights were on so it was necessary to go down at once and waste whole minutes of the precious scanting light when she rose the stricken ship was sinking and shortly afterwards blew up the other two were patrolling near by it would have been a fair chance in daylight but the darkness defeated her and she had to give up the attack  it was e1 who during thick weather came across a squadron of battlecruisers and got in on a flanking shipprobably the moltke the destroyers were very much on the alert and she had to dive at once to avoid one who only missed her by a few feet then the fog shut down and stopped further developments thus do time and chance come to every man  the trade has many stories too of watching patrols when a boat must see chance after chance go by under her nose and writemerely writewhat she has seen naturally they do not appear in any accessible records nor which is a pity do the authorities release the records of glorious failures when everything goes wrong when torpedoes break surface and squatter like ducks or arrive full square with a clang and burst of white water andfail to explode when the devil is in charge of all the motors and clutches develop play that would scare a shoregoing mechanic bald when batteries begin to give off death instead of power and atop of all ice or wreckage of the strewn seas racks and wrenches the hull till the whole leaking bag of tricks limps home on six missing cylinders and one ditto propeller plus the indomitable will of the redeyed husky scarecrows in charge  there might be worse things in this world for decent people to read than such records     ii  business in the sea of marmara   this war is like an iceberg we the public only see an eighth of it above water the rest is out of sight and as with the berg one guesses its extent by great blocks that break off and shoot up to the surface from some underlying outrunning spur a quarter of a mile away so with this war sudden tales come to light which reveal unsuspected activities in unexpected quarters one takes it for granted such things are always going on somewhere but the actual emergence of the record is always astonishing  once upon a time there were certain e type boats who worked the sea of marmara with thoroughness and humanity for the two in english hands are compatible the road to their huntinggrounds was strewn with peril the waters they inhabited were full of eyes that gave them no rest and what they lost or expended in wear and tear of the chase could not be made good till they had run the gauntlet to their base again the full tale of their improvisations and makeedoes will probably never come to light though fragments can be picked up at intervals in the proper places as the men concerned come and go the admiralty gives only the bones but those are not so dry of the boats official story  when e14 commander e courtneyboyle went to her work in the sea of marmara she like her sister proceeded on her gasengine up the dardanelles and a gasengine by night between steep cliffs has been described by the lowerdeck as a full brass band in a railway cutting so a fort picked her up with a searchlight and missed her with artillery she dived under the minefield that guarded the straits and when she rose at dawn in the narrowest part of the channel which is about one mile and a half across all the forts fired at her the water too was thick with steamboat patrols out of which e14 selected a turkish gunboat and gave her a torpedo she had just time to see the great column of water shoot as high as the gunboats mast when she had to dip again as the men in a small steamboat were leaning over trying to catch hold of the top of my periscope   six hours of blind death  this sentence which might have come out of a french exercise book is all lieutenantcommander courtneyboyle sees fit to tell and that officer will never understand why one taxpayer at least demands his arrest after the war till he shall have given the full tale did he sight the shadowy underline of the small steamboat green through the deadlights or did she suddenly swim into his vision from behind and obscure without warning his periscope with a single brown clutching hand was she alone or one of a mob of splashing shouting small craft he may well have been too busy to note for there were patrols all around him a minefield of curious design and undefined area somewhere in front and steam trawlers vigorously sweeping for him astern and ahead and when e14 had burrowed and bumped and scraped through six hours of blind death she found the sea of marmara crawling with craft and was kept down almost continuously and grew hot and stuffy in consequence nor could she charge her batteries in peace so at the end of another hectic hunted day of starting them up and breaking off and divingwhich is bad for the tempershe decided to quit those infested waters near the coast and charge up somewhere off the traffic routes  this accomplished after a long hot run which did the motors no good she went back to her beat where she picked up three destroyers convoying a couple of troopships but it was a glassy calm and the destroyers came for me she got off a longrange torpedo at one transport and ducked before she could judge results she apologises for this on the grounds that one of her periscopes had been damagednot as one would expect by the gentleman leaning out of the little steamboat but by some casual shotcalibre not specifiedthe day before and so says e14 i could not risk my remaining one being bent however she heard a thud and the depthgaugesthose great clockhands on the whitefaced circlesflicked which is another sign of dreadful certainty down under when she rose again she saw a destroyer convoying one burning transport to the nearest beach that afternoon she met a sisterboat now gone to valhalla who told her that she was almost out of torpedoes and they arranged a rendezvous for next day but before we could communicate we had to dive and i did not see her again there must be many such meetings in the trade under all skiesboat rising beside boat at the point agreed upon for interchange of news and materials the talk shouted aloud with the speakers eyes always on the horizon and all hands standing by to dive even in the middle of a sentence   annoying patrol ships  e14 kept to her job on the edge of the procession of traffic patrol vessels annoyed her to such an extent that as i had not seen any transports lately i decided to sink a patrolship as they were always firing on me so she torpedoed a thing that looked like a minelayer and must have been something of that kidney for it sank in less than a minute a trampsteamer lumbering across the dead flat sea was thoughtfully headed back to constantinople by firing rifles ahead of her under fire the whole day e14 observes philosophically the nature of her work made this inevitable she was all among the patrols which kept her down a good deal and made her draw on her batteries and when she rose to charge watchers ashore burned oilflares on the beach or made smokes among the hills according to the light in either case there would be a general rush of patrolling craft of all kinds from steam launches to gunboats nobody loves the trade though e14 did several things which made her popular she let off a string of very surprised dhows they were empty in charge of a tug which promptly fled back to constantinople stopped a couple of steamers full of refugees also bound for constantinople who were very pleased at being allowed to proceed instead of being lusitaniaed as they had expected another refugeeboat fleeing from goodness knows what horror she chased into rodosto harbour where though she could not see any troops they opened a heavy rifle fire on us hitting the boat several times so i went away and chased two more small tramps who returned towards constantinople  transports of course were fair game and in spite of the necessity she was under of not risking her remaining eye e14 got a big one in a night of wind and made another hurriedly beach itself which then opened fire on her assisted by the local population returned fire and proceeded says e14 the diversion of returning fire is one much appreciated by the lowerdeck as furnishing a pleasant break in what otherwise might be a monotonous and odoriferous task there is no drill laid down for this evolution but etiquette and custom prescribe that on going up the hatch you shall not too energetically prod the next man ahead with the muzzle of your rifle likewise when descending in quick time before the hatch closes you are requested not to jump directly on the head of the next below otherwise you act as requisite on your own initiative  when she had used up all her torpedoes e14 prepared to go home by the way she had comethere was no otherand was chased towards gallipoli by a mixed pack composed of a gunboat a torpedoboat and a tug they shepherded me to gallipoli one each side of me and one astern evidently expecting me to be caught by the nets there she walked very delicately for the next eight hours or so all down the straits underrunning the strong tides ducking down when the fire from the forts got too hot verifying her position and the position of the minefield but always taking notes of every ship in sight till towards teatime she saw our navy off the entrance and rose to the surface abeam of a french battleship who gave us a rousing cheer she had been away as nearly as possible three weeks and a kind destroyer escorted her to the base where we will leave her for the moment while we consider the performance of e11 lieutenantcommander me nasmith in the same waters at about the same season  e11 proceeded in the usual way to the usual accompaniments of hostile destroyers up the straits and meets the usual difficulties about chargingup when she gets through her wireless naturally takes this opportunity to give trouble and e11 is left deaf and dumb somewhere in the middle of the sea of marmara diving to avoid hostile destroyers in the intervals of trying to come at the fault in her aerial yet it is noteworthy that the language of the trade though technical is no more emphatic or incandescent than that of topside ships  then she goes towards constantinople finds a turkish torpedogunboat off the port sinks her has her periscope smashed by a sixpounder retires fits a new top on the periscope and at 1030 amthey must have needed itpipes all hands to bathe much refreshed she gets her wireless linked up at last and is able to tell the authorities where she is and what she is after   mr silas q swing  at this pointit was off rodostoenter a small steamer which does not halt when requested and so is fired at with several rounds from a rifle the crew on being told to abandon her tumble into their boats with such haste that they capsize two out of three fortunately says e11 they are able to pick up everybody you can imagine to yourself the confusion alongside the raffle of odds and ends floating out of the boats and the general particoloured hurrahsnest all over the bright broken water what you cannot imagine is this an american gentleman then appeared on the upper deck who informed us that his name was silas q swing of the chicago sun and that he was pleased to make our acquaintance he then informed us that the steamer was proceeding to chanak and he wasnt sure if there were any stores aboard if anything could astonish the trade at this late date one would almost fancy that the apparition of silas q swing very happy to meet you gentlemen might have started a rivet or two on e11s placid skin but she never even quivered she kept a lieutenant of the name of doyley hughes an expert in demolition parties and he went aboard the tramp and reported any quantity of storesa sixinch gun for instance lashed across the top of the forehatch silas q swing must have been an unobservant journalist a sixinch gunmounting in the forehold pedestals for twelvepounders thrown in as dunnage the afterhold full of sixinch projectiles and a scattering of other commodities they put the demolition charge well in among the sixinch stuff and she took it all to the bottom in a few minutes after being touched off  simultaneously with the sinking of the vessel the e11 goes on smoke was observed to the eastward it was a steamer who had seen the explosion and was running for rodosto e11 chased her till she tied up to rodosto pier and then torpedoed her where she laya heavily laden storeship piled high with packingcases the water was shallow here and though e11 bumped along the bottom which does not make for steadiness of aim she was forced to show a good deal of her only periscope and had it dented but not damaged by riflefire from the beach as she moved out of rodosto bay she saw a paddleboat loaded with barbed wire which stopped on the hail but as we ranged alongside her attempted to ram us but failed owing to our superior speed then she ran for the beach very skilfully keeping her stern to e11 till she drove ashore beneath some cliffs the demolitionsquad were just getting to work when a party of horsemen appeared on the cliffs above and opened a hot fire on the conning tower e11 got out but owing to the shoal water it was some time before she could get under enough to fire a torpedo the stern of a stranded paddleboat is no great target and the thing exploded on the beach then she recharged batteries and proceeded slowly on the surface towards constantinople all this between the ordinary office hours of 10 am and 4 pm  her next days work opens as no pallid writer of fiction dare begin thus having dived unobserved into constantinople observed etc her observations were rather hampered by crosstides mud and currents as well as the vagaries of one of her own torpedoes which turned upside down and ran about promiscuously it hit something at last and so did another shot that she fired but the waters by constantinople arsenal are not healthy to linger in after one has scared up the whole seafront so turned to go out matters were a little better below and e11 in her perilous passage might have been a lady of the harem tied up in a sack and thrown into the bosporus she grounded heavily she bounced up 30 feet was headed down again by a manoeuvre easier to shudder over than to describe and when she came to rest on the bottom found herself being swivelled right round the compass they watched the compass with much interest it was concluded therefore that the vessel e11 is one of the few who speaks of herself as a vessel as well as a boat was resting on the shoal under the leander tower and was being turned round by the current so they corrected her started the motors and bumped gently down into 85 feet of water with no more knowledge than the lady in the sack where the next bump would land them   the preening perch  and the following day was spent resting in the centre of the sea of marmara that was their favourite preening perch between operations because it gave them a chance to tidy the boat and bathe and they were a cleanly people both in their methods and their persons when they boarded a craft and found nothing of consequence they parted with many expressions of good will and e11 had a good wash she gives her reasons at length for going in and out of constantinople and the straits is all in the days work but going dirty you understand is serious she had of late noticed the atmosphere in the boat becoming very oppressive the reason doubtless being that there was a quantity of dirty linen aboard and also the scarcity of fresh water necessitated a limit being placed on the frequency of personal washing hence the centre of the sea of marmara all hands playing overside and as much laundry work as time and the service allowed one of the reasons by the way why we shall be good friends with the turk again is that he has many of our ideas about decency  in due time e11 went back to her base she had discovered a way of using unspent torpedoes twice over which surprised the enemy and she had as nearly as possible been cut down by a ship which she thought was running away from her instead of which she made the discovery at three thousand yards both craft all out the stranger steamed straight at her the enemy then witnessed a somewhat spectacular dive at full speed from the surface to 20 feet in as many seconds he then really did turn tail and was seen no more going through the straits she observed an empty troopship at anchor but reserved her torpedoes in the hope of picking up some battleships lower down not finding these in the narrows she nosed her way back and sank the trooper afterwards continuing journey down the straits off kilid bahr something happened she got out of trim and had to be fully flooded before she could be brought to her required depth it might have been whirlpools under water orother things they tell a story of a boat which once went mad in these very waters and for no reason ascertainable from within plunged to depths that contractors do not allow for rocketed up again like a swordfish and would doubtless have so continued till she died had not something she had fouled dropped off and let her recover her composure  an hour later heard a noise similar to grounding knowing this to be impossible in the water in which the boat then was i came up to 20 feet to investigate and observed a large mine preceding the periscope at a distance of about 20 feet which was apparently hung up by its moorings to the port hydroplane hydroplanes are the fins at bow and stern which regulate a submarines diving a mine weighs anything from hundredweights to halftons sometimes it explodes if you merely think about it at others you can batter it like an empty sardinetin and it submits meekly but at no time is it meant to wear on a hydroplane they dared not come up to unhitch it owing to the batteries ashore so they pushed the dim shape ahead of them till they got outside kum kale they then went full astern and emptied the aftertanks which brought the bows down and in this posture rose to the surface when the rush of water from the screws together with the sternway gathered allowed the mine to fall clear of the vessel  now a fool said dr johnson would have tried to describe that     iii  ravages and repairs   before we pick up the further adventures of hm submarine e14 and her partner e11 here is what you might call a cuttingout affair in the sea of marmara which e12 lieutenantcommander km bruce put through quite on the old lines  e12s main motors gave trouble from the first and she seems to have been a cripple for most of that trip she sighted two small steamers one towing two and the other three sailing vessels making seven keels in all she stopped the first steamer noticed she carried a lot of stores and moreover that her crewshe had no boatswere all on deck in lifebelts not seeing any gun e12 ran up alongside and told the first lieutenant to board the steamer then threw a bomb at e12 which struck but luckily did not explode and opened fire on the boardingparty with rifles and a concealed 1in gun e12 answered with her sixpounder and also with rifles the two sailing ships in tow very properly tried to foul e12s propellers and also opened fire with rifles  it was as orientally mixed a fight as a man could wish the first lieutenant and the boardingparty engaged on the steamer e12 foul of the steamer and being fouled by the sailing ships the sixpounder methodically perforating the steamer from bow to stern the steamers 1in gun and the rifles from the sailing ships raking everything and everybody else e12s coxswain on the conningtower passing up ammunition and e12s one workable motor developing slight defects at of course the moment when power to manoeuvre was vital  the account is almost as difficult to disentangle as the actual mess must have been at any rate the sixpounder caused an explosion in the steamers ammunition whereby the steamer sank in a quarter of an hour giving timeand a hot time it must have beenfor e12 to get clear of her and to sink the two sailing ships she then chased the second steamer who slipped her three tows and ran for the shore e12 knocked her about a good deal with gunfire as she fled saw her drive on the beach well alight and then since the beach opened fire with a gun at 1500 yards went away to retinker her motors and write up her log she approved of her first lieutenants behaviour under very trying circumstances this probably refers to the explosion of the ammunition by the sixpounder which doubtless jarred the boardingparty and of the cox who acted as ammunitionhoist and of the guns crew who all did very well under rifle and smallgun fire at a range of about ten yards but she never says what she really said about her motors   a brawl at a pier  now we will take e14 on various work either alone or as flagship of a squadron composed of herself and lieutenantcommander nasmiths boat e11 hers was a busy midsummer and she came to be intimate with all sort of craftsuch as the twofunnelled gunboat off sar kioi who fired at us and missed as usual hospital ships going back and forth unmolested to constantinople the gunboat which fired at me on sunday and other old friends afloat and ashore  when the crew of the turkish brigantine full of stores got into their boats by request and then all stood up and cursed us e14 did not lose her temper even though it was too rough to lie alongside the abandoned ship she told acting lieutenant rw lawrence of the royal naval reserve to swim off to her which he did and after a cursory searchwho can be expected to sherlock holmes for hours with nothing onset fire to her with the aid of her own matches and paraffin oil  then e14 had a brawl with a steamer with a yellow funnel blue top and black band lying at a pier among dhows the shore took a hand in the game with small guns and rifles and as e14 manoeuvred about the roadstead as requisite there was a sudden unaccountable explosion which strained her very badly i think she muses i must have caught the moorings of a mine with my tail as i was turning and exploded it it is possible that it might have been a big shell bursting over us but i think this unlikely as we were 30 feet at the time she is always a philosophical boat anxious to arrive at the reason of facts and when the game is against her she admits it freely  there was nondescript craft of a few hundred tons who at a distance did not look very warlike but when chased suddenly played a couple of sixpounders and got off two dozen rounds at us before we were under some of them were only about 20 yards off and when a wily steamer after sidling along the shore lay up in front of a town she became indistinguishable from the houses and so was safe because we do not löwestrafe open towns  sailing dhows full of grain had to be destroyed at one rendezvous while waiting for e11 e14 dealt with three such cases and then towed the crews inshore and gave them biscuits beef and rum and water as they were rather wet passenger steamers were allowed to proceed because they were full of people of both sexes which is an unkultured way of doing business  here is another instance of our insular type of mind an empty dhow is passed which e14 was going to leave alone but it occurs to her that the boat looks rather deserted and she fancies she sees two heads in the water so she goes back half a mile picks up a couple of badly exhausted men frightened out of their wits gives them food and drink and puts them aboard their property crews that jump overboard have to be picked up even if as happened in one case there are twenty of them and one of them is a german bank manager taking a quantity of money to the chanak bank hospital ships are carefully looked over as they come and go and are left to their own devices but they are rather a nuisance because they force e14 and others to dive for them when engaged in stalking warrantable game there were a good many hospital ships and as far as we can make out they all played fair e11 boarded one and reported everything satisfactory   strange messmates  a layman cannot tell from the reports which of the duties demanded the most workwhether the continuous clearing out of transports dhows and sailing ships generally found close to the wellgunned and attentive beach or the equally continuous attacks on armed vessels of every kind whatever else might be going on there was always the problem how to arrange for the crews of sunk ships if a dhow has no small boats and you cannot find one handy you have to take the crew aboard where they are horribly in the way and add to the oppressiveness of the atmospherelike the nine people including two very old men whom e14 made honorary members of her mess for several hours till she could put them ashore after dark oddly enough she could not get anything out of them imagine nine bewildered moslems suddenly decanted into the reeking clamorous bowels of a fabric obviously built by shaitan himself and surrounded bybut our people are people of the book and not dogeating kaffirs and i will wager a great deal that that little company went ashore in better heart and stomach than when they were passed down the conningtower hatch  then there were queer amphibious battles with troops who had to be shelled as they marched towards gallipoli along the coast roads e14 went out with e11 on this job early one morning each boat taking her chosen section of landscape thrice e14 rose to fire thinking she saw the dust of feet but each time it turned out to be bullocks when the shelling was ended i think the troops marching along that road must have been delayed and a good many killed the turks got up a fieldgun in the course of the afternoonyour true believer never hurrieswhich outranged both boats and they left accordingly  the next day she changed billets with e11 who had the luck to pick up and put down a battleship close to gallipoli it turned out to be the barbarossa meantime e14 got a 5000ton supply ship and later had to burn a sailing ship loaded with 200 bales of leaf and cut tobaccoturkish tobacco small wonder that e11 came alongside that afternoon and remained for an hourprobably making cigarettes   refitting under difficulties  then e14 went back to her base she had a hellish time among the dardanelles nets was of course fired at by the forts just missed a torpedo from the beach scraped a mine and when she had time to take stock found electric minewires twisted round her propellers and all her hull scraped and scored with wire marks but that again was only in the days work the point she insisted upon was that she had been for seventy days in the sea of marmara with no securer base for refit than the centre of the same and during all that while she had not had any engineroom defect which has not been put right by the engineroom staff of the boat the commander and the third officer went sick for a while the first lieutenant got gastroenteritis and was in bed if you could see that bed for the remainder of our stay in the sea of marmara but this boat has never been out of running order the credit is ascribed to the excellence of my chief engineroom artificer james hollier hague on 227715 whose name is duly submitted to the authorities for your consideration for advancement to the rank of warrant officer  seventy days of every conceivable sort of risk within and without in a boat which is all engineroom except where she is sickbay twelve thousand miles covered since last overhaul and never out of running orderthanks to mr hague such artists as he are the kind of engineroom artificers that commanders intrigue to get hold ofeach for his own boatand when the tales are told in the trade their names like abou ben adhems lead all the rest  i do not know the exact line of demarcation between engineroom and gunnery repairs but i imagine it is faint and fluid e11 for example while she was helping e14 to shell a beached steamer smashed half her gunmounting the gunlayer being thrown overboard and the gun nearly following him however the mischief was repaired in the next twentyfour hours which considering the very limited deck space of a submarine means that all hands must have been moderately busy one hopes that they had not to dive often during the job  but worse is to come e2 commander d stocks carried an externally mounted gun which while she was diving up the dardanelles on business got hung up in the wires and stays of a net she saw them through the conningtower scuttles at a depth of 80 ftone wire hawser round the gun another round the conningtower and so on there was a continuous crackling of small explosions overhead which she thought were charges aimed at her by the guardboats who watch the nets she considered her position for a while backed got up steam barged ahead and shore through the whole affair in one wild surge imagine the roof of a navigable cottage after it has snapped telegraph lines with its chimney and you will get a small idea of what happens to the hull of a submarine when she uses her gun to break wire hawsers with   trouble with a gun  e2 was a wet strained and uncomfortable boat for the rest of her cruise she sank steamers burned dhows was worried by torpedoboats and hunted by hun planes hit bottom freely and frequently silenced forts that fired at her from lonely beaches warned villages who might have joined in the game that they had better keep to farming shelled railway lines and stations would have shelled a pier but found there was a hospital built at one end of it so could not bombard came upon dhows crowded with female refugees which she allowed to proceed and was presented with fowls in return but through it all her chief preoccupation was that racked and strained gun and mounting when there was nothing else doing she reports sourly that she worked on gun as a philosopher of the lower deck put it tisnt what you blanky do that matters its what you blanky have to do in other words worry not work kills  e2s gun did its best to knock the heart out of them all she had to shift the wretched thing twice once because the bolts that held it down were smashed the wire hawser must have pretty well pulled it off its seat and again because the hull beneath it leaked on pressure she went down to make sure of it but she drilled and tapped and adjusted till in a short time the gun worked again and killed steamers as it should meanwhile the whole boat leaked all the plates under the old gunposition forward leaked she leaked aft through damaged hydroplane guards and on her way home they had to keep the water down by hand pumps while she was diving through the nets where she did not leak outside she leaked internally tank leaking into tank so that the petrol got into the main freshwater supply and the men had to be put on allowance the last pint was served out when she was in the narrowest part of the narrows a place where ones mouth may well go dry of a sudden  here for the moment the records end i have been at some pains not to pick and choose among them so far from doctoring or heightening any of the incidents i have rather understated them but i hope i have made it clear that through all the haste and fury of these multiplied actions when life and death and destruction turned on the twitch of a finger not one life of any noncombatant was wittingly taken they were carefully picked up or picked out taken below transferred to boats and despatched or personally conducted in the intervals of business to the safe unexploding beach sometimes they part from their chaperones with many expressions of good will at others they seem greatly relieved and rather surprised at not being knocked on the head after the custom of their allies but the boats with a hundred things on their minds no more take credit for their humanity than their commanders explain the feats for which they won their respective decorations     destroyers at jutland  1916      have you news of my boy jack       not this tide

paralytic   there was much destroyerwork in the battle of jutland the actual battle field may not have been more than twenty thousand square miles but the incidental patrols from first to last must have covered many times that area doubtless the next generation will comb out every detail of it all we need remember is there were many squadrons of battleships and cruisers engaged over the face of the north sea and that they were accompanied in their dread comings and goings by multitudes of destroyers who attacked the enemy both by day and by night from the afternoon of may 31 to the morning of june 1 1916 we are too close to the gigantic canvas to take in the meaning of the picture our children stepping backward through the years may get the true perspective and proportions  to recapitulate what every one knows  the german fleet came out of its north sea ports scouting ships ahead then destroyers cruisers battlecruisers and last the main battle fleet in the rear it moved north parallel with the coast of stolen schleswigholstein and jutland our fleets were already out the main battle fleet admiral jellicoe sweeping down from the north and our battlecruiser fleet admiral beatty feeling for the enemy our scouts came in contact with the enemy on the afternoon of may 31 about 100 miles off the jutland coast steering northwest they satisfied themselves he was in strength and reported accordingly to our battlecruiser fleet which engaged the enemys battlecruisers at about halfpast three oclock the enemy steered southeast to rejoin their own fleet which was coming up from that quarter we fought him on a parallel course as he ran for more than an hour  then his battlefleet came in sight and beattys fleet went about and steered northwest in order to retire on our battlefleet which was hurrying down from the north we returned fighting very much over the same waters as we had used in our slant south the enemy up till now had lain to the eastward of us whereby he had the advantage in that thick weather of seeing our hulls clear against the afternoon light while he himself worked in the mists we then steered a little to the northwest bearing him off towards the east till at six oclock beatty had headed the enemys leading ships and our main battlefleet came in sight from the north the enemy broke back in a loop first eastward then south then southwest as our fleet edged him off from the land and our main battlefleet coming up behind them followed in their wake thus for a while we had the enemy to westward of us where he made a better mark but the day was closing and the weather thickened and the enemy wanted to get away at a quarter past eight the enemy still heading southwest was covered by his destroyers in a great screen of grey smoke and he got away   night and morning  as darkness fell our fleets lay between the enemy and his home ports during the night our heavy ships keeping well clear of possible minefields swept down south to south and west of the horns reef so that they might pick him up in the morning when morning came our main fleet could find no trace of the enemy to the southward but our destroyerflotillas further north had been very busy with enemy ships apparently running for the horns reef channel it looks then as if when we lost sight of the enemy in the smoke screen and the darkness he had changed course and broken for home astern our main fleets and whether that was a sound manoeuvre or otherwise he and the still flows of the north sea alone can tell  but how is a layman to give any coherent account of an affair where a whole countrys coastline was background to battle covering geographical degrees the records give an impression of illimitable grey waters nicked on their uncertain horizons with the smudge and blur of ships sparkling with fury against ships hidden under the curve of the world one sees these distances maddeningly obscured by walking mists and weak fogs or wiped out by layers of funnel and gun smoke and realises how at the pace the ships were going anything might be stumbled upon in the haze or charge out of it when it lifted one comprehends too how the faroff glare of a great vessel afire might be reported as a local fire on a nearby enemy or vice versa how a silhouette caught for an instant in a shaft of pale light let down from the low sky might be fatally difficult to identify till too late but add to all these inevitable confusions and misreckonings of time shape and distance charges at every angle of squadrons through and across other squadrons sudden shifts of the centres of the fights and even swifter restorations wheelings sweepings and regroupments such as accompany the passage across space of colliding universes then blanket the whole inferno with the darkness of night at full speed andsee what you can make of it   three destroyers  a little time after the action began to heat up between our battlecruisers and the enemys eight or ten of our destroyers opened the ball for their branch of the service by breaking up the attack of an enemy light cruiser and fifteen destroyers of these they accounted for at least two destroyerssome think moreand drove the others back on their battlecruisers this scattered that fight a good deal over the sea three of our destroyers held on for the enemys battlefleet who came down on them at ranges which eventually grew less than 3000 yards our people ought to have been lifted off the seas bodily but they managed to fire a couple of torpedoes apiece while the range was diminishing they had no illusions says one of the three speaking of her second shot which she loosed at fairly close range this torpedo was fired because it was considered very unlikely that the ship would escape disablement before another opportunity offered but still they livedthree destroyers against all a battlecruiser fleets quickfirers as well as the fire of a batch of enemy destroyers at 600 yards and they were thankful for small mercies the position being favourable a third torpedo was fired from each while they yet floated  at 2500 yards one destroyer was hit somewhere in the vitals and swerved badly across her next astern who was obliged to alter course to avoid a collision thereby failing to fire a fourth torpedo then that next astern observed signal for destroyers recall and went back to report to her flotilla captainalone of her two companions one was badly hit and remained stopped between the lines the other remained stopped but was afloat when last seen ships that remain stopped are liable to be rammed or sunk by methodical gunfire that was perhaps fifty minutes work put in before there was any really vicious edge to the action and it did not steady the nerves of the enemy battlecruisers any more than another attack made by another detachment of ours  what does one do when one passes a ship that remains stopped i asked of a youth who had had experience  nothing special they cheer and you cheer back one doesnt think about it till afterwards you see it may be your luck in another minute   luck  there were many other torpedo attacks in all parts of the battle that misty afternoon including a quaint episode of an enemy light cruiser who looked as if she were trying to torpedo one of our battlecruisers while the latter was particularly engaged a destroyer of ours returning from a special job which required delicacy was picking her way back at 30 knots through batches of enemy battlecruisers and light cruisers with the idea of attaching herself to the nearest destroyerflotilla and making herself useful it occurred to her that as she was in a most advantageous position for repelling enemys destroyers endeavouring to attack she could not do better than to remain on the engaged bow of our battlecruiser so she remained and considered things  there was an enemy battlecruiser squadron in the offing with several enemy light cruisers ahead of that squadron and the weather was thickish and deceptive she sighted the enemy light cruiser class uncertain only a few thousand yards away and decided to attack her in order to frustrate her firing torpedoes at our battle fleet this in case the authorities should think that light cruiser wished to buy rubber so she fell upon the light cruiser with every gun she had at between two and four thousand yards and secured a number of hits just the same as at target practice while thus occupied she sighted out of the mist a squadron of enemy battlecruisers that had worried her earlier in the afternoon leaving the light cruiser she closed to what she considered a reasonable distance of the newcomers and let them have as she thought both her torpedoes she possessed an active acting sublieutenant who though officers of that rank think otherwise is not very far removed from an ordinary midshipman of the type one sees in tow of relatives at the army and navy stores he sat astride one of the tubes to make quite sure things were in order and fired when the sights came on  but at that very moment a big shell hit the destroyer on the side and there was a tremendous escape of steam believingsince she had seen one torpedo leave the tube before the smash camebelieving that both her tubes had been fired the destroyer turned away at greatly reduced speed the shell reduced it and passed quite reasonably close the light cruiser whom she had been hammering so faithfully till the larger game appeared meantime the sublieutenant was exploring what damage had been done by the big shell he discovered that only one of the two torpedoes had left the tubes and observing enemy light cruiser beam on and apparently temporarily stopped he fired the providential remainder at her and it hit her below the conningtower and well and truly exploded as was witnessed by the sublieutenant himself the commander a leading signalman and several other ratings luck continued to hold the acting sublieutenant further reported that we still had three torpedoes left and at the same time drew my attention to enemys line of battleships they rather looked as if they were coming down with intent to assault so the sublieutenant fired the rest of the torpedoes which at least started off correctly from the shellshaken tubes and must have crossed the enemys line when torpedoes turn up among a squadron they upset the steering and distract the attention of all concerned then the destroyer judged it time to take stock of her injuries among other minor defects she could neither steam steer nor signal   towing under difficulties  mark how virtue is rewarded another of our destroyers an hour or so previously had been knocked clean out of action before she had done anything by a big shell which gutted a boilerroom and started an oil fire that is the drawback to oil she crawled out between the battleships till she reached an area of comparative calm and repaired damage she says the fire having been dealt with it was found a mat kept the stokehold dry my only trouble now being lack of speed i looked round for useful employment and saw a destroyer in great difficulties so closed her that destroyer was our paralytic friend of the intermittent torpedotubes and a grateful ship she was when her crippled sister but still good for a few knots offered her a tow under very trying conditions with large enemy ships approaching so the two set off together cripple and paralytic with heavy shells falling round them as sociable as a couple of lame hounds cripple worked up to 12 knots and the weather grew vile and the tow parted paralytic by this time had raised steam in a boiler or two and made shift to get along slowly on her own cripple hirpling beside her till paralytic could not make any more headway in that rising sea and cripple had to tow her once more once more the tow parted so they tied paralytic up rudely and effectively with a cable round her after bollards and gun presumably because of strained forward bulkheads and hauled her sternfirst through heavy seas at continually reduced speeds doubtful of their position unable to sound because of the seas and much pestered by a wind which backed without warning till at last they made land and turned into the hospital appointed for brave wounded ships everybody speaks well of cripple her name crops up in several reports with such compliments as the men of the sea use when they see good work she herself speaks well of her lieutenant who as executive officer took charge of the fire and towing arrangements in a very creditable manner and also of tom battye and thomas kerr engineroom artificer and stoker petty officer who were in the stokehold at the time of the shell striking and performed cool and prompt decisive action although both suffering from shock and slight injuries   useful employment  have you ever noticed that men who do homeric deeds often describe them in homeric language the sentence i looked round for useful employment is worthy of ulysses when there was an evil sound at the ships of men who perished and of the ships themselves broken at the same time  roughly very roughly speaking our destroyers enjoyed three phases of prompt decisive actionthe first a period of daylight attacks from 4 to 6 pm such as the one i have just described while the battle was young and the light fairly good on the afternoon of may 31 the second towards dark when the light had lessened and the enemy were more uneasy and i think in more scattered formation the third when darkness had fallen and the destroyers had been strung out astern with orders to help the enemy home which they did all night as opportunity offered one cannot say whether the day or the night work was the more desperate from private advices the young gentlemen concerned seem to have functioned with efficiency either way as one of them said after a bit you see we were all pretty much on our own and you could really find out what your ship could do  i will tell you later of a piece of night work not without merit     ii  the night hunt  ramming an enemy cruiser   as i said we will confine ourselves to something quite sane and simple which does not involve more than halfadozen different reports  when the german fleet ran for home on the night of may 31 it seems to have scatteredstarred i believe is the word for the evolutionin a general sauve qui peut while the devil livelily represented by our destroyers took the hindmost our flotillas were strung out far and wide on this job one man compared it to hounds hunting half a hundred separate foxes  i take the adventures of several couples of destroyers who on the night of may 31 were nosing along somewhere towards the schleswigholstein coast ready to chop any hunstuff coming back to earth by that particular road the leader of one line was gehenna and the next two ships astern of her were eblis and shaitan in the order given there were others of course but with the exception of one goblin they dont come violently into this tale there had been a good deal of promiscuous firing that evening and actions were going on all round towards midnight our destroyers were overtaken by several threeand fourfunnel german ships cruisers they thought hurrying home at this stage of the game anybody might have been anybodypursuer or pursued the germans took no chances but switched on their searchlights and opened fire on gehenna her acting sublieutenant reports a salvo hit us forward i opened fire with the afterguns a shell then struck us in a steampipe and i could see nothing but steam but both starboard torpedotubes were fired  eblis gehennas next astern at once fired a torpedo at the second ship in the german line a fourfunnelled cruiser and hit her between the second funnel and the mainmast when she appeared to catch fire fore and aft simultaneously heeled right over to starboard and undoubtedly sank eblis loosed off a second torpedo and turned aside to reload firing at the same time to distract the enemys attention from gehenna who was now ablaze fore and aft gehennas acting sublieutenant the only executive officer who survived says that by the time the steam from the broken pipe cleared he found gehenna stopped nearly everybody amidships killed or wounded the cartridgeboxes round the guns exploding one after the other as the fires took hold and the enemy not to be seen three minutes or less did all that damage eblis had nearly finished reloading when a shot struck the davit that was swinging her last torpedo into the tube and wounded all hands concerned thereupon she dropped torpedo work fired at an enemy searchlight which winked and went out and was closing in to help gehenna when she found herself under the noses of a couple of enemy cruisers the nearer one he says altered course to ram me apparently the senior service writes in curiously lawyerlike fashion but there is no denying that they act quite directly i therefore put my helm hard aport and the two ships met and rammed each other port bow to port bow there could have been no time to think and for ebliss commander on the bridge none to gather information but he had observant subordinates and he writesand i would humbly suggest that the words be made the ships motto for evermorehe writes those aft noted that the enemy cruiser had certain marks on her funnel and certain arrangements of derricks on each side which quite apart from the evidence she left behind her betrayed her class eblis and she met says eblis i consider i must have considerably damaged this cruiser as 20 feet of her side plating was left in my focsle twenty feet of ragged rivetslinging steel razoring and reaping about in the dark on a focsle that had collapsed like a concertina it was very fair plating too there were sidescuttle holes in itwhat we passengers would call portholes but it might have been better for eblis reports sorrowfully by the thickness of the coats of paint duly given in 32nds of the inch she would not appear to have been a very new ship   a fugitive on fire  new or old the enemy had done her best she had completely demolished ebliss bridge and searchlight platform brought down the mast and the forefunnel ruined the whaler and the dinghy split the focsle open above water from the stem to the galley which is abaft the bridge and below water had opened it up from the stem to the second bulkhead she had further ripped off ebliss skinplating for an amazing number of yards on one side of her and had fired a couple of largecalibre shells into eblis at pointblank range narrowly missing her vitals even so eblis is as impartial as a prizecourt she reports that the second shot a trifle of eight inches may have been fired at a different time or just after colliding but the night was yet young and just after getting clear of this cruiser an enemy battlecruiser grazed past our stern at high speed and again the judgmatic mindi think she must have intended to ram us she was a large threefunnelled thing her centre funnel shot away and lights were flickering under her focsle as if she was on fire forward fancy the vision of her hurtling out of the dark redlighted from within and fleeing on like a man with his throat cut  as an interlude all enemy cruisers that night were not keen on ramming they wanted to get home a man i know who was on another part of the drive saw a covey bolt through our destroyers and had just settled himself for a shot at one of them when the night threw up a second bird coming down full speed on his other beam he had bare time to jink between the two as they whizzed past one switched on her searchlight and fired a whole salvo at him point blank the heavy stuff went between his funnels she must have sighted along her own beam of light which was about a thousand yards  how did you feel i asked  i was rather sick it was my best chance all that night and i had to miss it or be cut in two  what happened to the cruisers  oh they went on and i heard em being attended to by some of our fellows they didnt know what they were doing or they couldnt have missed me sitting the way they did   the confidential books  after all that eblis picked herself up and discovered that she was still alive with a dogs chance of getting to port but she did not bank on it that grand slam had wrecked the bridge pinning the commander under the wreckage by the time he had extricated himself he considered it advisable to throw overboard the steel chest and dispatchbox of confidential and secret books these are never allowed to fall into strange hands and their proper disposal is the last step but one in the ritual of the burial service of his majestys ships at sea gehenna afire and sinking out somewhere in the dark was going through it on her own account this is her acting sublieutenants report the confidential books were got up the first lieutenant gave the order every man aft and the confidential books were thrown overboard the ship soon afterwards heeled over to starboard and the bows went under the first lieutenant gave the order everybody for themselves the ship sank in about a minute the stern going straight up into the air  but it was not written in the book of fate that stripped and battered eblis should die that night as gehenna died after the burial of the books it was found that the several fires on her were manageable that she was not making water aft of the damage which meant twothirds of her were more or less in commission and best of all that three boilers were usable in spite of the cruisers shells so she shaped course and speed to make the least water and the most progress towards land on the way back the wind shifted eight points without warningit was this shift if you remember that so embarrassed cripple and paralytic on their homeward crawland what with one thing and another eblis was unable to make port till the scandalously late hour of noon on june 2 the mutual ramming having occurred about 1140 pm on may 31 she says this time without any legal reservation whatever i cannot speak too highly of the courage discipline and devotion of the officers and ships company  her recommendations are a compendium of godly deeds for the use of mariners they cover pretty much all that man may be expected to do there was as there always is a first lieutenant who while his commander was being extricated from the bridge wreckage took charge of affairs and steered the ship first from the engineroom or what remained of it and later from aft and otherwise manoeuvred as requisite among doubtful bulkheads in his leisure he improvised means of signalling and if there be not one joyous story behind that smooth sentence i am a hun   the art of improvising  they all improvised like the masters of craft they were the chief engineroom artificer after he had helped to put out fires improvised stops to the gaps which were left by the carrying away of the forward funnel and mast he got and kept up steam to a much higher point than would have appeared at all possible and when the sea rose as it always does if you are in trouble he improvised pumping and drainage arrangements thus allowing the ship to steam at a good speed on the whole there could not have been more than 40 feet of hole  the surgeona probationerperformed an amputation singlehanded in the wreckage by the bridge and by his wonderful skill resource and unceasing care and devotion undoubtedly saved the lives of the many seriously wounded men that no horror might be lacking there was a short circuit among the bridge wreckage for a considerable time the searchlight and wireless were tangled up together and the electricity leaked into everything  there were also three wise men who saved the ship whose names must not be forgotten they were chief engineroom artificer lee stoker petty officer gardiner and stoker elvins when the funnel carried away it was touch and go whether the foremost boiler would not explode these three put on respirators and kept the fans going till all fumes etc were cleared away to each man you will observe his own particular hell which he entered of his own particular initiative  lastly there were the two remaining quartermastersmutinous dogs both of emone wounded in the right hand and the other in the left who took the wheel between them all the way home thus improvising one complete navypattern quartermaster and refused to be relieved during the whole thirtysix hours before the ship returned to port so eblis passes out of the picture with never a moan or complaint from a single wounded man and in spite of the rough weather of june 1st they all remained cheery they had one hun cruiser torpedoed to their credit and strong evidence abroad that they had knocked the end out of another  but gehenna went down and those of her crew who remained hung on to the rafts that destroyers carry till they were picked up about the dawn by shaitan third in the line who at that hour was in no shape to give much help here is shaitans tale she saw the unknown cruisers overtake the flotilla saw their leader switch on searchlights and open fire as she drew abreast of gehenna and at once fired a torpedo at the third german ship shaitan could not see eblis her next ahead for as we know eblis after firing her torpedoes had hauled off to reload when the enemy switched his searchlights off shaitan hauled out too it is not wholesome for destroyers to keep on the same course within a thousand yards of big enemy cruisers  she picked up a destroyer of another division goblin who for the moment had not been caught by the enemys searchlights and had profited by this decent obscurity to fire a torpedo at the hindmost of the cruisers almost as shaitan took station behind goblin the latter was lighted up by a large ship and heavily fired at the enemy fled but she left goblin out of control with a grisly list of casualties and her helm jammed goblin swerved returned and swerved again shaitan astern tried to clear her and the two fell aboard each other goblins bows deep in shaitans forebridge while they hung thus locked an unknown destroyer rammed shaitan aft cutting off several feet of her stern and leaving her rudder jammed hard over as complete a mess as the personal devil himself could have devised and all due to the merest accident of a few panicky salvoes presently the two ships worked clear in a smother of steam and oil and went their several ways quite a while after she had parted from shaitan goblin discovered several of shaitans people some of them wounded on her own focsle where they had been pitched by the collision goblin working her way homeward on such boilers as remained carried on a onegun fight at a few cables distance with some enemy destroyers who not knowing what state she was in sheered off after a few rounds shaitan holed forward and opened up aft came across the survivors from gehenna clinging to their raft and took them aboard then some of our destroyersthey were thick on the sea that nighttried to tow her sternfirst for goblin had cut her up badly forward but since shaitan lacked any stern and her rudder was jammed hard across where the stern should have been the hawsers parted and after leave asked of lawful authority across all that waste of waters they sank shaitan by gunfire having first taken all the proper steps about the confidential books yet shaitan had had her little crumb of comfort ere the end while she lay crippled she saw quite close to her a german cruiser that was trailing homeward in the dawn gradually heel over and sink  this completes my version of the various accounts of the four destroyers directly concerned for a few hours on one minute section of one wing of our battle other ships witnessed other aspects of the agony and duly noted them as they went about their business one of our battleships for instance made out by the glare of burning gehenna that the supposed cruiser that eblis torpedoed was a german battleship of a certain class so gehenna did not die in vain and we may take it that the discovery did not unduly depress ebliss wounded in hospital   asking for trouble  the rest of the flotilla that the four destroyers belonged to had their own adventures later one of them chasing or being chased saw goblin out of control just before goblin and shaitan locked and narrowly escaped adding herself to that triple collision another loosed a couple of torpedoes at the enemy ships who were attacking gehenna which perhaps accounts for the anxiety of the enemy to break away from that hornets nest as soon as possible half a dozen or so of them ran into four german battleships which they set about torpedoing at ranges varying from half a mile to a mile and a half it was asking for trouble and they got it but they got in return at least one big ship and the same observant battleship of ours who identified ebliss bird reported three satisfactory explosions in half an hour followed by a glare that lit up all the sky one of the flotilla closing on what she thought was the smoke of a sister in difficulties found herself well in among the four battleships it was too late to get away she says so she attacked fired her torpedo was caught up in the glare of a couple of searchlights and pounded to pieces in five minutes not even her rafts being left she went down with her colours flying having fought to the last available gun  another destroyer who had borne a hand in gehennas trouble had her try at the four battleships and got in a torpedo at 800 yards she saw it explode and the ship take a heavy list then i was chased which is not surprising she picked up a friend who could only do 20 knots they sighted several hun destroyers who fled from them then dropped on to four hun destroyers all together who made great parade of commencing action but soon afterwards thought better of it and turned away so you see in that flotilla alone there was every variety of fight from the ordered attacks of squadrons under control to single ship affairs every turn of which depended on the seconds decision of the men concerned endurance to the hopeless end bluff and cunning reckless advance and redhot flight clear vision and as much of blank bewilderment as the senior service permits its children to indulge in that is not much when a destroyer who has been dodging enemy torpedoes and gunfire in the dark realises about midnight that she is following a strange british flotilla having lost sight of my own she decides to remain with them and shares their fortunes and whatever language is going  if lost hounds could speak when they cast up next day after an unchecked night among the wild life of the dark they would talk much as our destroyers do      the doorkeepers of zion       they do not always stand     in helmet and whole armour       with halberds in their hand     but being sure of zion       and all her mysteries     they rest awhile in zion     sit down and smile in zion     ay even jest in zion       in zion at their ease      the gatekeepers of baal       they dare not sit or lean     but fume and fret and posture       and foam and curse between     for being bound to baal       whose sacrifice is vain     their rest is scant with baal     they glare and pant for baal     they mouth and rant for baal       for baal in their pain      but we will go to zion       by choice and not through dread     with these our present comrades       and those our present dead     and being free of zion       in both her fellowships     sit down and sup in zion     stand up and drink in zion     whatever cup in zion       is offered to our lips     iii  the meaning of joss  a young officers letter   as one digs deeper into the records one sees the various temperaments of men revealing themselves through all the formal wording one commander may be an expert in torpedowork whose first care is how and where his shots went and whether under all circumstances of pace light and angle the best had been achieved destroyers do not carry unlimited stocks of torpedoes it rests with commanders whether they shall spend with a free hand at first or save for nightwork aheadrisk a possible while he is yet afloat or hang on coldly for a certainty so in the old whaling days did the harponeer bring up or back off his boat till some shift of the great fishs bulk gave him sure opening at the deepseated life  and then comes the question of private judgment i thought soandso would happen therefore i did thus and thus things may or may not turn out as anticipated but that is merely another of the million chances of the sea take a case in point a flotilla of our destroyers sighted six there had been eight the previous afternoon german battleships of kingly and imperial caste very early in the morning of the 1st june and duly attacked at first our people ran parallel to the enemy then as far as one can make out headed them and swept round sharp to the left firing torpedoes from their port or lefthand tubes between them they hit a battleship which went up in flame and débris but one of the flotilla had not turned with the rest she had anticipated that the attack would be made on another quarter and for certain technical reasons she was not ready when she was she turned and singlehandedthe rest of the flotilla having finished and gone oncarried out two attacks on the five remaining battleships she got one of them amidships causing a terrific explosion and flame above the masthead which signifies that the magazine has been touched off she counted the battleships when the smoke had cleared and there were but four of them she herself was not hit though shots fell close she went her way and seeing nothing of her sisters picked up another flotilla and stayed with it till the end do i make clear the maze of blind hazard and wary judgment in which our men of the sea must move   saved by a smoke screen  some of the original flotilla were chased and headed about by cruisers after their attack on the six battleships and a single shell from battleship or cruiser reduced one of them to such a condition that she was brought home by her sublieutenant and a midshipman her captain first lieutenant gunner torpedo coxswain and both signalmen were either killed or wounded the bridge with charts instruments and signalling gear went all torpedoes were expended a gun was out of action and the usual cordite fires developed luckily the engines were workable she escaped under cover of a smokescreen which is an unbearably filthy outpouring of the densest smoke made by increasing the proportion of oil to air in the furnacefeed it rolls forth from the funnels looking solid enough to sit upon spreads in a searchlightproof pat of impenetrable beastliness and in still weather hangs for hours but it saved that ship  it is curious to note the subdued tone of a boys report when by some accident of slaughter he is raised to command there are certain formalities which every ship must comply with on entering certain ports no fullystriped commander would trouble to detail them any more than he would the aspect of his club porter the young un puts it all down as who should say i rang the bell wiped my feet on the mat and asked if they were at home he is most careful of the port proprieties and since he will be sub again tomorrow and all his equals will tell him exactly how he ought to have handled her he almost apologises for the steps he tookdeeds which ashore might be called cool or daring  the senior service does not gush there are certain formulae appropriate to every occasion one of our destroyers who was knocked out early in the day and lay helpless was sighted by several of her companions one of them reported her to the authorities but being busy at the time said he did not think himself justified in hampering himself with a disabled ship in the middle of an action it was not as if she was sinking either she was only holed foreward and aft with a bad hit in the engineroom and her steeringgear knocked out in this posture she cheered the passing ships and set about repairing her hurts with good heart and a smiling countenance she managed to get under some sort of way at midnight and next day was taken in tow by a friend she says officially his assistance was invaluable as i had no oil left and met heavy weather  what actually happened was much less formal fleet destroyers as a rule do not worry about navigation they take their orders from the flagship and range out and return on signal like sheepdogs whose fixed point is their shepherd consequently when they break loose on their own they may fetch up rather doubtful of their whereaboutsas this injured one did after she had been so kindly taken in tow she inquired of her friend message captain to captainhave you any notion where we are the friend replied i have not but i will find out so the friend waited on the sun with the necessary implements which luckily had not been smashed and in due time made our observed position at this hour is thus and thus the tow irreverently is it didnt know you were a navigator the friend with hauteur yes its rather a hobby of mine the tow had no idea it was as bad as all that but im afraid ill have to trust you this time go ahead and be quick about it they reached a port correctly enough but to this hour the tow having studied with the friend at a place called dartmouth insists that it was pure joss   concerning joss  and joss which is luck fortune destiny the irony of fate or nemesis is the greatest of all the battlegods that move on the waters as i will show you later knowledge of gunnery and a delicate instinct for what is in the enemys minds may enable a destroyer to thread her way slowing speeding and twisting between the heavy salvoes of opposing fleets as the danksmelling waterspouts rise and break she judges where the next grove of them will sprout if her judgment is correct she may enter it in her report as a little feather in her cap but it is joss when the stray 12inch shell hurled by a giant at some giant ten miles away falls on her from heaven and wipes out her and her profound calculations this was seen to happen to a hun destroyer in midattack while she was being laboriously dealt with by a 4inch gun something immense took her andshe was not  joss it is too when the cruisers 8inch shot that should have raked out your innards from the forward boiler to the wardroom stove deflects miraculously like a twig dragged through deep water and almost returning on its track skips off unbursten and leaves you reprieved by the breadth of a nail from three deaths in one later a single splinter no more may cut your oilsupply pipes as dreadfully and completely as a broken windscreen in a collision cuts the surprised motorists throat then you must lie useless fighting oilfires while the precious fuel gutters away till you have to ask leave to escape while there are yet a few tons left one ship who was once bled white by such a piece of joss suggested it would be better that oilpipes should be led along certain lines which she sketched as if that would make any difference to joss when he wants to show what he can do  our seapeople who have worked with him for a thousand wettish years have acquired something of josss large toleration and humour he causes ships in thick weather or under strain to mistake friends for enemies at such times if your heart is full of highly organised hate you strafe frightfully and efficiently till one of you perishes and the survivor reports wonders which are duly wirelessed all over the world but if you worship joss you reflect you put two and two together in a casual insular way and arrivesometimes both parties arriveat instinctive conclusions which avoid trouble   an affair in the north sea  witness this tale it does not concern the jutland fight but another little affair which took place a while ago in the north sea it was understood that a certain type of cruiser of ours would not be taking part in a certain show therefore if anyone saw cruisers very like them he might blaze at them with a clear conscience for they would be hunboats and one of our destroyersthick weather as usualspied the silhouettes of cruisers exactly like our own stealing across the haze said the commander to his sub with an inflection neither period exclamation nor interrogationmark can renderthatisthem  said the sub in precisely the same tonethat is them sir as my sub said the commander your observation is strictly in accord with the traditions of the service now as man to man what are they weel said the sub since you put it that way im dd if id fire and they didnt and they were quite right the destroyer had been off on another job and joss had jammed the latest wireless orders to her at the last moment but joss had also put it into the hearts of the boys to save themselves and others  i hold no brief for the hun but honestly i think he has not lied as much about the jutland fight as people believe and that when he protests he sank a ship he did very completely sink a ship i am the more confirmed in this belief by a still small voice among the jutland reports musing aloud over an account of an unaccountable outlying brawl witnessed by one of our destroyers the voice suggests that what the destroyer saw was one german ship being sunk by another amen  our destroyers saw a good deal that night on the face of the waters some of them who were working in areas of comparative calm submit charts of their tangled courses all studded with notes along the zigzagsomething like this  8 pmheard explosion to the nw a neat arrowhead points that way half an inch farther along a short change of course and the word hit explains the meaning ofsighted enemy cruiser engaged with destroyers another twist follows 930 pmpassed wreckage engaged enemy destroyers port beam opposite courses a long straight line without incident then a tangle andpicked up survivors soandso a stretch over to some ship that they were transferred to a fresh departure and another brush with single destroyer on parallel course hit 07 ampassed bows enemy cruiser sticking up 018joined flotilla for attack on battleship squadron so it runs onone little ship in a few short hours passing through more wonders of peril and accident than all the old fleets ever dreamed   a childs letter  in years to come naval experts will collate all those diagrams and furiously argue over them a lot of the destroyer work was inevitably as mixed as bombing down a trench as the scuffle of a polo match or as the hot heaving heart of a football scrum it is difficult to realise when one considers the size of the sea that it is that very size and absence of boundary which helps the confusion to give an idea here is a letter it has been quoted before i believe but it is good enough to repeat many times from a nineteenyearold child to his friend aged seventeen and minus one leg in a hospital  im so awfully sorry you werent in it it was rather terrible but a wonderful experience and i wouldnt have missed it for anything but by jove it isnt a thing one wants to make a habit of  i must say it is very different from what i expected i expected to be excited but was not a bit its hard to express what we did feel like but you know the sort of feeling one has when one goes in to bat at cricket and rather a lot depends upon your doing well and you are waiting for the first ball well its very much the same as that do you know what i mean a sort of tense feeling not quite knowing what to expect one does not feel the slightest bit frightened and the idea that theres a chance of you and your ship being scuppered does not enter ones head there are too many other things to think about  follows the usual no ship like our ship talkee and a note of where she was at the time  then they ordered us to attack so we bustled off full bore being navigator also having control of all the guns i was on the bridge all the time and remained for twelve hours without leaving it at all when we got fairly close i sighted a goodlooking hun destroyer which i thought id like to strafe you know its awful fun to know that you can blaze off at a real ship and do as much damage as you like well id just got their range on the guns and wed just fired one round when some more of our destroyers coming from the opposite direction got between us and the enemy and completely blanketed us so we had to stop which was rather rot shortly afterwards they recalled us so we bustled back again how any destroyer got out of it is perfectly wonderful  literally there were hundreds of progs shells falling all round us from a 15inch to a 4inch and you know what a big splash a 15inch bursting in the water does make we got washed through by the spray just as we were getting back a whole salvo of big shells fell just in front of us and short of our big ships the skipper and i did rapid calculations as to how long it would take them to reload fire again time of flight etc as we had to go right through the spot we came to the conclusion that as they were short a bit they would probably go up a bit and they didnt but luckily they altered deflection and the next fell right astern of us anyhow we managed to come out of that row without the ship or a man on board being touched   what the big ships stand  its extraordinary the amount of knocking about the big ships can stand one saw them hit and they seemed to be one mass of flame and smoke and you think theyre gone but when the smoke clears away they are apparently none the worse and still firing away but to see a ship blow up is a terrible and wonderful sight an enormous volume of flame and smoke almost 200 feet high and great pieces of metal etc blown skyhigh and then when the smoke clears not a sign of the ship we saw one other extraordinary sight of course you know the north sea is very shallow we came across a hun cruiser absolutely on end his stern on the bottom and his bow sticking up about 30 feet in the water and a little farther on a destroyer in precisely the same position  i couldnt be certain but i rather think i saw your old ship crashing along and blazing away but i expect you have heard from some of your pals but the night was far and away the worse time of all it was pitch dark and of course absolutely no lights and the firing seems so much more at night as you could see the flashes lighting up the sky and it seemed to make much more noise and you could see ships on fire and blowing up of course we showed absolutely no lights one expected to be surprised any moment and eventually we were we suddenly found ourselves within 1000 yards of two or three big hun cruisers they switched on their searchlights and started firing like nothing on earth then they put their searchlights on us but for some extraordinary reason did not fire on us as of course we were going full speed we lost them in a moment but i must say that i and i think everybody else thought that that was the end but one does not feel afraid or panicky i think i felt rather cooler then than at any other time i asked lots of people afterwards what they felt like and they all said the same thing it all happens in a few seconds one hasnt time to think but never in all my life have i been so thankful to see daylight againand i dont think i ever want to see another night like thatits such an awful strain one does not notice it at the time but its the reaction afterwards  i never noticed i was tired till i got back to harbour and then we all turned in and absolutely slept like logs we were seventytwo hours with little or no sleep the skipper was perfectly wonderful he never left the bridge for a minute for twentyfour hours and was on the bridge or in the charthouse the whole time we were out the charthouse is an airy dogkennel that opens off the bridge and ive never seen anybody so cool and unruffled he stood there smoking his pipe as if nothing out of the ordinary were happening  one quite forgot all about time i was relieved at 4 am and on looking at my watch found i had been up there nearly twelve hours and then discovered i was rather hungry the skipper and i had some cheese and biscuits ham sandwiches and water on the bridge and then i went down and brewed some cocoa and ships biscuit      not in the thick of the fight       not in the press of the odds     do the heroes come to their height       or we know the demigods      that stands over till peace       we can only perceive     men returned from the seas       very grateful for leave      they grant us sudden days       snatched from their business of war     we are too close to appraise       what manner of men they are      and whether their names go down       with agekept victories     or whether they battle and drown       unreckoned is hid from our eyes      they are too near to be great       but our children shall understand     when and how our fate       was changed and by whose hand      our children shall measure their worth       we are content to be blind     for we know that we walk on a newborn earth       with the saviours of mankind     iv  the minds of men  how it is done   what mystery is there like the mystery of the other mans jobor what world so cut off as that which he enters when he goes to it the eminent surgeon is altogether such an one as ourselves even till his hand falls on the knob of the theatre door after that in the silence among the ether fumes no man except his acolytes and they wont tell has ever seen his face so with the unconsidered curate yet before the war he had more experience of the business and detail of death than any of the people who contemned him his face also as he stands his bedsidewatchesthat countenance with which he shall justify himself to his makernone have ever looked upon even the ditcher is a priest of mysteries at the high moment when he lays out in his mind his levels and the fall of the water that he alone can draw off clearly but catch any of these men five minutes after they have left their altars and you will find the doors are shut  chance sent me almost immediately after the jutland fight a lieutenant of one of the destroyers engaged among other matters i asked him if there was any particular noise  well i havent been in the trenches of course he replied but i dont think there could have been much more noise than there was  this bears out a report of a destroyer who could not be certain whether an enemy battleship had blown up or not saying that in that particular corner it would have been impossible to identify anything less than the explosion of a whole magazine  it wasnt exactly noise he reflected noise is what you take in from outside this was inside you it seemed to lift you right out of everything  and how did the light affect one i asked trying to work out a theory that noise and light produced beyond known endurance form an unknown anaesthetic and stimulant comparable to but infinitely more potent than the soothing effect of the smokepall of ancient battles  the lights were rather curious was the answer i dont know that one noticed searchlights particularly unless they meant business but when a lot of big guns loosed off together the whole sea was lit up and you could see our destroyers running about like cockroaches on a tin soupplate  then is black the best colour for our destroyers some commanders seem to think we ought to use grey  blessed if i know said young dante everything shows black in that light then it all goes out again with a bang trying for the eyes if you are spotting   ship dogs  and how did the dogs take it i pursued there are several destroyers more or less owned by pet dogs who start life as the chancefound property of a stoker and end in supreme command of the bridge  most of em didnt like it a bit they went below one time and wanted to be loved they knew it wasnt ordinary practice  what did arabella do i had heard a good deal of arabella  oh arabellas quite different her job has always been to look after her masters pyjamasfolded up at the head of the bunk you know she found out pretty soon the bridge was no place for a lady so she hopped downstairs and got in you know how she makes three little jumps to itfirst on to the chair then on the flaptable and then up on the pillow when the show was over there she was as usual  was she glad to see her master  raather arabella was the bold gay ladydog then  now arabella is between nine and eleven and a half inches long  does the hun run to pets at all  i shouldnt say so hes an unsympathetic felonthe hun but he might cherish a dachshund or so we never picked up any ships pets off him and im sure we should if there had been  that i believed as implicitly as the tale of a destroyer attack some months ago the object of which was to flush zeppelins it succeeded for the flotilla was attacked by several right in the middle of the flurry a destroyer asked permission to stop and lower dinghy to pick up ships dog which had fallen overboard permission was granted and the dog was duly rescued lord knows what the hun made of it said my informant he was rumbling round dropping bombs and the dinghy was digging out for all she was worth and the dogfiend was swimming for dunkirk it must have looked rather mad from above but they saved the dogfiend and then everybody swore he was a german spy in disguise   the fight  andabout this jutland fight i hinted not for the first time  oh that was just a fight there was more of it than any other fight i suppose but i expect all modern naval actions must be pretty much the same  but what does one dohow does one feel i insisted though i knew it was hopeless  one does ones job things are happening all the time a man may be right under your nose one minuteserving a gun or somethingand the next minute he isnt there  and one notices that at the time  yes but theres no time to keep on noticing it youve got to carry on somehow or other or your show stops i tell you what one does notice though if one goes below for anything or has to pass through a flat somewhere and one sees the old wardroom clock ticking or a photograph pinned up or anything of that sort one notices that oh yes and there was another thingthe way a ship seemed to blow up if you were far off her youd see a glare then a blaze and then the smokemiles high lifting quite slowly then youd get the row and the jar of itjust like bumping over submarines then a long while after praps you run through a regular rain of bits of burnt paper coming down on the deckslike showers of volcanic ash you know the door of the operatingroom seemed just about to open but it shut again  and the huns gunnery  that was various sometimes they began quite well and went to pieces after theyd been strafed a little but sometimes they picked up again there was one hunboat that got no end of a hammering and it seemed to do her gunnery good she improved tremendously till we sank her i expect wed knocked out some scientific hun in the controls and hed been succeeded by a man who knew how  it used to be fritz last year when they spoke of the enemy now it is hun or as i have heard yahun being a superlative of yahoo in the napoleonic wars we called the frenchmen too many names for any one of them to endure but this is the age of standardisation  and what about our lower deck i continued  they oh they carried on as usual it takes a lot to impress the lower deck when theyre busy and he mentioned several little things that confirmed this they had a great deal to do and they did it serenely because they had been trained to carry on under all conditions without panicking what they did in the way of running repairs was even more wonderful if that be possible than their normal routine  the lower deck nowadays is full of strange fish with unlookedfor accomplishments as in the recorded case of two simple seamen of a destroyer who when need was sorest came to the front as trained experts in firstaid  and nowwhat about the actual hun losses at jutland i ventured  youve seen the list havent you  yes but it occurred to methat they might have been a shade underestimated and i thought perhaps  a perfectly plain asbestos firecurtain descended in front of the already locked door it was none of his business to dispute the drive if there were any discrepancies between estimate and results one might be sure that the enemy knew about them which was the chief thing that mattered  it was said he joss that the light was so bad at the hour of the last roundup when our main fleet had come down from the north and shovelled the hun round on his tracks per contra had it been any other kind of weather the odds were the hun would not have ventured so far as it was the huns fleet had come out and gone back again none the better for air and exercise we must be thankful for what we had managed to pick up but talking of picking up there was an instance of almost unparalleled joss which had stuck in his memory a soldierman related to one of the officers in one of our ships that was put down had got five days leave from the trenches which he spent with his relative aboard and thus dropped in for the whole performance he had been employed in helping to spot and had lived up a mast till the ship sank when he stepped off into the water and swam about till he was fished out and put ashore by that time the tale goes his engineroomdried khaki had shrunk halfway up his legs and arms in which costume he reported himself to the war office and pleaded for one little days extension of leave to make himself decent not a bit of it said the war office if you choose to spend your leave playing with sailormen and getting wet all over thats your concern you will return to duty by tonights boat this may be a libel on the wo but it sounds very like them and he had to said the boy but i expect he spent the next week at headquarters telling fat generals all about the fight  and of course the admiralty gave you all lots of leave  us yes heaps we had nothing to do except clean down and oil up and be ready to go to sea again in a few hours  that little fact was brought out at the end of almost every destroyers report having returned to base at such and such a time i took in oil etc and reported ready for sea at  oclock when you think of the amount of work a ship needs even after peace manoeuvres you can realise what has to be done on the heels of an action and as there is nothing like housework for the troubled soul of a woman so a general cleanup is good for sailors i had this from a petty officer who had also passed through deep waters if youve seen your best friend go from alongside you and your own officer and your own boats crew with him and things of that kind a mans best comfort is small variegated jobs which he is damned for continuous   the silent navy  presently my friend of the destroyer went back to his stark desolate life where feelings do not count and the fact of his being cold wet seasick sleepless or dogtired had no bearing whatever on his business which was to turn out at any hour in any weather and do or endure decently according to ritual what that hour and that weather demanded it is hard to reach the kernel of navy minds the unbribable seas and mechanisms they work on and through have given them the simplicity of elements and machines the habit of dealing with swift accident a life of closest and strictest association with their own caste as well as contact with all kinds of men all earth over have added an immense cunning to those qualities and that they are from early youth cut out of all feelings that may come between them and their ends makes them more incomprehensible than jesuits even to their own people what then must they be to the enemy  here is a service which prowls forth and achieves at the lowest something of a victory how farreaching a one only the wars end will reveal it returns in gloomy silence broken by the occasional hoot of the longshore loafer after issuing a bulletin which though it may enlighten the professional mind does not exhilarate the layman meantime the enemy triumphs wirelessly far and wide a few frigid and perfunctoryseeming contradictions are put forward against his resounding claims a naval expert or two is heard talking off the rest is silence anon the enemy after a prodigious amount of explanation which not even the neutrals seem to take any interest in revises his claims and very modestly enlarges his losses still no sign after weeks there appears a document giving our version of the affair which is as colourless detached and scrupulously impartial as the findings of a prizecourt it opines that the list of enemy losses which it submits give the minimum in regard to numbers though it is possibly not entirely accurate in regard to the particular class of vessel especially those that were sunk during the night attacks here the matter rests and remainsjust like our blockade there is an insolence about it all that makes one gasp  yet that insolence springs naturally and unconsciously as an oath out of the same spirit that caused the destroyer to pick up the dog the reports themselves and tenfold more the stories not in the reports are charged with it but no words by any outsider can reproduce just that professional tone and touch a man writing home after the fight points out that the great consolation for not having cleaned up the enemy altogether was that anyhow those east coast devilsa fellowsquadron if you please which up till jutland had had most of the fightingwere not there they missed that show we were as cockahoop as a girl who had been to a dance that her sister has missed  this was one of the figures in that dance  a little british destroyer her midships rent by a great shell meant for a
