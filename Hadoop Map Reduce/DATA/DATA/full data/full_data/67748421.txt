67748421	jeff briggss love story   by bret harte     jeff briggss love story   i   it was raining and blowing at eldridges crossing from the stately pinetrees on the hilltops which were dignifiedly protesting through their rigid spines upward to the hysterical willows in the hollow that had whipped themselves into a maudlin fury there was a general tumult when the wind lulled the rain kept up the distraction firing long volleys across the road letting loose miniature cataracts from the hillsides to brawl in the ditches and beating down the heavy heads of wild oats on the levels when the rain ceased for a moment the wind charged over the already defeated field ruffled the gullies scattered the spray from the roadside pines and added insult to injury but both wind and rain concentrated their energies in a malevolent attempt to utterly disperse and scatter the halfway house which seemed to have wholly lost its way and strayed into the open where dazed and bewildered unprepared and unprotected it was exposed to the taunting fury of the blast a loose shambling disjointed hastily built structurerepresenting the worst features of pioneer renaissanceit rattled its loose windowsashes like chattering teeth banged its illhung shutters and admitted so much of the invading storm that it might have blown up or blown down with equal facility  jefferson briggs proprietor and landlord of the halfway house had just gone through the formality of closing his house for the night hanging dangerously out of the window in the vain attempt to subdue a rebellious shutter that had evidently entered into conspiracy with the invaders and shutting a door as against a sheriffs posse was going to bedi e to read himself asleep as was his custom as he entered his little bedroom in the attic with a highly exciting novel in his pocket and a kerosene lamp in his hand the wind lying in wait for him instantly extinguished his lamp and slammed the door behind him jefferson briggs relighted the lamp as if confidentially in a corner and shielding it in the bosom of his red flannel shirt which gave him the appearance of an illuminated shrine hung a heavy bearskin across the window and then carefully deposited his lamp upon a chair at his bedside this done he kicked off his boots flung them into a corner and rolling himself in a blanket lay down upon the bed a habit of early rising bringing with it presumably the proverbial accompaniment of health wisdom and pecuniary emoluments had also brought with it certain ideas of the effeminacy of separate toilettes and the virtue of readiness  in a few moments he was deep in a chapter  a vague pecking at his dooras of an unseasonable woodpecker finally asserted itself to his consciousness come in he said with his eye still on the page  the door opened to a gaunt figure partly composed of bedquilt and partly of plaid shawl a predominance of the latter and a long wisp of irongray hair determined her sex she leaned against the post with an air of fatigue half moral and half physical  how ye kin lie thar abed jeff and read and smoke on sich a night the sperrit o the lord abroad over the yearthand up stage not gone by yet well well its well thar ez some ez cant sleep  the up coach like as not is stopped by high water on the north fork ten miles away aunty responded jeff keeping to the facts possibly not recognizing the hand of the beneficent creator in the rebellious window shutter he avoided theology  well responded the figure with an air of delivering an unheeded and thankless warning it is not for me to say praps its all his wisdom that some will keep to their own mind its well ez some heznt narves and kin luxuriate in terbacker in the night watches but he says ill come like a thief in the nightlike a thief in the night jeff  totally unable to reconcile this illustration with the delayed pioneer coach and yuba bill its driver jeff lay silent in his own way perhaps he was uneasynot to say shockedat his aunts habitual freedom of scriptural quotation as that good lady herself was with an occasional oath from his lips a fact by the way not generally understood by purveyors of scripture licensed and unlicensed  id take a pull at them bitters aunty said jeff feebly with his wandering eye still recurring to his page theyll do ye a power of good in the way o calmin yer narves  ef i was like some folks i wouldnt want bittersthough made outer the simplest yarbs of the yearth with jest enough sperrit to bring out the vartoosez deacon stoers balm er gilead iswhat yer meaning ef i was like some folks i could lie thar and smoke in the lap o idlenesswith fourteen beds in the house empty and nary lodger for one of em ef i was that indifferent to havin invested my fortin in the good will o this house and not ez much ez a single transient lookin in i could lie down and take comfort in profane literatoor but it aint in me to do it and it wasnt your fathers way jeff neither  as the elder briggss way had been to seek surcease from such trouble at the gambling table and eventually in suicide jeff could not deny it but he did not say that a full realization of his unhappy venture overcame him as he closed the blinds of the hotel that night and that the half desperate idea of abandoning it then and there to the warring elements that had resented his trespass on nature seemed to him an act of simple reason and justice he did not say this for easygoing natures are not apt to explain the processes by which their content or resignation is reached and are therefore supposed to have none keeping to the facts he simply suggested the weather was unfavorable to travelers and again found his place on the page before him fixing it with his thumb he looked up resignedly the figure wearily detached itself from the doorpost and jeffs eyes fell on his book you wont stop aunty he asked mechanically as if reading aloud from the page but she was gone  a little ashamed although much relieved jeff fell back again to literature interrupted only by the charging of the wind and the heavy volleys of rain presently he found himself wondering if a certain banging were really a shutter and then having settled in his mind that it was he was startled by a shout another and in the road before the house  jeff put down the book and marked the place by turning down the leaf being one of that large class of readers whose mental faculties are butterfingered and easily slip their hold then he resumed his boots and was duly caparisoned he extinguished the kerosene lamp and braved the outer air and strong currents of the hall and stairway in the darkness lighting two candles in the barroom he proceeded to unlock the hall door at the same instant a furious blast shook the house the door yielded slightly and impelled a thin meeklooking stranger violently against jeff who still struggled with it  an accident has occurred began the stranger andbut here the wind charged again blew open the door pinned jeff behind it back against the wall overturned the dripping stranger dashed up the staircase and slammed every door in the house ending triumphantly with no 14 and a crash of glass in the window  come rouse up said jeff still struggling with the door rouse up and lend a hand yer  thus abjured the stranger crept along the wall towards jeff and began again we have met with an accident but here another and mightier gust left him speechless covered him with spray of a wildly disorganized waterspout that dangling from the roof seemed to be playing on the front door drove him into black obscurity and again sandwiched his host between the door and the wall then there was a lull and in the midst of it yuba bill driver of the pioneer coach quietly and coolly impervious in waterproof walked into the hall entered the barroom took a candle and going behind the bar selected a bottle critically examined it and returning poured out a quantity of whiskey in a glass and gulped it in a single draught  all this while jeff was closing the door and the meeklooking man was coming into the light again  yuba bill squared his elbows behind him and rested them on the bar crossed his legs easily and awaited them in reply to jeffs inquiring but respectful look he said shortly  oh youre thar are ye  yes bill  well this yer newfangled road o yours is ten feet deep in the hollow with back water from the north fork ive taken that yar coach inter fower feet of it and then i reckoned i couldnt hev any more ill stand on this yer hand sez i i brought the horses up yer and landed em in your barn to eat their blessed heads off till the water goes down thats wots the matter old man and jist about wot i kalkilated on from those durned old improvements o yours  coloring a little at this new count in the general indictment against the uselessness of the halfway house jeff asked if there were any passengers  yuba bill indicated the meek stranger with a jerk of his thumb and his wife and darter in the coach theyre all right and tight ez if they was in the fifth avenue hotel but i reckon he allows to fetch em up yer added bill as if he strongly doubted the wisdom of the transfer  the meek man much meeker for the presence of bill here suggested that such indeed was his wish and further prayed that jeff would accompany him to the coach to assist in bringing them up its rather wet and dark said the man apologetically my daughter is not strong have you such a thing as a waterproof  jeff had not but would a bearskin do  it would  jeff ran tore down his extempore window curtain and returned with it yuba bill who had quietly and disapprovingly surveyed the proceeding here disengaged himself from the bar with evident reluctance  youll want another man he said to jeff onless ye can carry double ez he indicating the stranger ez no sort o use hed better stay here and tend bar while you and me fetch the wimmen off specially ez i reckon weve got to do some tall wadin by this time to reach em  the meek man sat down helplessly in a chair indicated by bill who at once strode after jeff in another moment they were both fighting their way step by step against the storm in that peculiar drunken spasmodic way so amusing to the spectator and so exasperating to the performer it was no time for conversation even interjectional profanity was dangerously exhaustive  the coach was scarcely a thousand yards away but its bright lights were reflected in a sheet of dark silent water that stretched between it and the two men wading and splashing they soon reached it and a gully where the surplus water was pouring into the valley below fower feet o water round her but cant get any higher so ye see shes all right for a month o sich weather inwardly admiring the perspicacity of his companion jeff was about to open the coach door when bill interrupted  ill pack the old woman if youll look arter the darter and enny little traps  a female face anxious and elderly here appeared at the window  thets my little game said bill sotto voce  is there any danger where is my husband asked the woman impatiently  ez to the danger maamthar aint any yer ez safe here ez yed be in a sacramento steamer ez to your husband he allowed i was to come yer and fetch yer up to the hotel thats his lookout with this cheering speech bill proceeded to make two or three ineffectual scoops into the dark interior manifestly with the idea of scooping out the lady in question in another instant he had caught her lifted her gently but firmly in his arms and was turning away  but my childmy daughter shes asleepexpostulated the woman but bill was already swiftly splashing through the darkness jeff left to himself hastily examined the coach on the back seat a slight small figure enveloped in a shawl lay motionless jeff threw the bearskin over it gently lifted it on one arm and gathering a few travelling bags and baskets with the other prepared to follow his quickly disappearing leader a few feet from the coach the water appeared to deepen and the bearskin to draggle jeff drew the figure up higher in vain  sis he said softly  no reply  sis shaking her gently  there was a slight movement within the wrappings  couldnt ye climb up on my shoulder honey thats a good child  there were one or two spasmodic jerks of the bearskin and aided by jeff the bundle was presently seated on his shoulder  are you all right now sis  something like a laugh came from the bearskin then a childish voice said thank you i think i am  aint you afraid youll fall off  a little  jeff hesitated it was beginning to blow again  you couldnt reach down and put your arm round my neck could ye honey  i am afraid notalthough there was a slight attempt to do so  no  no  well then take a good holt a firm strong holt o my hair dont be afraid  a small hand timidly began to rummage in jeffs thick curls  take a firm holt thar just back o my neck thats right  the little hand closed over half a dozen curls the little figure shook and giggled  now dont you see honey if im keerless with you and dont keep you plump level up thar you jist give me a pull and fetch me up all standing  i see  of course you do thats because youre a little lady  jeff strode on it was pleasant to feel the soft warm fingers in his hair pleasant to hear the faint childish voice pleasant to draw the feet of the enwrapped figure against his broad breast altogether he was sorry when they reached the dry land and the lee of the halfway house where a slight movement of the figure expressed a wish to dismount  not yet missy said jeff not yet youll get blown away sure and then whatll they say no honey ill take you right in to your papa just as ye are  a few steps more and jeff strode into the hall made his way to the sittingroom walked to the sofa and deposited his burden the bearskin fell back the shawl fell back and jefffell back too for before him lay a small slight but beautiful and perfectly formed woman  he had time to see that the meek man no longer meek but apparently a stern uncompromising parent was standing at the head of the sofa that the elderly and nervous female was hovering at the foot that his aunt with every symptom of religious and moral disapproval of his conduct sat rigidly in one of the rigid chairshe had time to see all this before the quick hot blood flying to his face sent the water into his eyes and he could see nothing  the cause of all this smileda dazzling smile though a faint onethat momentarily lit up the austere gloom of the room and its occupants you must thank this gentleman papa said she languidly turning to her father for his kindness and his trouble he has carried me here as gently and as carefully as if i were a child seeing symptoms of a return of jeffs distress in his coloring face she added softly as if to herself its a great thing to be stronga greater thing to be strong and gentle  the voice thrilled through jeff but into this dangerous human voice twanged the accents of special spiritual revelation and called him to himself again be ye wise as sarpints but harmless as duvs said jeffs aunt generally and let em be thankful ez doesnt aboos the strenth the lord gives em but be allers ready to answer for it at the bar o their maker possibly some suggestion in her figure of speech reminded her of jeffs forgotten duties so she added in the same breath and tone especially when transient customers is waiting for their licker and yuba bill hammerin on the counter with his glass and yer ye stand jeff never even takin up that wet barskinenuff to give that young woman her death  stammering out an incoherent apology addressed vaguely to the occupants of the room but looking toward the languid goddess on the sofa jeff seized the bearskin and backed out the door then he flew to his room with it and then returned to the barroom but the impatient william of yuba had characteristically helped himself and gone off to the stable then jeff stole into the hall and halted before the closed door of the sittingroom a bold idea of going in again as became a landlord of the halfway house with an inquiry if they wished anything further had seized him but the remembrance that he had always meekly allowed that duty to devolve upon his aunt and that she would probably resent it with scriptural authority and bring him to shame again stayed his timid knuckles at the door in this hesitation he stumbled upon his aunt coming down the stairs with an armful of blankets and pillows attended by their small indian servant staggering under a mattress  is everything all right aunty  ye kin be thankful to the lord jeff briggs that this didnt happen last week when i was down on my back with rheumatiz but yere never grateful  the young ladyis she comfortable said jeff accepting his aunts previous remark as confirmatory  ez well ez enny critter marked by the finger of the lord with gallopin consumption kin be i reckon and she ez oughter be putting off airthly vanities askin for a lookinglass and you trapesin through the hall with her on yer shoulder and dancin and jouncin her up and down ez if it was a ballroom a guilty recollection that he had skipped with her through the passage struck him with remorse as his aunt went on its a mercy that betwixt you and the wet barskin she aint got her deth  dont ye think aunty stammered jeff thatthatmy bein the landlord yer know it would be the square thingjust out o respect ye knowfor me to drop in thar and ask em if thars anythin they wanted  his aunt stopped and resignedly put down the pillows sarah she said meekly to the handmaiden ye kin leave go that mattress yers mr jefferson thinks we aint good enough to make the beds for them two city women folks and he allows hell do it himself  no no aunty began the horrified jeff but failing to placate his injured relative took safety in flight  once safe in his own room his eye fell on the bearskin it certainly was wet perhaps he had been carelessperhaps he had imperiled her life his cheeks flushed as he threw it hastily in the corner something fell from it to the floor jeff picked it up and held it to the light it was a small a very small ladys slipper holding it within the palm of his hand as if it had been some delicate flower which the pressure of a finger might crush he strode to the door but stopped should he give it to his aunt even if she overlooked this evident proof of his carelessness what would she think of the young ladys ought heseductive thoughtgo downstairs again knock at the door and give it to its fair owner with the apology he was longing to make then he remembered that he had but a few moments before been dismissed from the room very much as if he were the original proprietor of the skin he had taken perhaps they were right perhaps he was only a foolish clumsy animal yet she had thanked himand had said in her sweet childlike voice it is a great thing to be strong a greater thing to be strong and gentle he was strong strong men had said so he did not know if he was gentle too had she meant that when she turned her strangely soft dark eyes upon him for some moments he held the slipper hesitatingly in his hand then he opened his trunk and disposing various articles around it as if it were some fragile perishable object laid it carefully therein  this done he drew off his boots and rolling himself in his blanket lay down upon the bed he did not open his novelhe did not follow up the exciting love episode of his favorite heroso ungrateful is humanity to us poor romancers in the first stages of their real passion ah me tis the jongleurs and troubadours they want then not us when master slender sick for sweet anne page would rather than forty shillings he had his book of songs and sonnets there what availed it that the italian boccaccio had contemporaneously discoursed wisely and sweetly of love in prose i doubt not that master jeff would have mumbled some verse to himself had he known any knowing none he lay there and listened to the wind  did she hear it did it keep her awake he had an uneasy suspicion that the shutter that was banging so outrageously was the shutter of her room filled with this miserable thought he arose softly stole down the staircase and listened the sound was repeated it was truly the refractory shutter of no 7the best bedroom adjoining the sittingroom the next room no 8 was vacant jeff entered it softly as softly opened the window and leaning far out in the tempest essayed to secure the nocturnal disturber but in vain cord or rope he had none nor could he procure either without alarming his auntan extremity not to be considered jeff was a man of clumsy but forceful expedients he hung far out of the window and with one powerful hand lifted the shutter off its hinges and dragged it softly into no 8 then as softly he crept upstairs to bed the wind howled and tore round the house the crazy waterpipe below jeffs window creaked the chimneys whistled but the shutter banged no more jeff began to doze its a great thing to be strong the wind seemed to say as it charged upon the defenseless house and then another voice seemed to reply a greater thing to be strong and gentle and hearing this he fell asleep   ii   it was not yet daylight when he awoke with an idea that brought him hurriedly to his feet quickly dressing himself he began to count the money in his pocket apparently the total was not satisfactory as he endeavored to augment it by loose coins fished from the pockets of his other garments and from the corner of his washstand drawer then he cautiously crept downstairs seized his gun and stole out of the still sleeping house the wind had gone down the rain had ceased a few stars shone steadily in the north and the shapeless bulk of the coach its lamps extinguished loomed high and dry above the lessening water in the twilight with a swinging tread jeff strode up the hill and was soon upon the highway and stage road a halfhours brisk walk brought him to the summit and the first rosy flashes of morning light this enabled him to knock over halfadozen early quail lured by the proverb who were seeking their breakfast in the chaparral and gave him courage to continue on his mission which his perplexed face and irresolute manner had for the last few moments shown to be an embarrassing one at last the white fences and imposing outbuildings of the summit hotel rose before him and he uttered a deep sigh there basking in the first rays of the morning sun stood his successful rival jeff looked at the wellbuilt comfortable structure the commanding site and the air of serene independence that seemed to possess it and no longer wondered that the great world passed him by to linger and refresh itself there  he was relieved to find the landlord was not present in person and so confided his business to the barkeeper at first it appeared that that functionary declined interference and with many headshakings and audible misgivings was inclined to await the coming of his principal but a nearer view of jeffs perplexed face and an examination of jeffs gun and the few coins spread before him finally induced him to produce certain articles which he packed in a basket and handed to jeff taking the gun and coins in exchange thus relieved jeff set his face homewards and ran a race with the morning into the valley reaching the halfway house as the sun laid waste its bare bleak outlines and relentlessly pointed out its defects one by one it was cruel to jeff at that moment but he hugged his basket close and slipped to the back door and the kitchen where his aunt was already at work  i didnt know ye were up yet aunty said jeff submissively it isnt more than six oclock  thars four more to feed at breakfast said his aunt severely and yers the top blown off the kitchen chimbly and the fire only just got to go  jeff saw that he was in time the ordinary breakfast of the halfway house not yet prepared consisted of codfish ham yellowochre biscuit made after a peculiar receipt of his aunts and potatoes  i got a few fancy fixins up at the summit this morning aunty he began apologetically seein we had sick folks you knowyou and the young ladyand thinkin it might save you trouble ive got em here and he shyly produced the basket  if ye kin afford it jeff responded his aunt resignedly im thankful  the reply was so unexpectedly mild for aunt sally that jeff put his arms around her and kissed her hard cheek and ive got some quail aunty knowin you liked em  i reckoned you was up to some such foolishness said aunt sally wiping her cheek with her apron when i missed yer gun from the hall but the allusion was a dangerous one and jeff slipped away  he breakfasted early with yuba bill that morning the latter gentlemans taciturnity being intensified at such moments through a long habit of confining himself strictly to eating in the limited time allowed his daily repasts and it was not until they had taken the horses from the stable and were harnessing them to the coach that jeff extracted from his companion some facts about his guests they were mr and mrs mayfield eastern tourists who had been to the sandwich islands for the benefit of their daughters health and before returning to new york intended under the advice of their physician to further try the effects of mountain air at the summit hotel on the invalid they were apparently rich people the coach had been engaged for them solelyeven the mail and express had been sent on by a separate conveyance so that they might be more independent it is hardly necessary to say that this fact was by no means palatable to billdebarring him not only the social contact and attentions of the express agent but the selection of a boxseated passenger who always acted like a man  ye kin kalkilate what kind of a pardner that ar yallerlivered mayfield would make up on that box partikly ez i heard before we started that hed requested the kimpanys agent in sacramento to select a driver ez didnt cuss smoke or drink he did sir by gum  i reckon you were very careful then bill said jeff  in course returned bill with a perfectly diabolical wink in course you know that blue grass pointing out a spirited leader shes a fair horse ez horses go but shes apt to feel her oats on a down grade and takes a powful deal o soothin and explanation afore she buckles down to her reglar work well sir i exhorted and labored in a christianlike way with that mare to that extent that im cussed if that chap didnt want to get down afore we got to the level  and the ladies asked jeff whose laughpossibly from his mornings experiencewas not as ready as formerly  the ladies ef you mean that ar livin skellington i packed up to yer house said bill promptly its a pair of them in size and color and ready for any firstclass undertakers team in the kintry why you remember that curve on break neck hill where the leaders allus look as if they was alongside o the coach and faced the other way well that woman sticks her skull outer the window and sez she confidentiallike to old yallerbelly sez she william henry sez she tell that man his horses are running away  you didnt get to see thethedaughter bill did you asked jeff whose laugh had become quite uneasy  no i didnt said bill with sudden and inexplicable vehemence and the less you see of her jefferson briggs the better for you  too confounded and confused by bills manner to question further jeff remained silent until they drew up at the door of the halfway house but here another surprise awaited him mr mayfield erect and dignified stood upon the front porch as the coach drove up  driver began mr mayfield  there was no reply  driver said mr mayfield slightly weakening under bills eye i shall want you no longer i have  is he speaking to me said bill audibly to jeff cause they call me yuba bill yer abouts  he is said jeff hastily  mebbee hes drunk said bill audibly a drop or two afore breakfast sometimes upsets his kind  i was saying bill said mr mayfield becoming utterly limp and weak again under bills cold gray eyes that ive changed my mind and shall stop here awhile my daughter seems already benefited by the change you can take my traps from the boot and leave them here  bill laid down his lines resignedly coolly surveyed mr mayfield the house and the halfpleased halffrightened jeff and then proceeded to remove the luggage from the boot all the while whistling loud and offensive incredulity then he climbed back to his box mr mayfield completely demoralized under this treatment as a last resort essayed patronage  you can say to the sacramento agents bill that i am entirely satisfied and  ye neednt fear but ill give ye a good character interrupted bill coolly gathering up his lines the whip snapped the six horses dashed forward as one the coach plunged down the road and was gone  with its disappearance mr mayfield stiffened slightly again i have just told your aunt mr briggs he said turning upon jeff that my daughter has expressed a desire to remain here a few days she has slept well seems to be invigorated by the air and although we expected to go on to the summit mrs mayfield and myself are willing to accede to her wishes your house seems to be new and clean your tablejudging from the breakfast this morningis quite satisfactory  jeff in the first flush of delight at this news forgot what that breakfast had cost himforgot all his mornings experience and i fear when he did remember it was too full of a vague hopeful courage to appreciate it conscious of showing too much pleasure he affected the necessity of an immediate interview with his aunt in the kitchen but his short cut round the house was arrested by a voice and figure it was miss mayfield wrapped in a shawl and seated in a chair basking in the sunlight at one of the bleakest and barest angles of the house jeff stopped in a delicious tremor  as we are dealing with facts however it would be well to look at the cause of this tremor with our own eyes and not jeffs to be plain my dear madam as she basked in that remorseless matteroffact california sunshine she looked her full agetwentyfive if a day there were wrinkles in the corners of her dark eyes contracted and frowning in that strong merciless light there was a nervous pallor in her complexion but being one of those fast colored brunettes whose dyes are a part of their temperament no sickness nor wear could bleach it out the red of her small mouth was darker than yours i wot and there were certain faint lines from the corners of her delicate nostrils indicating alternate repression and excitement under certain experiences which are not found in the classic ideals now jeff knew nothing of the classic idealdid not know that a thousand years ago certain sensual idiots had with brush and chisel inflicted upon the world the personification of the strongest and most delicate most controlling and most subtle passion that humanity is capable of in the likeness of a thickwaisted idealess expressionless perfectly contented female animal and that thousands of idiots had since then insisted upon perpetuating this model for the benefit of a world that had gone on sighing for pining for fighting for and occasionally blowing its brains out over types far removed from that idiotic standard  consequently jeff saw only a face full of possibilities and probabilities framed in a small delicate oval saw a slight womans formmore than usually smalland heard a low voice to him full of gentle pride passion pathos and human weakness and was helpless  i only said goodmorning said miss mayfield with that slight arch satisfaction in the observation of masculine bashfulness which the best of her sex cannot forego  thank you miss goodmorning ive been wanting to say to you that i hope you wasnt mad you know stammered jeff desperately intent upon getting off his apology  it is so lovely this morningsuch a change continued miss mayfield  yes miss you know i reckonedat least what your father said made me kalkilate that you  miss mayfield still smiling knitted her brows and went on i slept so well last night she said gratefully and feel so much better this morning that i ventured out i seem to be drinking in health in this clear sunlight  certainly miss as i was sayin your father says his daughter is in the coach and bill says says he to me ill packill carry the oldill bring up mrs mayfield if youll bring up the daughter and when we come to the coach i saw you asleeplike in the corner and bein small why miss you know how natral it is i  oh mr jeff mr briggs said miss mayfield plaintively dont pleasedont spoil the best compliment ive had in many a year you thought i was a child i know andwell you find she said audaciously suddenly bringing her black eyes to bear on him like a rifle you findwell  what jeff thought was inaudible but not invisible miss mayfield saw enough of it in his eye to protest with a faint color in her cheek thus does nature betray itself to nature the world over  the color faded its a dreadful thing to be so weak and helpless and to put everybody to such trouble isnt it mr jeff i beg your pardonyour aunt calls you jeff  please call me jeff said jeff to his own surprise rapidly gaining courage everybody calls me that  miss mayfield smiled i suppose i must do what everybody does so it seems that we are to give you the trouble of keeping us here until i get better or worse  yes miss  therefore i wont detain you now i only wanted to thank you for your gentleness last night and to assure you that the bearskin did not give me my death  she smiled and nodded her small head and wrapped her shawl again closely around her shoulders and turned her eyes upon the mountains gestures which the now quickminded jeff interpreted as a gentle dismissal and flew to seek his aunt  here he grew practical ready money was needed for the halfway house was such a public monument of illluck that jeff had no credit he must keep up the table to the level of that fortunate breakfastto do which he had 150 in the till left by bill and 250 produced by his aunt sally from her workbasket  why not ask mr mayfield to advance ye suthin said aunt sally  the blood flew to jeffs face never dont say that again aunty  the tone and manner were so unlike jeff that the old lady sat down half frightened and taking the corners of her apron in her hands began to whimper  thar now aunty i didnt mean nothinonly if you care to have me about the place any longer and i reckon its little good i am any way he added with a newfound bitterness in his tone yell not ask me to do that  whats gone o ye jeff said his aunt lugubriously ye aint natral like  jeff laughed see here aunty im goin to take your advice you know rabbit  the mare  yes im going to sell her the blacksmith offered me a hundred dollars for her last week  ef yed done that a month ago jeff ez i wanted ye to instead o keeping the brute to eat ye out o house and home yed be better off aunt sally never let slip an opportunity to improve the occasion but preferred to exhort over the prostrate body of the improved well i hope he maynt change his mind  jeff smiled at such suggestion regarding the best horse within fifty miles of the halfway house nevertheless he went briskly to the stable led out and saddled a handsome grey mare petting her the while and keeping up a running commentary of caressing epithets to which rabbit responded with a whinny and playful reaches after jeffs red flannel sleeve whereat jeff having loved the horse until it was displaced by another mistress grew grave and suddenly threw his arms around rabbits neck and then taking rabbits nose thrust it in the bosom of his shirt and held it there silently for a moment rabbit becoming uneasy jeffs mood changed too and having caparisoned himself and charger in true vaquero style not without a little mexican dandyism as to the set of his doeskin trousers and the tie of his red sash put a sombrero rakishly on his curls and leaped into the saddle  jeff was a fair rider in a country where riding was understood as a natural instinct and not as a purely artificial habit of horse and rider consequently he was not perched up jockey fashion with a kneegrip for his body and a reinrest for his arms on the beasts mouth but rode with long loose stirrups his legs clasping the barrel of his horse his single rein lying loose upon her neck leaving her head free as the wind after this fashion he had often emerged from a cloud of dust on the red mountain road striking admiration into the hearts of the wayfarers and coachpassengers and leaving a trail of pleasant incense in the dust behind him it was therefore with considerable confidence in himself and a little human vanity that he dashed round the house and threw his mare skilfully on her haunches exactly a foot before miss mayfieldhimself a resplendent vision of flying riata crimson scarf fawncolored trousers and jingling silver spurs  kin i do anythin for ye miss at the forks  miss mayfield looked up quietly i think not she said indifferently as if the flamingjeff was a very common occurrence  jeff here permitted the mare to bolt fifty yards caught her up sharply swung her round on her off hind heel permitted her to paw the air once or twice with her whitestockinged forefeet and then with another dash forward pulled her up again just before she apparently took miss mayfield and her chair in a running leap  are you sure miss asked jeff with a flushed face and a rather lugubrious voice  quite so thank you she said coldly looking past this centaur to the wooded mountain beyond  jeff thoroughly crushed was pacing meekly away when a childlike voice stopped him  if you are going near a carpenters shop you might get a new shutter for my window it blew away last night  it did miss  yes said the shrill voice of aunt sally from the doorway in course it did ye must be crazy jeff for thar it stands in no 8 whar ye must have put it after ye picked it up outside  jeff conscious that miss mayfields eyes were on his suffused face stammered that he would attend to it and put spurs to the mare eager only to escape  it was not his only discomfiture for the blacksmith seeing jeffs nervousness and anxiety was suspicious of something wrong as the world is apt to be and appeased his conscience after the worldly fashion by driving a hard bargain with the doubtful brother in afflictionthe morality of a horse trade residing always with the seller whereby master jeff received only eighty dollars for horse and outfitworth at least two hundredand was also mulcted of forty dollars principal and interest for past service of the blacksmith jeff walked home with forty dollars in his pocketcapital to prosecute his honest calling of innkeeper the blacksmith retired to an adjoining tavern to discuss jeffs affairs and further reduce his credit yet i doubt which was the happierthe blacksmith estimating his possible gains and doubtful of some uncertain sequence in his luck or jeff temporarily relieved boundlessly hopeful and filled with the vague delights of a first passion the only discontented brute in the whole transaction was poor rabbit who missing certain attentions became indignant after the manner of her sex bit a piece out of her crib kicked a hole in her box and receiving a bad character from the blacksmith gave a worse one to her late master  jeffs purchases were of a temporary and ornamental quality but not always judicious as a permanent investment overhearing some remark from miss mayfield concerning the dangerous character of the twotined steel fork which was part of the table equipage of the halfway house he purchased half a dozen of what his aunt was pleased to specify as split spoons and thereby lost his late good standing with her he not only repaired the windowshutter but tempered the glaring window itself with a bit of curtain he half carpeted miss mayfields bedroom with wildcat skins and the now historical bearskin and felt himself overpaid when that young lady passing the soft tabbyskins across her cheek declared they were lovely for miss mayfield deprecating slaughter in the abstract accepted its results gratefully like the rest of her sex and while willing to let the hart ungalled play nevertheless was able to console herself with its venison the woods besides yielding aid and comfort of this kind to the distressed damsel were flamboyant with vivid spring blossoms and jeff lit up the cold white walls of her virgin cell with demonstrative color and madewhat his aunt a cleanly soul whose ideas of that quality were based upon the absence of any color whatever calleda litter  the result of which was to make miss mayfield otherwise lanquid and ennuye welcome jeffs presence with a smile to make jeff otherwise anxious eager and keenly attentive mute and silent in her presence two symptoms bad for jeff  meantime mr mayfields small conventional spirit pined for fellowship only to be found in larger civilizations and sought under plea of business a visit to sacramento where a few of the mayfield type still surviving were to be found  this was a relief to jeff who only through his regard for the daughter was kept from open quarrel with the father he fancied miss mayfield felt relieved too although jeff had noticed that mayfield had deferred to his daughter more often than his wifeover whom your conventional small autocrat is always victorious it takes the legal matrimonial contract to properly develop the firstclass tyrant male or female  on one of these days jeff was returning through the woods from marketing at the forks which since the sale of rabbit had became a footsore and tedious business he had reached the edge of the forest and through the widerspaced trees the bleak sunlit plateau of his house was beginning to open out when he stopped instantly i know not what jeff had been thinking of as he trudged along but here all at once he was thrilled and possessed with the odor of some faint foreign perfume he flushed a little at first and then turned pale now the woods were as full of as delicate as subtle as grateful and i wot far healthier and purer odors than this but this represented to jeff the physical contiguity of miss mayfield who had the knackpeculiar to some of her sexof selecting a perfume that ideally identified her jeff looked around cautiously at the foot of a tree hard by lay one of her wraps still redolent of her jeff put down the bag which in lieu of a market basket he was carrying on his shoulder and with a blushing face hid it behind a tree it contained her dinner  he took a few steps forwards with an assumption of ease and unconsciousness then he stopped for not a hundred yards distant satmiss mayfield on a mossy boulder her cloak hanging from her shoulders her hands clasped round her crossed knees and one little foot outan exasperating combination of evangeline and little red riding hood in everything i fear but credulousness and selfdevotion she looked up as he walked towards her non constat that the little witch had not already seen him half a mile away and smiled sweetly as she looked at him so sweetly indeed that poor jeff felt like the hulking wolf of the old world fable and hesitatedas that wolf did not the california faunae have possibly depreciated  come here she cried in a small head voice not unlike a birds twitter  jeff lumbered on clumsily his high boots had become suddenly very heavy  im so glad to see you ive just tired poor mother outim always tiring people outand shes gone back to the house to write letters sit down mr jeff do please  jeff feeling uncomfortably large in miss mayfields presence painfully seated himself on the edge of a very low stone which had the effect of bringing his knees up on a level with his chin and affected an ease glaringly simulated  or lie down there mr jeffit is so comfortable  jeff with a dreadful conviction that he was crashing down like a falling pinetree managed at last to acquire a recumbent position at a respectful distance from the little figure  there isnt it nice  yes miss mayfield  but perhaps said miss mayfield now that she had him down perhaps you too have got something to do dear me im like that naughty boy in the storybook who went round to all the animals in turn asking them to play with him he could only find the butterfly who had nothing to do i dont wonder he was disgusted i hate butterflies  love clarifies the intellect jeff astonished at himself burst out why look yer miss mayfield the butterfly only hez a day or two tototo live andbe happy  miss mayfield crossed her knees again and instantly after the sublime fashion of her sex scattered his intellect by a swift transition from the abstract to the concrete but youre not a butterfly mr jeff youre always doing something youve been hunting  noo said jeff scarlet as he thought of his gun in pawn at the summit  but you do hunt i know it  how  you shot those quail for me the morning after i came i heard you go outearlyvery early  why you allowed you slept so well that night miss mayfield  yes but theres a kind of delicious halfsleep that sick people have sometimes when they know and are gratefully conscious that other people are doing things for them and it makes them rest all the sweeter  there was a dead silence jeff thrilling all over dared not say anything to dispel his delicious dream miss mayfield alarmed at his readiness with the butterfly illustration stopped short they both looked at the prospect at the distant summit hotela mere snowdrift on the mountainat the clear sunlight on the barren plateau at the bleak uncompromising halfway house and said nothing  i ought to be very grateful at last began miss mayfield in quite another voice and a suggestion that she was now approaching real and profitable conversation that im so much better this mountain air has been like balm to me i feel i am growing stronger day by day i do not wonder that you are so healthy and so strong as you are mr jeff  jeff who really did not know before that he was so healthy apologetically admitted the fact at the same time he was miserably conscious that miss mayfields condition despite her ill health was very superior to his own  a month ago she continued reflectively my mother would never have thought it possible to leave me here alone perhaps she may be getting worried now  miss mayfield had calculated over much on jeffs recumbent position to her surprise and slight mortification he rose instantly to his feet and said anxiously  ef you think so miss praps im keeping you here  not at all mr jeff your being here is a sufficient excuse for my staying she replied with the large dignity of a small body  jeff mentally and physically crushed again came down a little heavier than before and reclined humbly at her feet second knockdown blow for miss mayfield  come mr jeff said the triumphant goddess in her first voice tell me something about yourself how do you live herei mean what do you do you ride of courseand very well too i can tell you but you know that and of course that scarf and the silver spurs and the whole dashing equipage are not intended entirely for yourself no some young woman is made happy by that exhibition of course well then theres the riding down to see her and perhaps the riding out with her andwhat else  miss mayfield said jeff suddenly rising above his elbow and his grammar thar isnt no young woman thar isnt another soul except yourself that ive laid eyes on or cared to see since ive been yer ef my aunt hez been telling ye thatshessheshesheshelies  absolute undiluted truth even of a complimentary nature is confounding to most women miss mayfield was no exception to her sex she first laughed as she felt she ought to and properly might with any other man than jeff then she got frightened and said hurriedly no no you misunderstand me your aunt has said nothing and then she stopped with a pink spot on her cheekbones first blood for jeff  now this would never do it was worse than the butterflies she rose to her full heightfour feet eleven and a halfand drew her cloak over her shoulders i think i will return to the house she said quietly i suppose i ought not to overtask my strength  youd better let me go with you miss said jeff submissively  i will on one condition she said recovering her archness with a little venom in it i fear you were going home too when i called to you now i do not intend to let you leave that bag behind that tree and then have to come back for it just because you feel obliged to go with me bring it with you on one arm and ill take the other or elseill go alone dont be alarmed she added softly im stronger than i was the first night i came when you carried me and all my worldly goods besides  she turned upon him her subtle magnetic eyes and looked at him as she had the first night they met jeff turned away bewildered but presently appeared again with the bag on his shoulder and her wrap on his arm as she slipped her little hand over his sleeve he began apologetically and nervously  when i said that about aunt sally miss i  the hand immediately became limp the grasp conventional  i was mad miss jeff blundered on and i dont see how you believed itknowing everything ez you do  how knowing everything as i do asked miss mayfield coldly  why about the quail and about the bag  oh said miss mayfield  five minutes later yuba bill nearly ditched his coach in his utter amazement at an apparently simple spectaclea tall goodlooking young fellow in a red shirt and high boots carrying a bag on his back and beside him hanging confidentially on his arm a small slight pretty girl in a red cloak nothing mean about her eh bill said as admiring boxpassenger young couple i reckon just out from the states  no roared bill  oh well his sweetheart i reckon suggested the boxpassenger  nary time growled bill look yer i know em both and they knows me did ye notiss she never drops his arm when she sees the stage comin but kinder trapes along jist the same had they been courtin shed hev dropped his arm like pizen and walked on tother side the road  nevertheless for some occult reason bill was evidently out of humor and for the next few miles exhorted the impenitent blue grass horse with considerable fervor  meanwhile this pair outwardly the picture of pastoral conjugality slowly descended the hill in that brief time failing to get at any further facts regarding jeffs life or perhaps reading the story quite plainly miss mayfield had twittered prettily about herself she painted her tropic life in the sandwich islandsher delicious laziness as she called it for you know she added although i had the excuse of being an invalid and of living in the laziest climate in the world and of having money i think mr jeff that im naturally lazy perhaps if i lived here long enough and got well again i might do something but i dont think i could ever be like your aunt and there she is now mr jeff making signs for you to hasten no dont mind me but run on ahead else i shall have her blaming me for demoralizing you too go i insist upon it i can walk the rest of the way alone will you go you wont then i shall stop here and not stir another step forward until you do  she stopped half jestingly half earnestly in the middle of the road and emphasized her determination with a nod of her headan action that however shook her hat first rakishly over one eye and then on the ground at which jeff laughed picked it up presented it to her and then ran off to the house   iii   his aunt met him angrily on the porch thar ye are at last and yers a stranger waitin to see you hes been axin all sorts o questions about the house and the business and kinder snoopin round permiskiss i dont like his looks jeff but thets no reason why ye should be gallivantin round in business hours  a large thickset man with a mechanical smile that was an overt act of false pretense was lounging in the barroom jeff dimly remembered to have seen him at the last county election distributing tickets at the polls this gave jeff a slight prejudice against him but a greater presentiment of some vague evil in the air caused him to motion the stranger to an empty room in the angle of the house behind the barroom which was too near the hall through which miss mayfield must presently pass  it was an infelicitous act of precaution for at that very moment miss mayfield slowly passed beneath its open window and seeing her chair in the sunny angle dropped into it for rest and possibly meditation consequently she overheard every word of the following colloquy  the strangers voice well now seein ez ive been waitin for ye over an hour off and on and ez my bizness with ye is two words it strikes me yer puttin on a little too much style in this yer interview mr jefferson briggs  jeffs voice a little husky with restraint what is yer business  the strangers voice lazily its an attachment on this yer property for principal interest and costsone hundred and twelve dollars and seventyfive cents at the suit of cyrus parker  jeffs voice in quick surprise parker why i saw him only yesterday and he agreed to wait a spell longer  the strangers voice mebbee he did mebbee he heard afterwards suthin about the goins on up yar mebbee he heard suthin o property bein converted into ready cashsich property ez horses guns and sich mebbee he heard o gay and festive doinschickin every day fresh eggs butchers meat port wine and sich mebbee he allowed that his chances o gettin his own honest grub outer his debt was lookin mighty slim mebbee louder he thought hed ask the man who bought yer horse and the man you pawned your gun to what was goin on mebbee he thought hed like to get a holt a suthin himself even if it was only some of that yar chickin and port wine  jeffs voice earnestly and hastily theyre not for me i have a family boarding here with a sick daughter you dont think  the strangers voice lazily i reckon i seed you and her preambulating down the hill lockin arms a good deal o style jefffancy expensive how does aunt sally take it  a slight shaking of the floor and windowa dead silence  the strangers voice very faintly for gods sake let me up  jeffs voice very distinctly another word raise your voice above a whisper and by the living g  silence  the strangers voice gasping iipromise  jeffs voice low and desperate get up out of that sit down thar now hear me im not resisting your process if you had all hll as witnesses you darent say that ive shut up your foul jaw and kept it from poisoning the air and thars no law in californy agin it now listen what you will will you  everything quiet a bird twittering on the window ledge nothing more  the strangers voice very huskily i cave gimme some whiskey  jeffs voice when were through now listen you can take possession of the house you can stand behind the bar and take every cent that comes in you can prevent anything going out but as long as mr mayfield and his family stay here by the living godlaw or no lawill be boss here and they shall never know it  the strangers voice weakly and submissively that sounds square anythin not agin the law and in reason jeff  jeffs voice i mean to be square here is all the money i have ten dollars take it for any extra trouble you may have to satisfy me  a pausethe clinking of coin  the strangers voice deprecatingly well i reckon that would be about fair consider the trouble a weak laugh here just now taint every man ez hez your grip he he ef ye hadnt took me so suddent likehe hewellhow about that ar whiskey  jeffs voice coolly ill bring it  steps silence coughing spitting and throatclearing from the stranger  steps again and the click of glass  the strangers voice submissively in course i must go back to the forks and fetch up my duds ye know what i mean thar nowdont mr jeff  jeffs voice sternly if i find you go back on me  the strangers voice hurriedly thars my hand on it ye can count on jim dodd  steps again silence a bird lights on the window ledge and peers into the room all is at rest  jeff and the deputysheriff walked through the barroom and out on the porch miss mayfield in an armchair looked up from her book  ive written a letter to my father that id like to have mailed at the forks this afternoon she said looking from jeff to the stranger perhaps this gentleman will oblige me by taking it if hes going that way  ill take it miss said jeff hurriedly  no said miss mayfield archly ive taken up too much of your time already  im at your service miss said the stranger considerably affected by the spectacle of this pretty girl who certainly at that moment in her bright eyes and slightly pink cheeks belied the suggestion of ill health  thank you dear me she was rummaging in a reticule and in her pocket etc oh mr jeff  yes miss  im so frightened  how miss  i haveyesi have left that letter on the stump in the woods where i was sitting when you came would you  jeff darted into the house seized his hat and stopped he was thinking of the stranger  could you be so kind  jeff looked in her agitated face cast a meaning glance at the stranger and was off like a shot  the fire dropped out of miss mayfields eyes and cheeks she turned toward the stranger  please step this way  she always hated her own childish treble but just at that moment she thought she had put force and dignity into it and was correspondingly satisfied the deputy sheriff was equally pleased and came towards the upright little figure with open admiration  your name is doddjames dodd  yes miss  you are the deputy sheriff of the county dont look roundthere is no one here  well missif you say soyes  my fathermr mayfieldunderstood so i regret he is not here i regret still more i could not have seen you before you saw mr briggs as he wished me to  yes miss  my father is a friend of mr briggs and knows something of his affairs there was a debt to a mr parker here miss mayfield apparently consulted an entry in her tablets of one hundred and twelve dollars and seventyfive centsam i right  the deputy with great respect that is the figgers  which he wished to pay without the knowledge of mr briggs who would not have consented to it  the official opened his eyes yes miss  well as mr mayfield is not here i am here to pay it for him you can take a check on wells fargo  co i suppose  certainly miss  she took a checkbook and pen and ink from her reticule and filled up a check she handed it to him and the pen and ink you are to give me a receipt  the deputy looked at the matteroffact little figure and signed and handed over the receipted bill  my father said mr briggs was not to know this  certainly not miss  it was mr briggss intention to let the judgment take its course and give up the house you are a man of business mr dodd and know that this is ridiculous  the deputy laughed in course miss  and whatever mr briggs may have proposed to you to do when you go back to the forks you are to write him a letter and say that you will simply hold the judgment without levy  all right miss said the deputy not illpleased to hold himself in this superior attitude to jeff  and  yes miss  she looked steadily at him mr briggs told my father that he would pay you ten dollars for the privilege of staying here  yes miss  and of course thats not necessary now  noo miss  a very small white handa mere childs handwas here extended palm uppermost  the official demoralized completely looked at it a moment then went into his pockets and counted out into the palm the coins given by jeff they completely filled the tiny receptacle  miss mayfield counted the money gravely and placed it in her portemonnaie with a snap  certain qualities affect certain natures this practical business act of the diminutive beauty before himalbeit he was just ten dollars out of pocket by itstruck the official into helpless admiration he hesitated  thats all said miss mayfield coolly you need not wait the letter was only an excuse to get mr briggs out of the way  i understand ye miss he hesitated still do you reckon to stop in these parts long  i dont know  cause ye ought to come down some day to the forks  yes  good morning miss  good morning  yet at the corner of the house the rascal turned and looked back at the little figure in the sunlight he had just been physically overcome by a younger manhe had lost ten dollarshe had a wife and three children he forgot all this he had been captivated by miss mayfield  that practical heroine sat there five minutes at the end of that time jeff came bounding down the hill his curls damp with perspiration his fresh honest face the picture of woe her woe for the letter could not be found  never mind mr jeff i wrote another and gave it to him  two tears were standing on her cheeks jeff turned white  good god miss  its nothing you were right mr jeff i ought not to have walked down here alone im very very tired andsoso miserable  what woman could withstand the anguish of that honest boyish face i fear miss mayfield could for she looked at him over her handkerchief and said perhaps you had something to say to your friend and ive sent him off  nothing said jeff hurriedly and she saw that all his other troubles had vanished at the sight of her weakness she rose tremblingly from her seat i think i will go in now but i thinki thinki must ask you totocarry me  oh lame and impotent conclusion  the next moment jeff pale strong passionate but tender as a mother lifted her in his arms and brought her into the sittingroom a simultaneous ejaculation broke from aunt sally and mrs mayfieldthe possible comment of posterity on the whole episode  well jeff i reckoned youd be up to suthin like that  well jessie i knew you couldnt be trusted   mr james dodd did not return from the forks that afternoon to jeffs vague uneasiness towards evening a messenger brought a note from him written on the back of a printed legal form to this effect   dear sirseeing as you intend to act on the square in regard to that little mater i have aranged things so that i ant got to stop with you but ill drop in onct in a wile to keep up a show for a drinkrespy yours j dodd   in this latter suggestion our legal cerberus exhibited all three of his heads at once one could keep faith with miss mayfield one could see her onct in a wile and one could drink at jeffs expense innocent jeff saw only generosity and kindness in the man he had halfchoked and a sense of remorse and shame almost outweighed the relief of his absence he might hev been ugly said jeff he did not know how in this selfish world there is very little room for gratuitous active ugliness  miss mayfield did not leave her room that afternoon the wind was getting up and it was growing dark when jeff idly sitting on his porch hoping for her appearance was quite astounded at the apparition of yuba bill as a pedestrian dusty and thirsty making for his usual refreshment jeff brought out the bottle but could not refrain from mixing his verbal astonishment with the conventional cocktail bill partaking of his liquor and becoming once more a speaking animal slowly drew off his heavy baggy driving gloves no one had ever seen bill without themhe was currently believed to sleep in themand when he laid them on the counter they still retained the grip of his hand which gave them an entertaining likeness to two plethoric and overfed spiders  ef i concluded to pass over my lines to a friend and take a pasear up yer this evening said bill eying jeff sharply i dont know ez thars any law agin it onless yer keepin a private branch o the occidental hotel and ony take in fashnble fammerlies  jeff with a rising color protested against such a supposition  because ef ye are said bill lifting his voice and crushing one of the overgrown spiders with his fist ive got a word or two to say to the son of joe briggs of tuolumne yes sir joe briggsyer fatherez blew his brains out for want of a man ez could stand up and say a word to him at the right time  bill said jeff in a low resolute tonethat tone yielded up only from the smitten chords of despair and desperationthars a sick woman in the house ill listen to anything youve got to say if youll say it quietly but you must and shall speak low  real men quickly recognize real men the world over it is only your shams who fence and spar bill taking in the voice of the speaker more than his words dropped his own  i said i had a kepple of words to say to ye thar isnt any time in the last fower monthsever since ye took stock in this old shanty for the matter o thatthat i couldnt hev said them to ye ive knowed all your doins ive knowed all your debts speshly that ye owe that sneakin hound parker and thar isnt a time that i couldnt and wouldnt hev chipped in and paid em for yefor your fathers sakeef id allowed it to be the square thing for ye but i know ye jeff i know whats in your blood i knew your fatherallus dreamin hopin waitin i know you jeff dreamin hopin waitin till the end and i stood by givin you a free rein and let it come  jeff buried his face in his hands  it aint your blameits blood it aint a week ago ez the kimpany passes me over a hoss threequarters morgan sez they sez i wots the other quarter sez they a mexican halfbreed well she was a fair sort of hoss comin down heavytree hill last trip we meets a drove o spanish steers in course she goes wild directly blood  bill raised his glass softly swirled its contents round and round tasted it and set it down  the kepple o words i had to say to ye was this git up and git  something like this had passed through jeffs mind the day before the mayfields came something like it had haunted him once or twice since he turned quickly upon the speaker  ez how you sez said bill catching at the hook i drives up yer some night and you sez to me bill hev you got two seats over to the divide for me and auntyout on a pasear and i sez i happen to hev one inside and one on the box with me and you hands out yer traps and any vallybles ye dont want ter leave and you puts your aunt inside and gets up on the box with me and you sez to me ez man to man bill sez you might you hev a kepple o hundred dollars about ye that ye could lend a man ez was leaving the county dead broke and i sez ive got it and i know of an opnin for such a man in the next county and you steps into that opnin and your creditorsspeshly parkerslips into this and in a week they offers to settle with ye ten cents on the dollar  jeff started flushed trembled recovered himself and after a moment said doggedly i cant do it bill i couldnt  in course said bill putting his hands slowly into his pockets and stretching his legs outin course ye cant because of a woman  jeff turned upon him like a hunted bear both men rose but bill already had his hand on jeffs shoulder  i reckoned a minute ago there was a sick gal in the house whos going to make a row now whos going to stamp and tear round eh  jeff sank back on his chair  i said thar was a woman continued bill thar allus is one let a man be hellbent or heavenbent somewhere in his track is a womans feet i dont say anythin agin this gal ez a gal the best of em jeff is only guideposts to pint a fellow on his right road and only a fool or a drunken man holds on to em or leans agin em allowin this gal is all you think she is how far is your guidepost goin with ye eh is she goin to leave her father and mother for ye is she goin to give up herself and her easy ways and her sicknesses for ye is she willin to take ye for a perpetooal landlord the rest of her life and if she is jeff are ye the man to let her are ye willin to run on her errants to fetch her dinners ez ye do thar ez men ez does it not yer in californy but over in the states thars fellows is willing to take that situation ive heard continued bill in a low mysterious voice as of one describing the habits of the anthropophagiive heard o fellows ez call themselves men sellin of themselves to rich women in that way ive heard o rich gals buyin of men for their shape sometimesbut thets in furrin kintriesfor their pedigree ive heard o fellows bein in that business and callin themselves men instead o hosses ye aint that kind o man jeff taint in yer blood yer father was a fool about women and in course they ruined him as they allus do the best men its ony the fools and sneaks ez a woman ever makes anythin out of when ye hear of a man a woman hez made ye hears of a nincompoop and when they does produce em in the way o nater they aint responsible for em and sez theyre the image o their fathers ye aint a man ez is goin to trust yer fate to a woman  no said jeff darkly  i reckoned not said bill putting his hands in his pockets again ye might if ye was one o them kind o fellows as kem up from frisco with her to sacramento one o them kind o fellows ez could sling poetry and french and latin to herone of her kindbut ye aint no sir  unwise william of yuba in any other breast but jeffs that random shot would have awakened the irregular auxiliary of lovejealousy but jeff being at once proud and humble had neither vanity nor conceit without which jealousy is impossible yet he winced a little for he had feeling and then said earnestly  do you think that opening you spoke of would hold for a day or two longer  i reckon  well then i think i can settle up matters here my own way and go with you bill  he had risen and yet hesitatingly kept his hand on the back of his chair bill  jeff  i want to ask you a question speak up and dont mind me but say the truth  our crafty ulysses believing that he was about to be entrapped ensconced himself in his pockets cocked one eye and said go on jeff  was my father very bad  bill took his hands from his pockets thar isnt a man ez crawls above his grave ez is worthy to lie in the same ground with him  thank you bill good night im going to turn in  look yar boy gd dn it all jeff what do ye mean  there were two tearstwin sisters of those in his sweethearts eyes that afternoonnow standing in jeffs  bill caught both his hands in his own had they been of the latin race they would have right honestly taken each other in their arms and perhaps kissed being anglosaxons they gripped each others hands hard and one as above stated swore  when jeff ascended to his room that night he went directly to his trunk and took out miss mayfields slipper alack during the day aunt sally had put things to rights in his room and the trunk had been moved this had somewhat disordered its contents and miss mayfields slipper contained a dozen shot from a broken eleys cartridge a few quinine pills four postage stamps part of a coral earring which jeffon the most apocryphal authorityfondly believed belonged to his mother whom he had never seen and a small silver school medal which jeff had once received for good conduct much to his own surprise but which he still religiously kept as evidence of former conventional character he colored a little rubbed the medal and earring ruefully on his sleeve replaced them in his trunk and then hastily emptied the rest of the slippers contents on the floor this done he drew off his boots and gliding noiselessly down the stair hung the slipper on the knob of miss mayfields door and glided back again without detection  rolling himself in his blankets he lay down on his bed but not to sleep staringly wide awake he at last felt the lulling of the wind that nightly shook his casement and listened while the great rambling creaking disjointed halfway house slowly settled itself to repose he thought of many things of himself of his past of his future but chiefly i fear of the pale proud face now sleeping contentedly in the chamber below him he tossed with many plans and projects more or less impracticable and then began to doze whereat the moon creeping in the window laid a cold white arm across him and eventually dried a few foolish tears upon his sleeping lashes   iv   aunt sally was making pies in the kitchen the next morning when jeff hesitatingly stole upon her the moment was not a felicitous one piemaking was usually an aggressive pursuit with aunt sally entered into severely and prosecuted unto the bitter end after watching her a few moments jeff came up and placed his arms tenderly around her people very much in love find relief i am told in this vicarious expression  aunty  well jeff thar nowyer gittin all dough nevertheless the hard face relaxed a little something of a smile stole round her mouth showing what she might have been before theology and bitters had supplied the natural feminine longings  aunty dear  youboy  it was a boys facealbeit bearded like the pard with an extra fierceness in the mustachesthat looked upon hers she could not help bestowing a grim floury kiss upon it  well what is it now  im thinking aunty its high time you and me packed up our traps and shook this yar shanty and located somewhere else jeffs voice was ostentatiously cheerful but his eyes were a little anxious  what for now  jeff hastily recounted his ill luck and the various reasonsexcepting of course the dominant onefor his resolution  and when do you kalkilate to go  if youll look arter things here hesitated jeff i reckon ill go up along with bill tomorrow and look round a bit  and how long do you reckon that gal would stay here after yar gone  this was a new and startling idea to jeff but in his humility he saw nothing in it to flatter his conceit rather the reverse he colored and then said apologetically  i thought that you and jinny could get along without me the butcher will pack the provisions over from the fork  laying down her rollingpin aunt sally turned upon jeff with ostentatious deliberation ye aint she began slowly ez taking a man with wimmen ez your father wasthats a fact jeff briggs they used to say that no woman as he went for could get away from him but ye dont mean to say yer think yer not good enoughsuch as ye arefor this snip of an old maid ez big as a gold dollar and as yaller  aunty said jeff dropping his boyish manner and his color as suddenly id rather ye wouldnt talk that way of miss mayfield ye dont know her and theres times he added with a sigh ez i reckon ye dont quite know me either that young lady bein sick likes to be looked after any one can do that for her she dont mind who it is she dont care for me except for that and added jeff humbly its quite natural  i didnt say she did returned aunt sally viciously but seeing ez youve got an empty house yer on yer hands and me aslavin here on jist nothin if this gal for the sake o gallivantin with ye for a spell chooses to stay here and keep her family here and pay high for it i dont see why it aint yer duty to providence and me to take advantage of it  jeff raised his eyes to his aunts face for the first time it struck him that she might be his fathers sister and yet have no blood in her veins that answered to his there are few shocks more startling and overpowering to original natures than this sudden sense of loneliness jeff could not speak but remained looking fiercely at her  aunt sally misinterpreted his silence and returned to her work on the pies the gal aint no fool she continued rolling out the crust as if she were laying down broad propositions she reckons on it too ez if it was charged in the bill with the board and lodging why didnt she say to me last night that she kalkilated afore she went away to bring up some friends from frisco for a few days visit and didnt she say in that pipin affected voice o hers i oughter make some return for yer kindness and yer nephews kindness aunt sally by showing people that can help you and keep your house full how pleasant it is up here she aint no fool with all her faintins and dyins away no jeff briggs and if she wants to show ye off agin them city fellows ez she knows and ye aint got spunk enough to stand up and show off with herwhyshe turned her head impatiently but he was gone  if jeff had ever wavered in his resolution he would have been steady enough now but he had never wavered the convictions and resolutions of suddenly awakened character are seldom moved by expediency he was eager to taste the bitter dregs of his cup at once he began to pack his trunk and make his preparations for departure without avoiding miss mayfield in this new excitement he no longer felt the need of her presence he had satisfied his feverish anxieties by placing his trunk in the hall beside his open door and was sitting on his bed wrestling with a faded and overtasked carpetbag that would not close and accept his hard conditions when a small voice from the staircase thrilled him he walked to the corridor and looking down beheld miss mayfield midway on the steps of the staircase  she had never looked so beautiful before jeff had only seen her in those soft enwrappings and halfdeshabille that belong to invalid femininity always refined and modest thus in her present walkingcostume there was added a slight touch of coquettish adornment there was a brightness of color in her cheek and eye partly the result of climbing the staircase partly the result of that audacious impulse that had led hera modest virginto seek a gentleman in this personal fashion modesty in a young girl has a comfortable satisfying charm recognized easily by all humanity but he must be a sorry knave or a worse prig who is not deliciously thrilled when modesty puts her charming little foot just over the threshold of propriety  the mountain would not come to mohammed so mohammed must come to the mountain said miss mayfield mother is asleep aunt sally is at work in the kitchen and here am i already dressed for a ramble in this bright afternoon sunshine and no one to go with me but perhaps you too are busy  no miss i will be with you in a moment  i wish i could say that he went back to calm his pulses which the dangerous music of miss mayfields voice had set to throbbing by a few moments calm and dispassionate reflection but he only returned to brush his curls out of his eyes and ears and to button over his blue flannel shirt a white linen collar which he thought might better harmonize with miss mayfields attire  she was sitting on the staircase poking her parasol through the balusters you need not have taken that trouble mr jeff she said pleasantly you are a part of this mountain picture at all times but i am obliged to think of dress  it was no trouble miss  something in the tone of his voice made her look in his face as she rose it was a trifle paler and a little older the result doubtless thought miss mayfield of his yesterdays experience with the deputysheriff  such was her rapid deduction nevertheless after the fashion of her sex she immediately began to argue from quite another hypothesis  you are angry with me mr jeff  what imiss mayfield  yes you  miss mayfield  oh yes you are dont deny it  upon my soul  yes you give me punishments andpenances  jeff opened his blue eyes on his tormentor could aunt sally have been saying anything  if anybody miss mayfield he began  nobody but you look here  she extended her little hand with a smile in the centre of her palm lay four shining double b shot  there i found those in my slipper this morning jeff was speechless  of course you did it of course it was you who found my slipper said miss mayfield laughing but why did you put shot in it mr jeff in some catholic countries when people have done wrong the priests make them do penance by walking with peas in their shoes what have i ever done to you and why shot theyre ever so much harder than peas  seeing only the mischievous laughing face before him and the open palm containing the damning evidence of the broken eleys cartridge jeff stammered out the truth  i found the slipper in the bearskin miss mayfield i put it in my trunk to keep thinking yer wouldnt miss it and its being a kind of remembrance after youre gone awayofof the night you came here somebody moved the trunk in my room and he hung his head here the things inside all got mixed up  and that made you change your mind about keeping it said miss mayfield still smiling  no miss  what was it then  i gave it back to you miss mayfield because i was going away  indeed where  im going to find another location maybe youve noticed he continued falling back into his old apologetic manner in spite of his pride of resolutionmaybe youve noticed that this place here has no advantages for a hotel  i had not indeed i have been very comfortable  thank you miss  when do you go  tonight  for all his pride and fixed purpose he could not help looking eagerly in her face miss mayfields eyes met his pleasantly and quietly  im sorry to part with you so soon she said as she stepped back a pace or two with folded hands of course every moment of your time now is occupied you must not think of wasting it on me  but jeff had recovered his sad composure id like to go with you miss mayfield its the last time you know he added simply  miss mayfield did not reply it was a tacit assent however although she moved somewhat stiffly at his side as they walked towards the door quite convinced that jeffs resolution came from his pecuniary troubles miss mayfield was wondering if she had not better assure him of his security from further annoyance from dodd wonderful complexity of female intellect she was a little hurt at his ingratitude to her for a kindness he could not possibly have known miss mayfield felt that in some way she was unjustly treated how many of our miserable sex incapable of divination have been crushed under that unreasonable feminine reproof you ought to have known  the afternoon sun was indeed shining brightly as they stepped out before the bleak angle of the halfway house but it failed to mitigate the habitually practical austerity of the mountain breezea fact which miss mayfield had never before noticed the house was certainly bleak and exposed the site by no means a poetical one she wondered if she had not put a romance into it and perhaps even into the man beside her which did not belong to either it was a moment of dangerous doubt  i dont know but that youre right mr jeff she said finally as they faced the hill and began the ascent together this place is a little queer and bleak andunattractive  yes miss said jeff with direct simplicity ive always wondered what you saw in it to make you content to stay when it would be so much prettier and more suitable for you at the summit  miss mayfield bit her lip and was silent after a few moments climbing she said almost pettishly where is this famous summit  jeff stopped they had reached the top of the hill he pointed across an olivegreen chasm to a higher level where basking in the declining sun clustered the long rambling outbuildings around the white blinking facade of the summit house framed in pines and hemlocks tender with soft gray shadows and nestling beyond a foreground of cultivated slope it was a charming rustic picture  miss mayfields quick eye took in its details her quick intellect took in something else she had seated herself on the roadbank and clasping her knees between her locked fingers she suddenly looked up at jeff what possessed you to come halfway up a mountain instead of going on to the top  poverty miss  miss mayfield flushed a little at this practical direct answer to her halffigurative question however she began to think that moral alpineclimbing youth might have pecuniary restrictions in their high ambitions and that the hero of excelsior might have succumbed to more powerful opposition than the wisdom of age or the blandishments of beauty  you mean that poverty up there is more expensive  yes miss  but you would like to live there  yes  they were both silent miss mayfield glanced at jeff under the corners of her lashes he was leaning against a tree absorbed in thought accustomed to look upon him as a pleasing picturesque object quite fresh original and characteristic she was somewhat disturbed to find that today he presented certain other qualities which clearly did not agree with her preconceived ideas of his condition he had abandoned his usual large topboots for low shoes and she could not help noticing that his feet were small and slender as were his hands albeit browned by exposure his ruddy color was gone too and his face pale with sorrow and experience had a new expression his buttonedup coat and white collar so unlike his usual self also had its suggestionswhich miss mayfield was at first inclined to resent women are quick to notice and augur more or less wisely from these small details nevertheless she began in quite another tone  do you remember your mothermrmrbriggs  jeff noticed the new epithet no miss she died when i was quite young  your father then  jeffs eye kindled a little aggressively i remember him  what was he  miss mayfield  what was his business or profession  hehadntany  oh i seea gentleman of property  jeff hesitated looked at miss mayfield hurriedly colored and did not reply  and lost his property mr briggs with one of those rare impulses of an overtasked gentle nature jeff turned upon her almost savagely my father was a gambler and shot himself at a gambling table  miss mayfield rose hurriedly ii beg your pardon mr jeff  jeff was silent  you knowyou must knowi did not mean  no reply  mr jeff  her little hand fluttered toward him and lit upon his sleeve where it was suddenly captured and pressed passionately to his lips  i did not mean to be thoughtless or unkind said miss mayfield discreetly keeping to the point and trying weakly to disengage her hand you know i wouldnt hurt your feelings  i know miss mayfield another kiss  i was ignorant of your history  yes miss a kiss  and if i could do anything for you mr jeff she stopped  it was a very trying position being small she was drawn after her hand quite up to jeffs shoulder while he assenting in monosyllables was parting the fingers and kissing them separately reasonable discourse in this attitude was out of the question she had recourse to strategy  oh  miss mayfield  you hurt my hand  jeff dropped it instantly miss mayfield put it in the pocket of her sacque for security besides it had been so bekissed that it seemed unpleasantly conscious  i wish you would tell me all about yourself she went on with a certain charming feminine submission of manner quite unlike her ordinary speech i should like to help you perhaps i can you know i am quite independent i mean  she paused for jeffs face betrayed no signs of sympathetic following  i mean i am what people call rich in my own right i can do as i please with my own if any of your trouble mr jeff arises from want of money or capital if any consideration of that kind takes you away from your home if i could save you that trouble and find for youperhaps a little nearerthat which you are seeking i would be so glad to do it you will find the world very wide and very cold mr jeff she continued with a certain air of practical superiority quite natural to her but explicable to her friends and acquaintances only as the consciousness of pecuniary independence and i wish you would be frank with me although i am a woman i know something of business  i will be frank with you miss said jeff turning a colorless face upon her if you was ez rich as the bank of california and could throw your money on any fancy or whim that struck you at the moment if you felt you could buy up any man and woman in california that was willing to be bought up and if me and my aunt were starving in the road we wouldnt touch the money that we hadnt earned fairly and didnt belong to us no miss i aint that sort o man  how much of this speech in its brusqueness and slang was an echo of yuba bills teaching how much of it was a part of jeffs inward weakness i cannot say he saw miss mayfield recoil from him it added to his bitterness that his thought for the first time voiced appeared to him by no means as effective or powerful as he had imagined it would be but he could not recede from it and there was the relief that the worst had come and was over now  miss mayfield took her hand out of her pocket i dont think you quite understand me mr jeff she said quietly and i hope i dont understand you she walked stiffly at his side for a few moments but finally took the other side of the road they had both turned half unconsciously back again to the halfway house  jeff felt like all quarrelseekers righteous or unrighteous the full burden of the fight if he could have relieved his mind and at the next moment leaped upon yuba bills coach and so passed awaywithout a further word of explanationall would have been well but to walk back with this girl whom he had just shaken off and who must now thoroughly hate him was something he had not preconceived in that delightful forecast of the imagination when we determine what we shall say and do without the least consideration of what may be said or done to us in return no quarrel proceeds exactly as we expect people have such a way of behaving illogically and here was miss mayfield who was clearly derelict and who should have acted under that conviction walking along on the other side of the road trailing the splendor of her parasol in the dust like an offended goddess  they had almost reached the house at what time do you go mr briggs asked the young lady quietly  at eleven tonight by the up stage  i expect some friends by that stagecoming with my father  my aunt will take good care of them said jeff a little bitterly  i have no doubt responded miss mayfield gravely but i was not thinking of that i had hoped to introduce them to you tomorrow but i shall not be up so late tonight and i had better say goodby to you now  she extended the unkissed hand jeff took it but presently let the limp fingers fall through his own  i wish you good fortune mr briggs  she made a grave little bow and vanished into the house but here i regret to say her ladylike calm also vanished she upbraided her mother peevishly for obliging her to seek the escort of mr briggs in her necessary exercise and flung herself with an injured air upon the sofa  but i thought you liked this mr briggs he seems an accommodating sort of person  very accommodating going away just as we are expecting company  going away said mrs mayfield in alarm surely he must be told that we expect some preparation for our friends  oh said miss mayfield quickly his aunt will arrange that  mrs mayfield habitually mystified at her daughters moods said no more she however fulfilled her duty conscientiously by rising throwing a wrap over the young girl tucking it in at her feet and having as it were drawn a charitable veil over her peculiarities left her alone  at half past ten the coach dashed up to the halfway house with a flash of lights and a burst of cheery voices jeff coming upon the porch was met by mr mayfield accompanying a lady and two gentlemenevidently the guests alluded to by his daughter accustomed as jeff had become to mr mayfields patronizing superiority it seemed unbearable now and the easy indifference of the guests to his own presence touched him with a new bitterness here were her friends who were to take his place it was a relief to grasp yuba bills large hand and stand with him alone beside the bar  im ready to go with you tonight bill said jeff after a pause  bill put down his glassa sign of absorbing interest  and these yar strangers i fetched  aunty will take care of them ive fixed everything  bill laid both his powerful hands on jeffs shoulders backed him against the wall and surveyed him with great gravity  briggss son clar through a little off color but the grit all thar bully for you jeff he wrung jeffs hand between his own  bill said jeff hesitatingly  jeff  you wouldnt mind my getting up on the box now before all the folks get round  i reckon not thars the boxseat all ready for ye  climbing to his high perch jeff indistinguishable in the darkness looked out upon the porch and the moving figures of the passengers on bill growling out his orders to his active hostler and on the twinkling lights of the hotel windows in the mystery of the night and the bitterness of his heart everything looked strange there was a light in miss mayfields room but the curtains were drawn once he thought they moved but then fearful of the fascination of watching them he turned his face resolutely away  then to his relief the hour came the passengers reentered the coach bill had mounted the box and was slowly gathering his reins when a shrill voice rose from the porch  oh jeff  jeff leaned an anxious face out over the coach lamps  it was aunt sally breathless and on tiptoe reaching with a letter suthin you forgot then in a hoarse stage whisper perfectly audible to every one from her  jeff seized the letter with a burning face the whip snapped and the stage plunged forward into the darkness presently yuba bill reached down coolly detached one of the coach lamps and handed it to jeff without a word  jeff tore open the envelope it contained cyrus parkers bill receipted and the writ another small inclosure contained ten dollars and a few lines written in pencil in a large masculine business hand by the light of the lamp jeff read as follows   i hope you will forgive me for having tried to help you even in this accidental way before i knew how strong were your objections to help from me nobody knows this but myself even mr dodd thinks my father advanced the money the ten dollars the rascal would have kept but i made him disgorge it i did it all while you were looking for the letter in the woods pray forget all about it and any pain you may have had from j m   frank and practical as this letter appeared to be and doubtless as it was intended to be by its writer the reader will not fail to notice that miss mayfield said nothing of having overheard jeffs quarrel with the deputy and left him to infer that that functionary had betrayed him it was simply one of those unpleasant details not affecting the result usually overlooked in feminine ethics  for a moment jeff sat pale and dumb crushed under the ruins of his pride and selflove for a moment he hated miss mayfield small and triumphant how she must have inwardly laughed at his speech that morning with what refined cruelty she had saved this evidence of his humiliation to work her vengeance on him now he could not stand it he could not live under it he would go back and sell the househis clotheseverythingto pay this wicked heartless cruel girl that was killingyes killing  a strong hand took the swinginglantern from his unsteady fingers a strong hand possessed itself of the papers and miss mayfields note a strong arm was drawn around himfor his figure was swaying to and fro his head was giddy and his hat had fallen offand a strong voice albeit a little husky whispered in his ear  easy boy easy on the down grade itll be all one in a minit  jeff tried to comprehend him but his brain was whirling  pull yourself together jeff said bill after a pause thar look yar he said suddenly do you think you can drive six  the words recalled jeff to his senses bill laid the six reins in his hands a sense of life of activity of power came back to the young man as his fingers closed deliciously on the farreaching thrilling living leathern sinews that controlled the six horses and seemed to be instinct and magnetic with their bounding life jeff leaning back against them felt the strong youthful tide rush back to his heart and was himself again bill meantime took the lamp examined the papers and read miss mayfields note a grim smile stole over his face after a pause he said again give blue grass her head jeff dn it she aint miss mayfield  jeff relaxed the muscles of his wrists so as to throw the thumb and forefingers a trifle forward this simple action relieved blue grass alias miss mayfield and made the coach steadier and less jerky wonderful corelation of forces  thar said yuba bill quietly putting the coach lamp back in its place youre better already thars nothing like six horses to draw a woman out of a man ive knowed a case where it took eight mustangs but it was a mulatter from new orleans and they are pizen ye might hit up a little on the pinto hosshe aint harmin ye so now jeff take your time and take it easy and whats all this yer about  to control six fiery mustangs and at the same time give picturesque and affecting exposition of the subtle struggles of love and pride was a performance beyond jeffs powers he had recourse to an angry staccato which somehow seemed to him as ineffective as his previous discourse to miss mayfield he was a little incoherent and perhaps mixed his impressions with his facts but he nevertheless managed to convey to bill some general idea of the events of the past three days  and she sent ye off after that letter that wasnt thar while she fixed things up with dodd  yes said jeff furiously  ye neednt bully the pinto colt jeff he is doin his level best and she snaked that ar ten dollars outer dodd  yes and sent it back to me to me bill at such a time as this as if i was dead brokea mere tramp as if  in course in course said bill soothingly yet turning his head aside to bestow a deceitful smile upon the trees that whirled beside them and ye told her ye didnt want her money  yes billbut ititit was after she had done this  surely ill take the lines now jeff  he took them jeff relapsed into gloomy silence the starlight of that dewless sierran night was bright and cold and passionless there was no moon to lead the fancy astray with its faint mysteries and suggestions nothing but a clear grayishblue twilight with sharply silhouetted shadows pointed here and there with bright largespaced constant stars the deep breath of the pinewoods the faint cool resinous spices of bay and laurel at last brought surcease to his wounded spirit the blessed weariness of exhausted youth stole tenderly on him his head nodded dropped yuba bill with a grim smile drew him to his side enveloped him in his blanket and felt his head at last sink upon his own broad shoulder  a few minutes later the coach drew up at the summit house yuba bill did not dismount an unusual and disturbing circumstance that brought the barkeeper to the veranda  whats up old man  i am  sworn off your reglar pizen  my physician said bill gravely hez ordered me dry champagne every three hours  nevertheless the barkeeper lingered  whos that youre drynussin up there  i regret that i may not give yuba bills literal reply it suggested a form of inquiry at once distant indirect outrageous and impossible  the barkeeper flashed a lantern upon jeffs curls and his drooping eyelashes and mustaches  its that son o briggs o tuolumnepooty boy aint he  bill disdained a reply  played himself out down there i reckon left his rifle here in pawn  young man said bill gravely  old man  ef youre looking for a safe investment ez will pay ye better than fortyrod whiskey at two bits a glass jist you hang onter that ar rifle it may make your fortin yet or save ye from a drunkards grave with this ungracious pleasantry he hurried his dilatory passengers back into the coach cracked his whip and was again upon the road the lights of the summit house presently dropped here and there into the wasting shadows of the trees another stretch through the closeset ranks of pines another dash through the opening another whirl and rattle by overhanging rocks and the vehicle was swiftly descending bill put his foot on the brake threw his reins loosely on the necks of his cattle and looked leisurely back the great mountain was slowly and steadily rising between them and the valley they quitted  and at that same moment miss mayfield had crept from her bed and with a shawl around her pretty little figure was pressing her eyes against a blank window of the halfway house and wondering where he was now   v   the opening suggested by bill was not a fortunate one possibly views of business openings in the publichouse line taken from the tops of stagecoaches are not as judicious as those taken from less exalted levels certain it is that the goodwill of the lone star house promised little more pecuniary value than a conventional blessing it was in an older and more thickly settled locality than the halfway house indeed it was but half a mile away from campville famous in 49a place with a history and a disaster but young communities are impatient of settlements that through any accident fail to fulfil the extravagant promise of their youth and the wounded hamlet of campville had crept into the woods and died the lone star house was an attempt to woo the passing travelers from another point but its road led to campville and was already touched by its dryrot bill who honestly conceived that the infusion of fresh young blood like jeffs into the stagnant current would quicken it had to confess his disappointment i thought ye could put some go into the shanty jeff said bill and make it lively and invitin but the lack of vitality was not in the landlord but in the guests the regular customers were disappointed vacant hopeless men who gathered listlessly on the veranda and talked vaguely of the past their holloweyed feeble impotency affected the stranger even as it checked all ambition among themselves do what jeff might the habits of the locality were stronger than his individuality the dead ghosts of the past campville held their property by invisible mortmain  in the midst of this struggle the halfway house was sold spite of bills prediction the proceeds barely paid jeffs debts aunt sally prevented any troublesome consideration of her future by applying a small surplus of profit to the expenses of a journey back to her relatives in kentucky she wrote jeff a letter of cheerless instruction reminded him of the fulfillment of her worst prophecies regarding him but begged him in her absence to rely solely upon the word for the sperrit killeth she added vaguely whether this referred figuratively to jeffs business he did not stop to consider he was more interested in the information that the mayfields had removed to the summit hotel two days after he had left she allowed it was for her healths sake continued aunt sally but i reckon its another name for one of them city fellers who jined their party and is keepin company with her now they talk o property and stocks and sich worldly trifles all the time and its easy to see their idees is set together its allowed at the forks that mr mayfield paid parkers bill for you i said it wasnt so fur yed hev told me but if it is so jeff and ye didnt tell me it was for only one puppos and that wos that mayfield bribed ye to break off with his darter that was why you went off so suddent like a thief in the night and why miss mayfield never let on a word about you after you leftnot even your name  jeff crushed the letter between his fingers and going behind the bar poured out half a glass of stimulant and drank it it was not the first time since he came to the lone star house that he had found this easy relief from his present thought it was not the first time that he had found this dangerous ally of sure and swift service in bringing him up or down to that level of his dreary sodden guests so necessary to his trade jeff had not the excuse of the inborn drunkards taste he was impulsive and extreme at the end of the four weeks he came out on the porch one night as bill drew up you must take me from this place tonight he said in a broken voice scarce like his own when were on the road we can arrange matters but i must go tonight  but where asked bill  anywhere only i must go from here i shall go if i have to walk  bill looked hard at the young man his face was flushed his eyes bloodshot and his hands trembled not with excitement but with a vacant purposeless impotence bill looked a little relieved youve been drinking too hard jeff i thought better of ye than that  i think better of myself than that said jeff with a certain wild halfhysterical laugh and that is why i want to go dont be alarmed bill he added i have strength enough to save myself and i shall but it isnt worth the struggle here  he left the lone star house that night he would he said to bill go on to sacramento and try to get a situation as clerk or porter there he was too old to learn a trade he said little more when after fortyeight hours inability to eat drink or sleep bill looking at his haggard face and staring eyes pressed him to partake medicinally from a certain black bottle jeff gently put it aside and saying with a sad smile i can get along without it ive gone through more than this left his mentor in a state of mingled admiration and perplexity  at sacramento he found a commercial opening but certain habits of personal independence combined with a direct truthfulness and simplicity were not conducive to business advancement he was frank and in his habits impulsive and selfishly outspoken his employer a goodnatured man successful in his way anxious to serve his own interest and jeffs equally strove and labored with him but in vain his employers wife a still more goodnatured woman successful in her way and equally anxious to serve jeffs interests and her own also strove with him as unsuccessfully at the end of a month he discharged his employer after a simple boyish utterly unbusinesslike interview and secretly tore up his wifes letter i dont know what to make of that chap said the husband to his wife hes about as civilized as an injun and as conceited added the lady  howbeit he took his conceit his sorrows his curls mustaches broad shoulders and fifty dollars into humble lodgings in a back street the days succeeding this were the most restful he had passed since he left the halfway house to wander through the town half conscious of its strangeness and novel bustling life and to dream of a higher and nobler future with miss mayfieldto feel no responsibility but that of waitingwas i regret to say a pleasure to him he made no acquaintances except among the poorer people and the children he was sometimes hungry he was always poorly clad but these facts carried no degradation with them now he read much and in his wayjeffs waytried to improve his mind his recent commercial experience had shown him various infelicities in his speech and accent he learned to correct certain provincialisms he was conscious that miss mayfield must have noticed them yet his odd irrational pride kept him from ever regretting them if they had offered a possible excuse for her treatment of him  on one of these nights his steps chanced to lead him into a gamblingsaloon the place had offered no temptation to him his dealings with the goddess chance had been of less active nature nevertheless he placed his last five dollars on the turn of a card he won he won repeatedly his gains had reached a considerable sum when flushed excited and absorbed he was suddenly conscious that he had become the centre of observation at the table looking up he saw that the dealer had paused and with the cards in his motionless fingers was gazing at him with fixed eyes and a white face  jeff rose and passed hurriedly to his side whats the matter  the gambler shrunk slightly as he approached whats your name  briggs  god i knew it how much have you got there he continued in a quick whisper pointing to jeffs winnings  five hundred dollars  ill give you double if youll get up and quit the board  why asked jeff haughtily  why repeated the man fiercely why well your father shot himself thar where youre sittin at this table and he added with a halfforced halfhysterical laugh hes playin at me over your shoulders  jeff lifted a face as colorless as the gamblers own went back to his seat and placed his entire gains on a single card the gambler looked at him nervously but dealt there was a pause a slight movement where jeff stood and then a simultaneous cry from the players as they turned towards him but his seat was vacant run after him call him back hes won again but he had vanished utterly  how he left or what indeed followed he never clearly remembered his movements must have been automatic for when two hours later he found himself at the pioneer coach office with his carpetbag and blankets by his side he could not recall how or why he had come he had a dumb impression that he had barely escaped some dire calamityrather that he had only temporarily averted itand that he was still in the shadow of some impending catastrophe of destiny he must go somewhere he must do something to be saved he had no money he had no friends even yuba bill had been transferred to another route miles away yet in the midst of this stupefaction it was a part of his strange mental condition that trivial details of miss mayfields face and figure and even apparel were constantly before him to the exclusion of consecutive thought a collar she used to wear a ribbon she had once tied around her waist a blue vein in her dropped eyelid a curve in her soft full birdlike throat the arch of her instep in her small bootsall these were plainer to him than the future or even the present but a voice in his ear a figure before his abstracted eyes at last broke upon his reverie  jeff briggs  jeff mechanically took the outstretched hand of a young clerk of the pioneer coach company who had once accompanied yuba bill and stopped at the halfway house he endeavored to collect his thoughts here seemed to be an opportunity to go somewhere  what are you doing now said the young man briskly  nothing said jeff simply  oh i seegoing home  home the word stung sharply through jeffs benumbed consciousness  no he stammered that is  look here jeff broke in the young man ive got a chance for you that dont fall in a mans way every day wells fargo  cos treasure messenger from robinsons ferry to mempheys has slipped out the place is vacant i reckon i can get it for you  when  nowtonight  im ready  come then  in ten minutes they were in the companys office where its manager a man famous in those days for his boldness and shrewdness still lingered in the dispatch of business  the young clerk briefly but deferentially stated certain facts a few questions and answers followed of which jeff heard only the words tuolumne and yuba bill  sit down mr briggs goodnight roberts  the young clerk with an encouraging smile at jeff bowed himself out as the manager seated himself at his desk and began to write  you know the country pretty well between the fork and the summit mr briggs he said without looking up  i lived there said jeff  that was some months ago wasnt it  six months said jeff with a sigh  its changed for the worse since your house was shut up theres a long stretch of unsettled country infested by bad characters  jeff sat silent briggs  sir  the last man but one who preceded you was shot by road agents        highway robbers  yes sir  we lost sixty thousand dollars up there  yes  your father was briggs of tuolumne  yes sir jeffs head dropped but glancing shyly up he saw a pleasant smile on his questioners face he was still writing rapidly but was apparently enjoying at the same time some pleasant recollection  your father and i lost nearly sixty thousand dollars together one night ten years ago when we were both younger  yes sir said jeff dubiously  but it was our own money jeff  yes sir  heres your appointment he said briefly throwing away his pen folding what he had written and handing it to jeff it was the first time that he had looked at him since he entered he now held out his hand grasped jeffs and said goodnight   vi   it was late the next evening when jeff drew up at the coach office at robinsons ferry where he was to await the coming of the summit coach his mind lifted only temporarily out of its denumbed condition during his interview with the manager again fell back into its dull abstraction fully embarked upon his dangerous journey accepting all the meaning of the trust imposed upon him he was yet vaguely conscious that he did not realize its full importance he had neither the dread nor the stimulation of coming danger he had faced death before in the boyish confidence of animal spirits his pulse now was scarcely stirred with anticipation once or twice before in the extravagance of his passion he had imagined himself rescuing miss mayfield from danger or even dying for her during his journey his mind had dwelt fully and minutely on every detail of their brief acquaintance she was continually before him the tones of her voice were in his ears the suggestive touch of her fingers the thrill that his lips had felt when he kissed themall were with him now but only as a memory in his coming fate in his future life he saw her not he believed it was a premonition of coming death  he made a few preparations the companys agent had told him that the treasure letters and dispatches which had accumulated to a considerable amount would be handed to him on the box and that the arms and ammunition were in the boot a less courageous and determined man might have been affected by the cold practical brutality of certain advice and instructions offered him by the agent but jeff recognized this compliment to his determination even before the agent concluded his speech by saying but i reckon they knew what they were about in the lower office when they sent you up i dare say you kin give me pints ef ye cared to for all yere soft spoken there are only four passengers booked through we hev to be a little partikler suspectin spies two of the four ye kin depend upon to get the top o their dd heads blowed off the first fire he added grimly  at ten oclock the summit coach flashed rattled glittered and snapped like a disorganized firework up to the door of the companys office a familiar figure but more than usually truculent and aggressive slowly descended with violent oaths from the box without seeing jeff it strode into the office  now then said yuba bill addressing the agent whars that godforsaken fool that wells fargo  co hev sent up yar to take charge o their treasure because id like to introduce him to the champion idgit of calaveras county thats been selected to go to hll with him and thats me yuba bill pint him out dont keep me waitin  the agent grinned and pointed to jeff  both men recoiled in astonishment yuba bill was the first to recover his speech  its a lie he roared or somebody has been putting up a job on ye jeff because ive been twenty years in the service and am such a natral born mule that when the company strokes my back and sez youre the ony mule we kin trust bill i starts up and goes out as a blasted wooden figgerhead for road agents to lay fur and practice on it dont follow that youve any call to go  it was my own seeking bill said jeff with one of his old sweet boyish smiles i didnt know you were to drive but youre not going back on me now bill are you youre not going to send me off with another volunteer  that be dd growled bill nevertheless for ten minutes he reviled the pioneer coach company with picturesque imprecation tendered his resignation repeatedly to the agent and at the end of that time as everybody expected mounted the box and with a final malediction involving the whole settlement was off  on the road jeff in a few hurried sentences told his story bill scarcely seemed to listen look yar jeff he said suddenly  yes bill  if the worst happens and ye go under youll tell your father if i dont happen to see him first it wasnt no job of mine and i did my best to get ye out of it  yes said jeff in a faint voice  it maynt be so bad said bill softening they know dn em weve got a pile aboard ez well as if they seed that agent gin it ye but they also know weve prepared  i wasnt thinking of that bill i was thinking of my father and he told bill of the gambling episode at sacramento  dye mean to say ye left them hounds with a thousand dollars of yer hardearned  gambling gains bill interrupted jeff quietly  exactly well bill subsided into an incoherent growl after a few moments pause he began again yer ready as ye used to be with a sixshooter jeff times when ye was a boy and i uster chuck halfdollars in the air fur ye to make warts on  i reckon said jeff with a faint smile  thars two pints on the road to be looked to the woods beyond the blacksmiths shop that uster be the fringe of alder and buckeye by the crossing below your housepints where they kin fetch you without a show thars two ways o meetin them thar one way ez to pull up and trust to luck and brag the other way is to whip up and yell and send the whole six kiting by like hll  yes said jeff  the only drawback to that plan is this the road lies along the edge of a precipice straight down a thousand feet into the river ef these devils get a shot into any one o the six and it drops the coach turns sharp off and down we go the whole kerboodle of us plump into the stanislaus  and they dont get the money said jeff quietly  well no replied yuba bill staring at jeff whose face was set as a flint against the darkness i should reckon not he then drew a long breath glanced at jeff again and said between his teeth well im dd  at the next station they changed horses bill personally supervising especially as regarded the welfare and proper condition of blue grass who here was brought out as a leader formerly there was no change of horses at this station and this novelty excited jeffs remark these yar chaps say thars no station at the summit now growled bill in explanation the hotel is closed and its all private property bought by some chap from frisco thar ought to be a law agin such doins  this suggested obliteration of the last traces of miss mayfield seemed to jeff as only a corroboration of his premonition he should never hear from her again yet to have stood under the roof that last sheltered her to perchance have met some one who had seen her laterthis was a fancy that had haunted him on his journey it was all over now perhaps it was for the best  with the sinking behind of the lights of the station the occupants of the coach knew that the dangerous part of the journey had begun the two guards in the coach had already made obtrusive and warlike preparations to the illconcealed disgust of yuba bill id hev been willin to get through this yar job without the burnin of powder but ef any of them devils ez is waitin for us would be content with a shot at them fancy policemen inside id pull up and give em a show having relieved his mind bill said no more and the two men relapsed into silence the moon shone brightly and peacefully a fact pointed out by bill as unfavorably deepening the shadows of the woods and bringing the coach and the road into greater relief  an hour passed what were yuba bills thoughts are not a part of this history that they were turbulent and aggressive might be inferred from the occasional growls and interjected oaths that broke from his lips but jeff strange anomaly due perhaps to youth and moonlight was wrapped in a sensuous dream of miss mayfield of the scent of her dark hair as he had drawn her to his side of the outlines of her sweet form that had for a moment lightly touched his ownof anything i fear but the death he believed he was hastening to but  jeff said bill in an unmistakable tone  yes said jeff  that ar clump o buckeye on the ridge ready there leaning over the box to the guards within a responsive rustle in the coach which now bounded forward as if instinct with life and intelligence  jeff said bill in an odd altered voice take the lines a minit jeff took them bill stooped towards the boot a peaceful moment a peaceful outlook from the coach the white moonlit road stretching to the ridge no noise but the steady gallop of the horses  then a yellow flash breaking from the darkness of the buckeye a crack like the snap of a whip yuba bill steadying himself for a moment and then dropping at jeffs feet  they got me jeff buti drawed their fire dont drop the lines dont speak fortheythink im you and you me  the flash had illuminated jeff as to the danger as to bills sacrifice but above all and overwhelming all to a thrilling sense of his own power and ability  yet he sat like a statue six masked figures had appeared from the very ground clinging to the bits of the horses the coach stopped two wild purposeless shotsthe first and last fired by the guardswere answered by the muzzle of six rifles pointed into the windows and the passengers foolishly and impotently filed out into the road  now bill said a voice which jeff instantly recognized as the blacksmiths we wont keep ye long so hand down the treasure  the mans foot was on the wheel in another instant he would be beside jeff and discovery was certain jeff leaned over and unhooked the coach lamp as if to assist him with its light as if in turning he stumbled broke the lamp ignited the kerosene and scattered the wick and blazing fluid over the haunches of the wheelers the maddened animals gave one wild plunge forwards the coach followed twice its length throwing the blacksmith under its wheels and driving the other horses towards the bank but as the lamp broke in jeffs right hand his practiced left hand discharged its hidden derringer at the head of the robber who had held the bit of blue grass and throwing the useless weapon away he laid the whip smartly on her back she leaped forward madly dragging the other leaders with her and in the next moment they were free and wildly careering down the grade  a dozen shots followed them the men were protected by the coach but yuba bill groaned  are you hit again asked jeff hastily he had forgotten his saviour  no but the horses are i felt em look at em jeff  jeff had gathered up the almost useless reins the horses were running away but blue grass was limping  for gods sake said bill desperately dragging his wounded figure above the dashboard keep her up lift her up jeff till we pass the curve dont let her drop or were  can you hold the reins said jeff quickly  give em here  jeff passed them to the wounded man then with his bowieknife between his teeth he leaped over the dashboard on the backs of the wheelers he extinguished the blazing drops that the wind had not blown out of their smarting haunches and with the skill and instinct of a mexican vaquero made his way over their turbulent tossing backs to blue grass cut her traces and reins and as the vehicle neared the curve with a sharp lash drove her to the bank where she sank even as the coach darted by bill uttered a feeble hurrah but at the same moment the reins dropped from his fingers and he sank at the bottom of the boot  riding postilionwise jeff could control the horses the dangerous curve was passed but not the possibility of pursuit the single leader he was bestriding was pantingmore than that he was sweating and from the evidence of jeffs hands sweating blood back of his shoulder was a jagged hole from which his lifeblood was welling the offwheel horse was limping too that last volley was no foolish outburst of useless rage but was deliberate and premeditated skill jeff drew the reins and as the coach stopped the horse he was riding fell dead into the silence that followed broke the measured beat of horses hoofs on the road above he was pursued  to select the best horse of the remaining unscathed three to break open the boot and place the treasure on his back and to abandon and leave the senseless bill lying there was the unhesitating work of a moment great heroes and great lovers are invariably oneideaed men and jeff was at that moment both  eighty thousand dollars in golddust and jeffs weight was a handicap nevertheless he flew forward like the wind presently he fell to listening a certain hoofbeat in the rear was growing more distinct a bitter thought flashed through his mind he looked back over the hill appeared the foremost of his pursuers it was the blacksmith mounted on the fleetest horse in the countyjeffs own horserabbit  but there are compensations in all new trials as jeff faced round again he saw he had reached the open tableland and the bleak walls and ghastly untenanted windows of the halfway house rose before him in the distance jeff was master of the ground here he was entering the shadow of the woodsmiss mayfields woods and there was a cut off from the road and a bridlepath known only to himself hard by to find it leap the roadside ditch dash through the thicket and rein up by the road again was swiftly done  take a gentle woman betray her trust outrage her best feelings drive her into a corner and you have a fury take a gentle trustful man abuse him show him the folly of this gentleness and kindness prove to him that it is weakness drive him into a corner and you have a savage and it was this savage with an indians memory and an indians eye and ear that suddenly confronted the blacksmith  what more a single shot from a trained hand and oneideaed intellect settled the blacksmiths business and temporarily ended this iliad i say temporarily for mr dodd formerly deputysheriff prudently pulled up at the top of the hill and observing his principal bend his head forwards and act like a drunken man until he reeled limp and sideways from the saddle and noticing further that jeff took his place with a wellfilled saddlebag concluded to follow cautiously and unobtrusively in the rear   vii   but jeff saw him not with mind and will bent on one objectto reach the first habitation the summit and send back help and assistance to his wounded comradehe urged rabbit forward the mare knew her rider but he had no time for caresses through the smarting of his hands he had only just noticed that they were badly burned and the skin was peeling from them he had confounded the blood that was flowing from a cut on his scalp with that from the wounded horse it was one hour yet to the summit but the road was good the moon was bright he knew what rabbit could do and it was not yet ten oclock  as the white outbuildings and irregular outlines of the summit house began to be visible jeff felt a singular return of his former dreamy abstraction the hour of peril anger and excitement he had just passed through seemed something of years ago or rather to be obliterated with all else that had passed since he had looked upon that scene yet it was all changedstrangely changed what jeff had taken for the white wooden barns and outhouses were greenhouses and conservatories the summit hotel was a picturesque villa nestling in the selfsame trees but approached through cultivated fields dwellings of laborers parklike gates and walls and all the bountiful appointments of wealth and security jeff thought of yuba bills malediction and understood it as he gazed  the barking of dogs announced his near approach to the principal entrance lights were still burning in the upper windows of the house and its offices he was at once surrounded by the strange medley of a californian rancheros service peons chinese and vaqueros jeff briefly stated his business ah carrajo this was a matter for the majordomo or better the padronewilson but the padrone wilson called out by the tumult appeared in persona handsome resolute middleaged man who in a twinkling dispersed the group to barn and stable with a dozen orders of preparation and then turned to jeff  you are hurt come in  jeff followed him dazedly into the house the same sense of remote abstraction of vague dreaminess was overcoming him he resented it and fought against it but in vain he was only half conscious that his host had bathed his head and given him some slight restorative had said something to him soothingly and had left him jeff wondered if he had fainted or was about to fainthe had a nervous dread of that womanish weaknessor if he were really hurt worse than he believed he tried to master himself and grasp the situation by minutely examining the room it was luxuriously furnished jeff had but once before sat in such an armchair as the one that half embraced him and as a boy he had dim recollections of a life like this of which his father was part to poor jeff with his throbbing head his smarting hands and his lapsing moments of half forgetfulness this seemed to be a return of his old premonition there was a vague perfume in the room like that which he remembered when he was in the woods with miss mayfield he believed he was growing faint again and was about to rise when the door opened behind him  is there anything we can do for you mr wilson has gone to seek your friend and has sent manuel for a doctor  her voice he rose hurriedly turned she was standing in the doorway  she uttered a slight cry turned very pale advanced towards him stopped and leaned against the chimneypiece  i didnt know it was you  with her actual presence jeffs dream and weakness fled he rose up before her his old bashful stammering awkward self  i didnt know you lived here miss mayfield  if you had sent word you were coming said miss mayfield recovering her color brightly in one cheek  the possibility of having sent a messenger in advance to advise miss mayfield of his projected visit did not strike jeff as ridiculous your true lover is far beyond such trivialities he accepted the rebuke meekly he said he was sorry  you might have known it  what miss mayfield  that i was here if you wished to know  jeff did not reply he bowed his head and clasped his burned hands together miss mayfield saw their raw surfaces saw the ugly cut on his head pitied him but went on hastily with both cheeks burning to say womanlike what was then deepest in her heart  my brotherinlaw told me your adventure but i did not know until i entered this room that the gentleman i wished to help was one who had once rejected my assistance who had misunderstood me and cruelly insulted me oh forgive me mr briggs jeff had risen i did not mean that but mr jeffjeffoh she had caught his tortured hand and had wrung a movement of pain from him oh dear what did i do now but mr jeff after what has passed after what you said to me when you went away when you were at that dreadful place campville when you were two months in sacramento you mightyou ought to have let me know it  jeff turned her face more beautiful than he had ever seen it alive and eloquent with every thought that her womans speech but half expressed was very near hisso near that under her honest eyes the wretched scales fell from his own his selfwrought shackles crumbled away and he dropped upon his knees at her feet as she sank into the chair he had quitted both his hands were grasped in her own  you went away and i stayed she said reflectively  i had no home miss mayfield  nor had i i had to buy this she said with a delicious simplicity and bring a family here too she added in case youshe stopped with a slight color  forgive me said jeff burying his face in her hands  jeff  jessie  dont you think you were a littlejust a littlemean  yes  miss mayfield uttered a faint sigh he looked into her anxious cheeks and eyes his arm stole round her their lips met for the first time in one long lingering kiss then i fear for the second time  jeff said miss mayfield suddenly becoming practical and sweetly possessory you must have your hands bound up in cotton  yes said jeff cheerfully  and you must go instantly to bed  jeff stared  because my sister will think it very late for me to be sitting up with a gentleman  the idea that miss mayfield was responsible to anybody was something new to jeff but he said hastily i must stay and wait for bill he risked his life for me  oh yes you must tell me all about it i may wait for that  jeff possessed himself of the chair in some way he also possessed himself of miss mayfield without entirely dispossessing her then he told his story he hesitated over the episode of the blacksmith im afraid i killed him jessie  miss mayfield betrayed little concern at this possible extreme measure with a dangerous neighbor he cut your head jeff she said passing her little hand through his curls  no said jeff hastily that must have been done before  well said miss mayfield conclusively he would if hed dared and you brought off that wretched money in spite of him poor dear jeff  yes said jeff kissing her  where is it asked jessie looking round the room  oh just out there  out where  on my horse you know outside the door continued jeff a little uneasily as he rose ill go and  you careless boy said miss mayfield jumping up ill go with you  they passed out on the porch together holding each others hands like children the forgotten rabbit was not there miss mayfield called a vaquero  ah yesthe caballeros horse of a certainty the other caballero had taken it  the other caballero gasped jeff  si senor the one who arrived with you or a moment the very next moment after you your friend he said  jeff staggered against the porch and cast one despairing reproachful look at miss mayfield  oh jeff jeff dont look so i know i ought not to have kept you its a mistake jeff believe me  its no mistake said jeff hoarsely go he said turning to the vaquero gobring but his speech failed he attempted to gesticulate with his hands ran forward a few steps staggered and fell fainting on the ground  help me with the caballero into the blue room said miss mayfield white as jeff and hark ye manuel you know every ruffian man or woman on this road that horse and those saddlebags must be here tomorrow if you have to pay double what theyre worth  si senora  jeff went off into fever into delirium into helpless stupor from time to time he moaned bill and the treasure on the third day in a lucid interval as he lay staring at the wall miss mayfield put in his hand a letter from the company acknowledging the receipt of the treasure thanking him for his zeal and inclosing a handsome check  jeff sat up and put his hands to his head  i told you it was taken by mistake and was easily found said miss mayfield didnt i  yesand bill  you know he is so much better that he expects to leave us next week  andjessie  therego to sleep  at the end of a week she introduced jeff to her sisterinlaw having previously run her fingers through his hair to insure that becomingness to his curls which would better indicate his moral character and spoke of him as one of her oldest californian friends  at the end of two weeks she again presented him as her affianced husbanda long engagement of a year being just passed mr wilson who was bored by the mountain life undertaken to please his rich wife and richer sister saw a chance of escape here and bore willing testimony to the distant mr and mrs mayfield of the excellence of miss jessies choice and yuba bill was jeffs best man  the name of briggs remained a power in tuolumne and calaveras county mr and mrs briggs never had but one word of disagreement or discussion one day jeff looking over some old accounts of his wifes found an unreceipted unvouched for expenditure of twenty thousand dollars what is this for jessie he asked  oh its all right jeff  but here the now businesslike and practical mr briggs father of a family felt called upon to make some general remarks regarding the necessity of exactitude in accounts etc  but id rather not tell you jeff  but you ought to jessie  well then dear it was to get those saddlebags of yours from that rascal dodd said little mrs briggs meekly
