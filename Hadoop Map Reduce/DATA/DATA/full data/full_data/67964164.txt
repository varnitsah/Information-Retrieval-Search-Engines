67964164	night watches  by ww jacobs     the unknown  handsome is as andsome does said the nightwatchman  its an old saying but its true  give a chap good looks and its precious little else that is given to im  hes lucky when is good looks ave gornor partly gornto get a berth as nightwatchman or some other hard and badpaid job  one drawback to a goodlooking man is that he generally marries young not because e wants to but because somebody else wants im to  and that aint the worst of it the handsomest chap i ever knew married five times and got seven years for it  it wasnt his fault pore chap he simply couldnt say no  one o the bestlooking men i ever knew was capn bill smithers wot used to come up here once a week with a schooner called the wild rose funny thing about im was he didnt seem to know about is good looks and he was one o the quietest bestbehaved men that ever came up the london river  considering that he was mistook for me more than once it was just as well  he didnt marry until e was close on forty and then e made the mistake of marrying a widderwoman  she was like all the rest of em only worse  afore she was married butter wouldnt melt in er mouth but as soon as she ad got her lines safe she began to make up for it  for the fust month or two e didnt mind it e rather liked being fussed arter but when he found that he couldnt go out for arf an hour without having er with im he began to get tired of it  her idea was that e was too handsome to be trusted out alone and every trip he made e had to write up in a book day by day wot e did with himself  even then she wasnt satisfied and arter saying that a wifes place was by the side of er husband she took to sailing with im every vyge  wot he could ha seen in er i dont know  i asked im one eveningin a roundabout wayand he answered in such a long roundabout way that i didnt know wot to make of it till i see that she was standing just behind me listening  arter that i heard er asking questions about me but i didnt ave to listen i could hear er twenty yards away and singing to myself at the same time  arter that she treated me as if i was the dirt beneath er feet  she never spoke to me but used to speak against me to other people  she was always talking to them about the sleepingsickness and things o that kind  she said nightwatchmen always made er think of it somehow but she didnt know why and she couldnt tell you if you was to ask her the only thing i was thankful for was that i wasnt er husband she stuck to im like his shadow and i began to think at last it was a pity she adnt got some thing to be jealous about and something to occupy her mind with instead o me  she ought to ave a lesson i ses to the skipper one evening  are you going to be follered about like this all your life  if she was made to see the foolishness of er ways she might get sick of it  my idea was to send her on a wildgoose chase and while the wild rose was away i thought it out  i wrote a loveletter to the skipper signed with the name of dorothy and asked im to meet me at cleopatras needle on the embankment at eight oclock on wednesday  i told im to look out for a tall girl mrs smithers was as short as they make em with mischievous brown eyes in a blue at with red roses on it  i read it over careful and arter marking it private twice in front and once on the back i stuck it down so that it could be blown open amost and waited for the schooner to come back  then i gave a vanboy twopence to and it to mrs smithers wot was sitting on the deck alone and tell er it was a letter for captain smithers  i was busy with a barge wot happened to be handy at the time but i eard her say that she would take it and give it to im  when i peeped round she ad got the letter open and was leaning over the side to windard trying to get er breath  every now and then shed give another look at the letter and open er mouth and gasp but by and by she got calmer and arter putting it back in the envelope she gave it a lick as though she was going to bite it and stuck it down agin  then she went off the wharf and im blest if five minutes arterwards a young fellow didnt come down to the ship with the same letter and ask for the skipper  who gave it you ses the skipper as soon as e could speak  a lady ses the young fellow  the skipper waved im away and then e walked up and down the deck like a man in a dream  bad news  i ses looking up and catching is eye  no he ses no  only a note about a couple o casks o soda  he stuffed the letter in is pocket and sat on the side smoking till his wife came back in five minutes time smiling all over with good temper  its a nice evening she ses and i think ill just run over to dalston and see my cousin joe  the skipper got up like a lamb and said hed go and clean imself  you neednt come if you feel tired she ses smiling at im  the skipper could ardly believe his ears  i do feel tired he ses  ive had a heavy day and i feel more like bed than anything else  you turn in then she ses  ill be all right by myself  she went down and tidied herself upnot that it made much difference to erand arter patting him on the arm and giving me a stare that would ha made most men blink she took herself off  i was pretty busy that evening  wot with shifting lighters from under the jetty and sweeping up it was pretty near hapast seven afore i ad a minute i could call my own  i put down the broom at last and was just thinking of stepping round to the bulls head for a arfpint when i see capn smithers come off the ship on to the wharf and walk to the gate  i thought you was going to turn in i ses  i did think of it he ses then i thought praps id better stroll as far as broad street and meet my wife  it was all i could do to keep a straight face  id a pretty good idea where she ad gorn and it wasnt dalston  come in and ave arf a pint fust i ses  no i shall be late he ses hurrying off  i went in and ad a glass by myself and stood there so long thinking of mrs smithers walking up and down by cleopatras needle that at last the landlord fust asked me wot i was laughing at and then offered to make me laugh the other side of my face  and then he wonders why people go to the albion  i locked the gate rather earlier than usual that night  sometimes if im up that end i leave it a bit late but i didnt want mrs smithers to come along and nip in without me seeing her face  it was ten oclock afore i heard the bell go and when i opened the wicket and looked out i was surprised to see that she ad got the skipper with er  and of all the miserablelooking objects i ever saw in my life he was the worst  she ad him tight by the arm and there was a look on er face that amost scared me  did you go all the way to dalston for her  i ses to im  mrs smithers made a gasping sort o noise but the skipper didnt answer a word  she shoved him in in front of er and stood ever im while he climbed aboard  when he held out is hand to help er she struck it away  i didnt get word with im till five oclock next morning when he came up on deck with his air all rough and is eyes red for want of sleep  havent ad a wink all night he ses stepping on to the wharf  i gave a little cough  didnt she ave a pleasant time at dalston i ses  he walked a little further off from the ship  she didnt go there he ses in a whisper  youve got something on your mind i ses  wot is it  he wouldnt tell me at fust but at last he told me all about the letter from dorothy and is wife reading it unbeknown to im and going to meet er  it was an awful meeting  he ses  awful  i couldnt think wot to make of it  was the gal there then  i ses staring at im  no ses the skipper but i was  you  i ses starting back  you  wot for  im surprised at you i wouldnt ha believed it of you  i felt a bit curious he ses with a silly sort o smile  but wot i cant understand is why the gal didnt turn up  im ashamed of you bill i ses very severe  praps she did he ses arf to imself and then saw my missis standing there waiting  praps that was it  or praps it was somebody aving a game with you i ses  youre getting old bill he ses very short  you dont understand its some pore gal thats took a fancy to me and its my dooty to meet er and tell her ow things are  he walked off with his ead in the air and if e took that letter out once and looked at it he did five times  chuck it away i ses going up to him  certainly not he ses folding it up careful and stowing it away in is breastpocket  shes took a fancy to me and its my dooty  you said that afore i ses  he stared at me nasty for a moment and then e ses you aint seen any young lady hanging about ere i suppose bill  a tall young lady with a blue hat trimmed with red roses  i shook my ead  if you should see er he ses  ill tell your missis i ses  it ud be much easier for her to do her dooty properly than it would you  shed enjoy doing it too  he went off agin then and i thought he ad done with me but he adnt he spoke to me that evening as if i was the greatest friend he ad in the world  i ad two arfpints with im at the albionwith his missis walking up and down outsideand arter the second arfpint he said he wanted to meet dorothy and tell er that e was married and that he oped she would meet some good man that was worthy of er  i had a weeks peace while the ship was away but she was hardly made fast afore i ad it all over agin and agin  are you sure theres been no more letters he ses  sartain i ses  thats right he ses thats right  and you avent seen her walking up and down  no i ses  ave you been on the lookout he ses  i dont suppose a nice gal like that would come and shove her ead in at the gate  did you look up and down the road  yes i ses  ive fair made my eyes ache watching for her  i cant understand it he ses  its a mystery to me unless praps shes been taken ill  she must ave seen me here in the fust place and she managed to get hold of my name  mark my words i shall ear from her agin  ow do you know i ses  i feel it ere he ses very solemn laying his and on his chest  i didnt know wot to do  wot with is foolishness and his mississ temper i see i ad made a mess of it  he told me she had ardly spoke a word to im for two days and when i saidbeing a married man myself that it might ha been worse e said i didnt know wot i was talking about  i did a bit o thinking arter he ad gorn aboard agin  i dursnt tell im that i ad wrote the letter but i thought if he ad one or two more hed see that some one was aving a game with im and that it might do im good  besides which it was a little amusement for me  arter everybody was in their beds asleep i sat on a clerks stool in the office and wrote im another letter from dorothy  i called im dear bill and i said ow sorry i was that i adnt had even a sight of im lately having been laid up with a sprained ankle and ad only just got about agin  i asked im to meet me at cleopatras needle at eight oclock and said that i should wear the blue at with red roses  it was a very good letter but i can see now that i done wrong in writing it  i was going to post it to im but as i couldnt find an envelope without the name of the blessed wharf on it i put it in my pocket till i got ome  i got ome at about a quarter to seven and slept like a child till pretty near four  then i went downstairs to ave my dinner  the moment i opened the door i see there was something wrong  three times my missis licked er lips afore she could speak  her face ad gone a dirty white colour and she was leaning forward with her ands on her ips trembling all over with temper  is my dinner ready  i ses easylike  cos im ready for it  ii wonder i dont tear you limb from limb she ses catching her breath  wots the matter  i ses  and then boil you she ses between her teeth  you in one pot and your precious dorothy in another  if anybody ad offered me five pounds to speak then i couldnt ha done it  i see wot id done in a flash and i couldnt say a word but i kept my presence o mind and as she came round one side o the table i went round the other  wot ave you got to say for yourself  she ses with a scream  nothing i ses at last  its all a mistake  mistake she ses  yes you made a mistake leaving it in your pocket thats all the mistake youve made  thats wot you do is it when youre supposed to be at the wharf  go about with a blue at with red roses in it  at your time o life and a wife at ome working herself to death to make both ends meet and keep you respectable  its all a mistake i ses  the letter wasnt for me  oh no o course not she ses  thats why youd got it in your pocket i suppose  and i suppose youll say your name aint bill next  dont say things youll be sorry for i ses  ill take care o that she ses  i might be sorry for not saying some things but i dont think i shall  i dont think she was  i dont think she forgot anything and she raked up things that i ad contradicted years ago and wot i thought was all forgot  and every now and then when she stopped for breath shed try and get round to the same side of the table i was  she follered me to the street door when i went and called things up the road arter me  i ad a snack at a coffeeshop for my dinner but i adnt got much appetite for it i was too full of trouble and finding fault with myself and i went off to my work with a art as heavy as lead  i suppose i adnt been on the wharf ten minutes afore capn smithers came sidling up to me but i got my spoke in fust  look ere i ses if youre going to talk about that forward hussy wots been writing to you i aint  im sick and tired of er  forward hussy  he ses  forward hussy  and afore i could drop my broom he gave me a punch in the jaw that pretty near broke it  say another word against her he ses and ill knock your ugly ead off how dare you insult a lady  i thought i should ave gone crazy at fust but i went off into the office without a word  some men would ha knocked im down for it but i made allowances for is state o mind and i stayed inside until i see im get aboard agin  he was sitting on deck when i went out and his missis too but neither of em spoke a word  i picked up my broom and went on sweeping when suddenly i eard a voice at the gate i thought i knew and in came my wife  ho  she ses calling out  aint you gone to meet that gal at cleopatras needle yet  you aint going to keep er waiting are you  hsh  i ses  hsh yourself she ses shouting  ive done nothing to be ashamed of  i dont go to meet other peoples husbands in a blue at with red roses  i dont write em loveletters and say hsh to my wife when she ventures to make a remark about it  i may work myself to skin and bone for a man wots old enough to know better but im not going to be trod on  dorothy indeed  ill dorothy er if i get the chance  mrs smithers wot ad been listening with all her ears jumped up and so did the skipper and mrs smithers came to the side in two steps  did you say dorothy maam  she ses to my missis  i did ses my wife  shes been writing to my husband  it must be the same one ses mrs smithers  shes been writing to mine too  the two of em stood there looking at each other for a minute and then my wife holding the letter between er finger and thumb as if it was pison passed it to mrs smithers  its the same ses mrs smithers  was the envelope marked private  i didnt see no envelope ses my missis  this is all i found  mrs smithers stepped on to the wharf and taking old of my missis by the arm led her away whispering  at the same moment the skipper walked across the deck and whispered to me  wot dye mean by it  he ses  wot dye mean by aving letters from dorothy and not telling me about it  i cant help aving letters any more than you can i ses  now praps youll understand wot i meant by calling er a forward hussy  fancy er writing to you he ses wrinkling is forehead  pph  she must be crazy  praps it aint a gal at all i ses  my belief is somebody is aving a game with us  dont be a fool he ses  id like to see the party as would make a fool of me like that  just see im and get my ands on him  he wouldnt want to play any more games  it was no good talking to im  he was arf crazy with temper  if id said the letter was meant for im hed ave asked me wot i meant by opening it and getting im into more trouble with is missis instead of giving it to im on the quiet  i just stood and suffered in silence and thought wot a lot of arm eddication did for people  i want some money ses my missis coming back at last with mrs smithers  that was the way she always talked when shed got me in er power  she took twoandtenpenceall id gotand then she ordered me to go and get a cab  me and this lady are going to meet her she ses sniffing at me  and tell her wot we think of er ses mrs smithers sniffing too  and wot well do to er ses my missis  i left em standing side by side looking at the skipper as if e was a waxworks while i went to find a cab  when i came back they was in the same persition and e was smoking with is eyes shut  they went off side by side in the cab both of em sitting boltupright and only turning their eads at the last moment to give us looks we didnt want  i dont wish her no arm ses the skipper arter thinking for a long time  was that the fust letter you ad from er bill  fust and last i ses grinding my teeth  i hope they wont meet er pore thing he ses  ive been married longer than wot you have i ses and i tell you one thing  it wont make no difference to us whether they do or they dont i ses  and it didnt
