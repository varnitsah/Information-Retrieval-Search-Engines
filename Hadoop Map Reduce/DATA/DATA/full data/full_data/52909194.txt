    he snaps when i offer him his offspring      just as he snaps when i poke a bit of stick at him      because he is irascible this morning an irascible           tortoise      being touched with love and devoid of           fatherliness       father and mother      and three little brothers      and all rambling aimless like little perambulating           pebbles scattered in the garden      not knowing each other from bits of earth or old           tins       except that papa and mama are old acquaintances           of course      but family feeling there is none not even the

toes      to travel to burrow into a little loose earth           afraid of the night      to crop a little substance      to move and to be quite sure that he is moving      basta       to be a tortoise      think of it in a garden of inert clods      a brisk brindled little tortoise all to himself      croesus       in a garden of pebbles and insects      to roam and feel the slow heart beat      tortoisewise the first bell sounding      from   the   warm  blood   in   the   darkcreation           morning       moving and being himself      slow and unquestioned      and inordinately

decidedly arrogantly     lui et elle        she is large and matronly      and rather dirty      a little sardoniclooking as if domesticity had           driven her to it       though what she does except lay four eggs at           random in the garden once a year      and put up with her husband      i dont know       she likes to eat       she hurries up striding reared on long uncanny           legs      when food is going      oh yes she can make haste when she likes       she snaps the soft bread from my hand in great           mouthfuls      opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron           pristine face      into an enormously widebeaked mouth      like sudden curved scissors      and gulping at more than she can swallow and           working her thick soft tongue      and having the bread hanging over her chin       o mistress mistress      reptile mistress      your eye is very dark very bright      and it never softens      although you watch       she knows      she knows

curved gaping toothless           mouth      she has no qualm when she catches my finger in           her steel overlapping gums      but she hangs on and my shout and my shrinking           are nothing to her      she does not even know she is nipping me with           her curved beak      snakelike she draws at my finger while i drag           it in horror away       mistress reptile

than she      and he has a cruel scar on his shell       poor darling biting at her feet      running beside her like a dog biting her earthy           splay feet      nipping her ankles      which she drags apathetic away though without           retreating into her shell       agelessly silent      and with a grim reptile determination      cold  voiceless  ageafterage  behind him

    now look at him       alas the spear is through the side of his isolation      his adolescence saw him crucified into sex      doomed in the long crucifixion of desire to seek           his consummation beyond himself      divided into passionate duality      he so finished and immune now broken into           desirous fragmentariness      doomed to make an intolerable fool of himself      in his effort toward completion again       poor little earthy houseinhabiting osiris      the mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into           pieces      and he must struggle after reconstruction           ignominiously       and so behold him following the tail      of that mudhovel of his slowlyrambling spouse      like some unhappy bull at the tail of a cow      but with more than bovine grim  earthdank           persistence      suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as she stretches           out to walk      roaming over the sods      or if it happen to show at her pointed

pestered and tormented           say i       what can he do      he is dumb he is visionless      conceptionless       his black sadlidded eye sees but beholds not      as her earthen mound moves on      but he catches the folds of vulnerable leathery           skin      nailstudded that shake beneath her shell      and drags at these with his beak      drags and drags and bites      while she pulls herself free and rows her dull           mound along     tortoise gallantry        making his advances      he does not look at her nor sniff at her      no not even sniff at her his nose is blank       only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin      that work beneath her while she sprawls along      in her ungainly pace      her folds of skin that work and row      beneath  the   earthsoiled  hovel  in  which  she           moves       and so he strains beneath her housey walls      and catches her trouserlegs in his beak      suddenly or her skinny limb      and strange and grimly drags at her      like a dog      only agelessly silent with a reptiles awful      persistency       grim gruesome gallantry to which he is doomed      dragged out of an eternity of silent

 or did it sound on the plasm direct       worse than the cry of the newborn      a scream      a yell      a shout      a pæan      a deathagony      a birthcry      a submission      all tiny tiny

male souls membrane      torn with a shriek half music half horror       crucifixion       male tortoise cleaving behind the hovelwall of           that dense female      mounted and tense spreadeagle outreaching           out of the shell      in tortoisenakedness      long neck and long vulnerable limbs extruded      spreadeagle over her houseroof      and the deep secret allpenetrating tail curved           beneath her walls      reaching  and gripping  tense  more  reaching           anguish in uttermost tension      till suddenly in the spasm of coition tupping           like a jerking leap and oh      opening its clenched face from his outstretched           neck      and giving that fragile yell that scream      superaudible      from his pink cleft oldmans mouth      giving up the ghost      or screaming in pentecost receiving the ghost       his scream and his moments subsidence      the moment of eternal silence      yet unreleased and after the moment the      sudden startling jerk of coition and at once      the inexpressible faint yell      and so on till the last plasm of my body was           melted back      to the primeval rudiments of life and the secret       so he tups and screams      time after time that frail torn scream      after each jerk the longish interval      the tortoise eternity      agelong reptilian persistence      heartthrob slow heartthrob persistent for the           next spasm       i remember when i was a boy      i heard the scream of a frog which was caught           with his foot in the mouth of an upstarting           snake      i remember when i first heard bullfrogs break           into sound in the spring      i remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat           of night      cry loudly beyond the lake of waters      i remember the first time out of a bush in the           darkness a nightingales piercing cries and           gurgles startled the depths of my soul      i remember the scream of a rabbit as i went           through a wood at midnight      i remember the heifer in her heat blorting and           blorting through the hours persistent and           irrepressible      i remember my first terror hearing the howl of           weird amorous cats      i remember the scream of a terrified injured           horse the sheetlightning      and running away from the sound of a woman in           labor something like an owl whooing      and listening inwardly to the first bleat of a           lamb      the first wail of an infant      and my mother singing to herself      and the first tenor singing of the passionate           throat of a young collier who has long since           drunk himself to death      the first elements of foreign speech      on wild dark lips       and more than all these      and less than all these      this last      strange faint coition yell      of the male tortoise at extremity      tiny from under the very edge of the farthest           faroff horizon of life       the cross      the wheel on which our silence first is broken      sex which breaks up our integrity our single           inviolability our deep silence      tearing a cry from us       sex which breaks us into voice sets us calling           across the deeps calling calling for the           complement      singing and calling and singing again being           answered having found       torn to become whole again after long seeking           for what is lost      the same cry from the tortoise as from christ           the osiriscry of abandonment      that which is whole torn asunder      that which is in part finding its whole again           throughout the universe
