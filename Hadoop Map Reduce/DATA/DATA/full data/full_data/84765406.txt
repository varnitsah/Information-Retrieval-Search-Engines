84765406	the lances of lynwood   by  charlotte m yonge     preface   for an explanation of the allusions in the present tale scarcely any notes are necessary save a reference to the bewitching chronicle of froissart and we cannot but hope that our sketch may serve as an inducement to some young readers to make acquaintance with the delectable old canon for themselves undeterred by the size of his tomes  the story of orthon is almost verbally copied from him and bears a curious resemblance to various german legendssuch as that of heinzelman to be found in keightleys fairy mythology and to teague of the lea as related in crokers irish fairy legends  the old french vie de bertrand du guesclin has likewise been drawn upon for materials and would have supplied much more of great interest such as enrique of trastamares arrival in the disguise of a palmer to consult with him during his captivity at bordeaux and many most curious anecdotes of his early childhood and youth  to breton tradition his excellent wife epiphanie raguenel owes her title of tiphaine la fee meaning that she was endowed with magic power which enabled her to predict what would be lucky or unlucky days for her husband  his disregard of them was thought to have twice cost him the loss of a battle  we must apologize for having made henry of lancaster a year or two older than is warranted by the date of his birth      the lances of lynwood     chapter i   seldom had the interior of this island presented a more peaceful and prosperous aspect than in the reign of edward iii when the more turbulent spirits among his subjects had found occupation in his foreign wars and his wise government had established at home a degree of plenty tranquility and security such as had probably never before been experienced in england  castle and cottage church and convent alike showed the prosperity and safety of the inhabitants at once by the profuseness of embellishment in those newly erected and by the neglect of the jealous precautions required in former days of confusion and misrule  thus it was with the village of lynwood where among the cottages and farmhouses occupying a fertile valley in somersetshire arose the ancient keep built of gray stone and strongly fortified but the defences were kept up rather as appendages of the owners rank than as requisite for his protection though the moat was clear of weeds and full of water the drawbridge was so well covered with hardtrodden earth overgrown at the edges with grass that in spite of the massive chains connecting it with the gateway it seemed permanently fixed on the ground  the spikes of the portcullis frowned above in threatening array but a wreath of ivy was twining up the groove by which it had once descended and the archway which by day stood hospitably open was at night only guarded by two large oaken doors yielding to a slight push beneath the southern wall of the castle court were various flowerbeds the pride and delight of the old seneschal ralph penrose in his own estimation the most important personage of lynwood keep manager of the servants adviser of the lady and instructor of the young gentleman in the exercises of chivalry  one fine evening old ralph stood before the door his bald forehead and thin irongray locks unbonneted and his dark ruddybrown face marked at halidon hill with a deep scar raised with an air of deference and yet of selfsatisfaction towards the lady who stood on the steps of the porch  she was small and fragile in figure her face though very lovely was pale and thin and her smile had in it something pensive and almost melancholy as she listened to his narration of his dealings with a refractory tenant and at the same time watched a noblelooking child of seven or eight years old who mounted on an old warhorse was led round the court by a youth his elder by some ten or eleven years  see mother cried the child i am holding the reins myself  uncle eustace lays not a finger on them  as i was saying madam continued ralph disregarding the interruption i told him that i should not have thought of one exempted from feudal service in the camp by our noble knight being deficient in his dues in his absence  i told him we should see how he liked to be sent packing to bordeaux with a sheaf of arrows on his back instead of the sheaf of wheat which ought to be in our granary by this time  but you are too gentle with them my lady and they grow insolent in sir reginalds long absence  all goes ill in his absence said the lady  it is a weary while since the wounded archer brought tidings of his speedy return  therefore said the youth turning round it must be the nearer at hand  come sweet sister eleanor cheer up for he cannot but come soon  so many soons have passed away that my heart is wellnigh too sick for hope said eleanor  and when he comes it will be but a bright dream to last for a moment  he cannot long be spared from the princes side  you must go with him then sister and see how i begin my days of chivalrythat is if he will but believe me fit to bear shield and lance  ah master eustace if you were but such as i have seen others of your race said ralph shaking his head  there was sir henryat your age he had made the scottish thieves look about them i promise you  and to go no further back than sir reginald himselfhe stood by the princes side at crecy ere he was yet fifteen  it is not my fault that i have not done as much ralph said eustace it is not for want of the will as you know full well  no  thanks to me i trust you have the will and the teaching at least to make a good knight said ralph  and yet while i think of the goodly height and broad shoulders of those that have gone before you  but hark hark cried eustace cutting short a comparison which did not seem likely to be complimentary  dost not hear ralph a horn  the lynwood note  my husbands note  o thanks thanks to the saints cried the lady clasping her hands whilst eustace vaulting into the saddle behind his little nephew rode across the drawbridge as fast as the stiffened joints of old blanc etoile could be prevailed on to move  gaining the summit of a rising ground both at once shouted our own pennon  it is himself as they beheld the dark blue crosslet on an argent field floating above a troop of horsemen whose armour glanced in the setting sun  there are the lances of lynwood arthur said eustace leaping to the ground  keep your seat and meet your father like a brave knights son  he then settled the reins in the childs hand and walked beside him to meet the newcomers  they were about twenty in number armed alike with corselets marked with the blue cross steel headpieces and long lances  in front rode two of higher rank  the first was a man of noble mien and lofty stature his short dark curled hair and beard and handsome though sunburnt countenance displayed beneath his small blue velvet cap his helmet being carried behind him by a manatarms and his attire consisting of a closefitting dress of chamois leather a white mantle embroidered with the blue cross thrown over one shoulder and his sword hanging by his side his companion who carried at his saddlebow a shield blazoned with heraldic devices in scarlet and gold was of still greater height and very slight his large keen eyes hair and moustache black as jet and his complexion dark brown with a wellformed aquiline nose and a perfect and very white set of teeth  the instant the firstmentioned horseman perceived eustace and arthur he sprang to the ground and hurried to meet them with rapid affectionate greetings and inquiries  in another moment dame eleanor appeared on the drawbridge and weeping with joy was clasped in her husbands arms  behind her stood the venerable chaplain father cyril and a step or two further off ralph penrose both of whom in turn received the kindly greetings of sir reginald lynwood as with his wife hanging on his arm and his boy holding his hand he passed under the gateway of his ancestral castle  turning the next moment he addressed his tall companion friend gaston i bid you welcome  dame eleanor and you brother eustace i present to you my trusty esquire master gaston daubricour  due courtesies passed between the lady and the squire who after a few words with the knight remained to see the disposal of the men while sir reginald himself entered the hall with his wife son and brother eustace did not long remain there he found that reginald and eleanor had much to say to each other and his curiosity and interest were besides greatly excited by the novelty of the scene presented by the castle court so different from its usual peaceful monotony  the men were unsaddling their horses rubbing them down walking them about or removing the stains of dust and mud from their own armour while others were exchanging greetings with the villagers who were gathering in joyous parties round such of the newly arrived as were natives of the place  in the midst stood the strange squire superintending a horseboy who was rubbing down the knights tall warhorse and at the same time ordering giving directions answering inquiries or granting permission to the men to return home with their relations ralph penrose was near his countenance as eustace could plainly perceive expressing little satisfaction at finding another authority in the court of lynwood keep the references to himself short brief and rapid and only made when ignorance of the locality compelled the stranger to apply for information  the french accent and occasional french phrases with which the squire spoke made him contract his brow more and more and at last just as eustace came up he walked slowly away grumbling to himself well have it een your own way i am too old for your gay french fashions  it was not so in humfrey harwoods time when  but the world has gone after the french now sir reginald has brought home as many gascon thieves as kindly englishmen  eustace listened for a moment to his mutterings but without answering them and coming within a few steps of the stranger stood waiting to offer him any courtesy in his power though at the same time he felt abashed by the consciousness of his inferiority in accomplishments and experience  it was the squire who was the first to speak  so this is sir reginalds old keep  a fine old fortalicewould stand at least a fortnights siege  ha  is not yonder a weak point  i would undertake to scale that tower so the batteringrams made a diversion on the other side  i trust it will never be tried said eustace  it would be as fair a feat of arms as ever you beheld  but i crave your pardon added he displaying his white teeth with a merry laugh the state of my own land has taught me to look on every castle with eyes for attack and defence and your brother tells me i am not behind my countrymen in what you english call gasconades  you have seen many sieges and passages of arms asked eustace looking up in his face with an expression at once puzzled and respectful  since our castle of albricorte was sacked and burnt by the count de bearn i have seen little elsethree stricken fieldstwo towns stormedcastles more than i can remember  alas said eustace i have seen nothing but the muster of arms at taunton  daubricour laughed  look not downcast on it said he you have time before you and one year at bordeaux is worth four elsewhere but i forget you are the young clerk and yet that scarcely accords with that bright eye of yours and the weapon at your side  they spoke once of making me a clerk said eustace but i hope to show my brother that i am fit for his own way of life  sir squire do but tell me do you think i look unfit to sustain the honour of my name  mere strength is little said the squire else were that comely giant john ingram the best warrior in the army  nor does height reckon for much du guesclin himself is of the shortest  nor do you look like the boy over whose weakly timid nature i have heard sir reginald lament he proceeded surveying him with a critical eye  eustace had in fact hardly reached the middle height and was very slender his limbs were however well proportioned his step firm and every movement full of activity and grace  his face shaded with bright chestnut hair was of a delicate complexion the features finely moulded and the usual cast of expression slightly thoughtful but there was frequently and especially at this moment a bright kindling light in the dark blue eyes which changed the whole countenance from the grave and refined look of the young scholar to the bold ardent glance of the warrior  a cavalier every inch of you cried daubricour striking eustace on the shoulder as he concluded his inspection  ill have the training of you my gentil damoiseau and see if i do not make you as preux a chevalier as the most burly giant of them all  here know you this trick  he caught up one of the lances which the men had laid aside eustace followed his example and acquitted himself to his satisfaction in one or two chivalrous manoeuvres till a summons to supper put an end to the sport     chapter 2   the house of lynwood had long been famed for loyalty which had often cost them dear since their neighbours the lords of clarenham never failed to take advantage of the ascendency of the popular party and make encroachments on their privileges and possessions  thus when sir hugo lynwood the old crusader was made prisoner by simon de montforts party at lewes he was treated with great severity in order to obtain from him a recognition of the feudal superiority of the clarenhams and though the success of the royal party at evesham occasioned his liberation his possessions were greatly diminished nor had the turmoils of the reign of edward ii failed to leave their traces on the fortunes of the lynwoods sir henry father of the present knight was a staunch adherent of the unfortunate monarch and even joined the hapless edmund earl of kent in the rising in which that prince was entrapped after the murder of his brother  on this occasion it was only sir henrys hasty flight that preserved his life and his lands were granted to the baron simon de clarenham by the young edward iii then under the dominion of his mother isabel and roger mortimer but when at length the king had freed himself from their trammels the whole county of somerset rose to expel the intruders from lynwood keep and reinstate its true master  nor did simon de clarenham make much resistance for well knowing that an appeal to the king would occasion and instant revocation of the grant he judged it advisable to allow it to sleep for the present  sir henry lynwood therefore lived and died unmolested  his eldest son reginald was early sent to the royal camp where he soon distinguished himself and gained the favour and friendship of the gallant prince of wales  the feud with the clarenhams seemed to be completely extinguished when reginald chiefly by the influence of the prince succeeded in obtaining the hand of a lady of that family the daughter of a brave knight slain in the wars in brittany  since this time both the baron de clarenham and his son sir fulk had been on good terms with the knight of lynwood and the connection had been drawn still closer by the barons second marriage with the lady muriel de la poer a near relative of sir reginalds mother  many a time had dame eleanor lynwood ridden to clarenham castle under the escort of her young brotherinlaw to whom such a change from the lonely old keep afforded no small delight  eustace the only one of sir henrys younger children who survived the rough nursing or the overnursing whichever it might be that thinned in former days the families of nobles and gentleman might as well in the opinion of almost all have rested beneath a quaint little image of his infant figure in brass in the vaults of the little norman chapel for he was a puny ailing child apt to scandalize his father and brother and their warlike retainers by being scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest and preferring the seat at this mothers feet the fairy tale of the old nurse the song of the minstrel or the book of the priest to horse and hound or even to the sight of the martial sports of the tiltyard  the last five years had however wrought a great change in him he began to outgrow the delicacy of his constitution and with it to shake off his timidity of disposition  a diligent perusal of the romances of chivalry filled him with emulation and he had applied himself ardently to all knightly exercises looking with great eagerness to the time when he might appear in the princes court he had invested it with all the glory of the round table and of the paladins and though he knew he must not look for merlin or the siege perilous the men themselves were in his fancy rolands and tristrems and he scarcely dared to hope he could ever be fit to make one of them with all his diligent attention to old ralphs instructions  some of ralphs manoeuvres were indeed rather antiquated and afforded much amusement to gaston daubricour who was never weary of teasing the old seneschal with descriptions of the changes in the fashion of weapons tourneys and machines and especially delighted in histories of the marvellous effects of gunpowder ralph would shake his head vow that it would soon put an end to all true chivalry and walk off to furbish his favourite crossbow with many a murmured reflection on the folly of quitting good old plans and especially on that of his master who must needs bring home a gibing gascon when honest english squires were not scarce  very different was the state of the old keep of lynwood from the quiet almost deserted condition in which it had been left so long now that the knight had again taken his wonted place amongst the gentry of the county  entertainments were exchanged with his neighbours hunting and hawking matches and all the sports of the tiltyard followed each other in quick succession and the summer passed merrily away merrily that is to say with sir reginald whose stirring life in camp and court had left him but few and short intervals for enjoying his home and the society of his wife with eleanor who relieved from long anxiety began to recover the spirits and health which had nearly failed her and with eustace to whom the arrival of his brother and his followers brought a continued course of novelty and delight but less joyously with the knights followers who regretted more and more the gay court of bordeaux and grew impatient at the prospect of spending a tedious winter in a peaceful english castle  their anticipation of weariness and the contrary expectations of sir reginald were destined to be equally disappointed for two months had not passed since his return before a summons arrived or more properly speaking an invitation to the trusty and wellbeloved sir reginald lynwood to join the forces which the duke of lancaster was assembling at southampton the prince of wales having promised to assist king pedro of castile in recovering the kingdom from which he had been driven by his brother enrique of trastamare  sir reginald could not do otherwise than prepare with alacrity to obey the call of his beloved prince though he marvelled that edward should draw his sword in the cause of such a monster of cruelty and he was more reluctant than ever before to leave his home  he even promised his sorrowful eleanor that this should be the last time he would leave her  i will but bestow eustace in some honourable household where he may be trained in knightly lorethat of chandos perchance or some other of the leaders who hold the good old strict rule find good masters for my honest menatarms break one more lance with du guesclin and take to rule my vassals till my fields and be the honest old country knight my father was before me  said i well dame eleanor  eleanor smiled but the next moment sighed and drooped her head while a tear fell on the blue silk with which she was embroidering the crosslet on his pennon  sir reginald might have said somewhat to cheer her but at that instant little arthur darted into the hall with news that the armourer was come from taunton with two mules loaded with a store of goodly helmets swords and corselets which he was displaying in the court  the knight immediately walked forth into the court where all had been activity and eagerness ever since the arrival of the summons the smith hammering ceaselessly in his forge yet without fulfilling half the order continually shouted in his ears gaston daubricour and ralph penrose directing from morning to night in contradiction of each other the one always laughing the other always grumbling the menatarms and retainers some obeying orders others being scolded the steel clanging hammers ringing without intermission most of the party such at least as could leave their employment without a sharp reprimand from one or the other of the contending authorities the seneschal and the squire were gathered round the steps where the armourer was displaying with many an encomium his bundles of lances his real toledo blades and his helmets of the choicest fashion gaston daubricour and ralph were disputing respecting a certain suit of armour which the latter disapproved because it had no guards for the knees while the former contended that the only use for such protections was to disable a man from walking and nearly from standing when once unhorsed  in my day master daubricour it was not the custom for a brave manatarms to look to being unhorsed but times are changed  ay that they are master penrose for in our day we do not give ourselves over the moment we are down and lie closed up in our shells like great land tortoises turned on their backs waiting till some one is good enough to find his way through our shell with the misericorde  peace peace gaston said the knight  if we acquit ourselves as well as our fathers we shall have little to be ashamed of what think you of this mans gear  that i could pick up a better suit for half the price at old battista the lombards at bordeaux nevertheless since young eustace would be the show of the camp if he appeared there provided in ralphs fashion it may be as well to see whether there be any reasonableness in this old knave  before the question was decided the trampling of horses was heard and there rode into the court an elderly man whose dress and bearing showed him to be of consideration accompanied by a youth of eighteen or nineteen and attended by two servants  sir reginald and his brother immediately stepped forward to receive them  sir philip ashton said the former how is it with you  this is friendly in you to come and bid us farewell  i grieve that it should be farewell sir reginald said the old knight dismounting whilst eustace held his stirrup our country can ill spare such men as you  thanks my young friend eustace see leonard what good training will do for an esquire eustace has already caught that air and courteous demeanour that cannot be learnt here among us poor knights of somerset  this was to his son who with a short abrupt reply to the goodnatured greeting of sir reginald had scrambled down from his saddle and stood fixing his large gray eyes upon gaston whose tall active figure and lively dark countenance seemed to afford him an inexhaustible subject of study  the squire was presented by name to sir philip received a polite compliment and replying with a bow turned to the youth with the ready courtesy of one willing to relieve the shyness of an awkward stranger  we were but now discussing the merit between damasked steel and chain mail what opinion do you bring to aid us  a renewed stare an inarticulate muttering and master leonard turned away and almost hid his face in the mane of his horse whilst his father attempted to make up for his incivility by a whole torrent of opinions to which gaston listened with the outward submission due from a squire but with frequent glances accompanied by a tendency to elevate shoulder or eyebrow which eustace understood full well to convey that the old gentleman knew nothing whatever on the subject  this concluded sir philip went to pay his respects to the lady of lynwood and then as the hour of noon had arrived all partook of the meal which was served in the hall the squires waiting on the knights and the lady before themselves sitting down to table  it was the influence of dinner that first unchained the silent tongue of leonard ashton when he found himself seated next to his old acquaintance eustace lynwood out of hearing of those whose presence inspired him with shyness and the clatter of knives and trenchers drowning his voice  so your brother has let you bear sword after all  how like you the trade  better than poring over crabbed parchments i trow but guess you why we are here today  my father says that i must take service with some honourable knight and see somewhat of the world  he spoke long of the lord de clarenham because his favour would be well in the county but at last he has fixed on your brother because he may do somewhat for me with the prince  then you are going with us to bordeaux exclaimed eustace eagerly  ay truly  nay but that is a right joyful hearing said eustace  old friends should be brethren in arms  but eustace said young ashton lowering his voice to a confidential whisper i like not that outlandish squire so tall and black  men say he is a moora worshipper of mahound  eustace laughed heartily at this report and assured his friend that though he had heard his brother often give his squire in jest his nom de guerre of gaston le maure yet daubricour was a gallant gentleman of gascony  but still leonard was not satisfied  had ever man born in christian land such flashing black eyes and white teeth and is not he horribly fierce and strict  never was man of kinder heart and blither temper  then you think that he will not be sharp with us  more straight in your saddle lance lower head higher that is what has been ringing in my ears from morning till night of late sometimes enforced by a sharp blow on the shoulders  is it not so with you  oh old penrose took all that trouble off their hands long ago gaston is the gentlest of tutors compared with him  i hope so sighed leonard my very bones ache with the tutoring i get from my father at home  and eustace resolve me this  hush do not you see that father cyril is about to pronounce the grace  therenow must i go and serve your father with the gracecup but i will be with you anon  leonard put his elbow on the table mumbling to himself and these of eustaces be the courtly manners my father would have me learn they cost a great deal too much trouble  the meal over eustace took leonard into the court to visit the horses and inspect the new armour  they were joined by gaston who took upon himself to reply to the question which leonard wished to have resolved namely what they were to do in castile by persuading him to believe that enrique of trastamare was a giant twenty feet high who rode a griffin of proportionate dimensions and led an army whose heads grew under their shoulders  in the meantime sir philip ashton was with many polite speeches entering upon the business of his visit which was to request sir reginald to admit his son into his train as an esquire  the knight of lynwood though not very desirous of this addition to his followers could not well refuse him in consideration of the alliance which had long subsisted between the two houses but he mentioned his own purpose of quitting the princes court as soon as the present expedition should be concluded  that said sir philip softly will scarce be likely  such knights as sir reginald lynwood are not so easily allowed to hide themselves in obscurity  the prince of wales knows too well the value of his righthand counsellor  nay sir philip said sir reginald laughing that is rather too fine a term for a rough soldier who never was called into counsel at all except for the arraying a battle  it would take far sharper wits than mine or indeed i suspect than any that we have at bordeaux to meet the wiles of charles of france  no unless the royal banner be abroad in the field you may look to see me here before another year is out  i shall hope it may be otherwise for my boys sake said sir philip but be that as it may his fame will be secured by his going forth for the first time with such a leader as yourself  the example and friendship of your brother will also be of the utmost service  your chief squire tooso perfect in all chivalrous training and a foreignerwho better could be found to train a poor somersetshire clown for the princes gascon court  why for that matter interrupted sir reginald whose patience would seldom serve his to the end of one of his neighbours harangues it may be honest to tell you that though gaston is a kindlytempered fellow and of right knightly bearing his life has been none of the most steady  i took up with him a couple of years since when poor old humfrey harwood was slain at auray and i knew not where to turn for a squire  save for a few wild freaks now and then he has done right well though i sometimes marvelled at his choosing to endure my strict household  he obeys my orders and has made himself well liked by the men and i willingly trust eustace with him since the boy is of a grave clerkly sort of turn and under my own eye but it is for you to do as you will with your son  is he of honourable birth asked sir philip  at least he bears coat armour answered reginald  his shield is gules a wolf passant or and i have heard strange tales of his father beranger daubricour the black wolf of the pyrenees as he was called one of the robber noblesse of the navarrese border but i have little time for such matters and they do not dwell in my mind  if i find a man does his duty in my service i care not whence he comes nor what his forefathers may have been i listen to no such idle tales but i thought it best to warn you that i answer not for all the comrades your son may find in my troop  many thanks noble sir reginald under such care as yours he cannot fail to prosper i am secure of his welfare in your hands one word more sir reginald i pray you  you are allpowerful with prince edward  my poor boys advancement is in your hand one word in his favour to the princea hint of the following i could send his pennon  sir philip said reginald you overrate my influence and underrate the princes judgment if you imagine aught save personal merit would weigh with him  your son shall have every opportunity of deserving his notice but whether it be favourable or not must depend on himself  if you desire more you must not seek it of me  sir philip protested that this was all he wished and after reiterating his thanks took his leave promising that leonard should be at lynwood keep on the next monday the day fixed for sir reginalds departure     chapter iii   the morning of departure arrived  the menatarms were drawn up in the court like so many statues of steel leonard ashton sat on horseback his eyes fixed on the door gaston daubricour wrapped in his gay mantle stood caressing his arab steed brigliador and telling him they should soon exchange the chilly fogs of england for the bright sun of gascony ralph penrose held his masters horse and a black powerful charger was prepared for eustace but still the brothers tarried  my eleanor this should not be said reginald as his wife clung to him weeping  keep a good heart  tis not for long  take heed of your dealings with cousin fulk  she knows not what i say father cyril keep guard over her and my boy in case i should meet with any mishap  i will assuredly my son said the chaplain but it is little that a poor priest like me can do  i would that grant to the clarenhams were repealed  that were soon done said reginald but it is no time for a loyal vassal to complain of grievances when his liege lord has summoned him to the field  that were to make the kings need be his law  no no watch over her good father she is weak and tender  look up sweet heart give me one cheerful wish to speed me on my journey  no  she has swooned  eleanor my wife  begone begone my son said father cyril it will be the better for her  it may be said reginald yet to leave her thus  here nurse support her tend her well  give her my tenderest greetings arthur be duteous to her talk to her of our return farewell my boy and blessings on you  eustace mount  sir reginald sighing heavily swung himself into the saddle eustace waited a moment longer  good father this was to have been in poor eleanors charge  it is the token you know for whom  it shall reach her my son  you will send me a letter whenever you can  truly i will and i would have you read and write especially in latin when you have the chancegood gifts should not be buried bethink you too that you will not have the same excuse for sin as the rude ignorant men you will meet  eustace hastily called reginald and with a hurried farewell to all around the young squire sprang on horseback and the troop rode across the drawbridge  they halted on the mound beyond sir reginald shook his pennon till the long white swallow tails streamed on the wind then placed it in the hands of eustace and saying on lances of lynwood  in the name of god st george and king edward do your devoir he spurred his horse forward as if only desirous to be out of sight of his own turrets and forget the parting the pain of which still heaved his breast and dimmed his eye  a few days brought the troop to southampton where john of gaunt was collecting his armament and with it they embarked crossed to st malo and thence proceeded to bordeaux but there found that the prince of wales had already set forth and was waiting for his brother at dax  advancing immediately at the end of three days they came in sight of the forces encamped around that town  glorious was the scene before them the green plain covered in every direction with white tents surmounted with the banners or pennons of their masters the broad red cross of st george waving proudly in the midst and beside it the royal lions and castles of the two spanish monarchies  to the south the snowy peaks of the pyrenees began to gleam white like clouds against the sky and the gray sealine to the west closed the horizon eustace drew his rein and gazed in silent admiration and gaston riding by his side pointed out the several bearings and devices which to the warrior of that day spoke as plainly often more so as written words  see yonder the tent of my brave countryman the captal de buch close to that of the prince as is ever his wont  no doubt he is willing to wipe away the memory of his capture at auray  there to the left gules and argent per pale is the pennon of the stout old englishman chandos  ha i see the old free companions are here with sir hugh calverly  why twas but the other day they were starting to set this very don enrique on the throne as blithely as they now go to drive him from his  while gaston spoke the sound of horses feet approached rapidly from another quarter and a small party came in sight the foremost of whom checked his bridle as at reginalds signal his lances halted and drew respectfully aside  he was a man about thirtysix years of age and looking even younger from the remarkable fairness and delicacy of his complexion  the perfect regularity of his noble features together with the commanding yet gentle expression of his clear light blue eyes would even without the white ostrich feather in his black velvet cap have enabled eustace to recognize in him the flower of chivalry edward prince of wales  welcome my trusty reginald exclaimed he  i knew that the lances of lynwood would not be absent where knightly work is to be done  is my brother john arrived  yes my lord replied reginald i parted from him but now as he rode to the castle while i came to seek where to bestow my knaves  i know you of old for a prudent man said the prince smiling the provost marshal hath no acquaintance with that gallant little band methinks i see there a fair face like enough to yours to belong to another loyal lynwood  i could wish it were a little browner and more manly my lord said reginald  it is my brother eustace who has been suffered i take shame to myself for it to tarry at home as my ladys page till he looks as white as my lady herself  we will soon find a cure for that in the sun of castile said edward you are well provided with squires  the men of somerset know where good training is to be found for their sons  this my lord is the son of sir philip ashton a loyal knight of our country  he is welcome said the prince  we have work for all  let me see you this evening at supper in my tent  well eustace what sayest thou said gaston as the prince rode on  a prince to dream of a prince for whom to give a thousand lives said eustace  and that was the prince of wales said leonard  why he spoke just like any other man  the two tents of the lances of lynwood having been erected and all arrangements made the knights and squires set out for the princes pavilion the white curtains of which were conspicuous in the centre of the camp  within it was completely lined with silk embroidered with the various devices of the prince the lions of englandthe lilies of francethe bohemian ostrichplume with its humble motto the white rose not yet an emblem of discordthe blue garter and the red cross all in gorgeous combinationa fitting background as it were on which to display the chivalrous groups seen in relief against it  at the upper end was placed a long table for the prince and his guests and here sir reginald took his seat with many a hearty welcome from his friends and companions in arms while gaston led his comrades to the lower end where squires and pages were waiting for the provisions brought in by the servants which they were to carry to their knights gaston was soon engaged in conversation with his acquaintance to some of whom he introduced eustace and leonard but the former found far more interesting occupation in gazing on the company seated at the upper table  the black prince himself occupied the centre his brother john at his left hand and at his right a person whom both this post of honour and the blazonry of his surcoat marked out as the dethroned king of castile  pedro the cruel had not however the forbidding countenance which imagination would ascribe to him his features were of the fair and noble type of the old royal gothic race of spain he had a profusion of flaxen hair and large blue eyes rather too prominent and but for his receding forehead and the expression of his lips he would have been a handsome man of princely mien  something too there was of fear something of a scowl he seemed to shrink from the open and manly demeanour of edward and to turn with greater ease to converse with john who less lofty in character than his brother better suited his nature  there too eustace beheld the stalwart form and rugged features of sir john chandos the slender figure and dark sparkling southern face of the captal de buch the rough joyous booncompanion visage of sir hugh calverly the freebooting warrior the youthful form of the young stepson of the prince lord thomas holland the rude features of the breton knight sir oliver de clisson soon to be the bitterest foe of the standard beneath which he was now fighting many were there whose renown had charmed the ears of the young squire of lynwood keep and he looked on the scene with the eagerness with which he would have watched some favourite romance suddenly done into life and action  eustace  what eustace in a trance said daubricour  waken and carry this trencher of beef to your brother  best that you should do it he added in a low voice taking up a flask of wine and save our comrade from at once making himself a laughingstock  the discontented glance with which leonards eyes followed his fellow squires did not pass unobserved by a person with whom daubricour had exchanged a few words a squarelymade darkvisaged man with a thick black beard and a huge scar which had obliterated one eye his equipment was that of a squire but instead of like others of the same degree attending on the guests at the upper table he sat carelessly sideways on the bench with one elbow on the board  you gaze after that trencher as if you wished your turn was come said he in a patois of english and french which leonard could easily understand although he had always turned a deaf ear to gastons attempts to instruct him in the latter language  however a grunt was his only reply  or pursued the squire have you any fancy for carrying it yourself i for my part think we are well quit of the trouble  why ay said leonard but i trow i have as much right to serve at the princes table as dainty master eustace  my father had never put me under sir reginalds charge had he deemed i should be kept here among the servingmen  sir reginald  which sir reginald has the honour of your service asked the squire to whom leonards broad somersetshire dialect seemed to present few difficulties  sir reginald lynwood he with the curled brown locks next to that sternlooking old fellow with the gray hair  ay i know him of old  him whom the duke of lancaster is pledginga proud strict englishmanas rigid a service as any in the camp  i should think so said leonard  up in the morn hours before the sun to mass like a choir of novices to clean our own arms and the knights like so many horseboys and if there be but a speck of rust or a swordbelt half a fingers length awry  ay ay i once had a fortnights service with a knight of that stamp but a fortnight was enough for me i promise you  and yet gaston le maure chooses to stay with him rather than lead a merry life with sir perduccas dalbret with all to gain and nought to lose  a different life from the days he and i spent together of old  gaston daubricour is as sharp as the knight himself said leonard and gibes me without ceasing but yet i could bear it all were it not for seeing eustace the clerk preferred to me as if i were not heir to more acres than he can ever count crowns  what may then be your name fair youth and your inheritance demanded the oneeyed squire for your coat of arms is new in the camp  my name is leonard ashton my father but leonards speech was cut short by a squire who stumbled over his outstretched foot  both parties burst into angry exclamations leonards new acquaintance taking his part  men looked up and serious consequences might have ensued had not gaston hastened to the spot  shame on you young malapert said he to his hopeful pupil  cannot i leave you one moment unwatched but you must be brawling in the princes own presence  here bear this bread to sir reginald instantly and leave me to make your peace  master clifford added he as leonard shuffled away tis an uncouth slip whom sir reginald lynwood has undertaken to mould into form and if he is visited as he deserves for each piece of discourtesy his life will not be long enough for amendment so i must een beg you to take my apology  most readily master daubricour replied clifford there would not have been the least offence had the youth only possessed a civil tongue  is not he the son of one of your wealthy englishmen asked the oneeyed squire carelessly  ha  why should you think so said gaston turning sharply because he shows so much good nurture  because his brains are grown fat with devouring his fathers beeves fare on which you seem to thrive le maure said the oneeyed though you were not wont to like english beef and english discipline better than gascon wine and gascon freedom i begin to think that the cub of the black wolf of the pyrenees is settling down into a tame english housedog  he has teeth and claws at your service replied gaston  ay said the squire interrogatively then changing his tone but tell me honestly gaston repent you not of having taken service with gallant sir perduccas  why you have left him yourself  yes because we had sharp words on the spoil of a navarrese village my present leader sir william felton is as free and easy as dalbret or aymerigot marcel himself  and is not yon ungainly varlet the hope of some rich english house  i must see their hopes meet with no downfall said gaston walking away and muttering to himself  a plague upon it  to train two boys is more than i bargained for and over and above to hinder this wiseacre ashton from ruining himself or being ruined by le borgne basque  what brought him here  i thought he was safe in castile with the free companions  i would let the oaf take his course for a wilful wrongheaded fool but that it would scarce be doing good service to sir reginald  the knights had nearly finished their meal and the squires having served them with wine returned to their own table now freshly supplied with meat which the yeomen in their turn carved for them gaston kept leonard under his own eye till the party broke up  on the way to the tent he began to take him to task  a proper commencement  did you take the princes pavilion for one of your own island hostels where men may freely brawl and use their fists without fear of aught save the parish constable  what business had he to tread on my foot growled leonard  what business had your foot there  was not your office as i told you to stand ready to hand me whatever i might call for  i was speaking a few words to another gentleman  the fewer words you speak to le borgne basque the better unless you think it is sir reginalds pleasure that you should be instructed in all the dicing and drinking in this camp and unless you wish that the crowns with which your father stored your pouch should jingle in his pockets  it is well for you the knight marked you not  you held long enough parley with him yourself said the refractory pupil  look you master leonard ashton i do not presume to offer myself as an example to you save perhaps in the matter of sitting a steed or handing a winecup  i have no purse to lose and i have wit to keep it if i had or at least as a recollection crossed him if i lost it it should be to please myself and not le borgne basque above all my name and fame are made and yours  what would you say of mine said leonard with sulky indignation the heir of ashton is not to be evened to a wandering landless foreigner  it is not in sight of these mountain peaks said gaston contemptuously that i am to be called a foreigner and as to being landless if i chose to take my stand on the old tower of albricorte and call myself lord of the whole hillside i should like to see who would gainsay me  for name i suspect you will find that many a man has trembled at the sound of beranger dalbricorte to whom ashton would be but that of an english clown  moreover in this camp i would have you to know that the question is not who has the broadest lands but who has the strongest arm  and sir squire if you are not above listening to a piece of friendly counsel to brag of those acres of yours is the surest way to attract spoilers  i had rather a dozen time trust eustace in such company than you not only because he has more wit but because he has less coin  who is this man  what is his name asked eustace  le borgne basque i know no other said gaston  we reck little of names here especially when it may be convenient to have them forgotten  he is a free companion a routier brave enough but more ready at the sack than the assault and loving best to plunder waste and plunder again or else to fleece such sheep as our friend here  how could such a man gain entrance to the princes pavilion  stout hearts and strong arms find entrance in most places said gaston but as you saw he durst not appear at the upper table  the next morning the army began their march to the pyrenees  they halted for some days at the foot of the hills whilst negotiations were passing between the black prince and charles the bad king of navarre who might easily have prevented their entrance into the peninsula by refusing a passage through his mountain fastnesses  when the permission was granted they advanced with considerable danger and difficulty  the rugged paths were covered with snow and ice which made them doubly perilous for the horses and but for gastons familiarity with his native hills sir reginald declared that he could never have brought his little troop across them in safety  at length they emerged through the celebrated pass of roncesvalles where eustace in imagination listened to the echoes of the dying blast of roland  on the following evening he had the delight of reading his history in the veritable pages of archbishop turpin which precious work he found in the possession of brother waleran a layfriar in the employment of sir john froissart the chronicler who had sent him with the army as a reporter of the events of the campaign  this new acquaintance gave very little satisfaction to sir reginald who was almost ready to despair of eustaces courage and manhood when he found he had gone back to his books and manifested if not so much serious displeasure yet even more annoyance on this occasion than when shortly after he found that leonard ashton spent every moment at his own disposal in the company of le borgne basque  that worthy meeting the young gentleman had easily persuaded him that gastons cautions only proceeded from fears of stories that might with too much truth be told against himself and by skilful flatteries of the young englishmans selfimportance and sympathy with his impatience of the strict rule of the knight of lynwood succeeded in establishing over him great influence  so fared it with the two young squires whilst the army began to enter the dominions of the king of castile  here a want of provisions was severely felt for such was the hatred borne to pedro the cruel that every inhabitant of the country fled at his approach carrying off or destroying all that could be used as food  it was the intention of bertrand du guesclin the ally of enrique of trastamare to remain quietly in his camp of navaretta and allow hunger to do its work with the invading force but this prudent plan was prevented by the folly of don tello brother of enrique who accusing bertrand of cowardice so stung his fiery spirit that he resolved on instant combat though knowing how little dependence could be placed on his spanish allies  the challenge of the prince of wales was therefore accepted and never were tidings more welcome than these to the halffamished army encamped upon the banks of the ebro on the same ground on which in after years english valour was once more to turn to flight a usurping king of spain     chapter iv   the moon was at her height and shone full into the halfopened tent of sir reginald lynwood  at the further end quite in darkness the knight bareheaded and rosary in hand knelt before the darkrobed figure of a confessor while at a short distance lay on a couch of deerskins the sleeping leonard ashton  before the loopedup curtain that formed the door was gaston daubricour on one knee close to a huge torch of pinewood fixed in the earth examining by its flaring smoky light into the state of his masters armour proving every joint with a small hammer  near him eustace with the help of john ingram the stalwart yeoman was fastening his charge the pennon to a mighty lance of the toughest ashwood and often looking forth on the white tents on which the moonbeams shed their pale tranquil light  there was much to impress a mind like his in the scene before him the unearthly moonlight the few glimmering stars the skywhose southern clearness and brightness were to his unaccustomed eye doubly wonderfulthe constant though subdued sounds in the camp the murmur of the river and far away in the dark expanse of night the sparkling of a multitude of lights which marked the encampment of the enemy there was a strange calm awe upon his spirit  he spoke in a low voice and gastons careless lighthearted tones fell on his ear as something uncongenial but his eye glanced brightly his step was free and bold as he felt that this was the day that must silence every irritating doubt of his possessing a warriorspirit  the first red streak of dawn was beginning to glow in the eastern sky when the note of a bugle rang out from the princes tent and was responded to by hundreds of other horns  that instant the quiet slumbering camp awoke the space in front of every tent was filled with busy men arming themselves or saddling their horses  gaston and eustace already fully equipped assisted sir reginald to arm leonard was roused and began to fasten on his armour the menatarms came forth from their tent and the horses were saddled and bridled and now called sir reginald bring our last loaf john ingram  keep none back  by this days eve we shall have abundance or else no further need  the hard dry barleybread was shared in scanty but equal measure and scarcely had it been devoured before a second bugle blast pealing through the camp caused each mailclad warrior to close his visor and spring into the open plain where according to previous orders they arrayed themselves in two divisions the first commanded by the duke of lancaster and sir john chandos the second by prince edward and don pedro  after a pause employed in marshalling the different bands the host advanced at an even pace the rising sun glancing on their armour and revealing the multitude of waving crests and streamers fluttering from the points of the lances like the wings of gorgeous insects presently a wall of glittering armour was seen advancing to meet them with the same brilliant display  it might have seemed some mighty tournament that was there arrayed as the two armies stood confronting each other rather than a stern battle for the possession of a kingdom and well might old froissart declare it was a pleasure to see such hosts  but it would be presumptuous to attempt to embellish a tale after froissart has once touched it  to him then i leave it to tell how the rank of banneret was conferred on the gallant old chandos how the prince prayed aloud for a blessing on his arms how he gave the signal for the advance and how the boaster tello fled in the first encounter  the lances of lynwood in the division of the duke of lancaster well and gallantly did their part in the hard struggle with the brave band of french whose resistance was not overcome till the black prince himself brought his reserved troops to the aid of his brother  with the loss of only one manatarms the lances of lynwood had taken several prisoners  it was high noon and the field was wellnigh cleared of the enemy when sir reginald drew his rein at the top of a steep bank clothed with brushwood sloping towards the stream of the zadorra threw up his visor wiped his heated brow and patting his horses neck turned to his brother saying you have seen sharp work in this your first battleday eustace  it is a glorious day said eustace  see how they hurry to the water  and he pointed over the low shrubs to a level space on the bank of the river where several fugitives on foot and horseback were crowding together and pressing hastily forward  ha cried sir reginald the golden circlet  henry of trastamare himself and at the same instant he sprang to the ground  you said he speed round the bushes meet me at the ford they are making for this was directed to gaston and ere the last words were spoken both sir reginald and eustace were already beginning to hurry down the bank gaston rose to his full height in his stirrups and looking over the wood exclaimed the eagle crest i must be there  on ashtoningram this wayspeed speed speed and with these words threw himself from his horse and dashed after the two brothers as they went crashing in their heavy armour downwards through the boughs  in less than a minute they were on the level ground and sir reginald rushed forward to intercept don enrique who was almost close to the river  yield yield sir king he shouted but at the same moment another knight on foot threw himself between raising a huge battleaxe and crying away away sir leave me to deal with him enrique turned entered the river and safely swam his horse to the other side whilst his champion was engaged in desperate conflict  the knight of lynwood caught the first blow on his shield and returned it but without the slightest effect on his antagonist who though short in stature and clumsily made seemed to possess gigantic strength  a few moments more and reginald had fallen at full length on the grass while his enemy was pressing on to secure him as a prisoner or to seize the pennon which eustace held  the two squires stood with lifted swords before their fallen master but it cost only another of those irresistible strokes to stretch gaston beside sir reginald and eustace was left alone to maintain the struggle  a few moments more and the lances would come upbut how impossible to hold out  the first blow cleft his shield in two and though it did not pierce his armour the shock brought him to his knee and without the support of the staff of the pennon he would have been on the ground still however he kept up his defence using sometimes his sword and sometimes the staff to parry the strokes of his assailant but the strife was too unequal and faint with violent exertion as well as dizzied by a stroke which the temper of his helmet had resisted he felt that all would be over with him in another second when his sinking energies were revived by the cry of st george close at hand  his enemy relaxing his attack he sprang to his feet and that instant found himself enclosed almost swept away by a crowd of combatants of inferior degree as well as his own comrades as free lances all of whose weapons were turned upon his opponent  a sword was lifted over the enemys head from behind and would the next moment have descended but that eustace sprang up dashed it aside cried shame and grasping the arm of the threatened knight exclaimed yield yield it is your only hope  yield and to thee said the knight yet it is well meant  the sword of arthur himself would be of no avail  tiphaine was right it is the fated day  thou art of gentle birth  i yield me then rescue or no rescue the rather that i see thou art a gallant youth hark you fellows i am a prisoner so get off with you your name bold youth  eustace lynwood brother to this knight said eustace raising his visor and panting for breath  you need but a few years to nerve your arm  but rest a while you are almost spent said the prisoner in a kind tone of patronage as he looked at the youthful face of his captor which in a second had varied from deep crimson to deadly paleness  my brother my brother was all eustaces answer as he threw himself on the grass beside gaston who though bleeding fast had raised his masters head and freed him from his helmet but his eyes were still closed and the wound ghastly for such had been the force of the blow that the shoulder was wellnigh severed from the collarbone reginald  o brother look up cried eustace  o gaston does he live  i have crossed swords with him before said the prisoner  i grieve for the mishap  then as the soldiers crowded round he waved them off with a gesture of command which they instinctively obeyed  back clowns give him air  and hereone of youbring some water from the river  there he shows signs of life  as he spoke the clattering of horses feet was heardall made way and there rode along the bank of the river a band of spaniards headed by pedro himself his sword from hilt to point streaming with blood and his countenance ferocious as that of a tiger where is he was his cry where is the traitor enrique  i will send him to join the rest of the brood  where has he hidden himself  the prisoner who had been assisting to life the wounded man out of the path of the trampling horses turned round and replied with marked emphasis king henry of castile is thanks to our lady safe on the other side of the zadorra to recover his throne another day  du guesclin himself  ah dog cried pedro his eyes glaring with the malignity of a demon and raising his bloody weapon to hew down bertrand du guesclin for no other was the prisoner who stood with folded arms his dark eyes fixed in calm scorn on the kings face and his sword and axe lying at his feet  eustace was instantly at his side calling out my lord king he is my prisoner  thine said pedro with an incredulous look  leave him to my vengeance and thou shalt have goldhalf my treasuryall thy utmost wishes can reach  i give him up to none but my lord the prince of wales returned the young squire undauntedly  fool and caitiff out of my path or learn what it is to oppose the wrath of kings cried pedro  eustace grasped his sword  sir king you must win your way to him through my body  at this moment one of the attendants whispered el principe senor rey and in a few seconds more the black prince with a few followers rode towards the spot  hastily dismounting pedro threw himself on his knees to thank him for the victory but edward leaping from his horse raised him saying it is not to me but to the giver of victories that you should return thanks and eustace almost shuddered to see him embrace the bloodthirsty monster who still intent on his prey began the next moment here senor prince is the chief enemyhere is the disturber of kingdomsdu guesclin himselfand there stands a traitorous boy of your country who resolutely refuses to yield him to my just vengeance  as pedro spoke the prince exchanged with sir bertrand the courteous salutation of honourable enemies and then said in a quiet grave tone it is not our english custom to take vengeance on prisoners of war  my lord said eustace stepping forward as the prince looked towards him i deliver the prisoner into your princely hands  you have our best thanks sir squire said the prince  you are the young lynwood if i remember right  where is your brother  alas my lord here he lies sorely hurt said eustace only anxious to be rid of prisoner and prince and to return to reginald who by this time had by the care of gaston been recalled to consciousness  is it so  i grieve to hear it said edward with a face of deep concern advancing to the wounded knight bending over him and taking his hand how fares it with you my brave reginald  poorly enough my lord said the knight faintly i would i could have taken king henry  lament not for that said the prince but receive my thanks for the prize of scarcely less worth which i owe to your arms  what mean you my lord  not sir bertrand du guesclin i got nothing from him but my deathblow  how is this then said edward it was from your young brother that i received him  speak eustace said sir reginald eagerly and half raising himself sir bertrand your prisoner  fairly and honourably is it possible  fairly and honourably to that i testify said du guesclin  he knelt before you and defended your pennon longer than i ever thought to see one of his years resist that curtalaxe of mine the routier villains burst on us and were closing upon me when he turned back the weapon that was over my head and summoned me to yield which i did the more willingly that so gallant a youth should have such honour as may be acquired by my capture  he has it noble bertrand said edward  kneel down young squire thy name is eustace  in the name of god st michael and st george i dub thee knight  be faithful brave and fortunate as on this day arise sir eustace lynwood  thanks thanks my gracious prince said reginald a light glancing in his fading eyes  i should die content to see my brothers spurs so well earned  die  say not so my faithful reginald  speed denis and send hither our own leech  i trust you will live to see your son win his spurs as gallantly  no my good lord i am past the power of leech or surgeon i feel that this is my deathwound  i am glad it was in your cause  all i desire is your protection for my wifemy boymy brother  your brother has earned it already said edward  your child shall be as my own  but oh can nought be done  hasten the surgeon hither cheer thee reginaldlook up  o would that du guesclin were free the battle unfought so that thou wert but safe mine own dear brotherinarms  where is the prince called a voice from behind  my lord my lord if you come not speedily there will be foul slaughter made among the prisoners by your spanish butcherking i would say  i come i come chandos answered edward  fare thee well my brave reginald and you my newmade knight send tidings to my tent how it is with him  he pressed reginalds hand and sighing deeply mounted his horse and rode off with sir john chandos leaving the wounded knight to the care of his own followers  the stream of blood was flowing fast life was ebbing away and sir reginalds breath was failing as eustace relieving gaston from his weight laid his head on his breast and laved his brow with water from the river  you have done gallantly my brave brother i did wrong to doubt your spirit  thanks be to god that i can die in peace sure that arthur has in you a true and loving guardian  you are young eustace but my trust in you is firm you will train him in all christian and godly ways  it shall be the most sacred charge of my life said eustace scarcely able to speak  i know it said reginald and making an effort to raise his voice he continued bear witness all of you that i leave my son in the wardship of the king and of my brother sir eustace lynwood  and added he earnestly beware of fulk clarenham commend me to my sweet eleanor tell her she is the last as the first in my thoughts  then after a pause is gaston here  yes sir reginald said gaston leaning over him and pressing the hand which he feebly raised  gaston farewell and thanks to you for your true and loving service eustace will find wherewith to recompense you in some sort in my chest at bordeaux and my brave lances likewise and gaston go not back to the courses and comrades whence i took you on the word of a dying man it will be better for you when you are in this case  leonard strive to be a true and brave man though i may not fulfil your fathers trust  eustacemy eyes grow dimis this you supporting my headare these your tears  weep not for me brother  save for my poor eleanor i would not have it otherwise  mercy is sure  hold up the blessed roodthe sign of graceyou are half a clerk repeat me some holy psalm or prayer  eustace raised the cross hilt of his sword and with a broken voice commenced the miserere  sir reginald at first followed it with his lips but soon they ceased to move his head sank back his hand fell powerless and with one long gasping breath his faithful and noble spirit departed  for several moments eustace silently continued to hold the lifeless form in his arms then raising the face he imprinted an earnest kiss on the pale lips laid the head reverently on the ground hung over it for a short space and at last with an effort passed his hand over his face and turned away  his first look was towards daubricour who sat resting his head on his hand his elbow supported on his knee while with the other hand he dashed away his tears  his countenance was deathly pale and drops of blood were fast falling from the deep gash in his side o gaston exclaimed eustace with a feeling of selfreproach at having forgotten him i fear you are badly wounded  you would think little of it had you seen more stricken fields young knight said gaston attempting to smile i am only spent with loss of blood  bring me a draught of water and i can ride back to the tent  but look to your prisoner sir eustace  eustace turned to see what had become of his illustrious captive and saw him at a little distance speaking to a knight on horseback sir eustace said bertrand stepping towards him here is sir william beauchamp sent by the prince to inquire for your gallant brother and to summon me to his tent  i leave you the more willingly that i think you have no mind for guests this evening farewell  i hope to be better acquainted  eustace had little heart to answer but he took up du guesclins sword as if to return it to him  keep it sir knight said bertrand you know how to wield it  i am in some sort your godfather in chivalry and i owe you a gift  let me have yours that my side may not be without its wonted companion  farewell  and sir eustace lynwood said sir william beauchamp riding up you will advance to navaretta where we take up our quarters in the french camp  i grieve for the loss which has befallen us this day but i trust our chivalry has gained an equally worthy member  eustace bowed and whilst messire bertrand mounted a horse that had been brought for his use turned back to his own melancholy duties the body of sir reginald was raised from the ground and placed on the levelled lances of four of his men and eustace then assisted gaston to rise  he tottered leant heavily against the young knight and was obliged to submit to be lifted to the saddle but neither pain grief nor faintness could check his flow of talk  well eustacesir eustace i would sayyou have seen somewhat of the chances of war  the mischances you mean gaston  i tell you many a man in this host would have given his whole kindred for such luck as has befallen you  to cross swords with du guesclin is honour enough  this cut will be a matter of boasting to my dying day but to take him prisoner  nay that was no merit of mine  had not the rest come up my wars had soon been over and i had been spared this grief  i know what most youths would have done in your place and been esteemed never the worse  dropped the pennon at that first round blow that brought you to your knee and called for quarter  poor pennon i deemed it gone and would have come to your aid but before i could recover my feet the fight was over and i am glad the glory is wholly yours  knighted under a banner in a stricken field  it is a chance which befalls not one man in five hundred and you in your first battle  but he heeds me not  he thinks only of his brother  look up sir eustace tis but the chance of war better die under sword and shield than like a bedridden old woman better die honoured and lamented than worn out and forgotten still he has not a word  yea and i could weep too for company for never lived better knight nor one whom squire had better cause to love     chapter v   a battle in the days of chivalry was far less destructive than those of modern times  the loss in both armies at navaretta did not amount to six hundred and on pedros side but four knights had fallen of whom sir reginald lynwood was the only englishman  on the following day all the four were buried in solemn state at the church of the village of navaretta sir eustace following his brothers bier at the head of all the menatarms  on returning to his tent eustace found gaston sitting on his couch directing guy and old poitevin who had the blue crossletted pennon spread on the ground before him  eustace expressed his wonder what exclaimed gaston would i see my knight banneret the youngest knight in the army with paltry pennon  a banneret are you dubbed in the open field entitled to take precedence of all knight bachelors  here leonard bring that pennon to me that i may see if it can be cut square  poor eleanors pennon said eustace sadly  nay what greater honour can it have than in becoming a banner  i only grieve that this bloodstain the noblest mark a banner can bear is upon the swallowtail  but what do i see  you a belted knight in your plain esquires helmet and the bloodstained surcoat  ay and not even the gilded spurs he exclaimed indignantly  would that i had seen you depart  but it was leonards fault  why man knew you not your duty  i am no squire of eustace lynwood said ashton  every squire is bound to serve the knight in whose company he finds himself said daubricour  know you not thus much of the laws of chivalry  come bestir yourself that he may be better provided in future  you must present yourself to the prince tomorrow sir eustace  one of his squires bade me to his presence said the young knight but i must now write these heavy tidings to my poor sister and i am going to father walerans tent to seek parchment and ink  and how send you the letter  by the bearer of the princes letters to the king  sir richard ferrars knows him and will give them into his charge  so farewell gaston keep quiet and weary not yourself with my equipment  with these words he left the tent and gaston shaking his head and throwing himself back on his deerskins exclaimed tender and true brave and loving  i know not what to make of eustace lynwood  his spirit is high as a paladins of old of that i never doubted yet is his hand as deft at writing as a clerks and his heart as soft as a womans  how he sighed and wept the livelong night when he thought none could hear him  well sir reginald was a noble knight and is worthily mourned but where is the youth who would not have been more uplifted at his own honours than downcast at his loss and what newmade knight ever neglected his accoutrements to write sad tidings to his sisterinlaw  but he continued rising again guy bring me here the gilded spurs you will find yonder  the best were i know buried with sir reginald and methought there was something amiss with one rowel of the other  so it is  speed to maitre ferry the armourer and bid him come promptly  and lie you still on your couch meanwhile master daubricour said guy or there will soon be another squire missing among the lances of lynwood  i marvel at you daubricour said leonard looking up from a pasty which he was devouring with double relish to make up for past privations i marvel that you should thus weary yourself with your fresh wound and all for nought  call you our brave young banneret nought  shame on thee  all england should be proud of him much more his friend and companion  i wish eustace lynwood well with all my heart said leonard but i see not why he is to be honoured above all others  yourself gaston so much older so perfect in all exercises you who fought with this frenchman too of whom they make so much the prince might as well have knighted you as eustace who would have been down in another moment had not i made in to the rescue  methinks if i had been the prince i would have inquired upon whom knighthood would sit the best  and the choice would have been the same said gaston  not only was sir eustace the captor of messire bertrand whereas my luck was quite otherwise but what would knighthood have availed the wandering landless foreigner as you courteously term me save to fit me for the leadership of a band of routiers and unfit me for the office of an esquire which i do as you say understand indifferently well  is it not the same with him cried leonard  he does not own a palms breadth of land and for gold all he will ever possess is on those broken spurs of his brothers  listen to me leonard said gaston  rich or poor sir eustace is the only fit leader of the lances till the little boy is of age but this he could not be without knightly rank  even in this campaign when i might have taken the command i being disabled for the present it must have devolved on him who might not have been so readily obeyed  no indeed said leonard  strange that the touch of the princes sword should make so great a difference between him and me  if it was the touch of the princes sword that did so said gaston  what else sharply retorted leonard  not height nor strength his hand and arm might belong to a girl i could crush it in my grasp  so saying he extended a huge hard red palm  ay said gaston i should like to see whether that great paw would have won du guesclins sword  i tell you flatly proceeded ashton i might follow sir reginald since he was a man of substance honoured in our country and my father meant to oblige and do him grace by placing me with him  grace repeated gaston  but continued ashton angrily as to serving eustace the clerk no older than myself half a head shorter and a mere landless upstart that my fathers son shall never do  say you so said gaston  i recommend you not to do so quite so loud or perchance the landless upstart might hand your fathers son over to the provost marshal for preaching disaffection to his men and in good time here comes the master armourer  the rest of the day was spent by gaston in the arrangement of the equipments so important in his estimation and scarcely another word was spoken save on the choice of helm and shield and the adaptation of crests and blazonry  the next point for consideration was the disposal of the prisoners taken by the lances of lynwood in the early part of the battle  two were squires the other four roughlooking menatarms who protested that they could not pay one denier towards their ransom  eustace liberated them and was greatly inclined to do the same by the squires but gaston assured him it would be doing wrong to the princes cause to set the rogues free without taking some good french crowns from them and therefore permitting him to name what ransom he thought fit he returned to them their horses and dismissed them to collect the sum  early the next morning gaston had the satisfaction of beholding his young banneret arrayed in knightly guise the golden spurs on his heels du guesclins sword by his side and his white mantle flung over his shoulder  leonard was summoned to accompany him but he growled out something so like an absolute refusal and utter disclaimer of all duty to sir eustace that gaston began to reproach him vehemently  never mind gaston said eustace you never mend matters with him in that way i shall do very well alone  so you shall never go said gaston rising i will go myself i have been longing to see you received by the prince  where is my sword  nay gaston said eustace that must not be  see how the hot sunbeams lie across that hill between us and the princes tent you must not waste your strength if it is true that we are to journey to burgos today  it shows how new your chivalry is that you make so much of a mere scratch said gaston hastily commencing his preparations guy go you and saddle brigliador  no do not touch brigliador said eustace  you deny it in vain gaston your face betrays that you do not move without pain  i learnt some leechcraft among my clerkly accomplishments and you had better take care that you do not have the benefit  leonard since it is the only way to quiet him i order you to mount  leonard hung his head and obeyed  they rode towards the village of najara where eustace found the prince entering the church to hear morning mass  giving his horse to john ingram he followed among the other knights who thronged the little building  the service at an end he received more than one kind greeting from his brothers friends and one of them sir richard ferrars a fine old man whose irongray locks contrasted with his ruddy complexion led him forward to present him to the prince of wales  welcome our newmade knight said edward  brave comrades i present to you the youngest brother of our order trusting you will not envy him for having borne off the fairest rose of our chaplet of navaretta  bertrand du guesclin who stood among the throng of nobles around the prince was the first to come forward and shake eustace by the hand saying with a laugh nay my lord this is the first time the ugliest knight in france has been called by such a name  however young sir may you win and wear many another  that scarcely may be a sincere wish messire bertrand said the duke of lancaster unless you mean roses of love instead of roses of war and truly with his face and the fame he owes to you methinks he will not find our damsels at bordeaux very hard of heart  see he blushes as if we had guessed his very thought  truly my lord john said old sir john chandos sternly a man may well blush to hear a son of king edward talk as if such trifling were the reward of knighthood  his face and his fame forsooth as if he were not already in sufficient danger of being cockered up like some other striplings on whom it has pleased his highness to confer knighthood for as mere a chance as this  you have coloured his cheek in good earnest said the captal de buch consider chandos this is no time to damp his spirit  it were a spirit scarce worth fostering if it is to be damped by a little breath of the lips one way or the other said sir john moving off and adding when out of eustaces hearing a likely lad enough had he been under his brothers training but they will spoil him and i will have no hand in it  eustace had been accustomed to hold the warrior in such veneration that he felt considerably hurt and mortified at the want of welcome which contrasted with the kindness of the rest and he could hardly recover his selfpossession sufficiently to inquire the pleasure of the prince with regard to his brothers troop  take command yourself said edward  you surely have some esquire or manatarms who can supply your own want of experience  my brothers squire gaston daubricour is well learned in chivalry my lord said eustace and i will do my best with his aid to fulfil my trust  it is well said edward  the lances of lynwood are too well trained easily to forget their duty and i fear not but that you will do well how old is your brothers young heir  eight years my lord  we will soon have him at bordeaux said edward that he may grow up with my boys in the same friendship as their fathers  and now added he turning from eustace to the assembled nobles around him let us part and prepare for our further journey  in an hours time the bugles shall summon you to depart for burgos  the prince walked away towards his tent with the captal de buch and eustace looked round for his horse which he saw at no great distance with ingram but leonard ashton was nowhere in sight eustace mounted and rode towards his own tent desiring the yeoman to seek ashton out while he himself proceeded slowly musing with feelings of considerable disappointment and vexation on the reception he had met from sir john chandos the man in the whole camp whose good opinion he would have most valued  this is folly thought he however rousing himself after a minute or two of such meditations  what said the good old baron but what i know full well myself that i am far from meriting my new honours on whom does it depend but myself to win his praise and by our ladys grace i will make him confess at last that young as i am i can show that i deserve my spurs  what ho ingram where is master ashton  where you will little like to hear of him sir knight said the yeoman galloping up on his tall flemish horse  at the wineshop yonder in the village with that illfavoured oneeyed squire that you wot of  i called him as you desired and all that i got for an answer was that he would come at his own time and not at your bidding  said he so the ungracious headstrong fellow said eustace looking back wistfully  and what to do  to ride back myself might be the means of getting the whole troop late in starting and disorderlyyet to leave him  eustace looked at john ingrams comely and stolid face and then almost smiled at himself for seeking counsel from him  ride you on john said he tell master daubricour of the order to departlet all be in readiness by the time i return  then turning his horse quickly eustace rode back to the village all was haste and confusion therehorses were being led forth and saddled pages grooms and menatarms hurrying to and frobugles soundingeverything in the bustle incident to immediate departure  he could only make his way through the press slowly and with difficulty which ill suited with his impatience and perplexity  in front of the venta a low white cottage with a wooden balcony overspread with vines there was a still closer press and loud vehement voices as of disputants were heard while the various menatarms crowded in so closely to see the fray if such it were as to be almost regardless of the horse which eustace was pressing forward upon them  he looked over their heads to see leonard but in vain  he thought of retreat but found himself completely entangled in the throng  at that moment a cry was heard the provost marshal  the crowd suddenly he knew not how seemed to melt away from around him in different directions and he found himself left on horseback in the midst of the little village green amongst scattered groups of disreputablelooking yeomen archers and grooms who were making what speed they could to depart as from the other side the provost the archers of the guard and sir john chandos entered upon the scene  ha  what is all this  whom have we here exclaimed the old baron sir eustace lynwood  by my life a fair commencement for your dainty young knighthood  on my word my lord chandos said eustace colouring deeply i am no loiterer here i came but to seek my squire leonard ashton and found myself entangled in the crowd  ay ay  i understand said chandos without listening to him i see how it will be  off to your troop instantly master knight i suppose they are all seeking squires in the wineshops  you do me wrong my lord said eustace but you shall be obeyed  the bugles had already sounded before he reached his own quarters where he found that thanks to gaston all was right  the tent had been taken down and packed on the baggage mules the men were mounted and drawn up in full array with his banner floating above their heads and gaston himself was only waiting his appearance to mount a stout mule which martin the horseboy was leading up and down  this is well  thanks good gaston said eustace with a sigh of relief as he took off his heavy helmet which had become much heated during his hasty ride in the hot sun  no news of the truant asked gaston  who but you would have thought of going after him  well did i know you would never prosper without me at your elbow  eustace smiled but he was too much heated and vexed to give a very cheerful assent  he had only time to load ferragus with his armour and mount a small pony before the signal for the march was given and all set forth  early in the year as it was the sun already possessed great force and the dry rocky soil of castile reflected his beams so that long before noon it seemed to eustace almost as if their march lay through an oven  nor were his perplexities by any means at an end the thirst occasioned by the heat was excessive and at every venta in the villages through which they passed the men called loudly for liquor but the hot fiery spanish wine was as eustace had already been cautioned by father waleran only fit to increase the evil by inflaming their blood  it was the holy week which was to him a sufficient reason for refraining entirely contenting himself with a drink of water when it could be procured which however was but rarely  he would willingly have persuaded his men to do the same but remonstrance was almost without effect and his dry lips refused to utter a prohibition which would have been esteemed at once cruel and unreasonable  in his persuasions to gaston he was however more in earnest representing to him that he was increasing the fever of his wound but the squire was perfectly impracticable  at first he answered in his usual gay careless manner that the scratch was nothing and that be what it might he had as soon die of a wound as of thirst but as the day wore on it seemed as if the whole nature of the man were becoming changed sometimes he was boisterously loud in his merriment sometimes sullen and silent and when eustace unwearied reiterated his arguments he replied to him not only with complete want of the deference he was usually so scrupulous in paying to his dignity but with rude and scurril taunts and jests on his youth his clerkly education and his inexperience  eustaces patience would scarcely have held out but that he perceived that daubricour was by no means master of himself and he saw in his flushed brow and bloodshot eye reason to fear for the future effect of the present excess  there was suppressed laughter among the men at some of his sallies  without being positively in disorder the troop did not display the wellarrayed aspect which had always hitherto distinguished the lances of lynwood and poor eustace wearied and worn out his righthand man failing him dispirited by chandoss reproach and feeling all the cares of the world on his shoulders had serious thoughts of going to the prince and resigning the command for which he was unfit  at last he beheld the cathedral of burgos rising in the midst of the moorish fortifications of the town and halting his men under the shade of a few trees he rode on in search of the marshals of the camp and as soon as the open space for his tents had been assigned he returned to see them raised  gaston who had of late become more silent was lifted from his mule and assisted into the tent where he was laid on his couch and soon after eustace was relieved from his anxiety on leonard ashtons account by his appearance  he came stumbling in without one word of apology only declaring himself as weary as a dog and throwing himself down on a deerskin on his own side of the tent was fast asleep in another minute     chapter vi   leonard ashton was awakened the next morning by the light of the rising sun streaming in where the curtain of the tent had been raised to admit the fresh dewy morning air  the sunbeams fell on the hair and face of eustace as he leant over gaston who lay stretched on the couch and faintly spoke i tell you it is more such fever as this would not be caused by this trifling cut  there is sickness abroad in the camp and why should it not be my turn as well as another mans  take care of yourself sir eustace  no sooner did leonard understand the sense of these words than he sprang up rushed out of the tent and never rested till he thought himself at a safe distance when he shouted to eustace to come to him  has he got this fever on him exclaimed he as eustace approached  he is very ill at ease replied eustace but to my mind it is caused by yesterdays fatigue and heat added to the wine which he would drink  it is the fever i say replied ashton i am sure it is  come away eustace or we shall all be infected  i cannot leave him said eustace  what  you do not mean to peril yourself by going near him said ashton  i think not that there is peril in so doing answered eustace and even if there were i could not leave him in sickness after all his kindness to me and patience with my inexperience  he is no brother nor cousin to us said leonard  i see not why we should endanger our lives for a stranger  i will not for my own part and as your old friend and comrade i would entreat you not  these were kinder words than eustace had heard from ashton since the beginning of his jealousy and he answered as he thought they were meant in a friendly tone thanks leonard but i cannot look on gaston daubricour as a stranger and had i fewer causes for attachment to him i could not leave my post  only you do not expect me to do the same said leonard my father sent me here to gain honour and wealth not to be poisoned with the breath of a man in a fever  assuredly not said eustace  i will arrange matters so that you shall no longer sleep in our tent  but let me ask of you leonard what was the meaning of your conduct of yesterday  you may ask yourself said leonard sullenly it is plain enough methinks  have a care leonard  remember that my brothers authority is given to me  much good may it do you said leonard but that is nothing to me i am no vassal of yours to come at your call  i have my own friends and am not going to stay in this infected part of the camp with men who keep a fever among them  give me but my sword and mantle from the tent and i will trouble you no more  wait leonard i will take all measures for your safety but remember that i am answerable to the prince for my brothers followers  answer for your own serfs retorted leonard who had nearly succeeded in working himself into a passion  my father might be willing to grace sir reginald by letting me follow him but by his death i am my own man and not to move at your beck and call because the prince laid his sword on your shoulder  knave jasper he called to one of the menatarms bring my sword and cloak from the tent i enter it no more  i know not how far you may be bound to me said eustace and must inquire from some elder knight but i fear that your breaking from me may be attended with evil effects to your name and fame  leonard had put on his dogged expression and would not listen he had already set his mind on joining le borgne basque and leaving the service which his own envious service rendered galling and the panic excited in his mind by gastons illness determined him to depart without loss of time or listening to the representations which he could not answer  he turned his back on eustace and busied himself with the fastenings of his sword which had by this time been brought to him  even yet eustace was not rebuffed  one more hint leonard from what i am told there is more peril to thy health in revelry than in the neighbourhood of poor gaston  if you will quit one who wishes you well take heed to your ways  still the discourteous squire made no reply and walked off in all the dignity of illhumour  the young knight who really had a warm feeling of affection for him stood looking after him with a sigh and then returned to his patient whom he found in an uneasy sleep after a few moments consideration he summoned old guy to take the part of nurse and walked to the tent of sir richard ferrars to ask his counsel  the old knight who was standing at the door of his tent examining into some hurt which his steed had received the day before kindly and cordially greeted eustace on his approach  i am glad you are not above taking advice he said as many a youth might be after such fresh honours  i feel but too glad to find some one who will bestow advice on me said eustace and he proceeded to explain his difficulties with regard to leonard ashton  let him go and a good riddance said sir richard half your cares go with him  yet i am unwilling not to attempt to hinder my old comrade from running to ruin  you have quite enough on your own hands already said the old knight he would do far more harm in your troop than out of it and try your patience every hour  he is my old playfellow said eustace still dissatisfied  more shame for him said sir richard waste not another thought on so crossgrained a slip who as i have already feared might prove a stumblingblock to you so young in command as you are  let him get sick of his chosen associates and no better hap can befall him  and for yourself what shall you do with this sick squire  what can i do save to give the best attendance i may  nay i am not the man to gainsay it  tis no more than you ought and yet  he surveyed the young knights slender form and slightly moulded limbs his cheeks pale with watching and the oppressive heat of the night and the heavy appearance of the eyelids that shaded his dark blue thoughtful eyes  is your health good young man  as good as that of other men said eustace  men said sir richard boys you mean  but be a man since you will only take as good care of yourself as consists with duty  i had rather have you safe than a dozen of these blackvisaged gascons  eustace further waited to mention to sir richard his untoward encounter with sir john chandos and to beg him to explain it to the old baron  i will said sir richard and dont take old chandoss uncourtliness too much to heart young eustace  he means you no ill  do your duty and he will own it in time  eustace thanked the old knight and with spirits somewhat cheered returned to his tent there to devote himself to the service of his sick squire  the report that the fever was in his tent made most persons willing to avoid him and he met little interruption in his cares  of leonard all that he heard was from a manatarms who made his appearance in his tent to demand master ashtons arms horse and other property he having entered the service of sir william felton and eustace was too much engaged with his own cares to make further inquiry after him  for a day or two gaston daubricours fever ran very high and just when its violence was beginning to diminish a fresh access was occasioned by the journey from burgos to valladolid whither he was carried in a litter when the army by pedros desire marched thither to await his promised subsidy  the unwholesome climate was of most pernicious effect to the whole of the english army and in especial to the black prince who there laid the foundation of the disorder which destroyed his health  week after week passed on each adding heat to the summer and increasing the long roll of sick and dying in the camp while gaston still lay languid and feeble by day and fevered by night there were other patients among the menatarms requiring scarcely less care and the young knight himself though owing to his temperate habits he had escaped the prevailing sickness was looking thin and careworn with the numerous troubles and anxieties that were pressing on him  still he had actually lost not one of his men and after the first week or two began to have more confidence in himself and to feel his place as their commander more than he would have done had gaston been able to assist him  at last his trusty squire began slowly to recover though nightly returns of fever still kept him very weak  the pyrenean breezes would make me another man said he one evening when eustace had helped him to the front of the tent where he might enjoy the coolness which began to succeed the sultry heat of the day  i hear said eustace that we are to return as soon as the prince can be moved  he is weary of waiting till this dog of a spaniard will perform his contract  by my faith said daubricour i believe the butcherly rogue means to cancel his debts by the death of all his creditors  i would give my share of the pay were it twenty times more for one gust of the mountain air of my own hills  which way lies your home gaston asked eustace  near the pass by which we crossed  no more to the west  my home call you it  you would marvel to see what it is now  a shattered firescathed keep the wolfs den in earnest it may be  it is all that is left of the castle dalbricorte  how exclaimed eustace  what brought this desolation  heard you never my story said gaston  mayhap not  you are fresh in the camp and it is no recent news nor do men question much whence their comrades come  well albricorte was always a noted house for courage and my father baron beranger not a whit behind his ancestors  he called himself a liegeman of england because england was farthest off and least likely to give him any trouble and made war with all his neighbours in his own fashion rare was the prey that the old black wolf of the pyrenees was wont to bring up to his lair and right merry were the feastings there well i do remember how my father and brothers used to sound their horns as a token that they did not come emptyhanded and then panting up the steep path would come a rich merchant whose ransom filled our purses half a year after or a knight whose glittering armour made him a double prize or  what you were actually  freebooters after the fashion of our own quatre fils aymon answered gaston composedly  yes beranger dalbricorte was the terror of all around and little was the chance that aught would pursue him to his den  so there i grew up as well beseemed the cub of such a wolf racing through the old halls at my will  your mother asked eustace  ah poor lady  i remember her not  she died when i was a babe and all i know of her was from an old hag the only woman in the castle to whom the charge of me was left  my mother was a noble navarrese damsel whom my father saw at a tourney seized and bore away as she was returning from the festival  poor lady our grim castle must have been a sad exchange from her green valleysand the more that they say she was soon to have wedded the lord of montagudo the victor of that tourney  the montagudos had us in bitter feud ever after and my father always looked like a thunderstorm if their name was spoken they say she used to wander on the old battlements like a ghost ever growing thinner and whiter and scarce seemed to joy even in her babes but would only weep over them  that angered the black wolf and there were chidings which made matters little better till at last the poor lady pined away and died while i was still an infant  a sad tale said eustace  ay i used to weep at it when the old crone who nursed me would tell it over as i sat by her side in the evening  see here is holy relic that my mother wore round her neck and my nurse hung round mine  it has never been parted from me  so i grew up to the years of pagehood which came early with me and forth i went on my first foray with the rest of them  but as we rode joyously home with our prey before us a band of full a hundred and fifty menatarms set on us in the forest our brave thirtydown they went on all side  i remember the tumult the heavy mace uplifted and my fathers shield thrust over me  i can wellnigh hear his voice saying flinch not gaston my brave wolfcub  but then came a fall man and horse together and i went down stunned and knew no more till a voice over me said that whelp is stirringanother swordthrust  but another replied he bears the features of alienor i cannot slay him  it was your mothers lover  montagudo  even so and i was about to beg for mercy but at my first movement the other fellows sword struck me back senseless once more and when i recovered my wits all was still and the moonlight showed me where i was  and a fair scene to waken to a score of dark shapes hung on the treesour trusty menatarmsand my own head was resting on my dead fathers breast  us they had spared from hangingour gentle blood did us that service but my father and my three brethren all were stone dead  the count de bearn had sworn to put an end to the ravages of the black wolf and joining with the montagudos had done the work like traitor villains as they were  and yourself gaston  i was not so badly wounded but that i could soon rise to my feetbut where should i go  i turned towards the castle but the bearnese had been there before me and i saw flames bursting from every window  i was weak and wounded and sank down bleeding and bewailing till my senses left me and i should have died but for two benedictines journeying for the service of their convent  the good brethren were in fear for their bags in going through the black wolfs country but they had pity on me they brought me to myself and when they had heard my tale they turned aside to give christian burial to my father and brothers they were holy men those monks and for their sakes i have spared the cowl ever since  they tended me nearly as well as you have done and brought me to their convent where they would fain have made a monk of me but the wolf was too strong in me and ere a month was passed i had been so refractory a pupil that they were right glad to open the convent gates  i walked forth to seek my fortune without a denier with nothing but the sword i had taken from my fathers hand and borne with me much against the good mens will  i meant to seek service with any one who would avenge me on the count de bearn  one night i slept on the hillside one day i fasted the next i fell in with sir perduccas dalbrets troop  i had seen him in my fathers company he heard my tale saw me a strong spirited lad and knew a daubricour would be no discredit to his free lances  so he took me as his page and thencebut the tale would be longi became what you see me  and you have never seen your own castle again  but once  dalbret laughed when i called on him to revenge me on the count de bearn and bade me bide my time till i met him in battle  as to my heritage there was no hope for that  once when i had just broken with sir nele loring and left his troop and times were hard with me i took my horse and rode to albricorte but there was nought but the bare mountain and the walls black with fire  there was indeed a wretched shepherd and his wife who trembled and looked dismayed when they found that one of the albricortes still lived but i could get nothing from them unless i had taken a sheep before me on the saddle so i rode off again to seek some fresh service and by good hap lit on sir reginald just as old harwood was dead  all i have from my father is my name my shield and an arm that i trust has disgraced neither  no indeed  yours is a strange history gaston such as we dream not of in our peaceful land  homeless friendless i know not how you can be thus gay spirited  a light heart finds its way through the world the easiest said gaston smiling  i have nothing to lose and no sorrows to waste time on  but are you not going forth this cool evening sir eustace you spoke of seeking fresh tidings of the prince  eustace accordingly walked forth attended by his yeoman john ingram but all he could learn was that edward had sent a remonstrance to the king of castile on the delay of the subsidy     chapter vii   as eustace was returning his attention was caught by repeated groans which proceeded from a wretched little hovel almost level with the earth  hark said he to ingram a tall stout manatarms from the lynwood estate  didst thou not hear a groaning  some of the castilians sir  to think that the brutes should be content to live in holes not fit for swine  but methought it was an english tongue  listen john  and in truth english ejaculations mingled with the moans to st joseph of glastonbury a shrine of silver  blessed lady of taunton a silver candlestick  oh st dunstan  eustace doubted no longer and stooping down and entering the hut he beheld as well as the darkness would allow him leonard ashton himself stretched on some mouldy rushes and so much altered that he could scarcely have been recognized as the sturdy ruddy youth who had quitted the lances of lynwood but five weeks before  eustace eustace he exclaimed as the face of his late companion appeared  can it be you  have the saints sent you to my succour  it is i myself leonard replied eustace and i hope to aid you how is it  let me feel your hand that i may be sure you are flesh and blood cried ashton raising himself and grasping eustaces hand between his own which burnt like fire then lowering his voice to a whisper of horror she is a witch  who asked eustace making the sign of the cross  leonard pointed to a kind of partition which crossed the hut beyond which eustace could perceive an old haglike woman bending over a cauldron which was placed on the fire  having made this effort he sank back hiding his face with his cloak and trembling in every limb a thrill of dismay passed over the knight and the giant john ingram stood shaking like an aspen pale as death and crossing himself perpetually  oh take me from this place eustace repeated leonard or i am a dead man both body and soul  but how came you here leonard  i fell sick some three days since andand fearing infection sir william felton bade me be carried from his lodgings the robbers his menatarms stripped me of all i possessed and brought me to this doghole to the care of this old hag  oh eustace i have heard her mutter prayers backwards and last nightoh last night at the dead hour there came in a processionof that i would take my oathseven black cats each holding a torch with a blue flame and danced around me till one laid his paw upon my breast and grew and grew with its flaming eyes fixed on me till it was as big as an ox and the weight was intolerable the while her spells were over me and i could not open my lips to say so much as an ave mary  at last the cold dew broke out on my brow and i should have been dead in another instant when i contrived to make the sign of the cross whereat they all whirled wildly round and i felloh i fell miles and miles downwards till at last i found myself at mornings light with the hateful old witch casting water in my face  oh eustace take me away  such were the times that eustace lynwood with all his cool sense and mental cultivation believed implicitly poor leonards delirious fancyblack cats and all and the glances he cast at the poor old spaniard were scarcely less full of terror and abhorrence as he promised leonard whom he now regarded only in the light of his old comrade that he should without loss of time be conveyed to his own tent  but go notleave me not implored leonard clinging fast to him almost like a child to its nurse with a hand which was now cold as marble  no i will remain said eustace and you ingram hasten to bring four of the men with the litter in which master daubricour came from burgos  hasten i tell you  ingram with his eyes dilated with horror appeared but too anxious to quit this den yet lingered  i leave you not here sir knight  thanks thanks john replied the youth but remain i must and will  as a christian man i defy the foul fiend and all his followers  john departed  never was leonard so inclined to rejoice in his friends clerkly education or in his knighthood which was then so much regarded as a holy thing that the presence of one whose entrance into the order was so recent was deemed a protection the old woman a kindhearted creature in the main though certainly forbiddinglooking in her poverty and ugliness was rejoiced to see her patient visited by a friend  she came towards them addressing eustace with what he took for a spell though had he understood spanish he would have found it a fine flowing compliment  leonard shrank closer to him pressed his hand faster and he again crossing himself gave utterance to a charm spanish especially old castilian had likeness enough to latin for the poor old woman to recognize its purport she poured out a voluble vindication which the two young men believed to be an attempt at further bewitching them  eustace finding his latin rather the worse for wear had recourse to all the strange rhymes or exorcisms english french or latin with which his memory supplied him  thanks to these the sorceress was kept at bay and the spirits of his terrified companion were sustained till the arrival of all the lances of lynwood headed by gaston himself upon his mule in the utmost anxiety for his knight looking as gaunt and spectral as the phantoms they dreaded  he blessed the saints when eustace came forth safe and sound and smiled and shook his head with an arch look when leonard was carried out but his neverfailing goodnature prevented him from saying a word which might savour of reproach when he saw to what a condition the poor youth was reduced  as four stout menatarms took up the litter the old woman coming forth to her threshold uttered something which his knowledge of the romanesque tongues of southern france enabled him to interpret into a vindication of her character and a request for a reward for her care of the sick englishman  throw her a gold piece sir eustace or she may cast at you an evil eye  there you old hag he added in the provencal patois take that and thank your stars that tis not with a fire that your tender care as you call it is requited  the menatarms meditated ducking the witch after their own english fashion but it was growing late and dark and the knight gave strict orders that they should keep together in their progress to their own tents  here leonard was deposited on the couch which gaston insisted on giving up to him but his change of residence appeared to be of little advantage for the camp was scarce quiet for the night before he shrieked out that the black cats were there  neither eustace nor gaston could see them but that was only a proof that they were not under the power of the enchantment and john ingram was quite sure that he had not only seen the sparkle of their fiery eyes but felt the scratch of their talons which struck him to the ground with his foot caught in the rope of the tent while he was walking about with his eyes shut  the scratch was actually on his face the next morning and he set out at the head of half the lances of lynwood to find the poor old woman and visit her with condign punishment but she was not forthcoming and they were obliged to content themselves with burning her house assisted by a host of idlers  in the meantime sir eustace had called in the aid of the clergy the chaplains of the camp came in procession sprinkled the patients bed with holy water and uttered an exorcism but without availing to prevent a third visit from the enemy  after this however leonards fever began to abate and he ceased to be haunted  he had been very ill and thoroughly alarmed he thought himself dying and bitterly did he repent of the headstrong insubordination and jealously which had lead him to quit his best and only friend he had not indeed the refinement of feeling which would have made eustaces generosity his greatest reproach he clung to him as his support and received his attentions almost as a right but still he was sensible that he had acted like a fool and that such friendship was not to be thrown away and when he began to recover he showed himself subdued to a certain degree grateful and decidedly less sullen and more amenable to authority  in the meantime the prince of wales found himself sufficiently recovered to undertake to return to aquitaine and weary of the treacherous delays and flagrant crimes of his ally he resolved to quit this fatal land of castile  there was a general cry of joy throughout the camp when orders were given that the tents should be struck and the army begin its march in the early coolness of the next morning and without further adventure the black prince led his weakened and reduced forces over the pyrenees back into france  here they were again dispersed as the war was at an end and the young sir eustace lynwood received high commendation from the prince and even from chandos himself for being able to show his brothers band as complete in numbers and discipline as on the day when it was given into his charge  this as chandos said was a service which really showed him worthy of his spurs if he would but continue the good course  the peace with france however prevented the prince from being desirous of keeping up the lances of lynwood and he therefore offered to take their young leader into his own troop of knights who were maintained at his own table and formed a part of his state and so distinguished was this body that no higher favour could have been offered  edward likewise paid to sir eustace a considerable sum as the purchase of his illustrious captive and this together with the ransoms of the two other prisoners enabled him to reward the faithful menatarms some of whom took service with other knights and others returned to england  leonard ashton having no pleasant reminiscences of his first campaign and having been stripped of all his property by his chosen associates was desirous of returning to his father and eustace after restoring his equipments to something befitting an esquire of property and liberally supplying him with the expenses of his journey bade him an affectionate farewell and saw him depart not without satisfaction at no longer feeling himself accountable for his conduct  there he goes said gaston and i should like to hear the tales he will amaze the good somersetshire folk with  i trow he will make them believe that he took du guesclin himself and that the prince knighted you by mistake  his tale of the witches will be something monstrous said eustace but still methinks he is much the better for his expedition far less crabbed in temper and less clownish in manners  ay said gaston if he were never to be under any other guidance than yours i think the tough ashbough might be moulded into something less unshapely  you have a calmness and a temper such as he cannot withstand nor i understand  tis not want of spirit but it is that you never seem to take or see what is meant for affront i should think it tameness in any other  well poor fellow i wish he may prosper said eustace  but now gaston to our own affairs  let us see what remains of the gold  ah your bounty to our friend there has drawn deeply on our purse said gaston  it shall not be the worse for you gaston for i had set aside these thirty golden crowns for you before i broke upon my own store  it is not such a recompense as reginald or i myself would have wished after such loving and faithful service but gold may never recompense truth  as for recompense said gaston i should be by a long score the debtor if we came to that  if it had not been for sir reginald  i should be by this time a reckless freebooter without a hope in this world or the next if it had not been for you these bones of mine would long since have been picked by my cousins the spanish wolves but let the gold tarry in your keeping it were better king edwards good crowns should not be after all else that has been in my hands  but gaston you will need fitting out for the service of sir william beauchamp  what  what mean you sir eustace cried gaston  what have i done that you should dismiss me from your followers  nay kind gaston it were shame that so finished a squire should be bound down by my poverty to be the sole follower of a banner which will never again be displayed at the head of such a band as the lances of lynwood  no sir eustace i leave you not  recall your brothers words go not back to old ways and comrades quoth he and if you cast me off what else is left for me for having once served a banneret no other shall have my service  where else should i find one who would care a feather whether i am dead or alive  so there it endsput up your pieces or rather give me one  wherewith to purvey a new bridle for brigliador for the present is far from worthy of his name  accordingly the gascon squire still remained attached to eustaces service while the trusty englishman john ingram performed the more menial offices  time sped away at the court of bordeaux the gallant du guesclin was restored to liberty after twice paying away his ransom for the deliverance of his less renowned brethren in captivity and enrique of trastamare returning to castile was once more crowned by the inhabitants  his brother pedro attempting to assassinate him fell by his hand and all the consequences of the english expedition were undoneall save the wasting disease that preyed on englands heir and the desolation at the orphaned hearth of lynwood keep     chapter viii   two years had passed since the fight of navaretta when sir eustace lynwood received by the hands of a knight newly arrived from england a letter from father cyril praying him to return home as soon as possible since his sisterinlaw dame eleanor was very sick and desired to see him upon matters on which more could not be disclosed by letter  easily obtaining permission to leave bordeaux he travelled safely through france and crossing from brittany at length found himself once more in somersetshire  it was late and fast growing dark when he rode through bruton but eager to arrive he pushed on though twilight had fast faded into night and heavy clouds laden with brief but violent showers were drifting across the face of the moon  on they rode in silence save for gastons execrations of the english climate and the plashing of the horses feet in the miry tracks along which in many places the water was rushing in torrents  at length they were descending the long low hill or rather undulation leading to the wooded vale of lynwood and the bright lights of the keep began to gleam like stars in the darknessstars indeed to the eager eyes of the young knight who gazed upon them long and affectionately as he felt himself once more at home  i wonder said he to see the light strongest towards the east end of the castle  i knew not that the altar lights in the chapel could be seen so far then riding on more quickly and approaching more nearly he soon lost sight of them behind the walls and descending the last little rising ground the lofty mass of building rose huge and black before him  he wound his bugle and rode towards the gate but at the moment he expected to cross the drawbridge ferragus suddenly backed and he perceived that it was raised  this is some strange chance said he renewing the summons but in vain for the echoes of the surrounding woods were the only reply ralph must indeed be deaf said he  let him be stone deaf said gaston he is not the sole inhabitant of the castle  try them again sir eustace  harkmethought i heard the opening of the hall door said eustace no  what can have befallen them  my teeth are chattering with cold said gaston and the horses will be ruined with standing still in the driving rain  cannot we betake ourselves to the village hostel and in the morning reproach them with their churlishness  i must be certified that there is nothing amiss said sir eustace springing from his saddle i can cross the moat on one of the supports of the bridge  have with you then sir knight said gaston also leaping to the ground while eustace cautiously advanced along the narrow frame of wood on which the drawbridge had rested slippery with the wet and rendered still more perilous by the darkness  gaston followed balancing himself with some difficulty and at last they safely reached the other side  eustace tried the heavy gates but found them fastened on the inside with a ponderous wooden bar  most strange muttered he yet come on gaston i can find an entrance unless old ralph be more on the alert than i expect  creeping along between the walls and the moat till they had reached the opposite side of the keep eustace stopped at a low doorway a slight click was heard as of a latch yielding to his hand the door opened and he led the way up a stone staircase in the thickness of the wall warning his follower now and then of a broken step  after a long steep ascent gaston heard another door open and though still in total darkness perceived that they had gained a wider space the passage from the hall to the chapel whispered the knight and feeling by the wall they crept along until a buzz of voices reached their ears and light gleamed beneath a heavy dark curtain which closed the passage pausing for an instant they heard a voice tremulous with fear and eagerness it was himself tall plume bright armour the very crosslet on his breast could be seen in the moonlight  oh it was sir reginald himself and the wild young french squire that fell with him in spain  there was a suppressed exclamation of horror and a sound of crowding together and at that moment eustace drawing aside the curtain advanced into the light and was greeted by a frightful shriek which made him at first repent of having alarmed his sister but the next glance showed him that her place was empty and a thrill of dismay made him stand speechless and motionless as he perceived that the curtain he grasped was black and the hall completely hung with the same colour  the servants remained huddled in terror round the hearth and the pause was first broken by a fairfaced boy who breaking from the trembling circle came forward and in a quivering tone said sir are you my fathers spirit  gastons laugh came strangely on the scene but eustace bending down and holding out his hand said i am your uncle eustace arthur where is your mother  arthur with a wild cry of joy sprung to his neck and hid his face on his shoulder and at the same moment old ralph with uplifted hands cried blessing on the saints that my young lord is safe and that mine eyes have seen you once again  but where oh where is my sister again demanded eustace as his eye met that of father cyril who summoned by the screams of the servants had just entered the hall  my son replied the good father solemnly your sister is where the wicked may trouble her no more  it is three days now since she departed from this world of sorrow  oh had she but lived to see this day said ralph penrose her cares would have been over  her prayers are answered said father cyril  come with me my son eustace if you would take a last look of her who loved and trusted you so well  eustace followed him to the chamber where the lady eleanor lynwood lay extended on her bed  her features were pinched and sharpened and bore traces of her long wasting sufferings but they still looked lovely though awful in their perfect calmness  eustace knelt and recited the accustomed prayers and then stood gazing on the serene face with a full heart and gathering tears in his eyes for he had loved the gentle eleanor with the trusting affection of a younger brother  he thought of that joyous time the first brilliant day of his lonely childhood when the gay bridal cavalcade came sweeping down the hill and he half in pleasure half in shyness was led forth by his mother to greet the fair young bride of his brother  how had she brightened the dull old keep and given as it were a new existence to himself a dreamy solitary boyhow patiently and affectionately had she tended his mother and how pleasant were the long evenings when she had unwearily listened to his beloved romances and his visions of surpassing achievements of his own  no wonder that he wept for her as a brother would weep for an elder sister  father cyril well pleased to perceive that the kindly tenderness of his heart was still untouched by his intercourse with the world let him gaze on for some time in silence then laying his hand on his arm said she is in peace  mourn not that her sorrows are at an end her tears wiped away but prepare to fulfil her last wishes those prayers in answer to which as i fully believe the saints have sent you at the very moment of greatest need  her last wishes said eustace  they shall be fulfilled to the utmost as long as i have life or breath  oh had i but come in time to hear them from herself and give her my own pledge  grieve not that her trust was not brought down to aught of earth said father cyril  she trusted in heaven and died in the sure belief that her child would be guarded and lo his protector is come if as i well believe my son eustace you are not changed from the boy who bade us farewell three years ago  if i am changed it is not in my love for home and for all who dwell there said eustace or rather i love them better than before little did i dream what a meeting awaited me  again there was a long pause which eustace at length broke by saying what is the need you spoke of  what danger do you fear  this is no scene for dwelling on the evil deeds of wicked men otherwise than to pray for them said the priest but return with me to the hall and you shall hear  eustace lingered a few moments longer before heaving a deep sigh he returned to the hall where he found gaston and ingram just come in from attending to the horses and ralph hurrying the servants in setting out an ample meal for the travellers  my good old friend said eustace holding out his hand as he entered i have not greeted you aright  you must throw the blame on the tidings that took from me all other thought ralph for never was there face which i was more rejoiced to see  it was the blame of our own reception of you sir eustace said old penrose  i could tear my hair to think that you should have met with no better welcome than barred gates and owlet shrieks but did you but know how wildly your bugleblast rose upon our ear while we sat over the fire wellnigh distraught with sorrow you would not marvel that we deemed that the spirit of our good knight might be borne upon the moaning wind  yet said arthur i knew the note and would have gone to the turret window but that mistress cicely held me fast and when they sent jocelyn to look the cowardly knave brought back the tale which you broke short  boast not master arthur said gaston you believed in our ghostship as fully as any of them  but met us manfully said eustace  but why all these precautions why the drawbridge raised  that could scarce be against a ghost  alas  sir eustace there are bodily foes abroad said ralph  by your leave master daubricour as gaston was about to assist his knight in unfastening his armour none shall lay a hand near sir eustace but myself on this first night of his return thanks be to st dunstan that he has come  eustace stood patiently for several minutes while the old man fumbled with his armour and presently came the exclamation a plague on these newfangled clasps which a man cannot undo for his life  twas this low corselet that was the death of good sir reginald  i always said that no good would come of these fashions  in process of time eustace was disencumbered of his heavy armour but when he stood before him in his plain dress of chamois leather old ralph shook his head disappointed that he had not attained the height or the breadth of the stalwart figures of his father and brother but was still slight and delicate looking  the golden spurs and the sword of du guesclin however rejoiced the old mans heart and touching them almost reverentially he placed the large armchair at the head of the table and began eagerly to invite him to eat  eustace was too sorrowful and too anxious to be inclined for food and long before his followers had finished their meal he turned from the table and asked for an account of what had befallen in his absence for there was at that time no more idea of privacy in conversation than such as was afforded by the comparative seclusion of the party round the hearth consisting of the knight his arm around his little nephew who was leaning fondly against him of father cyril of gaston and old ralph in his wonted nook his elbow on his knee and his chin on his hand feasting his eyes with the features of his beloved pupil  in answer to the query who is the enemy you fear there was but one answer given in different tones the lord de clarenham  ha cried eustace it was justly then that your father arthur bade me beware of him when he committed you to my charge on the battlefield of navaretta  did he so exclaimed father cyril  did he commit the boy to your guardianship  formally and before witnesses  i can testify to it good father said gaston  ay and you ingram must have been within hearingto say nothing of du guesclin  and leonard ashton said ingram  it is well said father cyril he will be here tomorrow to be confronted with clarenham  it is the personal wardship that is of chief importance and dwelt most on my ladys mind  clarenham lays claim then to the guardianship asked eustace  father cyril proceeded with a narrative the substance of which was as followssimon de clarenham as has been mentioned had obtained from king edward in the days of the power of isabel and mortimer a grant of the manor of lynwood but on the fall of the wicked queen the rightful owner had been reinstated without however any formal revocation of the unjust grant  knowing it would cost but a word of sir reginald to obtain its recall both simon and fulk de clarenham had done their best to make him forget its existence but no sooner did the news of his death reach england than fulk began to take an ungenerous advantage of the weakness of his heir  he sent a summons for the dues paid by vassals to their lord on a new succession and on eleanors indignant refusal followed it up by a further claim to the wardship of the person of arthur himself both in right of his alleged feudal superiority and as the next of kin who was of full age  again was his demand refused and shortly after lady lynwoods alarms were brought to a height by an attempt on his part to waylay her son and carry him off by force whilst riding in the neighbourhood of the castle  the plot had failed by the fidelity of the villagers of lynwood but the shock to the lady had increased the progress of the decay of her health already undermined by grief  she never again trusted her son beyond the castle walls she trembled whenever he was out of her sight and many an hour did she spend kneeling before the altar in the chapel  on her brotherinlaw sir eustace her chief hope was fixed on him she depended for bringing arthurs case before the king and above all for protecting him from the attacks of the enemy of his family rendered so much more dangerous by his relationship  she did not believe that actual violence to arthurs person was intended but fulks house had of late become such an abode of misrule that his mother and sister had been obliged to leave it for a convent and the tales of the lawlessness which there prevailed were such that she would have dreaded nothing more for her son than a residence there even if fulk had no interest in oppressing him  that eustace should return to take charge of his nephew before her death was her chief earthly wish and when she found herself rapidly sinking and the hope of its fulfilment lessening she obtained a promise from father cyril that he would conduct the boy to the abbey of glastonbury and there obtain from the abbot protection for him until his uncle should return or the machinations of fulk be defeated by an appeal to the king  this was accordingly father cyrils intention  it was unavoidable that fulk the near kinsman of the deceased should be present at the funeral but father cyril had intended to keep arthur within the sanctuary of the chapel until he could depart under the care of twelve monks of glastonbury who were coming in the stead of the abbothe being unfortunately indisposed  sir philip ashton had likewise been invited in the hope that his presence might prove a check upon clarenham     chapter ix   with the first dawn of morning the chapel bell began to toll and was replied to by the deeper sound of the bell of the parish church soon the court began to be filled with the neighbouring villagers with beggars palmers mendicant friars of all orders pressing to the butteryhatch where they received the dole of bread meat and ale from the hands of the pantler under the direction of the almoner of glastonbury who requested their prayers for the soul of the noble sir reginald lynwood and dame eleanor of clarenham his wife  the peasantry of lynwood and the beggars whose rounds brought them regularly to the keep of lynwood and who had often experienced the bounty of the departed lady replied with tears and blessings  there were not wanting the usual though incongruous accompaniments of such a scenethe jugglers and mountebanks who were playing their tricks in one corner  within the hall all was in sad sober and solemn array contrasting with the motley concourse in the court  little arthur dressed in black stood by the side of his uncle to receive the greetings of his yeoman vassals as they came in one by one with clownish courtesy but hearty respect and affection and great satisfaction at the unexpected appearance of the young knight  next came in long file mounted on their sleek mules the twelve monks of glastonbury whom the knight and his nephew reverently received at the door and conducted across the hall to the chapel where the parish priest father cyril and some of the neighbouring clergy had been chanting psalms since morning light  on the way sir eustace held some conference with the chief brother michael who had come prepared to assist in conveying arthur if possible to glastonbury but was very glad to find that the knight was able to take upon himself the charge of his nephew without embroiling the abbey with so formidable an enemy as lord de clarenham  the next arrival was sir philip ashton and his son who could hardly believe their eyes when eustace met them  leonards manner was at first cordial but presently apparently checked by some sudden recollection he drew back and stood in sheepish embarrassment fumbling with his dagger while sir philip was lavishing compliments on eustace who was rejoiced when the sound of horses made it necessary to go and meet lord de clarenham at the door  arthur looked up in sir fulks face with a look in which curiosity and defiance were expressed while fulk on his side was ready to grind his teeth with vexation at the unexpected sight of the only man who could interfere with his projects  then he glanced at his own numerous and wellappointed retinue compared them with the small number of the lynwood vassals and with another look at his adversarys youthful and gentle appearance he became reassured and returned his salutations with haughty ceremony  the whole company moved in solemn procession towards the chapel where the mass and requiem were chanted and the corpse of the lady eleanor inclosed in a stone coffin was lowered to its restingplace in the vault of her husbands ancestors  it was past noon when the banquet was spread in the hall a higher table on the dais for the retainers and yeomanry the latter of whom were armed with dagger short sword or quarterstaff  sir philip ashton and brother michael were chiefly at the expense of the conversation eustace meanwhile doing the honours with grave courtesy taking care to keep his nephew by his side  there was no one who did not feel as if on the eve of a storm but all was grave and decorous and at length brother michael and the monks of glastonbury rejoicing that they at least had escaped a turmoil took their leave mounted their mules and rode off in all correctness of civility toward the house of lynwood which as eustace could not help feeling they thus left to fight its own battles  it waxes late said lord de clarenham rising bring out the horses miles and you my young kinsman arthur you are to be my guest from henceforth  come therefore prepare for the journey  arthur held fast by the hand of his uncle who replied i thank you in my nephews name for your intended hospitality but i purpose at once to conduct him to bordeaux to be enrolled among the princes pages  conduct him to bordeaux said the knight answered sir fulk with a sneer to bordeaux forsooth  it is well for you my fair young cousin that i have other claims to you since were you once out of england i can well guess who would return to claim the lands of lynwood  what claim have you to his wardship sir fulk asked eustace coldly disdaining to take notice of the latter part of this speech  as his feudal superior and his nearest relation of full age replied clarenham  there are many here who can prove that it is twentyone years past since i was born on the feast of st eustace replied the young knight  the house of lynwood owns no master beneath the king of england and the wardship of my nephew was committed to me by both his parents  here is a witness of the truth of my words  holy father the parchment  father cyril spread a thick roll with heavy seals purporting to be the last will and testament of dame eleanor lynwood bequeathing the wardship and marriage of her son to her beloved brother sir eustace lynwood knight banneret and in his absence to the lord abbot of glastonbury and cyril langton clerk  it is nought said clarenham pushing it from him the lady of lynwood had no right to make a will in this manner since she unlawfully detained her son from me his sole guardian  the force of the will may be decided by the kings justices said eustace but my rights are not founded on it alone  my brother sir reginald with his last words committed his son to my charge  what proof do you bring sir eustace said fulk  i question not your word but something more is needed in points of law and you can scarcely expect the world to believe that sir reginald would commit his only child to the guardianship of one so young and the next heir  i am here to prove it my lord said gaston eagerly  to your care i commit him eustace said sir reginald as he lay with his head on his brothers breast and methought he also added beware of clarenham  was it not so friend leonard  leonards reply was not readily forthcoming  his father was whispering in his ear whilst he knit his brow shuffled with his feet and shrugged his shoulder disrespectfully in his fathers face  speak master ashton said clarenham in a cold incredulous tone and bending on father and son glances which were well understood to your testimony respectable and uninterested credit must be added  what mean you by that sir fulk de clarenham cried gaston for what do you take me and my word  certain tales of you and your companions sir squire answered clarenham do not dispose me to take a gascons word for more than it is worth  this passes cried gaston striking his fist on the table you venture it because you are not of my degree  here ye craven squires will not one of you take up my glove when i cast back in his teeth your masters foul slander of an honourable esquire  touch it not i command you said clarenham unless master daubricour will maintain that he never heard of a certain oneeyed basque and never rode on a freebooting foray with the robber knight perduccas dalbret  what of that fiercely cried gaston  quite enough sir squire said fulk coolly  gaston was about to break into a tempest of rage when eustaces calm voice and gesture checked him  sir fulk said eustace were you at bordeaux you would know that no mans word can be esteemed more sacred or his character more high than that of gaston daubricour  but in the meantime said clarenham we must be content to take that as well as much besides on your own assertion sir eustace once more master leonard ashton let me hear your testimony as to the dying words of sir reginald lynwood  i am content to abide by them  come leonard said his father who had been whispering with him all this time speak up you may be grieved to disappoint a oncefriendly companion but you could not help the defect of your ears  sir philip i pray you not to prompt your son said eustace stand forth leonard on your honour  did you or did you not hear the words of my brother as he lay on the bank of the zadorra  leonard half rose as if to come towards him but his father held him fast he looked down and muttered ay truly i heard sir reginald say somewhat  tell it out then  he thanked the prince for knighting youhe prayed him to have charge of his wife and childhe bade gaston not to return to evil courses said leonard bringing out his sentences at intervals  and afterwards said eustace sternlywhen the prince was gone on your honour leonard  leonard almost writhed himself beneath the eyes that eustace kept steadily fixed on him  somewhatsomewhat he might have said of knightly training for his sonbutbut what do i know he added as his father pressed hard on his foot it was all in your ear for as he lay on your breast his voice grew so faint that i could hear little through my helmet  nay master ashton said john ingram pressing forward if i remember right you had thrown off your helmet saying it was as hot as a copper cauldron and besides our good knight when he said those words touching master arthur raised himself up somewhat and spoke out louder as if that we might all hear and bear witness  no witness beyond your own train sir eustace said clarenham  none said eustace excepting one whose word even you will scarcely dare to dispute sir bertrand du guesclin  i dispute no mans word sir eustace said fulk i only say that until the claim which you allege be proved in the kings court i am the lawful guardian of the lands and person of the heir of lynwood the lord chancellor wykeham may weigh the credit to be attached to the witness of this highly respectable esquire or this longeared manatarms or may send beyond seas for the testimony of du guesclin in the meantime i assume my office  come here boy  i will not come to you lord fulk said arthur or when i do it shall be sword in hand to ask for an account for the tears you have made my sweet mother shed  bred up in the same folly said fulk  once more sir eustace will you yield him to me or must i use force  i have vowed before his mothers corpse to shield him from you returned eustace  think of the consequences sir eustace said sir philip ashton coming up to him  remember the unrepealed grant to the clarenhams the lynwood manor may be at any moment resumed to which failing your nephew you are heir  you will ruin him and yourself  it is his person not his lands that i am bound to guard said eustace  let him do his worst my nephew had better be a landless man than one such as fulk would make him  think continued sir philip of the disadvantages to your cause of provoking a fray at such a time  hold your hand and yield the boy at least till the cause come before the chancellor  never said eustace  his parents have trusted him to me and i will fulfil my promise  the scandal of the fray be on him who occasions it  recollect my lord said ashton turning to fulk that this may be misrepresented  these young warriors are hot and fiery and this young knight they say has succeeded to all his brothers favour with the prince  i will not be bearded by a boy returned clarenham thrusting him aside  hark you sir eustace  you have been raised to a height which has turned your head your eyes have been dazzled by the gilding of your spurs and you have fancied yourself a man but in your own county and your own family airs are not to be borne  we rate you at what you are worth and are not to be imposed on by idle tales which the boastful young men of the princes court frame of each other  give up these pretensions depart in peace to your fellows at bordeaux and we will forget your insolent interference  never while i live replied eustace  vassals of lynwood guard your young lord  vassals of lynwood said fulk will you see your young lord carried off to perish in some unknown region and yourselves left a prey to an adventurer and freebooter  for that matter my lord said an old farmer if all tales be true master arthur is like to learn less harm with sir eustace than in your jolly householdi for one will stand by our good lords brother to the last  what say you comrades  hurrah for the lances of lynwood shouted john ingram and the cry was taken up by many a gruff honest voice till the hall rang again and the opposing shout of a clarenham a clarenham was raised by the retainers of the baron  eustace at the same moment raised his nephew in his arms and lifted him up into the embrasure of one of the high windows  sir philip ashton still hung upon clarenham pleading in broken sentences which were lost in the uproar hold hold my lord nay nay think buthere he was thrust roughly aside by fulksir eustace do but hearit will be a matter for the councilin the name of the kingfor the love of heavenleonard son leonard for heavens sake what have you to do with the matter down with that sword and follow me  dost not hear froward boy our names will be called in question  leonard on your dutyha have a care there  these last words were broken short as gaston rushing forwards to his masters side overthrew the table which carried sir philip with it in the fall and he lay prostrate under the boards a stumblingblock to a stream of eager combatants who one after another dashed against him fell and either rose again or remained kicking and struggling with each other  after several minutes confused fighting the tumult cleared away as it were leaving the principals on each side opposite to each other and as the fortune of the day rested on their conflict all became gradually fixed in attention resting upon their weapons in readiness at any moment to renew their own portion of the combat  fulk tall and robust had far more the appearance of strength than his slenderlymade antagonist but three years in the school of chivalry had not been wasted by eustace and the sword of du guesclin was in a hand well accustomed to its use  old ralph was uttering under his breath ecstatic exclamations ha  well struck  a rare foila perfect hithave a careah there comes my old blowthat is rightold sir henrys masterstroke thereone of your new french backstrokesbut it toldoh have a carethe saints guardaytherefollow it up  hurrah for lynwood as fulk tottered slipped sank on one knee and receiving a severe blow on the head with the back of the sword measured his length on the ground  hurrah for lynwood reechoed through the hall but eustace cut short the clamour at once by saying peace my friends and thanks sir fulk de clarenham he added as his fallen foe moved and began to raise himself you have received a lesson by which i hope you will profit  leave the house whose mourning you have insulted and thank your relationship that i forbear to bring this outrage to the notice of the king  while eustace spoke fulk had by the assistance of two of his retainers recovered his feet but though unwounded he was so dizzied with the blow as to be passive in their hands and to allow himself to be led into the court and placed on his horse before riding out of the gates he turned round and clenching his fist glanced malignantly at eustace and muttered you shall aby it  another shout of down with the false clarenham  hurrah for the lances of lynwood and the brave young knight was raised in the court by the peasantry among whom fulk was so much hated that not even regard for their future welfare could prevent them from indulging in this triumph probably too they expected the satisfaction of drinking the health of the victor for there were many disappointed countenances when he spoke from the steps of the porchthanks for your goodwill my friends fare ye well depart in peace and remember your young lord  then turning to the parish priest he added in a low voice see that they leave the castle as soon as possible  the gates must be secured as soon as may be  he turned back into the hall and at the door was met by little arthur who caught hold of his hand exclaiming so you have won me and shall keep me forever uncle eustace but come in for here is poor old sir philip who was thrown down under the table in the scuffle bemoaning himself most lamentably  sir philip hurt said eustace who vexed as he was by sir philips behaviour preserved a certain neighbourly hereditary respect for him i trust not seriously and he advanced towards the armchair where sir philip ashton was sitting attended by father cyril and a manatarms and groaning and complaining of his bruises while at the same time he ordered the horses to be brought out as speedily as possible  surely said eustace you should not be in such haste sir philip i grieve that you should have met with this mishap  but you had better remain here and try what rest will do for you  remain here said sir philip almost shuddering  nay nay my young sir i would not have you to remain here nor any of us for longer space than the saddling of a horse  alas alas my young friend i grieve for you  i loved your father welllook from the window leonard  are the horses led forth  but why this haste asked sir eustace  you are heavily bruisedbest let father cyril look to your hurts  thanks sir eustace butah my backbut i would not remain under this roof for more than you could give me  i should but endanger myself without benefiting you  alas alas that i should have fallen upon such a fray  i am sorry for you my brave youth  i thank you sir philip but i know not what i have done to deserve your concern  hot blood wilful blood said sir philip shaking his head  are the horses come  here your hand leonard help me to riseah ah not so fastoh i shall never get over it  theremind you i did all to prevent this unhappy businessi am clear of it  fare you well sir eustacetake an old mans advice give up the boy and leave the country before worse comes of it  what is likely to come of it said eustace clarenham made an uncalledfor unjust shameless attempt to seize the person of my ward i repelled him by force of arms and i think he would scarce like to call the attention of justice to his own share in the matter  ah well you speak boldly but before you have reached my years you will have learnt what it is to have for your foe the most mighty man of the countynay of the court for your foe lord de clarenham is in close friendship with the earl of pembroke  beware my young friend beware  when the hall was clear of guests a council was held between the knight the priest and the two esquires  its result was that arthurs person as the most important point should be secured by his uncle carrying him at once to the princes protection at bordeaux but it was only with difficulty that eustace was prevailed on to fly as he said from his accusers  the good father had to say with a smile that after all there was as much need for patience and submission under the helm as under the cowl before eustace at length consented  cyril meanwhile was to lay the case before the chancellor william of wykeham and eustace gave him letters to the duke of lancaster and to sir richard ferrars in the hopes of their recommending his suit  eustace then received from the hands of the priest a bag of gold coins his portion as a younger son part of which he gave to be distributed in alms part he still confided to father cyrils keeping and the rest he was to take away for present needsand they parted for the last night of his brief stay at lynwood keep     chapter x   in the early morning sir eustace and his few followers were in their saddles little arthur riding between his uncle and gaston the chief part of the day was spent on the journey  they dined to arthurs glee on provisions they had brought with them seated on a green bank near a stream and at evening found themselves at the door of a large hostel its open porch covered by a vine  the host and his attendants ran out at first to meet them with alacrity but on seeing them appeared disappointed  and as the knight dismounting ordered supper and bed the host replied that he could indeed engage to find food and to accommodate their steeds but that the whole of the inn had been secured on behalf of two noble ladies and their train who were each moment expected  be it so said eustace a truss of hay beside our horses or a settle by the fire is all we need  here is a taste already of a warriors life for you arthur  the boy was delighted certain that to sleep beside his pony was far more delightful as well as more manly than to rest in his bed like a lady at home  as this was arranged a sound of horses feet approached and a band of menatarms rode up to the door  arthur started and seized his uncles hand as he recognized the clarenham colours and badge uttering an exclamation of dismay  never fear arthur said eustace they come from the way opposite to ours it is not pursuit  see it is an escortthere are ladies among them  four said arthur  uncle that tall dame in black must be the lady muriel  and surely the white veil tied with rosecolour belongs to kind cousin agnes  true  these are no clarenhams to guard against said eustace to his squire who looked ready for action  lady muriel the stepmother of the baron and his sister is my godmother and by birth a lynwood  then stepping forward he assisted the elder lady to dismount she returned his courtesy by a slight inclination as to a stranger but her companion who had lightly sprung to the ground no sooner perceived him than she exclaimed eustace then laying her hand on lady muriels arm mother it is sir eustace lynwood  ha my gallant godson said the baroness greeting him cordially well met brave youth  no wonder in that knightly figure i did not know my kinswomans little page  how does my gentle niece eleanor  alack then you have not heard the tidings said eustace  we heard long since she was sick with grief said lady muriel much alarmed  what mean you  is she worse  you weepsurely she still lives  ah honoured dame we come even now from laying her in her grave here is her orphan boy  young agnes could not restrain a cry of grief and horror and trying to repress her weeping till it should be without so many witnesses lady muriel and her bowerwoman led her to their apartments in the inn eustace was greatly affected by her grief  she had often accompanied her stepmother on visits to lynwood keep in the peaceful days of their childhood she had loved no sport better than to sit listening to his romantic discourses of chivalry and had found in the shy delicate dreamy boy something congenial to her own quiet nature and in short when eustace indulged in a vision agnes was ever the lady of it the pale slight agnes with no beauty save her large soft brown eyes that seemed to follow and take in every fancy or thought of his  agnes was looked down onher father thought she would do him little honourher brother cared not for her save for her stepmother she would have met with little fostering attention and when eustace saw her set aside and disregarded his heart had bounded with the thought that when he should lay his trophies at her feet agnes would be honoured for his sake  but eustaces honours had been barren and he could only look back with a sad heart to the fancies of his youth when he had deemed knighterrantry might win the lady of his love  eleanor had been one of the few who had known and loved the damsel of clarenham and had encouraged her to lay aside her timidity agnes wept for her as a sister and still could hardly restrain her sobs when eustace and his nephew were invited to the presence of the ladies to narrate their melancholy tale  many tears were shed and caresses lavished upon the orphan  the ladies asked his destination and on hearing that he was to be taken to the princes court at bordeaux agnes said we too are bound to the princes court  i am to journey thither with fulk were it not better for arthur to travel with us  most carefully would we guard him  it would spare him many a hardship for which he is scarce old enough and his company would be a solace almost a protection to me  my pretty playfellow will you be my travelling companion  i would go with you cousin agnes for you are kind and gentle and i love you well but a brave knights son must learn to rough it and besides i would not go with sir fulk your brother for he is a false and cruel knight who persecuted my blessed mother to the very death  can this be  o speak eustace said agnes  what means the boy hath fulk shown himself other than a loving kinsman  the baroness who understood her stepsons character better than did his young sister and who was informed of the old enmity between the two houses felt considerable anxiety as to what they were now to hear when eustace beginning ah lady i grieve twice in the day to sadden your heart yet since so much has been said it were best to relate the whole truth proceeded to tell what had passed respecting the wardship of young arthur  agness eyes filled with burning tears of indignation  o dear lady mother cried she take me back to our convent  how can i meet my brother  how conceal my anger and my shame  this is far worse than even i feared said lady muriel  i knew fulk to be unscrupulous and grasping but i did not think him capable of such foul oppression  for you my sweet agneswould that i  could prevail on him to leave you in the safe arms of the cloisterbut alas  i have no right to detain you from a brothers guardianship  i dreaded this journey much before said agnes but now even my trust in fulk is gone i shall see round me no one in whom to place confidence  alas alas  nay fair agnes said eustace he will surely be a kind brother to theehe cannot be otherwise  how love and trust when there is no esteem  oh mother mother this is loneliness indeed  in that strange courtly throng who will protect and shelter me  there is an arm began the baroness  yes noble lady there is one arm eagerly exclaimed eustace that would only deem itself too much honoured if it could be raised in your service  i spoke of no arm of flesh said lady muriel reprovinglyand eustace hung his head abashed  i spake of the guardian who will never be wanting to the orphan  there was a silence first broken by eustace  one thing there is that i would fain ask of your goodness said he many a false tale many a foul slander will be spoken of me and many may give heed to them but let that be as it will they shall not render my heart heavy while i can still believe that you give no ear to them  sir eustace said the lady of clarenham i have known you from childhood and it would go hard with me to believe aught dishonourable of the pupil of sir reginald and of eleanor  yes sir eustace added agnes it would break my heart to distrust you for then i must needs believe that faith truth and honour had left the world  and now said lady muriel who thought the conversation had been sufficiently tender to fulfil all the requirements of the connection of families and of their old companionship now agnes we must take leave of our kind kinsman since doubtless he will desire to renew his journey early tomorrow  eustace took the hint and bent his knee to kiss the hands which were extended to him by the two ladies then left the room feeling among all the clouds which darkened his path one clear bright ray to warm and gladden his heart  agnes trusted his truth agnes would be at bordeauxhe might see her and she would hear of his deeds  agnes while she wept over her kinswomans death and her brothers faults rejoiced in having met her old playfellow and found him as noble a knight as her fancy had often pictured him and in the meanwhile the good old lady muriel sighed to herself and shook her head at the thought of the sorrows which an attachment would surely cause to these two young creatures  it was early in the morning that eustace summoned his nephew from the couch which one of the clarenham retainers had yielded him and mounting their horses they renewed their journey towards the coast  without further adventure the lances of lynwood as arthur still chose to call their little party safely arrived at rennes the capital of brittany where jean de montford held his court  here they met the tidings that charles v had summoned the prince of wales to appear at his court to answer an appeal made against him to the sovereign by the vassals of the duchy of aquitaine edwards answer was that he would appear indeed but that it should be in full armour with ten thousand knights and squires at his back and the war had already been renewed  the intelligence added to eustaces desire to be at bordeaux but he could not venture through the enemys country without exposing himself to death or captivity and even within the confines of brittany itself duke john though bound by gratitude and affection to the alliance of the king who had won for him his ducal coronet was unable to control the enmity which his subjects bore to the english and assured the knight that a safeconduct from him would only occasion his being robbed and murdered in secret instead of being taken a prisoner in fair fight and put to ransom  if eustace had been alone with his staunch followers he would have trusted to their good swords and swift steeds but to place arthur in such perils would be but to justify fulks accusations and there was no alternative but to accept the offer made to him by jean de montford for the sake of his duchess a daughter of edward iii to remain a guest at his court until the arrival of a sufficient party of english knights who were sure to be attracted by the news of the war  no less than two months was he obliged to wait during which both he and gaston chafed grievously under their forced captivity but at length he learnt that a band of free companions had arrived at rennes on their way to offer their service to the prince of wales accordingly he set forth and after some interval found himself once more in the domains of the house of plantagenet  it was late in the evening when he rode through the gates of bordeaux and sought the abode of the good old gascon merchant where he had always lodged  he met with a ready welcome and inquiring into the most recent news of the town learnt that the prince was considered to be slightly improved in health but that no word was spoken of the army taking the field and the war was chiefly carried on by the siege of castles  he asked for sir john chandos and was told that high words had passed between him and the prince respecting a hearthtax and that since he had returned to his government and seldom or never appeared at the council board  it was the earl of pembroke who was allpowerful there  and here the old gascon wandered into lamentable complaints of the aforesaid hearthtax from which eustace could scarcely recall him to answer whether the english baron de clarenham had arrived at bordeaux  he had come and with as splendid a train as ever was beheld and was in high favour at court  this was no pleasing intelligence but eustace determined to go the next day to present his nephew to the prince immediately after the noontide meal when it was the wont of the plantagenet princes to throw their halls open to their subjects  accordingly leading arthur by the hand and attended by gaston he made his appearance in the hall just as the banquet was concluded but ere the knights had dispersed  many wellknown faces were there but as he advanced up the space between the two long tables he was amazed at meeting scarce one friendly glance of recognition some looked unwilling to seem to know him and returned his salutation with distant coldness others gazed at the window or were intent on their wine and of these was leonard ashton whom to his surprise he saw seated among the knights  thus he passed on until he had nearly reached the dais where dined the prince and the personages of the most exalted rank  here he paused as his anxious gaze fell upon the prince and marked his countenance and mienalas how changed  he sat in his richlycarved chair wrapped in a velvet mantle which even on that bright day of a southern spring he drew closer round him with a shuddering chilliness  his elbow rested on the arm of his chair and his wasted cheek leant on his handthe long thin fingers of which showed white and transparent as a ladys his eyes were bent on the ground and a look of suffering or of moody thought hung over the whole of that face once full of free and open cheerfulness tears filled eustaces eyes as he beheld that wreck of manhood and thought of that bright day of hope and gladness when his brother had presented him to the prince  as he hesitated to advance the prince raising his eyes encountered that earnest and sorrowful gaze but only responding by a stern glance of displeasure  eustace however stepped forward and bending one knee said my lord i come to report myself as returned to your service and at the same time to crave for my nephew the protection you were graciously pleased to promise him  it is well sir eustace lynwood said edward coldly and with a movement of his head as if to dismiss him from his presence and you boy come hither he added as arthur seeing his uncle rise and retreat a few steps was following his example  i loved your father well he said laying his hand on the boys bright wavy hair and you shall find in me a steady friend as long as you prove yourself not unworthy of the name you bear  in spite of the awe with which arthur felt his head pressed by that royal hand in spite of his reverence for the hero and the prince he raised his eyes and looked upon the face of the prince with an earnest pleading almost upbraiding gaze as if child as he was he deprecated the favour which so evidently marked the slight shown to his uncle but the prince did not heed him and rising from his chair said thine arm clarenham  let us to the princess and present her new page  follow me boy  with a wistful look at his uncle standing alone on the step of the dais arthur reluctantly followed the prince as leaning on clarenhams arm he left the hall and crossing a gallery entered a large apartment  at one end was a canopy embroidered with the arms and badges of the heir of england and beneath it were two chairs of state one of which was occupied by joan plantagenet princess of wales once the fair maid of kent and though now long past her youth still showing traces of beauty befitting the lady for whom her royal cousin had displayed such love and constancy  as her husband entered she rose and looking anxiously at him while she came forward to meet him inquired whether he felt fatigued  no my fair dame replied the prince i came but to present you your new page the young cousin respecting whose safety my lord de clarenham hath been so much in anxiety  then it is his uncle who hath brought him asked joan  yes replied edward he himself brought him to the hall and even had the presumption to claim the protection for him that i pledged to his father when i deemed far otherwise of this young eustace  what account does he give of the length of time that he has spent on the road asked the princess  ay there is the strangest part of the tale said fulk clarenham with a sneer since he left the poor simple men at lynwood believing that he was coming at full speed to seek my lord the princes protection for the child a convenient excuse for eluding the inquiries of justice into his brawls at the funeral as well as for the rents which he carried off with him but somewhat inconsistent when it is not for five months that he makes his appearance at bordeaux and then in the society of a band of routiers  it shall be inquired into said the prince  nay nay my lord said fulk may i pray you of your royal goodness to press the matter no further  he is still young and it were a pity to cast dishonour on a name which has hitherto been honourable  since my young cousin is safe i would desire no more save to guard him from his future machinations  for his brothers sake my lord i would plead with you  little did i think such things of him said the prince when i laid knighthood on his shoulder in the battlefield of navaretta yet i remember even then old chandos chid me for overhastiness poor old chandos he has a rough tongue but a true heart  and under favour i would say answered clarenham that it might have been those earlywon honours that turned the head of such a mere youth so entirely without guidance or rather with the guidance of that dissolute squire who i grieve to observe still haunts his footsteps  knighthood with nought to maintain it is in truth a snare  well i am weary of the subject said the prince leaning back in his chair  the boy is safe and as you say fulk that is all that is of importance  call hither the troubadour that was in the hall at noon i would have your opinion of his lay he added turning to his wife  the indignation may be imagined with which arthur listened to this conversation as he stood on the spot to which edward had signed to him to advance when he presented him to the princess  he longed ardently to break in with an angry refutation of the slanders cast on his uncle but he was too well trained in the rules of chivalry to say nothing of the awful respect with which he regarded the prince to attempt to utter a word and he could only edge himself as far away as was possible from clarenham and cast at him glances of angry reproach  his uneasy movements were interpreted as signs of fatigue and impatience of restraint by one of the ladies who was sitting at no great distance a very beautiful and graceful maiden the lady maude holland daughter to the princess of wales by her first marriage and she kindly held out her hand to him saying come hither my pretty page  you have not learnt to stand stiff and straight like one of the supporters of a coatofarms  come hither and let me lead you to company better suited to your years  arthur came willingly as there was no more to hear about his uncle and besides it was away from the hateful clarenham  she led him across the hall to a tall arched doorway opening upon a wide and beautiful garden filled with the plants and shrubs of the south of france and sloping gently down to the broad expanse of the blue waves of the garonne  she looked round on all sides and seeing no one made a few steps forward on the greensward then called aloud thomas no answer edward  harry of lancaster but still her clear silvery voice was unheeded until a servant came from some other part of the building and bowing awaited her orders  where are lord edward and the rest she asked  gone forth the servant believed to ride on the open space near st ursulas convent  none left at home  none noble lady  none repeated lady maude save the little lord richard whose baby company your pageship would hardly esteem  you must try to endure the quietness of the ladys chamber unless you would wish to be at once introduced to the grave master of the damoiseaux  at this moment arthurs eye fell upon a lady who had just emerged from a long shady alley up which she had been slowly walking and the bright look of recognition which lighted up his face was so different from the shy and constrained expression he had hitherto worn that lady maude remarked it and following his gaze said lady agnes de clarenham  ah yes she is of kin to you  let us go meet her  then as they approached she said here agnes i have brought you a young cousin of yours whom the prince has just conducted into my mothers chamber where he bore so rueful a countenance that i grew pitiful enough to come forth on a bootless errand after his fellow damoiseaux who it seems are all out riding so i shall even leave him to you for there is a troubadour in the hall whose lay i greatly long to hear  away tripped lady maude well pleased to be free from the burthen her goodnature had imposed on her  arthur exclaimed agnes what joy to see you  is your uncle here  yes said arthur but oh cousin agnes if you had been by to hear the foul slanders which sir fulk has been telling the princeoh agnes you would disown him for your brother  arthur said agnes with a voice almost of anguish how could hewhy did he tarry so long on the road  how could we come on when the duke of brittany himself said it was certain death or captivity  we were forced to wait for an escort and now agnes think of your brother saying that uncle eustace carried off the rents of lynwood when every man in the castle could swear it was only the money father cyril had in keeping for his inheritance  alas said agnes  and the prince will believe itthe prince looks coldly on him already and my uncle loves the prince like his own life  oh he will be ready to die with grief  agnes  agnes what is to be done  but you dont believe it he proceeded seeing that she was weeping bitterly  you do not believe ityou promised you never would  oh say you do not believe it  i do not arthur i never believed half they said of him but oh that long delay was a sore trial to my confidence and cruelly confirmed their tales  and think of fulk too hindering the prince from inquiring because he says he would spare my uncle for my fathers sake when the truth is he only fears that the blackness of his own designs should be seen and gaston too he slandered  oh agnes agnes that there should be such wickedness and we able to do nought  nought but weep and pray said agnes  and yet i can bear it better now that you are here  your presence refutes the worst accusation and removes a heavy weight from my mind  you distrust him too  i cannot love you if you do  never never  i only feared some evil had befallen you and grieved to see the use made of your absence  your coming should make my heart light again  shall i often see you cousin agnes for there is none else in this wide castle that i shall care for  oh yes arthur there are full twenty pages little older than yourselflord thomas holland the princes stepson brother to the lady that led you to me little piers de greilly nephew to the captal de buch young lord henry of lancaster and the little prince edward himself  you will have no lack of merry playmates  ah but to whom can i talk of my blessed mother and of uncle eustace and of lynwood keep and poor old blanc etoile that i promised ralph i would bear in mind  well arthur said agnes cheerfully it is the pages duty to wait on the ladies in hall and bower and the ladies office to teach them all courtly manners and hear them read and say the credo and ave you shall be my own especial page and servant  is it agreed  oh yes said the boy  i wonder if the master of the damoiseaux is as strict as that lady said and i wonder when i shall see uncle eustace again     chapter xi   if arthur lynwood felt desolate when he left his uncles side it was not otherwise with sir eustace as he lost sight of the child who had so long been his charge and who repaid his anxiety with such confiding affection  the coveted fame favour and distinction seemed likewise to have deserted him  the princes coldness hung heavily on him and as he cast his eyes along the ranks of familiar faces not one friendly look cheered him  his greetings were returned with coldness and a grave haughty courtesy was the sole welcome chafed and mortified he made a sign to gaston and they were soon in the street once more  coward clown burst forth gaston at once  would that i could send all his grinning teeth down the false throat of him  whose  what mean you  whose but that sulky recreant ashton  he has done well to obtain knighthood or i would beat him within an inch of his life with my halbert and if he dared challenge me slay him as i would a carrion crown  he a knight  thanks to his acres and to lord pembroke  patience patience gastoni have not yet heard of what he accuses me  no he has learnt policyhe saith it not openly  he would deny it as did his esquire when i taxed him with it  would that you could not tell a letter  sir eustace of your favour let me burn every one of your vile books  my innocent friends  nay nay gastonthey are too knightly to merit such measure  then it is the old accusation of witchcraft i suppose so i was in league with the castilian witch and her cats was i  ay and her broomstick or her cats wafted you to lynwood where you suddenly stood in the midst of the mourners borne into the hall on a howling blast  how i got there i am sorry to say the craven declared not lest i should give him the lie at once  but surely such a tale is too absurd and vulgar to deceive our noble prince  oh there is another version for his ears  this is only for the lower sort who might not have thought the worse of you for kidnapping your nephew vowing his mother should remain unburied till he was in your hands and carrying off all his rents  that is clarenhams slander  yes  and credited by the prince  oh little did i think the hand which laid knighthood on my shoulder should repent the boon that it gave exclaimed eustace with a burst of sorrow rather than anger  do you not challenge the traitor at once  i trow not unless he speaks the charge to my face  father cyril declared that any outbreak on my part would damage our cause in the eyes of the chancellor we must bide our time  since arthur is safe i will bear my own burden  i am guiltless in this matter and i trust that the blessing of heaven on my deeds shall restore a name obscured but not tarnished  the resolution to forbear was tested for time passed on without vindicating him  with such art had the toils of his enemies been spread that no opening was left him for demanding an explanation the calumnies could only be brought home to the lowest retainers of clarenham and ashton and the only result of the zealous refutation by the followers of sir eustace was a brawl between john ingram and a yeoman of clarenhams ending in their spending a week in the custody of the provost marshal  had there been any tournament or like sport at bordeaux eustace could have asserted his place and challenged the attention of the court but the state of the princes health prevented such spectacles nor had he any opportunity of acquiring honour by his deeds in arms  no army took the field on either side and the war was chiefly carried on by expeditions for the siege or relief of frontier castles and here his unusual rank as knight banneret stood in his way since it was contrary to etiquette for him to put himself under the command of a knight bachelor  he was condemned therefore to a weary life of inaction the more galling because his poverty made it necessary to seek maintenance as formerly at the princes table where he was daily reminded by the altered demeanour of his acquaintance of the unjust suspicions beneath which he laboured  he had hoped that a dismissal from his post in the princes band would give him the muchdesired opportunity of claiming a hearing but he was permitted to receive his pay and allowance as usual and seemed completely overlooked  it was well that gastons gay temper could not easily be saddened by their circumstances and his high spirits and constant attachment often cheered his knight in their lonely evenings  eustace had more than once striven to persuade him to forsake his failing fortunes but to this the faithful squire would never consent vowing that he was as deeply implicated in all their accusations as sir eustace himself and who would wish to engage a fellowservant of the black cats  there were two others whom eustace would fain believe still confided in his truth and honour his nephew arthur and lady agnes de clarenham but he never saw them and often his heart sank at the thought of the impression that the universal belief might make on the minds of both  and to add to his depression a rumour prevailed throughout bordeaux that the baron of clarenham had promised his sisters hand to sir leonard ashton  nearly a year had passed since eustace had left england and his situation continued unchanged  perhaps the prince regarded him with additional displeasure since news had arrived that sir richard ferrars had made application to the duke of lancaster to interest the king in the cause of the guardianship for there was at this time a strong jealousy in the mind of the prince of the mighty power and influence of john of gaunt which he already feared might be used to the disadvantage of his young sons  the cause was at length decided and a letter from good father cyril conveyed to eustace the intelligence that the chancellor william of wykeham bishop of winchester having given due weight to sir reginalds dying words and lady lynwoods testament had pronounced sir eustace lynwood the sole guardian of the person and estate of his nephew and authorized all the arrangements he had made on his departure  affairs altogether began to wear a brighter aspect  the first indignation against sir eustace had subsided and he was treated in general with indifference rather than marked scorn  the gallant old chandos was again on better terms with the prince and coming to bordeaux made two or three expeditions in which eustace volunteered to join and gained some favourable though slight notice from the old knight  fulk clarenham too having received from the prince the government of perigord was seldom at court and no active enemy appeared to be at work against him  agnes de clarenham always retiring and pensive and seldom sought out by those who admired gayer damsels was sitting apart in the embrasure of a window whence through an opening in the trees of the garden she could catch a distant glimpse of the blue waters of the river where it joined the sea which separated her from her native land and from her who had ever been as a mother to her  she was so lost in thought that she scarce heard a step approaching till the unwelcome sound of fair greeting to you lady agnes caused her to look up and behold the still more unwelcome form of sir leonard ashton  to escape from him was the first idea for his clownish manners always unpleasant to her had become doubly so since he had presumed upon her brothers favour to offer to her addresses from which she saw no escape and with a brief reply of thanks for your courtesy sir knight she was about to rise and mingle with the rest of the party when he proceeded bluntly lady agnes will you do me a favour  i know of no favour in my power said she  nay he said it is easily done and it is as much to your brother as to myself  it is a letter which methinks fulk would not have read out of the family of which i may call myself one and he gave a sort of smirk at agnesbut he writes so crabbedly that i for one cannot read two linesand i would not willingly give it to a clerk who might be less secret  so methought as twas the barons affair i would even bring it here and profit by your conventbreeding lady agnes  agnes took the letter and began to read     for the hand of the right noble and worshipful knight sir   leonard ashton at the court of my lord the prince of wales   these    fair sir and brotherinarmsi hereby do you to wit that the   affair whereof we spoke goes well  both my lord of pembroke   and sir john chandos readily undertook to move the prince to   grant the banneret you wot of the government of the castle and   as he hath never forgotten the love he once bore to his brother   he will the more easily be persuaded  of the garrison we are   sure and all that is now needful is that the oneeyed squire   whereof you spoke to me should receive warning before he   arrives at the castle    tell him to choose his time and manage matters so that there   may be no putting to ransom  he will understand my meaning               greeting you well therefore                          fulk baron of clarenham   what means this exclaimed agnes as a tissue of treachery opened before her eyes  ay that you may say said leonard his slow brain only fixed upon fulks involved sentences and utterly unconscious of the horror expressed in her tone  how is a man to understand what he would have me to do  send to le borgne basque at chateau norbelle  is that it read it to me once again lady for the love of the saints what am i to tell le borgne basque  no putting to ransom doth he say  he might be secure enough for that mattereustace lynwood is little like to ransom himself  but what mean you said agnes eagerly hoping that she had done her brother injustice in her first horrible thought  sir eustace lynwood if you spake of him is no prisoner but is here at bordeaux  he shall not long be so said leonard  heard you not this very noon that the prince bestows on him the government of chateau norbelle on the marches of gascony  well that is the matter treated of in this letter  let me see let me see how was it to be  yes that is it it is le borgne basque who is seneschal  ay true that i knowand twas he who was to admit clissons men  admit clissons men  aytis one of those castles built by the old paladin renaud de montauban that eustace used to talk about  i ween he did not know of this trick that will be played on himselfand all of them have they say certain secret passages leading through the vaults into the castle  le borgne basque knows them all for he has served much in those parts and fulk placed him as seneschal for the very purpose  for the purpose of admitting clissons men  do i understand you right sir knight or do my ears play me false  yes i speak right  do you not see lady agnes it is the only way to free your house of this stumblingblockthis beggarly upstart eustacewho as long as he lives will never acknowledge fulks rights and would bring up his nephew to the same pride  and is it possible sir leonard that brother of mine and belted knight should devise so foul a scheme of treachery  oh unsay it again  let me believe it was my own folly that conjured up so monstrous a thought  ay that is the way with women said leonard they never look at the sense of the matter  why this eustace what terms should be kept with him who has dealings with the evil one and  i will neither hear a noble knight maligned nor suffer him to be betrayed interrupted agnes  i have listened to you too long sir leonard ashton and will stain my ears no longer  i thank you however for having given me such warning as to enable me to traverse them  what will you do asked leonard with a look of impotent anger  appeal instantly to the prince  tell him the use that is made of his castles and the falsehoods told him of his most truehearted knight and agnes with glancing eyes was already rising for the purpose forgetting in her eager indignation all that must follow when leonard muttering what madness possessed me to tell her stood full before her saying gloomily do so lady if you choose to ruin your brother  the timid girl stood appalled as the horrible consequences of such an accusation arose before her  that same day eustace was summoned to the princes presence  sir eustace lynwood said edward gravely i hear you have served the king well beneath the banner of sir john chandos  your friends have wrought with me to give you occasion to prove yourself worthy of your spurs and i have determined to confer on you the government of my chateau of norbelle on the frontier of gascony trusting to find you a true and faithful governor and castellane  i trust my lord that you have never had occasion to deem less honourably of me said eustace and his clear open eye and brow courted rather than shunned the keen look of scrutiny that the prince fixed upon him  his heart leapt at the hope that the time for inquiry was come but the prince in another moment sank his eyes again with more however of the weary impatience of illness than of actual displeasure and merely replied kneel down then sir knight and take the oaths of fidelity  eustace obeyed hardly able to suppress a sigh at the disappointment of his hopes  you will receive the necessary orders and supplies from sir john chandos and from the treasurer said edward in a tone that intimated the conclusion of the conference and eustace quitted his presence scarce knowing whether to be rejoiced or dissatisfied  the former gaston certainly was  i have often been heartily weary of garrison duty said he but never can i be more weary of aught than of being looked upon askance by half the men i meet  and we may sometimes hear the lark sing too as well as the mouse squeak sir eustace  i know every pass of my native county and the herds of languedoc shall pay toll to us  sir john chandos as constable of aquitaine gave him the requisite orders and information  the fortifications he said were in good condition and the garrison already numerous but a sum of money was allotted to him in order to increase their numbers as much as he should deem advisable since it was not improbable that he might have to sustain a siege as oliver de clisson was threatening that part of the frontier  four days were allowed for his preparations after which he was to depart for his government  eustace was well pleased with all that he heard and returned to his lodging where in the evening twilight he was deeply engaged in consultation with gaston on the number of followers to be raised when a light step was heard hastily approaching and arthur darting into the room flung himself on his neck exclaiming uncle uncle go not to this castle  arthur what brings you here  what means this  no foolish frolic no escape from punishment i trust said eustace holding him at some little distance and fixing his eyes on him intently  no uncle no  on the word of a true knights son said the boy stammering in his eagerness believe me trust me dear uncleand go not to this fearful castle  it is a trapa snare laid to be your death by the foulest treachery  silence arthur said the knight sternly  know you not what treason you speak  some trick has been played on your simplicity and yet youchild as you areshould as soon think shame of your own father as of the prince the very soul of honour  oh it is not the prince he knows nought of it it is those double traitors the baron of clarenham and sir leonard ashton who have worked upon him and deceived him  oh ho said gaston  the story now begins to wear some semblance of probability  arthur turned looking perplexed  master daubricour said he i forgot that you were here  this is a secret which should have been for my uncles ears alone  is it so said gaston then i will leave the room if it please you and the knightthough methought i was scarce small enough to be so easily overlooked and having heard the half  you had best hear the whole said arthur  uncle eustace what think you  i know not what to think arthur  you must be your own judge  arthurs young brow wore a look of deep thought at last he said do not go then gaston  if i have done wrong i must bear the blame and be it as it may my uncle needs must tell you all that i may tell him  let us hear then said eustace  well then said arthur who had by this time collected himself you must know that this chateau norbelle is one of those built by that famous paladin the chief of freebooters sir renaud de montauban of whom you have told me so many tales  now all of these have secret passages in the vaults communicating with the outer country  the boy is right said gaston i have seen one of them in the castle of montauban itself  then it seems proceeded arthur that this castle hath hitherto been in the keeping of a certain oneeyed seneschal a great friend and comrade of sir leonard ashton  le borgne basque exclaimed both knight and squire looking at each other in amaze  true true said arthur  now you believe me  well the enemy being in the neighbourhood it was thought right to increase the garrison and place it under the command of a knight and these cowardly traitors have wrought with my lord of pembroke and sir john chandos to induce the prince to give you this postit being their intention that this wicked seneschal and his equally wicked garrison should admit sir oliver de clisson the butcher of bretagne himself through the secret passage  and uncle said the boy pressing eustaces hand while tears of indignation sprang to his eyes the letter expressly said there was to be no putting to ransom  oh uncle eustace go not to this castle  and how came you by this knowledge asked the knight  that i may never tell said arthur  by no means which might not beseem the son of a brave man said eustace  mistrust me not so foully said the boy  i know it from a sure hand and there is not dishonour save on the part of those villain traitors  oh promise me fair uncle not to put yourself in their hands  arthur i have taken the oaths to the prince as castellane  i cannot go back from my duty nor give up its defence for any cause whatsoever  alas alas  there would be only one way of avoiding it said eustace and you must yourself say arthur whether that is open to me  to go to the prince and tell him openly what use is made of his castles and impeach the villains of their treachery  that cannot be said arthur shaking his head sadlyit is contrary to the pledge i gave for you and for myself  but go not go not uncle  remember uncle if you will not take thought for yourself that you are all that is left meall that stands between me and that wicked clarenhamgaston persuade him  gaston would never persuade me to disgrace my spurs for the sake of danger replied eustace  have you no better learnt the laws of chivalry in the princes household arthur  besides remember old ralphs proverb forewarned is forearmed  think you not that gaston and honest ingram and i may not be a match for a dozen cowardly traitors  besides which see here the gold allotted me to raise more men with which i will obtain some honest hearts for my defenceand it will go hard with me if i cannot find sir renauds secret door  then if you will go uncle take take me with youi could at least watch the door and i know how to hit a mark with a crossbow as well as lord harry of lancaster himself  take you master arthur  what steal away the princes page that i have been at such pains to bring hither and carry him to a nest of traitors  why it would be the very way to justify clarenhams own falsehoods  and of the blackest are they said arthur  think uncle of my standing by to hear him breathing his poison to the prince and the preventing him from searching to find out the truth by pretending a regard for my fathers name and your character  oh that our noble prince should be deluded by such a recreant and think scorn of such a knight as you  i trust yet to prove to him that it is a delusion said eustace many a knight at twentytwo has yet to make his name and fame mine thanks to du guesclin and the prince himself is already made and though clouded for a time with the grace of our lady and of st eustace i will yet clear it so arthur be not downcast for me but think what father cyril hath taught concerning evil report and good report  but tell me how came you hither  shethat is the person that warned melet me down from the window upon the head of the great gurgoyle and from thence i scrambled down by the vines on the wall ran through the court without being seen by the squires and grooms and found my way to the bridge where happily i met john ingram who brought me hither  she repeated gaston with a sly look in his black eyes  i have said too much said arthur colouring deeply i pray you to forget  forget proceeded the squire that is sooner said than done  we shall rack our brains to guess what lady can  hush gaston said eustace as his nephew looked at him imploringly tempt not the boy  and you arthur must return to the palace immediately  oh uncle said the boy may i not stay with you this one night it is eight weary months since i have ever seen you save by peering down through the tall balusters of the princesss balcony when the knights were going to dinner in the hall and i hoped you would keep me with you at least one night  see how late and dark it isthe castle gates will be closed by this time  it does indeed rejoice my heart to have you beside me fair nephew said eustace and yet i know not how to favour such an escape as this even for such a cause  i never broke out of bounds before said arthur and never will though lord harry and lord thomas holland have more than once asked me to join them  then said the knight since it is as you say too late to rouse the palace i will take you back in my hand tomorrow morn see the master of the damoiseaux and pray him to excuse you for coming to see me ere my departure  yes that will be all well said arthur i could to be sure find the corner where lord harry has loosened the stones and get in by the pages window ere old master michael is awake in the morn but i think such doings are more like those of a fox than of a brave boy and though i should be well punished i will walk in at the door and hold up my head boldly  shall you be punished then said gaston  is your old master of the damoiseaux very severe  he has not been so hitherto with me said arthur he scolds me for little save what you too are displeased with master daubricour because i cannot bring my mouth to speak your language in your own fashion  it is lord harry that chiefly falls under his displeasure but punished now i shall assuredly be unless uncle eustace can work wonders  i will see what may be done arthur said eustace  and now have you supped  the evening passed off very happily to the little page who quite reassured by his uncles consolations only thought of the delight of being with one who seemed to supply to him the place at once of an elder brother and of a father  early the next morning eustace walked with him to the palace  just before he reached it he made this inquiry arthur do you often see the lady agnes de clarenham  oh yes i am with her almost every afternoon  she hears me read she helps me with my french words and teaches me courtly manners i am her own page and servantbut here we are  this is the door that leads to the room of master michael de sancy the master of the damoiseaux     chapter xii   the next few days were spent in taking precautions against the danger intimated by the mysterious message  gaston gathered together a few of the ancient lances of lynwood who were glad to enlist under the blue crosslet and these with some menatarms who had recently come to bordeaux to seek employment formed a body with whom eustace trusted to be able to keep the disaffected in check  through vineyards and over gently swelling hills did their course lead them till on the evening of the second days journey the view to the south was shut in by more lofty and bolder peaks rising gradually towards the pyrenees and on the summit of a rock overhanging a small rapid stream appeared the tall and massive towers of a castle surmounted by the broad red cross of st george and which their guide pronounced to be the chateau norbelle  a noble eyrie said eustace looking up and measuring it with his eye  too noble to be sacrificed to the snaring of one poor knight  shame that such a knightly building should serve for such a nest of traitors said gaston  saving treachery a dozen boys could keep it against a royal host provided they had half the spirit of your little nephew  let us summon the said traitors said eustace blowing a blast on his bugle  the gates were thrown wide open the drawbridge lowered and beneath the portcullis stood the seneschal his bunch of keys at his girdle  both eustace and gaston cast searching glances upon him and his aspect made them for a moment doubt the truth of the warning a patch covered the lost eye his moustache was shaved his hair appeared many shades lighter as well as his beard which had been carefully trimmed and altogether the obsequious seneschal presented a strong contrast to the dissolute reckless manatarms  the knight debated with himself whether to let him perceive that he was recognized and deciding to watch his conduct he asked by what name to address him  thibault sanchez replied le borgne basque giving his real name which he might safely do as it was not known to above two men in the whole duchy of aquitaine  thibault sanchez so please you noble sir a poor squire from the mountains who hath seen some few battles and combats in his day but never one equal to the fight of najara where your deeds of prowess  my deeds of prowess sir seneschal had better rest in silence until our horses have been disposed of and i have made the rounds of the castle before the light fails us  so late sir knight and after a long and weary journey  surely you will drink a cup of wine and take a nights rest first relying on me who though i be a plain man trust i understand somewhat of the duties of mine office  i sleep not until i have learnt what is committed to my charge replied the knight  lead the way master sanchez  ah there is what it is to have a knight of fame cried le borgne basque  what vigilance what earnestness  ah this will be as i told my comrades even now the very school of chivalry the pride of the country  they had by this time crossed the narrow court and passing beneath a second portcullised door defended on either side by high battlement walls nearly double as thick as the steps themselves were wide  at the head was an arched door heavily studded with nails and opening into the castle hall a gloomy vaulted room its loophole windows in their mighty depth of wall affording little light  a large wood fire was burning in the hearth and its flame cast a bright red light on some suits of armour that were hung at one end of the hall as well as on some benches and a long table in the midst where were placed some trenchers drinking horns and a flask or two of wine  a drop of wine noble knight said the seneschal  take a cup to recruit you after your journey and wash the dust from your throat  a long ride in full armour beneath the sun of gascony made this no unacceptable proposal but the probability that the wine might be drugged had been contemplated by eustace who had not only resolved to abstain himself but had exacted the same promise from daubricour sorely against his will  we will spare your flasks till a time of need said eustace only accepting the basin of fair water presented to him to lave his hands and now to the walls he added after he had filled a cup with water from the pitcher and refreshed himself with it  gaston followed his example not without a wistful look at the wine and sanchez was obliged to lead the way up a long flight of spiral steps to two other vaulted apartments one over the otherthe lower destined for the sleeping chamber of the knight and his squire the higher for such of the menatarms as could not find accommodation in the hall or in the offices below  above this they came out on the leadcovered roof surrounded with a high crenellated stone parapet where two or three warders were stationed  still higher rose one small octagonal watchtower on the summit of which was planted a spear bearing st georges pennon and by its side sir eustace now placed his own  this done eustace could not help standing for a few moments to look forth upon the glorious expanse of country beneath himthe rich fields and fair vineyards spreading far away to the west and north with towns and villages here and there rising among them while far away to the east among higher hills lay the french town of carcassonne a white mass just discernible by the light of the setting sun and the south was bounded by the peaks of the pyrenees amongst which lay all eustaces brightest recollections of novelty adventure and hopes of glory  descending the stairs once more after traversing the hall they found themselves in the kitchen where a large supper was preparing here too was the buttery some other small chambers fit for storehouses and some stalls for horses all protected by the great bartizan at the foot of the stairs which was capable of being defended even after the outer court was won  by the time the newcomers had made themselves acquainted with these localities the evening was fast closing in and sanchez pronounced that the knights survey was concluded in good time for supper  i have not yet seen the vaults said eustace  the vaults sir knight what would you see there save a few rusted chains and some whitened bones that have been there ever since the days of the count de montfort and the heretic albigenses  they say that their accursed spirits haunt the place  i have heard returned sir eustace that these castles of gascony are said to have secret passages communicating with their vaults and i would willingly satisfy my own eyes that we are exposed to no such peril here  nay not a man in the castle will enter those vaults after sunset sir knight  the albigenses sir eustace  i will take the risk alone said eustace  hand me a torch there  gaston took another and thibault sanchez seeing them so resolute chose to be of the party  the torches shed their red glare over the stone arches on which the castle rested and there was a chill damp air and earthy smell which made both knight and squire shudder and start no sooner had they entered than thibault trembling exclaimed in a tone of horror there there  o blessed lady protect us  where asked eustace scarce able to defend himself from an impression of terror  tis goneyet methought i saw it againthere look yonder sir knightsomething white fluttering behind that column  gaston crossed himself and turned pale but eustace had settled his nerves  a truce with these vain follies master seneschal said he sternly  those who know le borgne basque cannot believe his fears either of saints or demons to be other than assumed  no ghost could have startled the seneschal of the chateau norbelle as much as this sobriquet  he fell back and subsided into complete silence as he meditated whether it were best to confess the plot and throw himself upon sir eustaces mercy or whether he could hope that this was merely a chance recognition  he inclined to the latter belief when he observed that the knight was at fault respecting the secret passage searching in vain through every part of the vault and twice passing over the very spot  the third time however it so chanced that his spur rung against something of metal and he called for gaston to hold his torch lower  the light fell not only upon an iron ring but upon a guard which evidently covered a keyhole  sanchez after in vain professing great amazement and perfect ignorance of any such entrance gave up his bunch of keys protesting that there was nothing there which could unlock the mysterious door but the knight had another method  look you master sanchez said he it may be as you say that this door hath not been unclosed for hundreds of years notwithstanding i see traces in the dust as if it had been raised of late  i shall however sleep more securely if convinced that it is an impossibility to lift it  go therefore gaston and call half a dozen of the men to bring each of them the heaviest stone they can find from that heap i saw prepared for a mangonel in the courtyard  oh excellent exclaimed gaston and yet sir eustace  there he stopped but it was evident that he was reluctant to leave his master alone with this villain  eustace replied by drawing his good sword and giving him a fearless smile as he planted his foot upon the trapdoor and fixing his gaze upon le borgne basque made him feel that this was no moment for treachery  gaston sped fast out of the dungeon and in brief space made his appearance at the head of the menatarms some bearing torches others labouring under the weight of the huge stones which as he rightly thought they were far more inclined to heave at sir eustaces head than to place in the spot he pointed out  they were however compelled to obey and with unwilling hands built up such a pile upon the secret door that it could not be lifted from beneath without gigantic strength and a noise which would reecho through the castle this done sir eustace watched them all out of the vault himself closed the door locked it and announced to the seneschal his intention of relieving him for the future from the care of the keys still watching him closely he ascended to the hall and gave the signal for the supper which shortly made its appearance  thibault sanchez who laid claim to some share of gentle blood was permitted to enjoy the place of honour together with sir eustace and daubricourthe rather that it gave them a better opportunity of keeping their eye upon him  there was an evident attempt on the part of the garrison to engage their new comrades in a carouse in honour of their arrival but this was brought to an abrupt conclusion by sir eustace who in a tone which admitted no reply ordered the wine flasks to the buttery and the men some to their posts and others to their beds  ingram walked off muttering his discontent and great was the illwill excited amongst not only the original garrison but the newcomers from bordeaux who from their lairs of straw lamented the day when they took service with so severe and rigid a knight and compared his discipline with that of his brother sir reginald who strict as he might be never grudged a poor manatarms a little merriment but as to this knight one might as well serve a cistercian monk  as to le borgne basque he betook himself to the buttery and there in an undertone of great terror began to mutter to his friend and ally tristan de la fleche it is all over with us  he is a wizard sir leonard ashton was rightoaf as he was i never believed him before but what save enchantment could have enabled him to recognize me under this disguise or how could he have gone straight to yonder door  think you not that he had some warning asked tristan  impossible save from clarenham or from ashton himself and dolt as he is i trow he has sense enough to keep his own counsel  he has not forgotten the day when he saw this dainty young sprig rise up in his golden spurs before his eyes  i know how it is  it is with him as it was with the lord of corasse  how was that thibault  why you must know that raymond de corasse had helped himself to the tithes of a certain church in catalonia whereby the priest who claimed them said to him know that i will send thee a champion that thou wilt be more afraid of than thou hast hitherto been of me  three months after each night in the castle of corasse began such turmoil as never was known raps at every door and especially that of the knightas if all the goblins in fairyland had been let loose  the knight lay silent all one night but the next when the rioting was renewed as loud as ever he leapt out of his bed and bawled out who is it at this hour thus knocks at my chamber door  he was answered it is i  and who sends thee hither asked the knight  the clerk of catalonia whom thou hast much wronged  i will never leave thee quiet until thou hast rendered him a just account  what art thou called said the knight who art so good a messenger  orthon is my name  but it fell out otherwise from the clerks intentions for orthon had taken a liking to the knight and promised to serve him rather than the clerkengaging never to disturb the castlefor indeed he had no power to do ill to any  often did he come to the knights bed by night and pull the pillow from under his head  what was he like asked tristan  the lord de corasse could not tell he only heard himhe never saw aught for orthon only came by night and having wakened him would begin by saying he was come from england hungary or elsewhere and telling all the news of the place  and what think you was he  that was what our lord the count de foix would fain have known when he had much marveled at the tidings that were brought him by the lord de corasse and had heard of the strange messenger who brought them he entreated the knight to desire orthon to show himself in his own proper formand then having seen to describe him  so at night when orthon came again and plucked away the pillow the knight asked him from whence he came  from prague in bohemia answered orthon  how far is itsixty days journey  hast thou returned thence in so short a timei travel as fast as the wind or faster  what hast thou got wingsoh no  how then canst thou fly so fastthat is no business of yours no said the knighti should like exceedingly to see what form thou hastthat concerns you not replied orthon be satisfied that you hear me  i should love thee better had i seen thee said the knightwhereupon orthon promised that the first thing he should see tomorrow on quitting his bed should be no other than himself  ha then i wager that he saw one of the black cats that played round young ashtons bed  nay the knights lady would not rise all day lest she should see orthon but the knight leaping up in the morning looked about but could see nothing unusual  at night when orthon came he reproached him for not having shown himself as he had promised i have replied orthon  i say no said the knight  what you saw nothing when you leapt out of bedyes said the lord de corasse after having considered awhile i saw two straws which were turning and playing together on the floor  that was myself said orthon  the knight now desired importunately that orthon would show himself in his own true shape  orthon told him that it might lead to his being forced to quit his servicebut he persisted and orthon promised to show himself when first the knight should leave his chamber in the morning  therefore as soon as he was dressed the knight went to a window overlooking the court and there he beheld nothing but a large lean sow so poor that she seemed nothing but skin and bone with long hanging ears all spotted and a thin sharppointed snout  the lord de corasse called to his servants to set the dogs on the illfavoured creature and kill it but as the kennel was opened the sow vanished away and was never seen afterwards  then the lord de corasse returned pensive to his chamber fearing that the sow had indeed been orthonand truly orthon never returned more to his bedside  within a year the knight was dead  is it true think you sanchez  true why man i have seen the chateau de corasse seven leagues from orthes  and what think you was orthon  it is not for me to say but you see there are some who stand fair in mens eyes who have strange means of gaining intelligence it will be a merit to weigh down a score of rifled priests if we can but circumvent a wizard such as this  but he has brought his books  i saw that broadfaced englishman carry up a whole pile of them cried tristan turning pale  with his books he will be enough to conjure us all into apes  now or never said sanchez encouragingly  when all is still i will go round and waken our comrades while you creep forth by the hole beneath the bartizan and warn clisson that the secret passage is nought but that when he sees a light in old montforts turret  tristan suddenly trod on his foot as a sign of silence as a step descended the stairs and sir eustace stood before them  you appear to be agreeably employed gentlemen said he glancing at the stoup of wine which was before them but my orders are as precise as norman williams  no lights in this castle save my own after eight oclock  to your beds gentlemen and a good night to you  he was still fully armed so that it was unsafe to attack him  and he saw them up the spiral stairs that led from the hall and watched them enter the narrow dens that served them as sleeping rooms where many a curse was uttered on the watchfulness of the wizard knight  at the turn of midnight le borgne basque crept forth in some hope that there might be an opportunity of fulfilling his designs and earning the reward promised him both by clarenham and the french  but he had not descended far before a red gleam of torchlight was seen on the dark stairs and ere he could retreat the black head and dark eyes of gaston appeared glancing with mischievous amusement as he said in his gay voice you are on the alert my old comrade  you have not forgotten your former habits when in command here  but sir eustace intrusts the care of changing the guard to none but me so i will not trouble you to disturb yourself another night  and the baffled miscreant retreated  in this manner passed day after day in a tacit yet perpetual war between the knight and the garrison  not a step could be taken scarce a word spoken without some instant reminder that either sir eustace or gaston was on the watch  on the borders of the enemys country there was so much reason for vigilance that the garrison could not reasonably complain of the services required of them the perpetual watch and numerous guards the occupations which knight and squire seemed never weary of devising for the purpose of keeping them separate and their instant prohibition of any attempt at the riotous festivity which was their only consolation for the want of active exercises  they grew heartily weary and fiercely impatient of restraint and though the firm calm steady strictness of the knight was far preferable to the rude familiarity and furious passions of many a castellane there were many of the menatarms who though not actually engaged in the conspiracy were impatient of what they called his haughtiness and rigidity  these men were mercenaries from different parts of france accustomed to a lawless life and caring little or nothing whatever whether it were beneath the standard of king charles or king edward that they acquired pay and plunder  the englishmen were of course devoted to their king and prince and though at times unruly were completely to be depended upon  yet while owning sir eustace to be a brave gallant and kindhearted knight there were times when even they felt a shudder of dread and almost of hatred pass over them when tales were told of the supernatural powers he was supposed to possess when leonard ashtons adventure with the cats was narrated or the story of his sudden arrival at lynwood keep on the night before the ladys funeral  his own immediate attendants might repel the charge with honest indignation but many a stout warrior slunk off in terror to bed from the sight of sir eustace turning the pages of one of his heavy books by the light of the hall fire and saw in each poor bat that flitted about within the damp depths of the vaulted chambers the familiar spirit which brought him exact intelligence of all that passed at bordeaux at paris or in london  nay if he only turned his eyes on the ground he was thought to be looking for the twisting straws     chapter xiii   there was a village at some distance from the chateau norbelle the inhabitants of which were required to furnish it with provisions the castellane by paying just prices and preventing his men from treating the peasants in the cruel and exacting manner to which they were accustomed had gained their goodwill  prompt intelligence of the proceedings of the french army was always brought to him and he was thus informed that a large treasure was on its way from bayonne to carcasonne being the subsidy promised by enrique king of castile to his allies bertrand du guesclin and oliver de clisson  it became the duty of the english to intercept these supplies and eustace knew that he should incur censure should he allow the occasion to pass  but how divide his garrison  which of the menatarms could be relied on  after consultation with daubricour it was determined that he himself should remain with john ingram and a sufficient number of english to keep the traitors in check while gaston went forth in command of the party who were certain to fight with a good will where spoil was the object  they would be absent at least two nights since the pass of the pyrenees where they intended to lie in ambush was at a considerable distance nor was the time of the arrival of the convoy absolutely certain  the expedition proved completely successful and on the morning of the third day the rising sun beheld gaston daubricour riding triumphantly at the head of his little band in the midst of which was a long line of heavilyladen baggage mules  the towers of chateau norbelle appeared in his view when suddenly with a cry of amazement he perceived that the pennon of st george and the banner of lynwood were both absent from the keep  he could scarcely believe his eyes but forcing his horse onward with furious impetuosity to obtain a nearer view he discovered that it was indeed true  the miscreants he shouted  oh my knight my knight and turning to the men who followed him he exclaimed there is yet hope  will you see our trust betrayed our noble knight foully murdered and delivered to his enemies or will ye strike a bold stroke in his defence  he who is not dead to honour follow me  there was a postern of which eustace had given gaston the key on his departure and thither the faithful squire hastened without looking back to see whether he was followed by many or fewin fact rather ready to die with sir eustace than hoping to rescue him  the ten englishmen and some eight frenchmen infected by the desperation of his manner followed him closely as he rushed up the slope dashed through the moat and in another moment opening the door burst into the court  there stood a party of the garrison upon whom he rushed with a shout of death death to the traitor  gastons arm did the work of three as he hewed down the villains who surprised and discomfited made feeble resistance  who they were or how many he saw not he cared not but struck right and left till the piteous cries for mercy in familiar tones made some impression and he paused as did his companions while in a tone of rage and anguish he demanded where is sir eustace  ah master daubricour twas not me twas the traitor sancheztwas tristan was the answer  oh mercy for our blessed ladys sake  no mercy dogs till ye have shown me sir eustace in life and limb  alas alas master daubricour  this cry arose from some of the english and gaston springing towards the bartizan beheld the senseless form of his beloved knight lying stretched in a pool of his own blood  pouring out lamentations in the passionate terms of the south tearing his hair at having been beguiled into leaving the castle and vowing the most desperate vengeance against clarenham and his accomplices he lifted his master from the ground and as he did so he fancied he felt a slight movement of the chest and a faint moan fell upon his ear  what recked gaston that the castle was but half taken that enemies were around on every side  he saw only heard only thought only of sir eustace  what was life or death prosperity or adversity save as shared with him  he lifted the knight in his arms and hurrying up the stone steps placed him on his couch  bring water bring wine he shouted as he crossed the hall  a horseboy followed with a pitcher of water and gaston unfastening the collar of his doublet raised his head held his face towards the air and deluged it with water entreating him to look up and speak  a few long painful gasps and the eyes were half unclosed while a scarce audible voice said gaston is it thou  i deemed it was over and then the eyes closed again  gastons heart was lightened at having heard that voice once more even had that word been his lastand answering ay truly sir knight all is well so you will but look up he succeed in pouring a little water into his mouth  he was interrupted by several of the menatarms who came trooping up to the door looking anxiously at the wounded knight while the foremost said master gaston here is gear which must be looked to thibault sanchez and half a dozen more have drawn together in montforts tower and swear they will not come forth till we have promised their lives  give them no such pledgehang without mercy cried another voice from behind  did not i myself hear the traitorous villains send off tristan de la fleche to bear the news to carcassonne  we shall have the butcher of bretagne at our throats before another hour is over  cowardly traitor cried gaston  wherefore didst thou not cut the throat of the caitiff and make in to the rescue of the knight  why master daubricour the deed was done ere i was well awake and when it was done and could not be undone and we were but four men to a dozen what could a poor groom do  but you had better look to yourself for it is true as the legends of the saints that tristan is gone to carcassonne riding full speed on the knights own black charger  the news seemed to have greater effect in restoring eustace than any of gastons attentions  he again opened his eyes and made an effort to raise his head as he said almost instinctively secure the gates warders to your posts  the men stood amazed and eustace rallying looked around him and perceived the state of the case  said you they had sent to summon the enemy said he  martin said so replied gaston and i fear it is but too true  not a moment to be lost said eustace  give me some wine and he spoke in a stronger voice how many of you are true to king edward and to the prince  all who will not fight to the death in their cause have free leave to quit this castle but first a message must be sent to bordeaux  true sir eustace but on whom can we rely asked gaston  alas  i fear my faithful ingram must be slain said the knight else this could never have been  know you aught of him he added looking anxiously at the men  the answer was a call from one of the men here john dont stand there grunting like a hog the knight is asking for you dont you hear  a slight scuffle was heard and in a few seconds the broad figure of ingram shouldered through the midst of the menatarms  he came almost like a man in a dream to the middle of the room and there suddenly dropping upon his knees he clasped his hands exclaiming i john ingram hereby solemnly vow to our blessed lady of taunton and st joseph of glastonbury that never more will i drink sack or wine or any other sort or kind spiced or unspiced on holiday or common day by day or night  so help me our blessed lady and st joseph  stand up john and let us know if you are in your senses said gaston angrily we have no time for fooleries  let us know whether you have been knave traitor or fool for one or other you must have been to be standing here sound and safe  you are right sir squire said ingram covering his face with his hands  i would i were ten feet underground ere i had seen this day and he groaned aloud  you have been deceived by their arts said eustace  that i can well believe but that you should be a traitor never my trusty john  blessings on you for the word sir eustace cried the yeoman while tears fell down his rough cheeks  oh all the wine in the world may be burnt to the very dregs ere i again let a drop cross my lips but it was drugged sir eustace it was druggedthat will i aver to my dying day  i believe it said eustace but we must not wait to hear your tale john  you must take horse and ride with all speed to bordeaux one of you go and prepare a horse  take brigliador said gaston he is the swiftest  poor fellow well that i spared him from our journey amid the mountain passes  then proceeded eustace bear the news of our casethat we have been betrayedthat clisson will be on us immediatelythat we will do all that man can do to hold out till succour can come which i pray the prince to send us  take care to whom he addresses himself said gaston  to some our strait will be welcome news  true said eustace  do thy best to see sir john chandos or if he be not at the court prefer thy suit to the prince himselfto any save the earl of pembroke  or if thou couldst see little arthur it might be best of all  dost understand my orders john  ay sir said ingram shaking his great head while the tears still flowed down his cheeks but to see you in this case  think not of that kind john said eustace death must come sooner or later and a swordcut is the end for a knight  you will not shall not die sir eustace cried gaston  your wounds  i know not gaston but the point is now not of saving my life but the castle  speed speed ingram  tell the prince if this castle be taken it opens the way to bordeaux itself  tell him how many brave men it contains and say to him that i pray him not to deem that eustace lynwood hath disgraced his knighthood  tell arthur too to bear me sometimes in mind and never forget the line he comes of  fare thee well good john  let me but hear that i have your forgiveness sir knight  you have it as freely as i hope for mercy  one thing more should you see leonard ashton let him know that i bear him no illwill and pray him not to leave the fair fame of his old comrade foully stained farewell here is my handdo not take it as scorn that it is my leftmy right i cannot move  the yeoman still stood in a sort of trance gazing at him as if unable to tear himself away  see him off gaston said the knight then have the walls properly mannedall is in your hands  gaston obeyed hurrying him to the gate and giving him more hope of sir eustaces recovery than he felt for he knew that nothing but the prospect of saving him was likely to inspire the yeoman with either speed or pertinacity enough to be of use  he fondly patted brigliador who turned his neck in amaze at finding it was not his master who mounted him and having watched them for a moment he turned to look round the court which was empty save for the bodies of those whom he had slain in his furious onset he next repaired to the hall where he found the greater part of the men loitering about and exchanging different reports of strange events which had taken placehe cant be a wizard for certain said one or he never would be in this case unless his bargain was up  it were shame not to stand by him now in the face of the enemy said another  how bold he spoke weak and wounded as he was  he is of the old english stock said a thirda brave stouthearted young knight  well spoken old simon silverlocks said gaston entering  i doubt where you would find another such within the wide realm of france  he is brave enough that no man doubts answered simon but somewhat of the strictest especially considering his years  sir reginald was nothing to him  was it not time to be strict when there was such a nest of treachery within the castle said gaston  we knew that murderous miscreant of a basque and had we not kept well on our guard against him you master simon would long since have been hanging as high from montforts tower as i trust soon to see him  but how knew you him master daubricour that is the question said old simon with a very solemn face of awe  how why by means of somewhat sharper eyes than you seem to possess i have no time to bandy wordsall i come to ask is will you do the duty of honest men or not  if not away with you and i and the knight will abide here till it pleases messire oliver the butcher to practice his trade on us  i remember if some of the lances of lynwood do not a certain camp at valladolid when some of us might have been ill off had he not stood by our beds of sickness nor will i easily desert that pennon which was so gallantly made a banner  these were remembrances to stir the hearts of the ancient lances of lynwood and there was a cry among them of we will never turn our backs on it  lynwood for ever  right mine old comrades  our walls are strong our hearts are stronger three days and aid must come from bordeaux  the traitors are captives and we know to whom to trust for ye of english birth and ye my countrymen who made in so boldly to the rescue ye will not fail at this pinch and see a brave and noble knight yielded to a pack of cowardly murderers  never never  we will stand by him to the last drop of our blood they replied for the sight of the brave wounded knight as well as the example of gastons earnestness and devotion had had a powerful effect and they unanimously joined the squire in a solemn pledge to defend both castle and knight to the last extremity  then up with the good old banner said gaston and let us give messire oliver such a reception as he will be little prepared for he then gave some hasty directions appointed old silverlocks a skilled and tried warrior to take the place of seneschal for the time and to superintend the arrangements and sending two men to guard the entrance of montforts tower where sanchez and his accomplices had shut themselves up he returned to the castellanes chamber  never was there an apartment more desolate  chateau norbelle was built more to be defended than to be inhabited and the rooms were rather so much inclosed space than places intended for comfort the walls were of unhewn stone and as well as the roof thickly tapestried with cobwebsthe narrow loophole which admitted light was unglazedand there was nothing in the whole chamber that could be called furniture save the two rude pallets which served the knight and squire for beds and a chest which had been forced open and rifled by the mutineers they had carried off eustaces beloved books to burn them in the court as instruments of sorcery and a few garments it had likewise contained lay scattered about the room  gaston hastened to the side of his beloved knight almost dreading from his silence and stillness to find him expiring  but he was only faint and exhausted and when gaston raised him and began to examine his wounds he looked up saying thanks thanks kind gaston but waste not your time here the castle the castle  what care i for the castle compared to your life said gaston  for my honour and your own said eustace fixing his eyes on his squires face  gaston i fear you he added stretching out his hand and grasping that of daubricour if you survive you will forget the duty you owe the king for the purpose of avenging me upon clarenham if ever you have loved me gaston give me your solemn promise that this shall not be  it was the purpose for which i should have lived said gaston  you resign it said eustace still retaining his hold of his hand you touch not one of my wounds till you have given me your oath  i swear it then said gaston since you will ever have your own way and i do it the rather that messire oliver de clisson will probably save me the pain of keeping the pledge  you have taken all measures for defence  yes  the menatarms such as are left may be trusted and have all taken an oath to stand by us which i do not think they will readily break  the rest either made off with the baggagemules or were slain when we broke in to your rescue or are shut up with le borgne basque in montforts tower  i have sent the men to their posts put them under silverlocks orders and told him to come to me for directions  eustace at last resigned himself into the squires hands  a broken arm a ghastlylooking cut on the head and a deep thrust with a poniard in the breast seemed the most serious of the injuries he had received but there were numerous lesser gashes and stabs which had occasioned a great effusion of blood and he had been considerably bruised by his fall  gaston could attempt nothing but applying some ointment sold by a jew at bordeaux as an infallible cure for all wounds and bruises and having done all he could for the comfort of his patient quitted him to attend to the defence of the castle  his first visit was to montforts tower one of the four flanking the main body of the castle  well master thibault sanchez or if you like it better le borgne basque cried he thank you for saving us some trouble  you have found yourself a convenient prison there and i hope you are at your ease  we shall see how you are at your ease master gaston le maure retorted sanchez from the depths of the tower when another borgne shall make his appearance and string you up as a traitor to king charles your liege lord  le borgne basque talking of traitors and such gear returned gaston but he will tell a different tale when the succours come from the prince  ha ha laughed thibault a little bird whispered in mine ear that you may look long for succour from bordeaux  this was in a great measure gastons own conviction but he only replied the more vehemently that it could not fail since neither knights nor castles were so lightly parted with and that he trusted soon to have the satisfaction of seeing the inhabitants of the tower receive the reward of their treachery  thus they partedthibault perfectly well satisfied to remain where he was since he had little doubt that oliver de clissons speedy arrival would set him at liberty and turn the tables upon gaston and gaston glad that since he could not at present have the satisfaction of hanging him he was in a place where he could do no mischief and whence he could not escape  now the warder on the watchtower blew a blast and every eye was turned towards the eastern part of the country where in the direction of carcassonne was to be seen a thick cloud of dust from which in due time were visible the flashes of armour and the points of weapons  gaston having given his orders and quickened the activity of each man in his small garrison hurried down to bear the tidings to sir eustace and to array himself in his own brightest helmet and gayest surcoat  ascending again to the battlements he could see the enemy approaching could distinguish the banner of clisson and count the long array of menatarms and crossbowmen as they pursued their way through the bright green landscape now half hidden by a rising ground now slowly winding from its summit  at last they came to the foot of the slope  gaston had already marked the start and pause which showed when they first recognized the english standard and there was another stop while they ranged themselves in order and after a moments interval a manatarms rode forward towards the postern door looked earnestly at it and called sanchez  shoot him dead said gaston to an english crossbowman who stood beside him it is the villain tristan on poor ferragus  the arblast twanged and tristan fell while poor ferragus after starting violently trotted round to the wellknown gate and stood there neighing  poor fellow said gaston art calling brigliador i would i knew he had sped well  the french dismayed by the reception of their guide held back but presently a pursuivant came forward from their ranks and after his trumpet had been sounded summoned in the name of the good knight messire oliver de clisson the garrison of chateau norbelle to surrender it into his hands as thereto commissioned by his grace charles king of france  the garrison replied by another trumpet and gaston standing forth upon the battlements over the gateway demanded to speak with sir oliver de clisson and to have safeconduct to and from the open space at the foot of the slope  this being granted the drawbridge was lowered and the portcullis raised  ferragus entered and went straight to his own stall and gaston daubricour came forth in complete armour and was conducted by the pursuivant to the leader of the troop  sir oliver de clisson as he sat on horseback with the visor of his helmet raised had little or nothing of the appearance of the courteous knight of the period  his features were not perhaps originally as harsh and illformed as those of his compeer bertrand du guesclin but there was a want of the frank open expression and courteous demeanour which so well suited the high chivalrous temper of the great constable of france  they were dark and stern and the loss of an eye which had been put out by an arrow rendered him still more hardfavoured  he was in fact a man soured by early injurieshis father had been treacherously put to death by king john of france when duke of normandy and his brother had been murdered by an englishmanhis native brittany was torn by dissensions and divisionsand his youth had been passed in bloodshed and violence  he had now attained the deserved fame of being the second knight in france honourable and loyal as regarded his king but harsh rigid cruel of an unlovable temper which made him in after years a mark for plots and conspiracies and the vindictive temper of the celtic race leading him to avenge the death of his brother upon every englishman who fell into his hands  so sir squire exclaimed he in his harsh voice what excuse do you come to make for slaying my messenger ere he had time to deliver his charge  i own him as no messenger returned gaston  he was a renegade traitor from our own castle seeking his accomplice in villainy  well speak on said oliver to whom the death of a manatarms was a matter of slight importance  art thou come to deliver up the castle to its rightful lord  no messire oliver replied gaston  i come to bring the reply of the castellane sir eustace lynwood that he will hold out the castle to the last extremity against all and each of your attacks  sir eustace lynwood  what means this master squire  yonder knave declared he was dead  hear me sir oliver de clisson said gaston  sir eustace lynwood hath a pair of mortal foes at the princes court who prevailed on a part of the garrison to yield him into your hands  in my absence they in part succeeded  by the negligence of a drunken groom they were enabled to fall upon him in his sleep and as they deemed had murdered him  i returning with the rest of the garrison was enabled to rescue him and deliver the castle where he now liesalive indeed but desperately wounded  now i call upon you sir oliver to judge whether it be the part of a true and honourable knight to become partner of such miscreants and to take advantage of so foul a web of treachery  this may be a fine tale for the ears of younger knightserrant sir squire was the reply of clisson  for my part though i am no lover of treason i may not let the kings service be stayed by scruples for yourself sir squire i make you a fair offer  you are by your tongue and countenance a gascona liegeman born of king charles of france  to you and to every other man of french birth i offer to enter his service or to depart whither it may please you with arms and baggage so you will place the castle in our handsand leave us to work our will of the island dogs it contains  thanks sir oliver for such a boon as i would not vouchsafe to stoop to pick up were it thrown at my feet  well and good sir squire said clisson rather pleased at the bold reply  we understand each other  fare thee well  and gaston walked back to the castle muttering to himself had it been but the will of the saints to have sent du guesclin hither then would sir eustace have been as safe and free as in lynwood keep itself but what matters it  if he dies of his wounds what good would my life do me save to avenge himand from that he has debarred me  so grim oliver do thy worstha as he entered the castledown portcullisup drawbridge  archers bend your bows  martin stones for the mangonel  nor was the assault long delayed  clissons men only waited to secure their horses and prepare their ladders and the attack was made on every side  it was well and manfully resisted  bravely did the little garrison struggle with the numbers that poured against them on every side and the day wore away in the desperate conflict  sir eustace heard the loud cries of montjoie st denis clisson on the one side and the st george for merry england  a lynwood with which his own party replied he heard the thundering of heavy stones the rush of combatants the cries of victory or defeat sometimes his whole being seemed in the fight he clenched his teeth he shouted his warcry tried to raise himself and lift his powerless arm then returned again to the consciousness of his condition clasped either the rosary or the crucifix and turned his soul to fervent prayer then again the strange wild cries without confounded themselves into one maddening noise on his feverish ear or in the confusion of his weakened faculties he would as it were believe himself to be his brother dying on the field of navaretta and scarce be able to rouse himself to a feeling of his own identity  so passed the dayand twilight was fast deepening into night when the cries a short time since more furious than ever and nearer and more exulting on the part of the french at length subsided and finally died away the trampling steps of the menatarms could be heard in the hall below and gaston himself came up with hasty step undid his helmet and wiping his brow threw himself on the ground with his back against the chest saying well we have done our devoir at any rate poor brigliador  i am glad he has a kind master in ingram  have they won the court asked eustace  i thought i heard their shouts within it  ay  even so  how could we guard such an extent of wall with barely five and twenty men  old silverlocks and jaques de leure are slain martin badly wounded and we all forced back into the inner court after doing all it was in a man to do  i heard your voice bold and cheerful as ever above the tumult said eustace  but the inner court is fit for a long defencethat staircase parapet where so few can attack at once  ay said gaston it was that and the darkness that stopped them there i can detain them long enough to give the chance of the succours so those knaves below do not fail in spiritand they know well enough what chance they have from yon grimvisaged breton  but as to those succours i no more expect them than i do to see the prince at their head  a hundred to one that he never hears of our need or if he should that pembroke and clarenham do not delay the troops till too late  and there will be the loss of the most important castle and the most faithful and kindest heart said eustace  but go gastonfood and rest you must need after this long days fightand the defences must be looked to and the men cheered  yes said gaston slowly rising and bending over the knight but is there nought i can do for you sir eustace  nought save to replenish my cup of water  it is well for me that the enemy have not cut us off from the castle well  gastons supper did not occupy him long  he was soon again in eustaces room talking over his plan of defence for the next day but with little if any hope that it would be other than his last struggle  at last wearied out with the exertions of that day and the preceding he listened to eustaces persuasions and removing the more cumbrous portions of his armour threw himself on his bed and in a moment his regular breathings announced that he was sound asleep  it was in the pale early light of dawn that he awoke and starting up while still half asleep exclaimed sir eustace are you there i should have relieved guard long since  then as he recalled his situation i had forgot  how is it with you sir eustace  have you slept  no said eustace  i have not lost an hour of this last night i shall ever see  it will soon be over nowthe sun is already reddening the sky and so gaston ends our long truehearted affection  little did i think it would bring thee to thy death in the prime of they strength and manhood and he looked mournfully on the lofty stature and vigorous form of the squire as he stood over him  for that sir eustace there is little cause to grieve  i have been a wanderer friendless and homeless throughout my life and save for yourself and perhaps poor little arthurs kind heart where is one who would cast a second thought on me beyond perhaps saying he was a brave and faithful squire  but little little did i think when i saw your spurs so nobly won that this was to be the end of itthat you were to die defamed and reviled in an obscure den and by the foul treachery of  speak not of that gaston said eustace  i have dwelt on it in the long hours of the night and i have schooled my mind to bear it  those with whom we shall soon be know that if i have sinned in many points yet i am guiltless in that whereof they accuse meand for the rest there are at least two who will think no shame of eustace lynwood and now if there is yet time gaston since no priest is at hand i would pray thee to do me the last favour of hearing the confession of my sins  and gaston kneeling down the knight and squire according to the custom of warriors in extremity confessed to each other with the crucifix raised between them  eustace then with his weak and failing voice repeated several prayers and psalms appropriate to the occasion in which gaston joined with hearty devotion  by this time a slight stir was heard within the castle and gaston rising from his knees went to the loophole which commanded a view of the court where the french had taken up their quarters for the night in some of the outbuildingsand the lion rampant of clisson was waving in triumph on the gateway tower  all silent there said he but i must go to rouse our knaves in time to meet the first onset  and as he clasped on his armour he continued all that is in the power of man will we do  rest assured sir eustace they reach you not save through my body and let your prayers be with me  one embrace sir eustace and we meet no more  in this world  eustace concluded the sentence as gaston hung over him and his tears dropped on his face  farewell most faithful and most truehearted  go i command thee  think not on methink on thy dutyand good angels will be around us both farewell farewell  gaston for the first time in his life felt himself unable to speak he crossed the room with slow and lingering step then with a great effort dashed out at the door closing his visor as he did so and after a short interval during which he seemed to have stopped on the stairs eustace could hear his gay bold tones calling up up my merry men all  let not the french dogs find the wolf asleep in his den  they will find our inner bartizan a hard stone for their teethand it will be our own fault if they crack it before the coming of our brave comrades from bordeaux     chapter xiv   the open space beyond the walls of bordeaux presented a bright and lively scene  it was here that the pages of the black prince were wont to exercise those sports and pastimes for which the court of the palace scarce offered sufficient space or which were too noisy for the neighbourhood of the ladies and of the invalid prince  of noble and often of princely birth were all who entered that school of chivalry and for the most part the fine open countenances noble bearing and wellmade figures of the boys testified their high descent as completely as the armorial bearings embroidered on the back and front of their short kirtles many different provinces had sent their noblest to be there trained in the service of the bravest knights and princes  there besides the brownhaired fairskinned english boy was the quick fiery welsh child who owned an especial allegiance to the prince the broad blueeyed fleming whose parents rejoiced in the fame of the son of philippa of hainault the pert lively gascon and the swarthy navarrese mountaineerall brought together in close and everchanging contrast of countenance habits and character  of all the merry groups scattered through that wide green space the most interesting was one formed by three boys who stood beneath a tree a little from the rest  the two eldest might be from ten to eleven years old the third two or three years younger and his delicate features fair pale complexion and slender limbs made him appear too weak and childish for such active sports as the rest were engaged in but that the lordly glance of his clear blue eye his firm tread and the noble carriage of his shapely head had in them something of command which attracted notice even before the exceeding beauty of his perfectly moulded face and long waving curls of golden hair  so like him that they might have passed for brothers was one of the elder boys who stood nearthere was the same high white brow proud lip regular features and bright eye but the complexion though naturally fair was tanned to a healthy brown where exposed to the sun the frame was far stronger and more robust and the glance of the eye had more in it of pride and impatience than of calm command so remarkable in the little one  the three boys were standing in consultation over an arrow which they had just discovered stuck deep in the ground  tis my arrow that i shot over the mark on monday said the elder  nay harry said the younger boy that cannot be for remember thomas holland said your arrow would frighten the good nuns of st ursula in their garden  it must be mine persisted harryfor none of you all can shoot as far  yes english arthur can said the little boy  he shot a whole clothyard beyond you the day  well never mind edward said harry sharplywho cares for arrowsweapons for clowns and not for princes  nay not so lord harry interrupted the third boy i have heard my uncle say many a time that englands archery is half her strengthand how it was our archers at the battle of crecy  i know all thathow the men of genoa had wet bowstrings and ours dry ones said henry but they were peasants after all  ay but a king of england should know how to praise and value his good yeomen  henry turned on his heel and saying well let the arrow be whose it will i care not for it walked off  do you know why harry of lancaster goes arthur said edward smiling  no my lord replied arthur  he cannot bear to hear aught of king of england was the answer if you love me good arthur vex him not with speaking of it  father cyril would say he ought to learn content with the rank where he was born said arthur  father cyril again said prince edward  you cannot live a day without speaking of him and of your uncle  i do not speak of them so much now said arthur colouring it is only you lord edward who never make game of me for doing sothough i trow i have taught pierre de greilly to let my uncles name alone  truly you did so said edward laughing and he has scarce yet lost his black eye  but i love to hear your tales arthur of that quiet castle and the old blanc etoile and your uncle who taught you to ride  sit down here on the grass and tell me more  but what are you staring at so fixedly  at the poor jaded horse that yonder manatarms is urging on so painfully  tisno it is notyes tis brigliador and john ingram himself cried arthur  oh my uncle my uncle  and in one moment he had bounded across the ditch which fenced in their exercising ground and had rushed to meet ingram  oh john exclaimed he breathlessly have they done it  oh tell me of uncle eustace is he alive  master arthur exclaimed ingram stopping his wearied horse  oh tell me ingram reiterated arthur is my uncle safe  he is alive master arthurthat is he was when i came away but as sore wounded as ever i saw a knight  and the butcher of brittany is upon them by this time  and here i am sent to ask succoursand i know no more whom to address myself than the cock at the top of lynwood steeple  but what has chanced johnmake haste and tell me  and john in his own awkward and confused style narrated how he had been entrapped by sanchez and the consequences of his excess but said he i have vowed to our lady of taunton and st joseph of glastonbury that never again  arthur had covered his face with his hands and gave way to tears of indignation and grief as he felt his helplessness  but one hand was kindly withdrawn and a gentle voice said weep not arthur but come with me and my father will send relief to the castle and save your uncle  you here lord edward exclaimed arthur who had not perceived that the prince had followed him  oh yes thanks thanks  none but the prince can save him  oh let me see him myself and that instantly  then let us come said edward still holding arthurs hand  arthur set off at such a pace as to press the little prince into a breathless trot by his side but he too was all eagerness and scorned to complain  they proceeded without interruption to the court of the palace  edward leading the way hastened to his mothers apartments  he threw open the door looked in and saying to arthur he must be in the council chamber cut short an exclamation of lady maude holland by shutting the door and running down a long gallery to an antechamber where were several persons waiting for an audience and two warders with halberts erect standing on guard outside a closed door  the prince is in council my lord  edward drew up his head and waving them aside with a gesture that became the heir of england said i take it upon myself  he then opened the door and still holding arthur fast by the hand led him into the chamber where the prince of wales sat in consultation  there was a pause of amazement as the two boys advanced to the high carved chair on which the prince was seatedand edward exclaimed father save arthurs uncle  what means this edward demanded the prince of wales somewhat sternly  go to your mother boywe cannot hear you now and  i cannot go father replied the child till you have promised to save arthurs uncle  he is woundedthe traitors have wounded himand the french will take the castle and he will be slain and arthur loves him so much  come here edward said the prince remarking the flushed cheek and tearful eye of his son and tell me what this means  edward obeyed but without loosing his hold of his young friends hand the manatarms is come all heat and dust on the poor drooping jaded steedand he said the knight would be slain and the castle taken unless you would send him relief  it is arthurs uncle that he loves so well  arthurs uncle repeated the princeand turning his eyes on the suppliant figure he said arthur lynwood  speak boy  oh my lord said arthur commanding his voice with difficulty i would only pray you to send succour to my uncle at chateau norbelle and save him from being murdered by oliver de clisson  it was a voice which boded little good to arthurs suit that now spoke if it be sir eustace lynwood at chateau norbelle of whom the young prince speaks he can scarce be in any strait since the garrison is more than sufficient  the little page started to his feet and regarding the speaker with flashing eyes exclaimed hearken not to him my lord prince  he is the cause of all the treacheryhe is the ruin and destruction of my unclehe has deceived you with his falsehoodsand now he would be his death  how now my young cousin said clarenham in a most irritating tone of indifferenceyou forget in what presence you are  i do not replied arthur fiercely  before the prince fulk clarenham i declare you a false traitorand if you dare deny it there lies my gloves  fulk only replied by a scornful laugh and addressing the prince said may i pray of your grace not to be over severe with my young malapert relation  the captal de buch spoke you do not know what an adversary you have provoked fulk  the other day i met my nephew little pierre with an eye as black as the patch we used to wear in our young days of knighterrantry  what wars have you been in master pierre i asked it was english arthur who had fought with him for mocking at his talking of nothing but his uncle  but you need not colour and look so abashed little englishmani bear no more malice than i hope pierre doesi only wish i had as bold a champion i remember thine uncle if he is the youth to whom the constable surrendered at navaretta and of whom we made so much  too much then and too little afterwards said old sir john chandos  you do not know all chandos said the prince  you do not yourself know all my lord said arthur turning eagerly lord de clarenham has deceived you and led you to imagine that my uncle wished ill to me and wanted to gain my lands whereas it is he himself who wants to have me in his hands to bend me to his will it is he who has placed traitors in chateau norbelle to slay my uncle and deliver him to the enemy they have already wounded him almost to deathhere arthurs lips quivered and he could hardly restrain a burst of tearsand they have sent for sir oliver de clisson the butcher  gaston will hold out as long as they can but if you will not send succours my lord he willwill be slain and kind gaston too and arthur unable to control himself any longer covered his face with his hands and gave way to a silent suppressed agony of sobs and tears  cheer thee my boy said the prince kindly we will see to thine uncle  then looking at his nobles he continued it seems that these varlets will allow us no more peace and since there does in truth appear to be a knight and castle in jeopardy one of you had perhaps better go with a small band and clear up this mystery  if it be as the boy saith lynwood hath had foul wrong  i care not if i be the one to go my lord said chandos my men are aver kept in readiness and a nights gallop will do the lazy knaves all the good in the world  arthur brushing off the tears of which he was much ashamed looked at the old knight in transport  thanks chandos said the prince i would commit the matter to none so willingly as to you though i scarce would have asked it considering you were not quite so prompt on a late occasion  my lord of pembroke will allow however that i did come in time said sir john  it was his own presumption and foolhardiness that got him into the scrape and he was none the worse for the lesson he received  but this young fellow seems to have met with this mischance by no fault of his own and i am willing to see him righted for he is a good lad as well as a brave as far as i have known him  how came the tidings asked the prince  did not one of you boys say somewhat of a manatarms  yes my lord said arthur john ingram my uncles own yeoman has come upon brigliador with all speed  i sent him to the guardroom where he now waits in case you would see him  ay said old chandos a man would have some assurance that he is not going on a fools errand  let us have him here my lord  cause him to be summoned said the prince to arthur  and at the same time said chandos send for my squire henry neville to the antechamber  the men may get on their armour in the meantime  in a few minutes john ingram made his appearance the dust not yet wiped from his armour his hair hanging is disordered masses over his forehead and his jaws not completely resting from the mastication of a huge piece of pasty  his tale though confused could not be for an instant doubted as he told of the situation in which he had left chateau norbelle and its castellane the best man could wish to live under  well he hath forgiven me and given me his hand upon it  forgiven theefor what said the prince  ah my lord i may speak of treason but i am one of the traitors myself  did not the good knight leave me in charge to make my rounds constantly in the castle while he slept after his long watching and lo there comes that wily rascal the seneschal sanchez with his tis a cold night friend john the knight wakes thee up early come down to the buttery and crack a cup of sack in all friendliness down then go i oaf that i was thinking that may be our knight was over strict and harsh and pulled the reins so tight that a poor manatarms must needs get a little diversion now and thenas the proverb says when the cats away the mice may play  but it was drugged my lord else when would one cup of spiced wine have so overcome me that i knew nought till i hear master daubricour shouting treason in the courtyard like one frantic  but the knight has forgiven me and i have sworn to our blessed lady of taunton and st joseph of glastonbury that not a draught of wine spiced or unspiced shall again cross my lips  a wholesome vow said the prince and her is a token to make thee remember itand he placed in the hand of the yeoman a chain of some value  go to the guardroom where you shall be well entertained till such time as we need thee again as we may if you have been as you say long in sir eustace lynwoods service but what now  hast more to say  i would sayso please you my lordthat i pray you but to let me ride back to chateau norbelle with this honourable knight for i owe all service to sir eustace nor could i rest till i know how it fares with him  as you will good fellow said the prince and you chandos come with me to my chamberi would speak with you before you depart  my lord said arthur would you but grant me one boonto go with sir john to chateau norbelle  you too  you would almost make me think you all drawn by witchcraft to this castle  but arthurs eagerness extorted a consent and he rode off amid sir john chandoss troop boldly enough at first but by and by so sleepily that as night advanced sir john ordered him to be placed in front of a trooper and he soon lost all perception of the rough rapid pace at which they travelled  it was broad day when he was awakened by a halt and the first thing he heard was there is st georges pennon still safe  he sat upright gazed eagerly forwards and beheld a tall dark tower rising by the bank of a stream at some distance  chateau norbelle he asked  oh ho my little page said chandos  you are alive again are you ay chateau norbelle it isand we are in time it seems  but let us have you on your own steed again  and let us seeif oliver be there himself we shall have sharp work  ay keep you by the side of the old master leech therehe will be sure to keep out of peril  nowclose inlances in restbows bent  forward banner  arthur by no means approving of the companionship assigned him contrived to wedge in his pony a little in the rear of sir johns two squires as the whole squadron rode down the slope of the hill and up the ascent on which the castle stood  loud cries and shrieks from within began to strike their earsthe clash of armsall the tumult of attack and defence raging fearfully high and wild  ho ho friend oliverwe have you in a trap said old chandos in high glee as he drew up close without the walls  neville guard the gates  he signed to about half his band to remain without and cut off the retreat of the enemy  the jew doctor chose his post in their rear close to the castle moatbut not so arthur  unnoticed and forgotten he still kept close behind the squire who rode alongside of sir john chandos as he crossed the drawbridge  the castle gate was open and showed a wild confused mass of struggling men and flashing arms  it was the last most furious onset when clisson enraged by the long resistance of so weak a garrison was concentrating his strength in one effort and in the excitement of the assault he had failed to remark that his sentinels had transgressed his orders and mingled with the crowd who were striving by force of numbers to overwhelm the small troop of defenders of the bartizan  in rushed chandos shouting his warcryin dashed his stout warriors and loud and fierce pealed forth st george st george drowning the now feebler note of montjoie st denis and fearful were the shrieks of horror and of pain that rose mingled with it hemmed in attacked in front and rear their retreat cut off the french looked in vain for escape some went down beneath the tremendous charge of the english some cried for mercy and surrendered as prisoners  oliver de clisson himself seeing that all was lost swinging round his head his heavy battleaxe opened for himself a way and with a few followers broke through the men whom chandos had left outside and cutting down a groom who was holding it captured one of his led horses on which he rode off at his leisure confident in his own gigantic strength  so little resistance had been offered that arthurs bold advance had involved him in little danger he was borne onwards and only was conscious of a frightful tumult where all seemed to be striking and crushing together  at last there was something of a lull the cries of mercy and offers to surrender alone were heard  arthur found his pony standing still and himself pressed hither and thither by the crowd from which he knew not how to escape  above these various sounds he heard an opening doorthere was a press forward which carried him with it  the heavy doors shivered here and there by clissons axe had been thrown wide open but the crowd closed inhe saw no more  he threw himself from his pony struggled forwards and at last emerging between the arms of two tall men he beheld sir john chandos dismounting from his warhorse which was held by a grim bloody dusty figure in broken armour whose length of limb and the crisp black curled hair that showed through the shattered helmet proved that it could be no other than gaston daubricour  arthur darted forwards his heart upon his lips but neither knight nor squire had eye or ear for him they were hastily exchanging queries abouthe knew not whatthey were not of his uncle and borne on by his impatience he hurried past them up the narrow stone stair  more than one corpsea ghastly sightlay on the steps but he hastened on half a dozen men were standing on the stones at the top all like gaston dusty and gory and leaning on their weapons or on the wall as if exhausted  they were looking intently at the court and gave no heed to the boy as he ran on into the hall  two men lay there groaning before the fire arthur stood and looked round hesitating whether to ask them for his uncle but perceiving the spiral stairs quickly ascended far and far up he wound till he came to a lowbrowed arch he paused and saw a large vaulted room through the loophole window of which shone a yellow stream of golden sunshine  there was a low bed in one corner and on it lay a motionless form  on tiptoe and with a throbbing heart the boy approached he saw the faceit was ghastly pale  he stood transfixedcould it beyes it must still be his own uncle eustace     chapter xv   it was still very early and the narrow line of sky seen from the turret window was gilded by the bright palegreen light of morning when sir eustace awoke  all around was perfectly still and he could have believed himself waking merely from a dream of tumult and disturbance but for his feelings of pain and weakness  at some little distance lay on a softlydressed sheepskin the oriental figure of the jewish mediciner and at the foot of his own bed the unexpected form of little arthur reclined half sitting half lying with his head resting on his crossed arms and his long curls floating over them all was a riddle to his misty remembrance clouded by weakness and in vague uncertain recollections and conjectures the time rolled away till the sounds of awakening and calls of the warders within the castle betokened that it was occupied by no small number of persons still arthur slept on and eustace abstained from the slightest movement that could disturb him till a step stole quietly to the door and gastons head was seen cautiously and anxiously looking in  eustace raising his hand beckoned him and made a sign of silence  how is with you sir eustace  it must needs be better  i see a light in your eye once more  i am another man since yesterday gaston but be carefulsee there  little fear of breaking such sleep as that said gaston  tis a noblehearted little fellow and if matters go better with us henceforth it will be his work  what is become of clisson  he was riding off headlong when master henry neville last beheld him gaining thereby a sound rating from old chandos  sir john chandos here  fast asleep in your own carved chair with his feet on the oaken settle  sir john chandos again exclaimed eustace  even so  all thanks to the brave young damoiseau who  here gastons ardour had the effect of awakening the doctor who immediately began to grumble at his patients admitting visitors without permission  by the time he had examined eustaces wounds and pronounced him to be progressing favourably the whole castle was up and awake and arthur against his will was sent down to attend on sir john chandos at breakfast when scarce satisfied that his uncle could speak to him  in process of time he came up to announce a visit from chandos himself and close on his steps followed the stalwart old warrior pausing at the door he looked around him struck with the aspect of the dungeonlike apartment still more rugged in the morning light than in the evening gloomthe bare rough walls an arrow sticking between the stones immediately above the knights head the want of furniture the knights own mantle and that of gaston both called into requisition to protect him from the damp chill night air their bright hues and rich embroidery contrasting with the squalid appearance of all around as indeed did the noble though pale features of the wounded man himself and the graceful attire and shining hair of the fair young boy who stood over him but sir john beheld all with no dissatisfaction  well my brave young sir said he advancing how is it with you this morning  you look cheerily i trust we shall soon have you on horseback again  thanks to the blessed saints and to you sir john replied eustace i fear you fared ill last night forand he looked round with a smileyou see i occupy the state bedchamber  the better sir eustace said chandos  it does my heart good to see such a chamber as thisnone of the tapestry and hangings which our young knights nowadays fence themselves with as if they kept out the foethis is what it is meant fora stronghold and not a bower  ill have my dainty young master neville up here to see how a good knight should be lodged  i fear he would scarce consider it as an example said eustace smiling since all our simplicity would not have availed to protect us but for your coming  we little dreamt to see this mornings light  true but where should i look for a garrison to make such a defence as you and your squire have done  when i saw the spot and looked at the numbers and heard how long you had held out methought i was returned once more to the good old days of calais  and here this youth of mine not yet with his spurs though i dare say full five years older than you must needs look sour upon it because he has to sleep on a settle for one nightand that too when he has let oliver de clisson slip through his fingers without so much as a scratch taken or given on either side  it grieves my very soul to think on it  but all has gone to rack and ruin since the prince has been unable to set the example  is the prince better in health  yesso they saybut his looks tell another tale and i never expect to see him on horseback again said the old warrior with a deep sigh but i have to do his bidding here and have much to ask of you sir eustace and i do it the more willingly that i rejoice to see a brave man righted  has the prince then commanded an inquiry into my conduct exclaimed eustace joyfully  it is what i have ever most warmly desired  and know you whom you have to thank said sire john  that youngster who stands at your feettwas he that with little prince edward burst into the council and let not another word be said till he had told your need given fulk clarenham the lie direct and challenged him to prove his words  pray when is the defiance to be fought out sir page  arthur coloured crimson and looked down then raising his glowing face said firmly tomorrow if need were sirfor god would defend the right  roundly spoken master page  but let not your early years be all talk nothing worth  the same warning that you gave to me sir john said eustace  when you thought i looked coldly and churlishly on your newwon honours said sir john  i own i thought the prince was bestowing knighthood over lightlyand so do i say still sir eustace  but i saw afterwards that you were not so easily uplifted as i had thought i saw you as diligent in the study of all that was knightly as if your spurs were yet to earn and i knew the prince had a brave young servant in you  if he would have trusted me said eustace  he hath been deceived by the flatterers who have gained his ear it should not have been thus had i been at court but things have been much against my counsel  it may be that i have been too plain spokenforgetting that he is not the boy who used to be committed to my chargeit may be that he hath been over hastyand yet when i look on his changed mien and wasted face i can scarce blame him nor must you sir eustace though cruel injustice hath i fear been done you  i blame our glorious prince exclaimed the young knight  i would as soon blame the sun in heaven because the clouds hide his face from me for a time  the clouds are likely to be dispersed with a vengeance said chandos the confession of yonder mutinous traitors will clear you from all that your accusers have said by proving their villainy and baseness  how  sanchez and his fellows  have they surrendered  yes  they kept themselves shut up in montforts tower until they lost all hope of relief from their friends without then being in fear of starvation they were forced to surrender and came forth praying that their lives might be spared  i as you may suppose would as lief have spared the life of a wolf and the halters were already round their necks when your darkvisaged squire prayed me to attempt to gain a confession from them and sure enough they told a marvellous talethat clarenham had placed them here to deliver you up to the enemy whom they were to admit by a secret passageand that they would have done it long since save that you and your squire not only discovered the passage but showed such vigilance and so frustrated all their plans that they firmly believed that you held commerce with the foul fiend  did you in truth suspect their treachery  yes replied eustace looking at arthur  the recognition of le borgne basque in the seneschal would have been sufficient to set us on our guard  but the passage asked sir john what knowledge had you of that for they vow that you could never have discovered it but by art magic  we found it by long and diligent search  and what led you to search sir eustace  i you can clear up the matter it will be the better for you for this accusation of witchcraft will hang to you like a burrthe more perhaps as you are somewhat of a scholar  it was i who warned him of it sir knight said arthur stepping forward  you young page exclaimed sir john  are you jesting  ha then you must have pagelike been eavesdroppingi should scarce have thought it of you  oh uncle exclaimed arthur in great distress you do not believe me capable of aught so unknightly  do but say that you at least trust my word when i say that i learnt their plots by no means unbecoming the son of sir reginald lynwood  i believe you fully arthur replied his uncle the more that i should have been the last person to whom you would have brought information gained in such a fashion  and how was it gained asked sir john  that said the boy is a secret i am bound never to disclose  strange passing strange repeated the old knight shaking his head clarenham and ashton would scarce have taken any into their councils who would warn you  and you will or can tell no more  no more replied the boy  i was bidden secretly to warn my uncle of the entrance to the vaults and of the treachery of this villain garrison  i did so and he who says aught dishonourable of him or of me lies in his throat  can you read this riddle sir eustace asked chandos looking rather suspiciously at the very faint glow which mantled in the white cheek of the wounded knight  i know nothing but what he has told you sir john replied he  nor guess aught said sir john but perhaps that is scarce a fair query and i will to the rest of my business though it is scarce neededonly i would have the prince see the full extent of the falsehoods with which he has been gulled  and he then proceeded to inquire into the circumstances of lady eleanors funeral the brawling the violent abstraction of arthur and of a considerable portion of his property and the long delay which had given his enemies so much opportunity to blacken his character  eustace explained all fully to the satisfaction of chandos and appealed to numerous witnesses  that is well said the old knight  we shall have it all clear as daylightand the only wonder is that the prince could be so long deceived by such monstrous falsehoods  let me seeyour right to the wardship is established  yes it hath been so decided by the bishop of winchester  and let me tell you sir eustace you did yourself little good by getting the interest of the duke of lancaster  methought it still further prejudiced the prince  it was justice that i sought not favour said eustace  the knightly view said sir john and it was more the work of your friends than yourself but i never loved that young john of lancaster and still less since he hath seemed willing to make a party for himself  i trow he hath given the prince a distrust of all uncles ha little varlet added he as he met arthurs eyesif you can keep one secret keep another or still better forget what i have said understandest thou  i will answer for him said eustace  and now said chandos i must be on my way back for that expedition to bescancon must be looked to  but what is to be done with the boy  oh i remain here cried arthur eagerly  the prince consented oh i pray of you let me stay here  in this dismal old castle arthur said eustace apart from all your playmates  it will not be like home remember for scarce ever will you be able to go beyond the wallsand with me lying here and gaston always occupied you will find it weary work  not with you uncle eustace  i shall sit by you and tend you and read to you  it is so long since i have been with you  oh send me not away  i care for no playmatefor nothing in the wide world as for you  well let him een stay said sir john it will be a better training for him than among the gilded little varlets who are cockered up among princess joans ladies  the two knights had next to arrange some matters respecting the garrison sir john leaving a sufficient number of men to secure the castle in case of a second attack  he was somewhat inclined to leave master henry neville to command them but consideration for eustace and gaston induced him to spare the young gentleman a sojourn which he would have regarded as so far from enviable nor was the leech more desirous of a lengthened stay with a patient whom he suspected to be unable to requite him for the discomfort which he might endure in his service  he therefore pronounced sir eustace to stand in no further need of his attentions and recommending rest and providing him with good store of remedies he saddled his mule to accompany sir john chandos  the old commander took his leave with many kind wishes for sir eustaces speedy recovery and promises that he should ere long hear from bordeaux  in ten minutes more arthur standing at the window announced that the troop was riding off with clissons pennon borne among them in triumph and sanchez and his accomplices with their hands tied and their feet fastened together beneath the bodies of their horses     chapter xvi   four or five weeks had passed away since sir john chandos had quitted the chateau norbelle  the knight had nearly recovered his full strength but still wore his broken arm in a scarf when one evening as he was sitting on the battlements delighting the ears of arthur and of gaston with an interminable romance of chivalry three or four horseman bearing the colours and badges of the black prince were descried riding towards the castle  knight squire and page instantly descended to the courtyard which in short space was entered by the messengers the principal of whom an elderly manatarms respectfully saluted the knight and delivered to him a parchment scroll tied with silk of scarlet and blue supporting the heavy seal of the prince of wales and duke of aquitaine and addressed to the hands of the honourable knight banneret sir eustace lynwood castellane of the chateau norbelle  this document bore the signature of edward himself and contained his mandate to eustace to come immediately to his court at bordeaux leaving the command of the chateau norbelle to the bearer  the old manatarms was closely questioned all the evening respecting the state of the court but he could give little information  sir john chandos was at bordeaux and had daily attended the council to which the prince was devoting more attention than usual a vessel had also arrived bearing letters from england to the prince this was all the information that could be obtained  the next morning eustace with gaston arthur and ingram all full of expectation and delighted at the change from the gloomy solitary old castle were all posting on their way back to bordeaux  they slept at an hostel about twelve miles from the town first however by desire of the princes messengers sending ingram on to announce their speedy arrival and about ten in the morning rode into town  there was evidently some grand spectacle at hand for the bordelais gentle and simple in holiday habits were proceeding in the direction of the palace but the knight and his attendants had no time to wait for inquiries and pressed on with the stream to the gates of the courtyard where they found warders placed to keep back the dense throng of people  at the mention of sir eustaces name they readily and respectfully admitted him and his companions into the court  ha cried gaston what means this is there a tilt towards  this reminds me of the good old days ere the prince fell ill  the lists the galleries the ladies the princes own chair of state too  oh sir eustace i could tear my hair that you cannot yet use your sword arm  can it be a challenge on the part of fulk  said eustace or a reply to yours arthur  yet that can hardly be  and see there is no barrier in the midst only a huge block  what can be intended  i do not see agnes among the ladies in the galleries said arthur looking up as eagerly and more openly than his uncle was doing and oh here comes the princessyes and lord edward and little lord richard with her  and here is the prince himself leaning on the earl of cambridge  uncle eustace lord edward is beckoning to me  may i run to him  come with me since i must present myself said eustace dismounting as one of the princes squires held his horse  and oh who is yonder darkbrowed dwarfish knight at the princes right hand cried arthur  eustace could scarcely believe his eyes as he looked where the boy pointed  the royal party were now seated in full array on their raised platform the prince upon his chair of state with more brightness in his eye and of vigour in his movements than when eustace had last seen him and at his side sat his wifeher features still retaining the majestic beauty of joan plantagenet the fair maid of kentbut worn and faded with anxiety  she watched her princely lord with an eye full of care and could scarcely spare attention for the lovely child who clung to her side and whose brilliantly fair complexion wavy flaxen hair high brow and perfectly formed though infantine features already promised that remarkable beauty which distinguished the countenance of richard ii  on the other side of the prince sat his sisterinlaw the countess of cambridge a spanish infanta and her husband edmund afterwards duke of york was beside the princess of wales  but more wonderful than all among them stood the constable of france  the two boys prince edward and his cousin henry of lancaster were stationed as pages on each side of the princess but as their playfellow arthur advanced with his uncle they both sprang down the steps of the gallery to meet him and each took a hand  edward however first bethinking himself of the respect which prince as he was he owed to a belted knight made his reverence to sir eustace who at a sign from the prince of wales mounted the steps and bent his knee to the ground before him  nay sir eustace said the prince bending forward it is rather i who should kneel to you for pardon i have used you ill eustace and i fear me transgressed the pledge which i gave to your brother on the plain of navaretta  oh say not so my gracious liege said eustace as tears gathered in his eyesit was but that your noble ear was deceived by the slanders of my foes  true sir eustaceyet once edward of england would not have heard a slanderous tale against one of his wellproved knights without sifting it well  but i am not as once i wassickness hath unnerved me and i fear me hath often led me to permit what may have dimmed my fame  who would have dared to tell me that i should suffer my castles to be made into traps for my faithful knights  and now sir eustace that i am about to repair my injustice towards you let me feel as a man whose account for this world must ere long be closed that i have your forgiveness  the prince took the hand of the young knight who struggled hard with his emotion  and here is another friend he addeda firmer friend though foe than you have found some others  well met my chivalrous godson said the constable du guesclin holding out his hand  i rejoice that my neighbour oliver did not put an end to your faits darmes  i marvel eustace hardly found words between wonder and condolence the prince caught the import of his hesitating sentences  he thinks you a prisoner sir bertrand he said  no sir eustace messire le connetable is captive only in his goodwill to you  i wrote to pray him to send me his witness to those last words of your brother since you had ever appealed to him and he replied by an offer which does us too much honour to become our guest  i am no scribe apart from my fairy dame tiphaine said du guesclin abruptly  it cost me less pains to ride hitherbesides that i longed to renew my old english acquaintances and see justice done to you fair godson  ha  sir bertrand thou recreantso no other spell drew thee hither thou hast no gallantry even for such an occasion as this said a gay voice  how should the illfavoured knight deal in gallantries said du guesclin turning  here is one far fitter for your graces eyes  and you discourteous constable were keeping him for you own behoof when all my maidens have been speaking for weeks of no name but the knight of the beleaguered castle  and eustace had to kiss the fair hand of the princess of wales  in the meantime the three boys were whispering together  it is all well all gloriously well is it not arthur as i told you said edward  i knew my father would settle all in his own noble fashion  what said the master of the damoiseaux  asked arthur as the sight of that severe functionary revived certain halfforgotten terrors  oh he the old crabstock said henryhe looked sour enough at first but edward kept your counsel well till you were safe at a good distance from bordeaux and then though he said somewhat of complaining to my lord the prince it was too late to mend it and when sir john chandos came back and bade him be content he vowed you were enough to spoil a whole host of pages but did not we all wish some of our uncles would get themselves betrayed  but what means all this preparation asked arthurthese lists oh surely there is not to be a tourney which i have so longed to see  no said edward that cannot be my mother says while my father is so weakly and ill  but there are the trumpets you will soon see what will befall  and with a loud blast of trumpets the gorgeously arrayed heralds rode into the court followed by a guard of halberdiers in the midst of whom rode a knight in bright armour his visor closed but his shield and crest marking the baron of clarenham  when the trumpets had ceased and the procession reached the centre of the lists they halted and drew up in orderthe principal herald aquitaine immediately in front of the prince  after another short clear trumpetblast aquitaine unrolled a parchment and in a loud voice proclaimed the confession of fulk baron of clarenham of his foul and unknightly conduct in attempting to betray the person of the good knight and true eustace lynwood knight banneret with that of his esquire gaston daubricour and of certain other trusty and wellbeloved subjects of his liege lord king edward of england together with the fortalice called chateau norbelle in the county of gascogne appertaining to my lord edward prince of wales and duke of aquitaine into the hands of the enemyhaving for that purpose tampered with and seduced thibault sanchez seneschal of the castle tristan de la fleche and certain others who having confessed their crime have received their deserts by being hung on a gallowsupon which same gallows it was decreed by the authority of the prince duke and governor of aquitaine that the shield of fulk de clarenham should be hunghe himself being degraded from the honours and privileges of knighthood of which he had proved himself unworthyand his lands forfeited to the king to be disposed of at his pleasure  clarenham was then compelled to dismount from his horse and to first one foot and then the other upon the block where a broad redfaced cook raising his cleaver cut off the golden spurs  sir john chandos as constable of aquitaine then came forward and taking the shield from the arm of clarenham gave it reversed into the hands of one of the heralds who carried it away  the belt another token of knighthood was next unbuckled and chandos taking the sword broke it in three pieces across his knee saying lie there dishonoured steel and throwing it down by the spurs lastly the helmet with the baronial bars across the visor was removed and thrown to the ground leaving visible the dark countenance where the paleness of shame and the flush of rage alternated  and now away with the traitor away with the recreant knight out upon him cried in a loud voice sir john chandos while the shout was taken up by a deafening multitude of voicesin the midst of which the degraded knight and landless baron made his way to the gate and as he passed out a redoubled storm of shouts and yells arose from without  out upon the traitor cried harry of lancaster with the loudest away with him  but edward and you too arthur why shout you not hate you not traitors and treason  i would not join my voice with the rabble said edward and it makes me sad to see knighthood fallen  what say you arthur  alas he is my mothers kinsman said arthur and i loved his name for her sake as for that of agnes too  where is agnes  in the convent of the benedictine nuns said edward  but in your ear arthur what say you to our plan that she shall be heiress of her brothers lands on condition of her weddingguess whom  not mine uncle  oh lord edward is it really so  how rejoiced old ralph would be  speak not of it arthurit was my mother who told me when agnes craved permission to go to the convent and i feared she would become one of those blackveiled nuns and i should never see her more  where is my uncle asked arthur gazing round  i thought he was standing by the lady princesss chair  he went to speak to sir john chandos but now said prince henry but i see him not  mark what a lull in the sounds without  in fact the various cries of execration which had assailed fulk clarenham on his exit from the gates of the castle after sounding more and more violent for some minutes had suddenly died away almost into stillnessand the cause was one little guessed at within the court the unhappy fulk was moving onwards almost as in a dream without aim or object other than to seek a refuge from the thousand eyes that marked his disgrace and the tongues that upbraided him with it but in leaving the court he entered upon a scene where danger as well as disgrace was to be apprehended  the rabble of the town ever pleased at the fall of one whose station was higher than their own mindful of unpaid debts and harsh and scornful demeanour and as natives rejoiced at the misfortune of a foreigner all joined in one cry ofaway with the recreant englishmandown with himdown with him every hand was armed with a stone and brief would have been fulks space for repentance had not the cry in its savage tones struck upon the ear of eustace as he stood in the lists receiving the congratulations of sir john chandos and of other knights who with changed demeanour came to greet the favoured hero  they will murder him exclaimed eustace and breaking from his new friends he made his way to the gate and hurried into the town just as fulk had fallen to the ground struck by a heavy stone hurled by the hand of no other than john ingram  he rushed forward amid the hail of stones and as he lifted clarenhams head called out how is this brave men of bordeaux would you become murderers  is this like honourable men to triumph over the fallen  they held back in amazement for a second then as eustace knelt by him and tried to recall his consciousness murmurs arose why interferes he with our affairs  he is english and they all held together another of the purseproud english who pay no debts and ruin the poor bordelais  his blood we will have if we cannot have his money away master knight be not so busy about the traitor if you would not partake his fate  eustace looked up as the stones were uplifted and more than one free companion had drawn his sword  hold he exclaimed in a clear fulltoned voice that filled every ear  hold i am eustace lynwood the castellane of chateau norbelle  there was an instant silence  every one pressed forward to see him whose recent adventures had made him an object of much interest and curiosity and the attention of the crowd was entirely diverted from the former unhappy subject of their pursuit  whispers passed of noble knight flower of chivalry how generous and christianlike he bends over his enemy  nay if he revenge not himself what right have we and see his arm is still in a scarf from the treachery of those villains  well i would yet give yon ruffian his desert  by this time eustace having observed ingram among the crowd summoned him to his side and at the same time courteously craving the aid of one of the bystanders who of course though collectively lions were individually lambs succeeded in conveying clarenham whose senses had so far returned that he was able to rise with their assistance to the door of a monastery chapel the porch of which opened upon the street  holy fathers said eustace i crave the protection of the church for an unhappy and i trust a penitent man praying you will tend him well to aid and relief alike of body and soul until you hear from me again  with these words he quitted the chapel before his late enemy had sufficiently recovered his faculties to recognize his preserver  leonard ashton for whom eustace inquired had it appeared saved himself by making full confession and had been sent home in deep disgrace though spared public dishonour  it was some few days after these events that the presence of lady agnes de clarenham was requested in the parlour of her nunnery which was some miles distant from bordeaux by a person who as the porteress informed her was the bearer of a message from the princess of wales she descended accordingly but her surprise was great on beholding instead of one of the female attendants of her mistress as she had expected the slender figure of the young knight with whom she had last parted at the hostelry  her first feeling was not one of kindness towards him  agnes had indeed grieved and felt indignant when she saw him oppressed and in danger from  her brothers treachery but in these days of favour she could not regard with complacency the cause of her brothers ruin and of the disgrace of her house  she started and would have retreated but that he prevented by saying in a tone which had in it more of sorrow than of any other feeling lady agnes i pray you to hear mefor you have much to forgive  forgive  nay sir eustace it is you who have so much to forgive my unhappy house  oh can you she added as the countenance and manner recalling long past days made her forget her displeasure can you tell me where the wretched one has shrouded his head from the shame which even i cannot but confess he has merited  i heard of the barof your brother this very morn said eustace from one of the good brethren of the convent where he has taken shelter the convent of the augustine friars of st mary they spoke of him as amended in health and though sorely dejected returning they hoped to a better spirit  thanks sir eustace even so do i hope and pray it may besince repentance is the only good which can yet be his  but tell me sir eustacefor vague rumours only reach us in this lonely cellwas it true that the populace pursued the fallen one with clamours and might even have slain him but for his rescue by a gallant knight who braved their utmost fury  it was even so lady said eustace with some embarrassment  oh who was that noblest of knights that i may name him in my most fervent prayers who has that strongest claim on the gratitude of the brokenhearted sister  nay lady it was but common duty the mere mercy of a christian man who could not see a fellowcreature die such a death without attempting to save him  oh sir eustace it is not like your former self to deny the greatness of a noble deed  i will not be robbed of my gratitude tell me the name of that most noble of men  he half smiled then looking down and colouring deeply do you remember lady agnes the knight whom you bound by a promise that in case of the triumph of his cause  eustace eustace  oh i should have known that nothing was too great and high for you that you would not disparage the nobleness of any other than yourself  oh how shall i ever render you my thanks  after such cruel treachery as that from which you have and i fear me are still suffering  alas alas that i should be forced to use such harsh words of my own brother  i trust you may still be comforted lady said eustace  from what the good fathers tell me there is hope that fulk may yet be an altered man and when the pilgrimage to the holy land which he has vowed is concluded may return in a holy temper  return but whither should he return said agnes in a broken despondent tonelandless homeless desolate outcast what shelter is open to him  for if the porteresss tale spoke truth his lands and manors are forfeited to the king  they are so in truth but there is one way agnes in which they may still be restored to their true owner  how so  what mean you sir eustace  agnes i would not have broken upon your sorrow by speaking thus abruptly but that the princes or rather the kings desire was urgent that the matter should be determined without loss of time to you in all justice does he will that the castles and manors of clarenham should descend but on one condition  agnes raised her eyes and while she slowly shook her head looked anxiously at him as he paused in considerable embarrassment  on condition that you lady agnes should permit the king and prince to dispose of your fair hand in marriage  agnes gave a slight cry and leant against the grate of the parlour oh that may never be andbut how advantageth that poor fulk  because lady agnesbecause it is to me that they would grant that hand which i have so long loved passionately and hopelessly agnes it was not willingly but at the command of the prince that i came hither with a suit which must seem to you most strangely timed from one who has been the most unwilling cause of so much misery to you whom from earliest years he has ever loved more than his own life  i know too that you cannot endure to rise on the ruin of your brother nor could i bear to feel that i was living on the lands of a kinsman and neighbour whose overthrow i had wrought  but see you not that jointly we can do what we never could do separately that the condition fulfilled we could kneel before king edward and entreat for the pardon and restoration of fulk which to such prayers he would surely grant  agnes tears were gathering fast and she spoke in a broken voice as she said eustace you are the  most generous of knights and then ashamed of having said so much covered her face with her veil and turned away  eustace stood watching her with his soul in his eyes but before either had summoned courage to break the silence the porteress came hurrying in good lack good lack if ever my eyes saw the likehere is the princess of wales herself at the gate and all her trainwhere is sister katherine where is the mother abbess alas alas that nought should be ready to receive her  oh and i have mislaid the key of the great gate while the good woman was bustling on in her career eustace had time to say yea agnes the princess is come in case you hear my suit favourably to conduct you back to bordeaux  think of a true and devoted heart think of fulk ere you decide  as he spoke the whole train of blackveiled nuns came sweeping into the parlour whence agnes hastily escaped to collect her thoughts during the few instants before she could be summoned to attend the princess while eustace walked into the convent court which was by this time filled by the gay party which accompanied the princess  agnes quickly gained her cell and sank down on her bed to make the most of the minutes that might be her own  never probably had lady shorter time in which to decide or did it seem more impossible to come to a resolution but agnes had known eustace all her life had never met one whom she thought his equal found him raised a thousandfold in her estimation by the events of the day and could not bear to think of disappointing the hopes which had lighted up that bright eye and animated that whole face  then too why by her act completely ruin her brother  the thoughts flashed through her mind in rapid succession and she did not rise with much reluctance when called to meet the princess though longing for more time which after all would but have enabled her to harass herself more  well my gentle agnes said the princess what say you  come you back to the court where my boys are wearing for their playfellow hasten then sweet maiden for i promised little edward to bring you back and i know not how to face his wrath if you come not  agnes still almost dreaming offered no opposition but allowed her dress to be arranged took leave of the abbess and her nuns and shortly found herself she scarcely knew how mounted on her palfrey in the princesss train with sir eustace lynwood at her side  and old ralph penrose was one of the happiest of mankind when he beheld his pupil return the first knight in the countythe honoured of the prince  for the next seven years the clarenham vassals rejoiced in the gentle noble and firm rule of their new lord and lady yet it was remarked with some surprise that the title of baron of clarenham was dropped and that sir eustace and dame agnes lynwood instead of living at their principal castle took up their abode at a small manor which had descended to the lady from her mother while the castle was placed under the charge of gaston daubricour beneath whose care the fortifications assumed a more modern character and the garrison learnt the newest fashions of handling their weapons  at the end of that time sir eustace and his lady travelled to the court where alas of all the royal party who had rejoiced at their marriage they found only the young king richard ii and his mother the princess joanna once the fair maid of kent but now sadly aged by time and sorrow who received kindly though tearfully those who reminded her of those last bright days of her life at bordeaux and readily promised to forward their request at the council where alas she said shaking her head lord henry of lancaster now earl of bolingbroke too often loved to oppose her and her son  no one at the council could refuse thought the amazement of all was great when the request was made known that king richard would be pleased to reinstate in his titles lands and manors fulk late baron of clarenham in consideration of his good services to christendom rendered on the coast of africa under the banner of the knights of st john whose grand master attested his courage and faithfulness  soon clarenham castle opened its gates to receive its humbled repentant and muchchanged lord who was welcomed by all the gentle blood in the countyat the head of whom rode sir eustace with his squire and his nephew arthur now a gallant young man only waiting the summons promised him by the princess to receive knighthood at the same time as his royal master richard ii
