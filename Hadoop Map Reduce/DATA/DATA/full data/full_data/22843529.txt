danced around him in numbers     tommy and grizel       part i     chapter i  how tommy found a way   op pym the colossal pym that vast and rolling figure who never knew what he was to write about until he dipped grandly an author in such demand that on the foggy evening which starts our story his publishers have had his boots removed lest he slip thoughtlessly round the corner before his work is done as was the great mans wayshall we begin with him or with tommy who has just arrived in london carrying his little box and leading a lady by the hand it was pym as we are about to see who in the beginning held tommy up to the public gaze pym who first noticed his remarkable indifference to female society pym who gave himbut alack does no one remember pym for himself is the king of the penny number already no more than a button that once upon a time kept tommys person together and we are at the night when they first met let us hasten into marylebone before little tommy arrives and pym is swallowed like an oyster  this is the house 22 little owlet street marylebone but which were his rooms it is less easy to determine for he was a lodger who flitted placidly from floor to floor according to the state of his finances carrying his apparel and other belongings in one great armful and spilling by the way on this particular evening he was on the second floor front which had a fireplace in the corner furniture all his landladys and mostly horsehair little to suggest his calling save a noble saucerful of ink and nothing to draw attention from pym who lolled gross and massive on a sofa one leg over the back of it the other drooping his arms extended and his pipe which he could find nowhere thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat an agreeable piperack he wore a yellow dressinggown or could scarcely be said to wear it for such of it as was not round his neck he had converted into a cushion for his head which is perhaps the part of him we should have turned to first it was a big round head the plentiful gray hair in tangles possibly because in pyms last flitting the comb had dropped over the banisters the features were ugly and beyond lifesize yet the forehead had altered little except in colour since the day when he was near being made a fellow of his college there was sensitiveness left in the thick nose humour in the eyes though they so often watered the face had gone to flabbiness at last but not without some lines and dents as if the head had resisted the body for a space before the whole man rolled contentedly downhill  he had no beard young man let your beard grow those who have forgotten all else about pym may recall him in these words they were his one counsel to literary aspirants who according as they took it are now bearded and prosperous or shaven and on the rates to shave costs threepence another threepence for loss of timenearly ten pounds a year three hundred pounds since pyms chin first bristled with his beard he could have bought an annuity or a cottage in the country he could have had a wife and children and driven his dogcart and been made a churchwarden all gone all shaved and for what when he asked this question he would move his hand across his chin with a sigh and so bravely to the barbers  pym was at present suffering from an ailment that had spread him out on that sofa again and againacute disinclination to work  meanwhile all the world was waiting for his new tale so the publishers two little round men have told him they have blustered they have fawned they have asked each other out to talk it over behind the door  has he any idea of what the story is to be about  he has no idea  then at least pymexcellent pymsit down and dip and let us see what will happen  he declined to do even that while all the world waited this was pyms ultimatum  i shall begin the damned thing at eight oclock  outside the fog kept changing at intervals from black to white as lazily from white to black the monster blinking there was not a sound from the street save of pedestrians tapping with their sticks on the pavement as they moved forward warily afraid of an embrace with the unknown it might have been a city of blind beggars one of them a boy  at eight oclock pym rose with a groan and sat down in his stockingsoles to write his delicious tale he was now alone but though his legs were wound round his wastepaper basket and he dipped often and loudly in the saucer like one ringing at the door of fancy he could not get the idea that would set him going he was still dipping for inspiration when t sandys who had been told to find the second floor for himself knocked at the door and entered quaking  i remember it vividly pym used to say when questioned in the after years about this his first sight of tommy and i hesitate to decide which impressed me more the richness of his voice so remarkable in a boy of sixteen or his serene countenance with its noble forehead behind which nothing base could lurk  pym pym it is such as you that makes the writing of biography difficult the richness of tommys voice could not have struck you for at that time it was a somewhat squeaky voice and as for the noble forehead behind which nothing base could lurk how could you say that pym you who had a noble forehead yourself  no all that pym saw was a pastyfaced boy sixteen years old and of an appearance mysteriously plain hair light brown and waving defiance to the brush nothing startling about him but the expression of his face which was almost fearsomely solemn and apparently unchangeable he wore his sunday blacks of which the trousers might with advantage have borrowed from the sleeves and he was so nervous that he had to wet his lips before he could speak he had left the door ajar for a private reason but pym misunderstanding thought he did it to fly the more readily if anything was flung at him and so concluded that he must be a printers devil  pym had a voice that shook his mantelpiece ornaments he was all on the same scale as his inkpot your christian name boy he roared hopefully for it was thus he sometimes got the idea that started him  thomas replied the boy  pym gave him a look of disgust you may go he said but when he looked up presently thomas was still there he was not only there but whistlinga short encouraging whistle that seemed to be directed at the door he stopped quickly when pym looked up but during the remainder of the interview he emitted this whistle at intervals always with that anxious glance at his friend the door and its strained joviality was in odd contrast with his solemn face like a cheery tune played on the church organ  begone cried pym  my full name explained tommy who was speaking the english correctly but with a scots accent is thomas sandys and fine you know who that is he added exasperated by pyms indifference im the t sandys that answered your advertisement  pym knew who he was now you young ruffian he gasped i never dreamt that you would come  i have your letter engaging me in my pocket said tommy boldly and he laid it on the table pym surveyed it and him in comic dismay then with a sudden thought produced nearly a dozen letters from a drawer and dumped them down beside the other it was now his turn to look triumphant and tommy aghast  pyms letters were all addressed from the dubb of prosen farm near thrums nb to different advertisers care of a london agency and were tommys answers to the wants in a london newspaper which had found its way to the far north x y z was in need of a chemists assistant and from his earliest years said one of the letters chemistry had been the study of studies for t sandys he was glad to read was t sandys that one who did not object to long hours would be preferred for it seemed to him that those who objected to long hours did not really love their work their heart was not in it and only where the heart is can the treasure be found  123 had a vacancy for a pageboy glasgow man for a photographer pageboy must not be over fourteen photographer must not be under twenty i am a little over fourteen but i look less wrote t sandys to 123 i am a little under twenty he wrote to glasgow man but i look more his heart was in the work  to be a political organizer if h and h who advertised for one only knew how eagerly the undersigned desired to devote his life to political organizing  in answer to scholastics advertisement for janitor in a boys school t sandys begged to submit his name for consideration  undoubtedly the noblest letter was the one applying for the secretaryship of a charitable society salary to begin at once but the candidate selected must deposit one hundred pounds the application was noble in its offer to make the work a labour of love and almost nobler in its argument that the hundred pounds was unnecessary  rex had a vacancy in his drapery department t sandys had made a unique study of drapery  lastly anon wanted an amanuensis salary said anon who seemed to be a humourist salary large but uncertain he added with equal candour drudgery great but to an intelligent man the pickings may be considerable pickings is there a finer word in the language t sandys had felt that he was particularly good at pickings but amanuensis the thing was unknown to him no one on the farm could tell him what it was but never mind his heart was in it  all this correspondence had produced one reply the letter on which tommys hand still rested it was a brief note signed op pym and engaging mr sandys on his own recommendation if he really felt quite certain that his heart treasure included was in the work so far good tommy had thought when he received this answer but there was nothing in it to indicate the nature of the work nothing to show whether op pym was scholastic or 123 or rex or any other advertiser in particular stop there was a postscript i need not go into details about your duties as you assure me you are so well acquainted with them but before you join me please send in writing a full statement of what you think they are  there were delicate reasons why mr sandys could not do that but oh he was anxious to be done with farm labour so he decided to pack and risk it the letter said plainly that he was engaged what for he must find out slyly when he came to london so he had put his letter firmly on pyms table but it was a staggerer to find that gentleman in possession of the others  one of these was pyms by right the remainder were a humourous gift from the agent who was accustomed to sift the correspondence of his clients pym had chuckled over them and written a reply that he flattered himself would stump the boy then he had unexpectedly come into funds he found a forgotten check while searching his old pockets for tobaccocrumbs and in that glory t sandys escaped his memory result that they were now face to face  a tiny red spot not noticeable before now appeared in tommys eyes it was never there except when he was determined to have his way pym my friend yes and everyone of you who is destined to challenge tommy ware that red light  well which am i demanded pym almost amused tommy was so obviously in a struggle with the problem  the saucer and the blank pages told nothing whichever you are the boy answered heavily its not herding nor foddering cattle and so long as its not that ill put my heart in it and where the heart is there the treasure  he suddenly remembered that his host must be acquainted with the sentiment  easygoing pym laughed then said irritably of what use could a mere boy be to me  then its not the pageboy exclaimed tommy thankfully  perhaps i am scholastic suggested pym  no said tommy after a long study of his face  pym followed this reasoning and said touchily many a schoolmaster has a red face  not that kind of redness explained tommy without delicacy  i am h and h said pym  you forget you wrote to me as one person replied tommy  so i did that was because i am the chemist and i must ask you thomas for your certificate  tommy believed him this time and pym triumphantly poured himself a glass of whisky spilling some of it on his dressinggown  not you said tommy quickly a chemist has a steady hand  confound you cried pym what sort of a boy is this  if you had been the draper you would have wiped the drink off your gown continued tommy thoughtfully and if you had been glasgow man you would have sucked it off and if you had been the charitable society you wouldnt swear in company he flung out his hand ill tell you who you are he said sternly youre anon  under this broadside pym succumbed he sat down feebly right he said with a humourous groan and i shall tell you who you are i am afraid you are my amanuensis  tommy immediately whistled a louder and more glorious note than before  dont be so cocky cried pym in sudden rebellion you are only my amanuensis if you can tell me what that is if you cantout you go  he had him at last  not he  an amanuensis said tommy calmly is one who writes to dictation am i to bring in my box its at the door  this made pym sit down again you didnt know what an amanuensis was when you answered my advertisement he said  as soon as i got to london tommy answered i went into a booksellers shop pretending i wanted to buy a dictionary and i looked the word up  bring in your box pym said with a groan  but it was now tommys turn to hesitate have you noticed he asked awkwardly that i sometimes whistle  dont tell me said pym that you have a dog out there  its not a dog tommy replied cautiously  pym had resumed his seat at the table and was once more toying with his pen open the door he commanded and let me see what you have brought with you  tommy obeyed gingerly and then pym gaped for what the open door revealed to him was a tiny roped box with a girl of twelve sitting on it she was dressed in some dullcoloured wincey and looked cold and patient and lonely and as she saw the big man staring at her she struggled in alarm to her feet and could scarce stand on them tommy was looking apprehensively from her to pym  good god boy roared pym are you married  no cried tommy in agony shes my sister and were orphans and did you think i could have the heart to leave elspeth behind he took her stoutly by the hand  and he never will marry said little elspeth almost fiercely will you tommy  never said tommy patting her and glaring at pym  but pym would not have it married he shouted magnificent and he dipped exultantly for he had got his idea at last forgetting even that he had an amanuensis he wrote on and on and on  he smells o drink elspeth whispered  all the better replied tommy cheerily make yourself at home elspeth hes the kind i can manage was there ever a kind i couldna manage he whispered topheavy with conceit  there was grizel elspeth said rather thoughtlessly and then tommy frowned     chapter ii  the search for the treasure   six years afterwards tommy was a famous man as i hope you do not need to be told but you may be wondering how it came about the whole question in pyms words resolves itself into how the solemn little devil got to know so much about women it made the world marvel when they learned his age but no one was quite so staggered as pym who had seen him daily for all those years and been damning him for his indifference to the sex during the greater part of them  it began while he was still no more than an amanuensis sitting with his feet in the wastepaper basket pym dictating from the sofa and swearing when the words would not come unless he was perpendicular among the duties of this amanuensis was to remember the name of the heroine her appearance and other personal details for pym constantly forgot them in the night and he had to go searching back through his pages for them cursing her so horribly that tommy signed to elspeth to retire to her tiny bedroom at the top of the house he was always most careful of elspeth and with the first pound he earned he insured his life leaving all to her but told her nothing about it lest she should think it meant his early death as she grew older he also got good dull books for her from a library and gave her a piano on the hire system and taught her many things about life very carefully selected from his own discoveries  elspeth out of the way he could give pym all the information wanted her name is felicity he would say at the right moment she has curly brown hair in which the sun strays and a blushing neck and her eyes are like blue lakes  height roared pym have i mentioned it  no but she is about five feet six  how the  could you know that  you tell percys height in his stockingsoles and when she reached to his mouth and kissed him she had to stand on her tiptoes so to do  tommy said this in a most businesslike tone but could not help smacking his lips he smacked them again when he had to write have no fear little woman i am by your side or what a sweet child you are  pym had probably fallen into the way of making the percys revel in such epithets because he could not remember the girls name but this delicious use of the diminutive as addressed to fullgrown ladies went to tommys head his solemn face kept his secret but he had some narrow escapes as once when saying goodnight to elspeth he kissed her on mouth eyes nose and ears and said shall i tuck you in little woman he came to himself with a start  i forgot he said hurriedly and got out of the room without telling her what he had forgotten  pyms publishers knew their man and their arrangement with him was that he was paid on completion of the tale but always before he reached the middle he struck for what they called his honorarium and this troubled them for the tale was appearing week by week as it was written if they were obdurate he suddenly concluded his story in such words as these  several years have passed since these events took place and the scene changes to a lovely garden by the bank of old father thames a young man sits by the softflowing stream and he is calm as the scene itself for the storm has passed away and percy for it is no other has found an anchorage as he sits musing over the past felicity steals out by the french window and puts her soft arms around his neck my little wife he murmurs the endunless you pay up by messenger  this last line which was not meant for the world but little would pym have cared though it had been printed usually brought his employers to their knees and then as tommy advanced in experience came the pickingsfor pym with money in his pockets had important engagements round the corner and risked intrusting his amanuensis with the writing of the next instalment all except the bang at the end  smaller people in tommys state of mind would have hurried straight to the lovepassages but he saw the danger and forced his pegasus away from them do your days toil first he may be conceived saying to that animal and at evenfall i shall let you out to browse so with this reward in front he devoted many pages to the dreary adventures of pretentious males and even found a certain pleasure in keeping the lady waiting but as soon as he reached her he lost his head again  oh you beauty oh you small pet he said to himself with solemn transport  as the artist in him was stirred great problems presented themselves for instance in certain circumstances was darling or little one the better phrase darling in solitary grandeur is more pregnant of meaning than little one but little has a flavour of the patronizing which darling perhaps lacks he wasted many sheets over such questions but they were in his pocket when pym or elspeth opened the door it is wonderful how much you can conceal between the touch on the handle and the opening of the door if your heart is in it  despite this fine practice however he was the shyest of mankind in the presence of women and this shyness grew upon him with the years was it because he never tried to uncork himself oh no it was about this time that he one day put his arm round clara the servantnot passionately but with deliberation as if he were making an experiment with machinery he then listened as if to hear clara ticking he wrote an admirable loveletterwarm dignified sincereto nobody in particular and carried it about in his pocket in readiness but in lovemaking as in the other arts those do it best who cannot tell how it is done and he was always stricken with a palsy when about to present that letter it seemed that he was only able to speak to ladies when they were not there well if he could not speak he thought the more he thought so profoundly that in time the heroines of pym ceased to thrill him  this was because he had found out that they were not flesh and blood but he did not delight in his discovery it horrified him for what he wanted was the old thrill to make them human so that they could be his little friends againnothing less was called for this meant slaughter here and there of the great pyms brainwork and tommy tried to keep his hands off but his heart was in it in pyms pages the ladies were the most virtuous and proper of their sex though dreadfully persecuted but he merely told you so at the beginning and now and again afterwards to fill up and then allowed them to act with what may be called rashness so that the story did not really suffer before tommy was nineteen he changed all that out went this because she would not have done it and that because she could not have done it fathers might now have taken a lesson from t sandys in the upbringing of their daughters he even sternly struck out the diminutives with a pen in his hand and woman in his head he had such noble thoughts that his tears of exaltation damped the pages as he wrote and the ladies must have been astounded as well as proud to see what they were turning into  that was tommy with a pen in his hand and a handkerchief hard by but it was another tommy who when the finest bursts were over sat back in his chair and mused the lady was consistent now and he would think about her and think and think until concentration which is a pair of blazing eyes seemed to draw her out of the pages to his side and then he and she sported in a way forbidden in the tale while he sat there with eyes riveted he had her to dinner at a restaurant and took her up the river and called her little woman and when she held up her mouth he said tantalizingly that she must wait until he had finished his cigar this queer delight enjoyed back he popped her into the story where she was again the vehicle for such glorious sentiments that elspeth to whom he read the best of them feared he was becoming too good to live  in the meantime the great penny public were slowly growing restive and at last the two little round men called on pym to complain that he was falling off and pym turned them out of doors and then sat down heroically to do what he had not done for two decadesto read his latest work  elspeth go upstairs to your room whispered tommy and then he folded his arms proudly he should have been in a tremble but latterly he had often felt that he must burst if he did not soon read some of his bits to pym more especially the passages about the hereafter also the opening of chapter seventeen  at first pyms only comment was it is the same old drivel as before what more can they want  but presently he looked up puzzled is this chapter yours or mine he demanded  it is about half and half said tommy  is mine the first half where does yours begin  that is not exactly what i mean explained tommy in a glow but backing a little you wrote that chapter first and then ii  you rewrote it roared pym you dared to meddle with he was speechless with fury  i tried to keep my hand off tommy said with dignity but the thing had to be done and they are human now  human who wants them to be human the fiends seize you boy you have even been tinkering with my heroines personal appearance what is this you have been doing to her nose  i turned it up slightly thats all said tommy  i like them down roared pym  i prefer them up said tommy stiffly  where cried pym turning over the leaves in a panic where is the scene in the burning house  its out tommy explained but there is a chapter in its place aboutits mostly about the beauty of the soul being everything and mere physical beauty nothing oh mr pym sit down and let me read it to you  but pym read it and a great deal more for himself no wonder he stormed for the impossible had been made not only consistent but unreadable the plot was lost for chapters the characters no longer did anything and then went and did something else you were told instead how they did it you were not allowed to make up your own mind about them you had to listen to the mind of t sandys he described and he analyzed the road he had tried to clear through the thicket was impassable for chips  a few more weeks of this said pym and we should all three be turned out into the streets  tommy went to bed in an agony of mortification but presently to his side came pym  where did you copy this from he asked it is when we are thinking of those we love that our noblest thoughts come to us and the more worthy they are of our love the nobler the thought hence it is that no one has done the greatest work who did not love god  i copied it from nowhere replied tommy fiercely its my own  well it has nothing to do with the story and so is only a blot on it and i have no doubt the thing has been said much better before still i suppose it is true  its true said tommy and yet  go on i want to know all about it  and yet tommy said puzzled ive known noble thoughts come to me when i was listening to a brass band  pym chuckled funny things noble thoughts he agreed he read another passage  it was the last halfhour of day when i was admitted with several others to look upon my friends dead face a handkerchief had been laid over it i raised the handkerchief i know not what the others were thinking but the last time we met he had told me something it was not muchonly that no woman had ever kissed him it seemed to me that as i gazed the wistfulness came back to his face i whispered to a woman who was present and stooping over him she was about tobut her eyes were dry and i stopped her the handkerchief was replaced and all left the room save myself again i raised the handkerchief i cannot tell you how innocent he looked  who was he asked pym  nobody said tommy with some awe it just came to me do you notice how simple the wording is it took me some time to make it so simple  you are just nineteen i think  yes  pym looked at him wonderingly  thomas he said you are a very queer little devil  he also said and it is possible you may find the treasure you are always talking about dont jump to the ceiling my friend because i say that i was once after the treasure myself and you can see whether i found it  from about that time on the chances that this mysterious treasure might spring up in the form of a new kind of flower pym zealously cultivated the ground and tommy had an industrious time of it he was taken off his stories which at once regained their elasticity and put on to exercises  if you have nothing to say on the subject say nothing was one of the new rules which few would have expected from pym another was as soon as you can say what you think and not what some other person has thought for you you are on the way to being a remarkable man  without concentration thomas you are lost concentrate though your coattails be on fire  try your hand at description and when you have done chortling over the result reduce the whole by half without missing anything out  analyze your characters and their motives at the prodigious length in which you revel and then my sonny cut your analysis out it is for your own guidance not the readers  i have often noticed you are always saying the story has nothing to do with you obliterate yourself i see that will be your stiffest job  stop preaching it seems to me the pulpit is where you should look for the treasure nineteen and you are already as didactic as seventy  and so on  over his exercises tommy was now engrossed for so long a period that as he sits there you may observe his legs slowly lengthening and the coming of his beard no his legs lengthened as he sat with his feet in the basket but i feel sure that his beard burst through prematurely some night when he was thinking too hard about the ladies  there were no ladies in the exercises for despite their altercation about noses pym knew that on this subject tommys mind was a blank but he recognized the sexs importance and becoming possessed once more of a black coat marched his pupil into the somewhat shoddy drawingrooms that were still open to him and there ordered tommy to be fascinated for his future good but it was as it had always been tommy sat white and speechless and apparently bored could not even say you sing with so much expression when the lady at the pianoforte had finished  shyness i could pardon the exasperated pym would roar but want of interest is almost immoral at your age the blood would have been coursing through my veins love you are incapable of it there is not a drop of sentiment in your frozen carcass  can i help that growled tommy it was an agony to him even to speak about women  if you cant said pym all is over with you an artist without sentiment is a painter without colours young man i fear you are doomed  and tommy believed him and quaked he had the most gallant struggles with himself he even set his teeth and joined a dancingclass though neither pym nor elspeth knew of it and it never showed afterwards in his legs in appearance he was now beginning to be the sandys of the photographs a little over the middle height and rather heavily built nothing to make you uncomfortable until you saw his face that solemn countenance never responded when he laughed and stood coldly by when he was on fire he might have winked for an eternity and still the onlooker must have thought himself mistaken in his boyhood the mask had descended scarce below his mouth for there was a dimple in the chin to put you at ease but now the short brown beard had come and he was for ever hidden from the world  he had the dandys tastes for superb neckties velvet jackets and he got the ties instead of dining he panted for the jacket knew all the shopwindows it was in but for years denied himself with a moan so that he might buy pretty things for elspeth when eventually he got it pyms friends ridiculed him when he saw how ill his face matched it he ridiculed himself often when tommy was feeling that now at last the ladies must come to heel he saw his face suddenly in a mirror and all the spirit went out of him but still he clung to his velvet jacket  i see him in it stalking through the terrible dances a heroic figure at last he shuddered every time he found himself on one leg he got sternly into everybodys way he was the butt of the little noodle of an instructor all the social tortures he endured grimly in the hope that at last the cork would come out then though there were all kinds of girls in the class merry sentimental practical coquettish prudes there was no kind he felt whose heart he could not touch in lovemaking as in the favourite thrums game of the dambrod there are sixtyone openings and he knew them all yet at the last dance as at the first the universal opinion of his partners shopgirls mostly from the large millinery establishments who had to fly like cinderellas when the clock struck a certain hour was that he kept himself to himself and they were too much the lady to make up to a gentleman who so obviously did not want them  pym encouraged his friends to jeer at tommys want of interest in the sex thinking it a way of goading him to action one evening the bottles circulating they mentioned one dolly goddess at some bar as a fit instructress for him coarse pleasantries passed but for a time he writhed in silence then burst upon them indignantly for their unmanly smirching of a womans character and swept out leaving them a little ashamed that was very like tommy  but presently a desire came over him to see this girl and it came because they had hinted such dark things about her that was like him also  there was probably no harm in dolly though it is mans proud right to question it in exchange for his bitters she was tall and willowy and stretched her neck like a swan and returned you your change with disdainful languor to call such a haughty beauty dolly was one of the minor triumphs for man and dolly they all called her except the only one who could have given an artistic justification for it  this one was a bearded stranger who when he knew that pym and his friends were elsewhere would enter the bar with a cigar in his mouth and ask for a whiskyandwater which was heroism again for smoking was ever detestable to him and whisky more offensive than quinine but these things are expected of you and by asking for the whisky you get into talk with dolly that is to say you tell her several times what you want and when she has served every other body you get it the commercial must be served first in the barroom he blocks the way like royalty in the street there is a crown for us all somewhere  dolly seldom heard the bearded ones goodevening she could not possibly have heard the dear for though it was there it remained behind his teeth she knew him only as the stiff man who got separated from his glass without complaining and at first she put this down to forgetfulness and did nothing so that he could go away without drinking but by and by wherever he left his tumbler cunningly concealed behind a waterbottle or temptingly in front of a commercial she restored it to him and there was a twinkle in her eye  you little rogue so you see through me surely it was an easy thing to say but what he did say was thank you then to himself he said ass ass ass  sitting on the padded seat that ran the length of the room and surreptitiously breaking his cigar against the cushions to help it on its way to an end he brought his intellect to bear on dolly at a distance and soon had a better knowledge of her than could be claimed by those who had dollied her for years he also wove romances about her some of them of too lively a character and others so noble and sad and beautiful that the tears came to his eyes and dolly thought he had been drinking he could not have said whether he would prefer her to be good or bad  these were but his leisure moments for during the long working hours he was still at the exercises toiling fondly and right willing to tear himself asunder to get at the trick of writing so he passed from exercises to the grand experiment  it was to be a tale for there they had taken for granted lay the treasure pym was most considerate at this time and mentioned woman with an apology  i have kept away from them in the exercises he said in effect because it would have been useless as well as cruel to force you to labour on a subject so uncongenial to you and for the same reason i have decided that it is to be a tale of adventure in which the heroine need be little more than a beautiful sack of coals which your cavalier carries about with him on his left shoulder i am afraid we must have her to that extent thomas but i am not asking much of you dump her down as often as you like  and thomas did his dogged best the red light in his eye though he had not and never could have had the smallest instinct for storywriting he knew to the fingertips how it is done but for ever he would have gone on breaking all the rules of the game how he wrestled with himself sublime thoughts came to him nearly all about that girl and he drove them away for he knew they beat only against the march of his story and whatever befall the story must march relentlessly he followed in the track of his men pushing the dreary dogs on to deeds of valour he tried making the lady human and then she would not march she sat still and he talked about her he dumped her down and soon he was yawning this weariness was what alarmed him most for well he understood that there could be no treasure where the work was not engrossing play and he doubted no more than pym that for him the treasure was in the tale or nowhere had he not been sharpening his tools in this belief for years strange to reflect now that all the time he was hacking and sweating at that novel the last he ever attempted it was only marching towards the wastepaper basket  he had a fine capacity as has been hinted for selfdeception and in time of course he found a way of dodging the disquieting truth this equally of course was by yielding to his impulses he allowed himself an hour a day when pym was absent in which he wrote the story as it seemed to want to write itself and then he cut this piece out which could be done quite easily as it consisted only of moralizings thus was his day brightened and with this relaxation to look forward to be plodded on at his proper work delving so hard that he could avoid asking himself why he was still delving what shall we say he was digging for the treasure in an orchard and every now and again he came out of his hole to pluck an apple but though the apple was so sweet to the mouth it never struck him that the treasure might be growing overhead at first he destroyed the fruit of his stolen hour and even after he took to carrying it about fondly in his pocket and to rewriting it in a splendid new form that had come to him just as he was stepping into bed he continued to conceal it from his overseers eyes and still he thought all was over with him when pym said the story did not march  it is a dead thing pym would roar flinging down the manuscripta dead thing because the stakes your man is playing for a womans love is less than a wooden counter to you you are a fine piece of mechanism my solemnfaced don but you are a watch that wont go because you are not wound up nobody can wind the artist up except a chit of a girl and how you are ever to get one to take pity on you only the gods who look after men with a want can tell  it becomes more impenetrable every day he said no use your sitting there tearing yourself to bits out into the street with you i suspend these sittings until you can tell me you have kissed a girl  he was still saying this sort of thing when the famous letters were publishedt sandys author letters to a young man about to be married was the full title and another almost as applicable would have been bits cut out of a story because they prevented its marching if you have any memory you do not need to be told how that splendid study so ennobling so penetrating of woman at her best took the town tommy woke a famous man and except elspeth no one was more pleased than bighearted hopeless bleary pym  but how the  has it all come about he kept roaring  a woman can be anything that the man who loves her would have her be says the letters and oh said woman everywhere if all men had the same idea of us as mr sandys  to meet mr t sandys leaders of society wrote it on their invitation cards their daughters athirst for a new sensation thrilled at the thought will he talk to us as nobly as he writes and oh how willing he was to do it especially if their noses were slightly tilted     chapter iii  sandys on woman   can you kindly tell me the name of the book i want  it is the commonest question asked at the circulating library by dainty ladies just out of the carriage and the librarian after looking them over can usually tell in the days we have now to speak of however he answered without looking them over  sandyss letters  ah yes of course may i have it please  i regret to find that it is out  then the lady looked naughty why dont you have two copies she pouted  madam said the librarian we have a thousand  a small and very timid girl of eighteen with a neat figure that shrank from observation although it was already aware that it looked best in gray was there to drink in this music and carried it home in her heart she was elspeth and that dear heart was almost too full at this time i hesitate whether to tell or to conceal how it even created a disturbance in no less a place than the house of commons she was there with mrs jerry and the thing was recorded in the papers of the period in these blasting words the home secretary was understood to be quoting a passage from letters to a young man but we failed to catch its drift owing to an unseemly interruption from the ladies gallery  but what was it you cried out tommy asked elspeth when she thought she had told him everything like all true women she always began in the middle  oh tommy have i not told you i cried out im his sister  thus owing to elspeths behaviour it can never be known which was the passage quoted in the house but we may be sure of one thingthat it did the house good that book did everybody good even pym could only throw off its beneficent effects by a tremendous effort and young men about to be married used to ask at the bookshops not for the letters but simply for sandys on woman acknowledging tommy as the authority on the subject like mill on jurisprudence or thomson and tait on the differential calculus controversies raged about it some thought he asked too much of man some thought he saw too much in women there was a fear that young people knowing at last how far short they fell of what they ought to be might shrink from the matrimony that must expose them to each other now that they had sandys to guide them and the persons who had simply married and risked it and it was astounding what a number of them there proved to be wrote to the papers suggesting that he might yield a little in the next edition but sandys remained firm  at first they took for granted that he was a very aged gentleman he had indeed hinted at this in the text and when the truth came out and just fancy he is not even married the enthusiasm was doubled not engaged they cried dont tell that to me no unmarried man could have written such a eulogy of marriage without being on the brink of it perhaps she was dead it ran through the town that she was dead some knew which cemetery  the very first lady mr sandys ever took in to dinner mentioned this rumour to him not with vulgar curiosity but delicately with a hint of sympathy in waiting and it must be remembered in fairness to tommy that all artists love sympathy this sympathy uncorked him and our tommy could flow comparatively freely at last observe the delicious change  has that story got abroad he said simply the matter is one which i need not say i have never mentioned to a soul  of course not the lady said and waited eagerly  if tommy had been an expert he might have turned the conversation to brighter topics but he was not there had already been long pauses and in dinner talk it is perhaps allowable to fling on any faggot rather than let the fire go out it is odd that i should be talking of it now he said musingly  i suppose she said gently to bring him out of the reverie into which he had sunk i suppose it happened some time ago  long long ago he answered having written as an aged person he often found difficulty in remembering suddenly that he was two and twenty  but you are still a very young man  it seems long ago to me he said with a sigh  was she beautiful  she was beautiful to my eyes  and as good i am sure as she was beautiful  ah me said tommy  his confidante was burning to know more and hoping they were being observed across the table but she was a kind sentimental creature though stout or because of it and she said i am so afraid that my questions pain you  no no said tommy who was very very happy  was it very sudden  fever  ah but i meant your attachment  we met and we loved he said with gentle dignity  that is the true way said the lady  it is the only way he said decisively  mr sandys you have been so good i wonder if you would tell me her name  felicity he said with emotion presently he looked up it is very strange to me he said wonderingly to find myself saying these things to you who an hour ago were a complete stranger to me but you are not like other women  no indeed said the lady warmly  that he said must be why i tell you what i have never told to another human being how mysterious are the workings of the heart  mr sandys said the lady quite carried away no words of mine can convey to you the pride with which i hear you say that be assured that i shall respect your confidences she missed his next remark because she was wondering whether she dare ask him to come to dinner on the twentyfifth and then the ladies had to retire and by the time he rejoined her he was as tonguetied as at the beginning the cork had not been extracted it had been knocked into the bottle where it still often barred the way and there was always as we shall see a flavour of it in the wine  you will get over it yet the summer and the flowers will come to you again she managed to whisper to him kindheartedly as she was going  thank you he said with that inscrutable face it was far from his design to play a part he had indeed had no design at all but an opportunity for sentiment having presented itself his mouth had opened as at a cherry he did not laugh afterwards even when he reflected how unexpectedly felicity had come into his life he thought of her rather with affectionate regard and pictured her as a tall slim girl in white when he took a tall slim girl in white in to dinner he could not help saying huskily  you remind me of one who was a very dear friend of mine i was much startled when you came into the room  you mean some one who is dead she asked in awestruck tones  fever he said  you think i am like her in appearance  in every way he said dreamily the same sweetpardon me but it is very remarkable even the tones of the voice are the same i suppose i ought not to ask your age  i shall be twentyone in august  she would have been twentyone in august had she lived tommy said with fervour my dear young lady  this was the aged gentleman again but she did not wince he soon found out that they expect authors to say the oddest things and this proved to be a great help to him  my dear young lady i feel that i know you very well  that she said is only because i resemble your friend outwardly the real me she was a bit of philosopher also you cannot know at all  he smiled sadly has it ever struck you he asked that you are very unlike other women  oh how ever could you have found that out she exclaimed amazed  almost before he knew how it came about he was on terms of very pleasant sentiment with this girl for they now shared between them a secret that he had confided to no other his face which had been so much against him hitherto was at last in his favour it showed so plainly that when he looked at her more softly or held her hand longer than is customary he was really thinking of that other of whom she was the image or if it did not precisely show that it suggested something or other of that nature which did just as well there was a sweet something between them which brought them together and also kept them apart it allowed them to go a certain length while it was also a reason why they could never never exceed that distance and this was an ideal state for tommy who could be most loyal and tender so long as it was understood that he meant nothing in particular she was the right kind of girl too and admired him the more and perhaps went a step further because he remained so true to felicitys memory  you must not think him calculating and coldblooded for nothing could be less true to the fact when not engaged indeed on his new work he might waste some time planning scenes with exquisite ladies in which he sparkled or had a hidden sorrow he cared not which but these scenes seldom came to life he preferred very pretty girls to be rather stupid oh the artistic instinct of the man but instead of keeping them stupid as he wanted to do he found himself trying to improve their minds they screwed up their noses in the effort meaning to thrill the celebrated beauty who had been specially invited to meet him he devoted himself to a plain woman for whose plainness a sudden pity had mastered him for like all true worshippers of beauty in women he always showed best in the presence of plain ones with the intention of being a gallant knight to lady iwonttellthename a whim of the moment made him so stiff to her that she ultimately asked the reason and such a charmingly sad reason presented itself to him that she immediately invited him to her riverside party on thursday week he had the conversations and incidents for that party ready long before the day arrived he altered them and polished them as other young gentlemen in the same circumstances overhaul their boating costumes but when he joined the party there was among them the childrens governess and seeing her slighted his blood boiled and he was her attendant for the afternoon  elspeth was not at this pleasant jink in high life she had been invited but her ladyship had once let tommy kiss her hand for the first and last time so he decided sternly that this was no place for elspeth when temptation was nigh he first locked elspeth up and then walked into it  with two in every three women he was still as shy as ever but the third he escorted triumphantly to the conservatory she did no harm to his workrather sent him back to it refreshed it was as if he were shooting the sentiment which other young men get rid of more gradually by beginning earlier and there were such accumulations of it that i dont know whether he ever made up on them punishment sought him in the night when he dreamed constantly that he was marriedto whom scarcely mattered he saw himself coming out of a church a married man and the fright woke him up but with the daylight came again his talent for dodging thoughts that were lying in wait and he yielded as recklessly as before to every sentimental impulse as illustration take his humourous passage with mrs jerry geraldine something was her name but her friends called her mrs jerry  she was a wealthy widow buxom not a day over thirty when she was merry which might be at inappropriate moments as immediately after she had expressed a desire to lead the higher life but i have a theory my dear she said solemnly to elspeth that no woman is able to do it who cannot see her own nose without the help of a mirror she had taken a great fancy to elspeth and made many engagements with her and kept some of them and the understanding was that she apprenticed herself to tommy through elspeth he being too terrible to face by himself or as mrs jerry expressed it all nose so tommy had seen very little of her and thought less until one day he called by passionate request to sign her birthdaybook and heard himself proposing to her instead  for one thing it was twilight and she had forgotten to ring for the lamps that might have been enough but there was more she read to him part of a letter in which her hand was solicited in marriage and for the life of me said mrs jerry almost in tears i cannot decide whether to say yes or no  this put tommy in a most awkward position there are probably men who could have got out of it without proposing but to him there seemed at the moment no other way open the letter complicated matters also by beginning dear jerry and saying little jerry further onexpressions which stirred him strangely  why do you read this to me he asked in a voice that broke a little  because you are so wise she said do you mind  do i mind he exclaimed bitterly take care you idiot he said to himself  i was asking your advice only is it too much  not at all i am quite the right man to consult at such a moment am i not  it was said with profound meaning but his face was as usual  that is what i thought she said in all good faith  you do not even understand he cried and he was also looking longingly at his hat  understand what  jerry he said and tried to stop himself with the result that he added dear little jerry what am i doing he groaned  she understood now you dont mean she began in amazement  yes he cried passionately i love you will you be my wife i am lost  gracious exclaimed mrs jerry and then on reflection she became indignant i would not have believed it of you she said scornfully is it my money or what i am not at all clever so you must tell me  with tommy of course it was not her money except when he had elspeth to consider he was as much a quixote about money as pym himself and at no moment of his life was he a snob  i am sorry you should think so meanly of me he said with dignity lifting his hat and he would have got away then which when you come to think of it was what he wanted had he been able to resist an impulse to heave a brokenhearted sigh at the door  dont go yet mr sandys she begged i may have been hasty and yetwhy we are merely acquaintances  he had meant to be very careful now but that word sent him off again acquaintances he cried no we were never that  it almost seemed to me that you avoided me  you noticed it he said eagerly at least you do me that justice oh how i tried to avoid you  it was because  alas  she was touched of course but still puzzled we know so little of each other she said  i see he replied that you know me very little mrs jerry but youoh jerry jerry i know you as no other man has ever known you  i wish i had proof of it she said helplessly  proof she should not have asked tommy for proof i know he cried how unlike all other women you are to the world you are like the rest but in your heart you know that you are different you know it and i know it and no other person knows it  yes mrs jerry knew it and had often marvelled over it in the seclusion of her boudoir but that another should have found it out was strange and almost terrifying  i know you love me now she said softly only love could have shown you that butoh let me go away for a minute to think and she ran out of the room  other suitors have been left for a space in tommys state of doubt but never it may be hoped with the same emotions oh heavens if she should accept him he saw elspeth sickening and dying of the news  his guardian angel however was very good to tommy at this time or perhaps like cannibals with their prisoner the god of sentiment who has a tail was fattening him for a future feast and mrs jerrys answer was that it could never be  tommy bowed his head  but she hoped he would let her be his very dear friend it would be the proudest recollection of her life that mr sandys had entertained such feelings for her  nothing could have been better and he should have found difficulty in concealing his delight but this strange tommy was really feeling his part again it was an unforced tear that came to his eye quite naturally he looked long and wistfully at her  jerry jerry he articulated huskily and whatever the words mean in these circumstances he really meant then he put his lips to her hand for the first and last time and so was gone broken but brave he was in splendid fettle for writing that evening wild animals sleep after gorging but it sent this monster refreshed to his work  nevertheless the incident gave him some uneasy reflections was he indeed a monster was one that he could dodge as yet but suppose mrs jerry told his dear elspeth of what had happened she had said that she would not but a secret in mrs jerrys breast was like her pug in her arms always kicking to get free  elspeth said tommy what do you say to going north and having a sight of thrums again  he knew what she would say they had been talking for years of going back it was the great day that all her correspondence with old friends in thrums looked forward to  they made little of you tommy she said when we left but im thinking they will all be at their windows when you go back  oh replied thomas thats nothing but i should like to shake corp by the hand again  and aaron said elspeth she was knitting stockings for aaron at that moment  and gavinia tommy said and the dominie  and ailie  and then came an awkward pause for they were both thinking of that independent girl called grizel she was seldom discussed tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name he would have preferred elspeth to mention it and elspeth had misgivings that this was so with the result that neither could say grizel without wondering what was in the others mind tommy had written twice to grizel the first time unknown to elspeth but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him and against his better judgment for well he knew she would never stand it he had begun his letter with these mad words dear little woman she did not answer this but soon afterwards she wrote to elspeth and he was not mentioned in the letter proper but it carried a sting in its tail ps it said how is sentimental tommy  none but a fiend in human shape could have written thus and elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother now we know what grizel is she said i am done with her now  but when tommy had got back his wind he said nobly ill call her no names if this is how she likes to repay me forfor all my kindnesses let her but elspeth if i have the chance i shall go on being good to her just the same  elspeth adored him for it but grizel would have stamped had she known he had that comfort  the second letter he never posted it was written a few months before he became a celebrity and had very fine things indeed in it for old dr mcqueen grizels dear friend had just died at his post and it was a letter of condolence while tommy wrote it he was in a quiver of genuine emotion as he was very pleased to feel and it had a specially satisfying bit about death and the world never being the same again he knew it was good but he did not send it to her for no reason i can discover save that postscripts jarred on him     chapter iv  grizel of the crooked smile   to expose tommy for what he was to appear to be scrupulously fair to him so that i might really damage him the more that is what i set out to do in this book and always when he seemed to be finding a way of getting round me as i had a secret dread he might do i was to remember grizel and be obdurate but if i have so far got past some of his virtues without even mentioning them and i have i know how many opportunities for discrediting him have been missed and that would not greatly matter there are so many more to come if grizel were on my side but she is not throughout those first chapters a voice has been crying to me take care if you hurt him you will hurt me and i know it to be the voice of grizel and i seem to see her rocking her arms as she used to rock them when excited in the days of her innocent childhood dont dont dont she cried at every cruel word i gave him and she to whom it was ever such agony to weep dropped a tear upon each word so that they were obliterated and surely i knew him best she said and i always loved him and she stood there defending him with her hand on her heart to conceal the gaping wound that tommy had made  well if grizel had always loved him there was surely something fine and rare about tommy but what was it grizel why did you always love him you who saw into him so well and demanded so much of men when i ask that question the spirit that hovers round my desk to protect tommy from me rocks her arms mournfully as if she did not know the answer it is only when i seem to see her as she so often was in life before she got that wound and after bending over some little child and looking up radiant that i think i suddenly know why she always loved tommy it was because he had such need of her  i dont know whether you remember but there were once some children who played at jacobites in the thrums den under tommys leadership elspeth of course was one of them and there were corp shiach and gavinia and lastly there was grizel had tommys parents been alive she would not have been allowed to join for she was a painted ladys child but tommy insisted on having her and grizel thought it was just sweet of him he also chatted with her in public places as if she were a respectable character and oh how she longed to be respectable but on the other hand he was the first to point out how superbly he was behaving and his ways were masterful so the independent girl would not be captains wife if he said she was captains wife he had to apologize and if he merely looked it he had to apologize just the same  one night the painted lady died in the den and then it would have gone hard with the lonely girl had not dr mcqueen made her his little housekeeper not out of pity he vowed she was so anxious to be told that but because he was an old bachelor sorely in need of someone to take care of him and how she took care of him but though she was so happy now she knew that she must be very careful for there was something in her blood that might waken and prevent her being a good woman she thought it would be sweet to be good  she told all this to tommy and he was profoundly interested and consulted a wise man whose advice was that when she grew up she should be wary of any man whom she liked and mistrusted in one breath meaning to do her a service tommy communicated this to her and then what do you think grizel would have no more dealings with him by and by the gods in a sportive mood sent him to labour on a farm whence as we have seen he found a way to london and while he was growing into a man grizel became a woman at the time of the doctors death she was nineteen tall and graceful and very dark and pale when the winds of the day flushed her cheek she was beautiful but it was a beauty that hid the mystery of her face the sun made her merry but she looked more noble when it had set then her pallor shone with a soft radiant light as though the mystery and sadness and serenity of the moon were in it the full beauty of grizel came out only at night like the stars  i had made up my mind that when the time came to describe grizels mere outward appearance i should refuse her that word beautiful because of her tilted nose but now that the time has come i wonder at myself probably when i am chapters ahead i shall return to this one and strike out the word beautiful and then as likely as not i shall come back afterwards and put it in again whether it will be there at the end god knows her eyes at least were beautiful they were unusually far apart and let you look straight into them and never quivered they were such clear gray searching eyes they seemed always to be asking for the truth and she had an adorable mouth in repose it was perhaps hard because it shut so decisively but often it screwed up provokingly at one side as when she smiled or was sorry or for no particular reason for she seemed unable to control this vagary which was perhaps a little bit of babyhood that had forgotten to grow up with the rest of her at those moments the essence of all that was characteristic and delicious about her seemed to have run to her mouth so that to kiss grizel on her crooked smile would have been to kiss the whole of her at once she had a quaint way of nodding her head at you when she was talking it made you forget what she was saying though it was really meant to have precisely the opposite effect her voice was rich with many inflections when she had much to say it gurgled like a stream in a hurry but its cooing note was best worth remembering at the end of the day there were times when she looked like a boy her almost gallant bearing the poise of her head her noble franknessthey all had something in them of a princely boy who had never known fear  i have no wish to hide her defects i would rather linger over them because they were part of grizel and i am sorry to see them go one by one thrums had not taken her to its heart she was a proudpurse they said meaning that she had a haughty walk her sense of justice was too great she scorned frailties that she should have pitied how strange to think that there was a time when pity was not the feeling that leaped to grizels bosom first she did not care for study she learned french and the pianoforte to please the doctor but she preferred to be sewing or dusting when she might have been reading she was perhaps making for herself one of those costumes that annoyed every lady of thrums who employed a dressmaker or more probably it was a delicious garment for a baby for as soon as grizel heard that there was a new baby anywhere all her intellect deserted her and she became a slave books often irritated her because she disagreed with the author and it was a torment to her to find other people holding to their views when she was so certain that hers were right in church she sometimes rocked her arms and the old doctor by her side knew that it was because she could not get up and contradict the minister she was i presume the only young lady who ever dared to say that she hated sunday because there was so much sitting still in it  sitting still did not suit grizel at all other times she was happy but then her mind wandered back to the thoughts that had lived too closely with her in the old days and she was troubled what woke her from these reveries was probably the doctors hand placed very tenderly on her shoulder and then she would start and wonder how long he had been watching her and what were the grave thoughts behind his cheerful face for the doctor never looked more cheerful than when he was drawing grizel away from the ugly past and he talked to her as if he had noticed nothing but after he went upstairs he would pace his bedroom for a long time and grizel listened and knew that he was thinking about her then perhaps she would run up to him and put her arms around his neck these scenes brought the doctor and grizel very close together but they became rarer as she grew up and then for once that she was troubled she was a hundred times irresponsible with glee and oh you dearest darlingest she would cry to him i must dancei must i mustthough it is a fastday and you must dance with your mother this instanti am so happy so happy mother was his nickname for her and she delighted in the word she lorded it over him as if he were her troublesome boy  how could she be other than glorious when there was so much to do the work inside the house she made for herself and outside the doctor made it for her at last he had found for nurse a woman who could follow his instructions literally who understood that if he said five oclock for the medicine the chap of six would not do as well who did not in her heart despise the thermometer and who resolutely prevented the patient from skipping out of bed to change her pillowslips because the minister was expected such tyranny enraged every sufferer who had been ill before and got better but what they chiefly complained of to the doctor and he agreed with a humourous sigh was her masterfulness about fresh air and cold water windows were opened that had never been opened before they yielded to her pressure with a groan and as for cold water it might have been said that a bath followed her wherever she wentnot mark me for putting your hands and face in not even for your feet but in you must go the whole of you as if they said indignantly there was something the matter with our skin  she could not gossip not even with the doctor who liked it of an evening when he had got into his carpet shoes there was no use telling her a secret for she kept it to herself for evermore she had ideas about how men should serve a woman even the humblest that made the men gaze with wonder and the women curiously enough with irritation her greatest scorn was for girls who made themselves cheap with men and she could not hide it it was a physical pain to grizel to hide her feelings they popped out in her face if not in words and were always in advance of her selfcontrol to the doctor this impulsiveness was pathetic he loved her for it but it sometimes made him uneasy  he died in the scarletfever year im smitten he suddenly said at a bedside and a week afterwards he was gone  we must speak of it now grizel he said when he knew that he was dying  she pressed his hand she knew to what he was referring yes she said i should love you to speak of it now  you and i have always fought shy of it he said making a pretence that it had altogether passed away i thought that was best for you  dearest darlingest she said i knowi have always known  and you he said you pretended because you thought it was best for me  she nodded and we saw through each other all the time she said  grizel has it passed away altogether now  her grip upon his hand did not tighten in the least yes she could say honestly it has altogether passed away  and you have no more fear  no none  it was his great reward for all that he had done for grizel  i know what you are thinking of she said when he did not speak you are thinking of the haunted little girl you rescued seven years ago  no he answered i was thanking god for the brave wholesome woman she has grown into and for something else grizelfor letting me live to see it  to do it she said pressing his hand to her breast  she was a strange girl and she had to speak her mind i dont think god has done it all she said i dont even think that he told you to do it i think he just said to you there is a painted ladys child at your door you can save her if you like  no she went on when he would have interposed i am sure he did not want to do it all he even left a little bit of it to me to do myself i love to think that i have done a tiny bit of it myself i think it is the sweetest thing about god that he lets us do some of it ourselves do i hurt you darling  no she did not hurt him for he understood her but you are naturally so impulsive he said it has often been a sharp pain to me to see you so careful  it was not a pain to me to be careful it was a joy oh the thousand dear delightful joys i have had with you  it has made you strong grizel and i rejoice in that but sometimes i fear that it has made you too difficult to win  i dont want to be won she told him  you dont quite mean that grizel  no she said at once she whispered to him impulsively it is the only thing i am at all afraid of now  what  love  you will not be afraid of it when it comes  but i want to be afraid she said  you need not he answered the man on whom those clear eyes rest lovingly will be worthy of it all if he were not they would be the first to find him out  but need that make any difference she asked perhaps though i found him out i should love him just the same  not unless you loved him first grizel  no she said at once again i am not really afraid of love she whispered to him you have made me so happy that i am afraid of nothing  yet she wondered a little that he was not afraid to die but when she told him this he smiled and said everybody fears death except those who are dying and when she asked if he had anything on his mind he said i leave the world without a care not that i have seen all i would fain have seen many a time especially this last year when i have seen the mother in you crooning to some neighbours child i have thought to myself i dont know my grizel yet i have seen her in the bud only and i would fain he broke off but i have no fears he said as i lie here with you sitting by my side looking so serene i can say for the first time for half a century that i have nothing on my mind  but grizel i should have married he told her the chief lesson my life has taught me is that they are poor crittursthe men who dont marry  if you had married she said you might never have been able to help me  it is you who have helped me he replied god sent the child he is most reluctant to give any of us up ay grizel thats what my life has taught me and its all i can leave to you the last he saw of her she was holding his hand and her eyes were dry her teeth were clenched but there was a brave smile upon her face for he had told her that it was thus he would like to see her at the end after his death she continued to live at the old house he had left it to her i want it to remain in the family he said with all his savings which were quite sufficient for the needs of such a manager he had also left her plenty to do and that was a still sweeter legacy  and the other jacobites what of them hi where are you corp here he comes grinning in his spleet new uniform to demand our tickets of us he is now the railway porter since tommy left thrums steam had arrived in it and corp had by nature such a gift for giving luggage the twist which breaks everything inside as you dump it down that he was inevitably appointed porter there was no travelling to thrums without a ticket at tilliedrum which was the junction for thrums you showed your ticket and were then locked in a hundred yards from thrums corp leaped upon the train and fiercely demanded your ticket at the station he asked you threateningly whether you had given up your ticket even his wife was afraid of him at such times and had her ticket ready in her hand  his wife was one gavinia and she had no fear of him except when she was travelling to his face she referred to him as a doited sumph but to grizel pleading for him she admitted that despite his warts and quarrelsome legs he was a great big muckle sonsy stout buirdly well set up wiselike havering man when first corp had proposed to her she gave him a clout on the head and so little did he know of the sex that this discouraged him he continued however to propose and she to clout him until he heard accidentally he woke up in church of a man in the bible who had wooed a woman for seven years and this example he determined to emulate but when gavinia heard of it she was so furious that she took him at once dazed by his good fortune he rushed off with it to his aunt whom he wearied with his repetition of the great news  to your bed wi you she said yawning  bed cried corp indignantly and so auntie says gavinia yes says she ill hae you those were her nevertobeforgotten words  you pitiful object answered his aunt men hae been married afore now without making sic a stramash  i daursay retorted corp but they hinna married gavinia and this is the best known answer to the sneer of the cynic  he was a public nuisance that night and knocked various people up after they had gone to bed to tell them that gavinia was to have him he was eventually led home by kindly though indignant neighbours but early morning found him in the country carrying the news from farm to farm  no i winna sit down he said i just cried in to tell you gavinia is to hae me six miles from home he saw a mud house on the top of a hill and ascended genially he found at their porridge a very old lady with a nutcracker face and a small boy we shall see them again auld wifie said corp i dinna ken you but ive just stepped up to tell you that gavinia is to hae me  it made him the butt of the sportive if he or gavinia were nigh they gathered their fowls round them and then said hens i didna bring you here to feed you but just to tell you that gavinia is to hae me this flustered gavinia but grizel who enjoyed her own jokes too heartily to have more than a polite interest in those of other people said to her how can you be angry i think it was just sweet of him  but was it no vulgar  vulgar said grizel why gavinia that is how every lady would like a man to love her  and then gavinia beamed im glad you say that she said for though i wouldna tell corp for worlds i fell likit it  but grizel told corp that gavinia liked it  it was the proof she said smiling that you have the right to marry her you have shown your ticket never give it up corp  about a year afterwards corp armed in his sunday stand rushed to grizels house occasionally stopping to slap his shiny knees grizel he cried theres somebody come to thrums without a ticket then he remembered gavinias instructions mrs shiachs compliments he said ponderously and its a boy  oh corp exclaimed grizel and immediately began to put on her hat and jacket  corp watched her uneasily mrs shiachs compliments he said firmly and hes ower young to be bathed yet but shes awid to show him off to you he hastened to add tell grizel was her first words  tell grizel they were among the first words of many mothers none they were aware would receive the news with quite such glee as she they might think her cold and reserved with themselves but to see the look on her face as she bent over a baby and to know that the baby was yours what a way she had with them she always welcomed them as if in coming they had performed a great feat that is what babies are agape for from the beginning had they been able to speak they would have said tell grizel themselves  and mrs shiachs compliments corp remembered and she would be windy if you would carry the bairn at the christening  i should love it corp have you decided on the name  lang syne gin it were a lassie we were to call her grizel  oh how sweet of you  after the finest lassie we ever kent continued corp stoutly but i was sure it would be a laddie  why  because if it was a laddie it was to be called after him he said with emphasis on the last word and thinks i to mysel hell find a way what a crittur he was for finding a way grizel and he lookit so holy a the time do you mind that swear word o hisstroke it just meant damn but he could make even damn look holy  you are to call the baby tommy  hell be christened thomas sandys shiach said corp i hankered after putting something out o the jacobites intil his name and i says to gavinia lets call him thomas sandys stroke shiach says i and the ministerll be nane the wiser but gavinia was scandalized  grizel reflected corp she said i am sure gavinias sister will expect to be asked to carry the baby i dont think i want to do it  after you promised cried corp much hurt i never kent you to break a promise afore  i will do it corp she said at once  she did not know then that tommy would be in church to witness the ceremony but she knew before she walked down the aisle with ts shiach in her arms it was the first time that tommy and she had seen each other for seven years that day he almost rivalled his namesake in the interests of the congregation who however took prodigious care that he should not see itall except grizel she smiled a welcome to him and he knew that her serene gray eyes were watching him     chapter v  the tommy myth   on the evening before the christening aaron latta his head sunk farther into his shoulders his beard gone grayer no other perceptible difference in a dreary man since we last saw him in the book of tommys boyhood had met the brother and sister at the station a barrow with him for their luggage it was a great hour for him as he wheeled the barrow homeward elspeth once more by his side but he could say nothing heartsome in tommys presence and tommy was as uncomfortable in his the old strained relations between these two seemed to begin again at once they were as selfconscious as two mastiffs meeting in the street and both breathed a sigh of relief when tommy fell behind  youre bonny elspeth aaron then said eagerly im glad glad to see you again  and him too aaron elspeth pleaded  he took you away frae me  he has brought me back  ay and he has but to whistle to you and away you go wi him again hes ower grand to bide lang here now  you dont know him aaron we are to stay a long time do you know mrs mclean invited us to stay with her i suppose she thought your house was so small but tommy said the house of the man who befriended us when we were children shall never be too small for us  did he say that ay but elspeth i would rather hear what you said  i said it was to dear good aaron latta i was going back and to no one else  god bless you for that elspeth  and tommy she went on must have his old garret room again to write as well as sleep in and the little room you partitioned off the kitchen will do nicely for me  theres no a window in it replied aaron but it will do fine for you elspeth he was almost chuckling for he had a surprise in waiting for her this way he said excitedly when she would have gone into the kitchen and he flung open the door of what had been his warpingroom the warpingmill was goneeverything that had been there was gone what met the delighted eyes of elspeth and tommy was a cozy parlour which became a bedroom when you opened that other door  you are a leddy now elspeth aaron said husky with pride and you have a leddys room do you see the piano  he had given up the warping having at last twa three hunder in the bank and all the work he did now was at a loom which he had put into the kitchen to keep him out of languor i have sorted up the garret too for you he said to tommy but this is elspeths room  as if tommy would take it from me said elspeth running into the kitchen to hug this dear aaron  you may laugh aaron replied vindictively but he is taking it frae you already and later when tommy was out of the way he explained his meaning i did it all for you elspeth elspeths room i called it when i bought the mahogany armchair thats elspeths chair i said to mysel and when i bought the bed its hers i said ay but i was soon disannulled o that thait for in spite of me they were all got for him not a rissom in that room is yours or mine elspeth every muhlen belongs to him  but who says so aaron i am sure he wont  i dinna ken them they are leddies that come here in their carriages to see the house where thomas sandys was born  but aaron he was born in london  they think he was born in this house aaron replied doggedly and its no for me to cheapen him  oh aaron you pretend  i was never very fond o him aaron admitted but i winna cheapen jean myless bairn and when they chap at my door and say they would like to see the room thomas sandys was born in i let them see the best room i have so thats how he has laid hands on your parlor elspeth afore i can get rid o them they gie a squeak and cry was that thomas sandyss bed and i says it was thats him taking the very bed frae you elspeth  you might at least have shown them his bed in the garret she said  its a shilpit bit thing he answered and i winna cheapen him theyre curious too to see his favourite seat  it was the fender she declared  it was he assented but its no for me to cheapen him so i let them see your new mahogany chair thomas sandyss chair they call it and they sit down in it reverently they winna even leave you the piano was this thomas sandyss piano they speir it was says i and syne they gowp at it his under lip shot out a sure sign that he was angry i dinna blame him he said but he had the same masterful way of scooping everything into his lap when he was a laddie and i like him none the mair for it and from this position aaron would not budge  quite right too tommy said when he heard of it but you can tell him elspeth that we shall allow no more of those prying women to come in and he really meant this for he was a modest man that day was tommy nevertheless he was perhaps a little annoyed to find as the days went on that no more ladies came to be turned away  he heard that they had also been unable to resist the desire to shake hands with thomas sandyss schoolmaster it must have been a pleasure to teach him they said to cathro  ah me ah me cathro replied enigmatically it had so often been a pleasure to cathro to thrash him  genius is odd they said did he ever give you any trouble  we were like father and son he assured them with natural pride he showed them the inkpot into which thomas sandys had dipped as a boy they were very grateful for his interesting reminiscence that when the pot was too full thomas inked his fingers he presented several of them with the inkpot  two ladies who came together bothered him by asking what the hugh blackadder competition was they had been advised to inquire of him about thomas sandyss connection therewith by another schoolmaster a mr ogilvy whom they had met in one of the glens  mr cathro winced and then explained with emphasis that the hugh blackadder was a competition in which the local ministers were the sole judges he therefore referred the ladies to them the ladies did go to a local minister for enlightenment to mr dishart but after reflecting mr dishart said that it was too long a story and this answer seemed to amuse mr ogilvy who happened to be present  it was mr mclean who retailed this news to tommy he and ailie had walked home from church with the newcomers on the day after their arrival the day of the christening they had not gone into aarons house for you are looked askance at in thrums if you pay visits on sundays but they had stood for a long time gossiping at the door which is permitted by the strictest ailie was in a twitter as of old and not able even yet to speak of her husband without an apologetic look to the ladies who had none and oh how proud she was of tommys fame her eyes were an offering to him  dont take her as a sample of the place though mr mclean warned him for thrums does not catch fire so readily as london it was quite true i was at the school wi him they said up there and implied that this damned his book  but there were two faithful souls or more strictly one for corp could never have carried it through without gavinias help tommy called on them promptly at their house in the bellies brae four rooms but a lodger and said almost before he had time to look that the baby had corps chin and gavinias eyes he had made this up on the way he also wanted to say so desirous was he of pleasing his old friends that he should like to hold the baby in his arms but it was such a thundering lie that even an author could not say it  tommy sat down in that house with a very warm heart for its inmates but they chilled himgavinia with her stiff words and corp by looking miserable instead of joyous  i expected you to come to me first corp said tommy reproachfully i had scarcely a word with you at the station  he couldna hae presumed replied gavinia primly  i couldna hae presumed said corp with a groan  fudge tommy said you were my greatest friend and i like you as much as ever corp  corps face shone but gavinia said at once you werena sic great friends as that were you man  no corp replied gloomily  whatever has come over you both asked tommy in surprise you will be saying next gavinia that we never played at jacobites in the den  i dinna deny that corp and me played gavinia answered determinedly but you didna you said to us think shame you said to be playing vulgar games when you could be reading superior books they were his very words were they no man she demanded of her unhappy husband with a threatening look  they were said corp in deepest gloom  i must get to the bottom of this said tommy rising and as you are too great a coward corp to tell the truth with that shameless woman glowering at you out you go gavinia and take your disgraced bairn with you do as you are told you besom for i am captain stroke again  corp was choking with delight as gavinia withdrew haughtily i was sure you would sort her he said rubbing his hands i was sure you wasna the kind to be ashamed o auld friends  but what does it mean  she has a notion corp explained growing grave again that it wouldna do for you to own the like o us we mauna cheapen him she said she wanted you to see that we hinna been cheapening you he said in a sepulchral voice there has been leddies here and they want to ken what thomas sandys was like as a boy its me they speir for but gavinia she just shoves me out o sight and says she leave them to me  corp told tommy some of the things gavinia said about thomas sandys as a boy how he sat rapt in church and instead of going birdnesting lay on the ground listening to the beautiful little warblers overhead and gave all his pennies to poorer children and could repeat the shorter catechism beginning at either end and was very respectful to the aged and infirm and of a yielding disposition and said from his earliest years i dont want to be great i just want to be good  how can she make them all up tommy asked with respectful homage to gavinia  corp with his eye on the door produced from beneath the bed a little book with coloured pictures it was entitled great boyhoods by aunt martha she doesna make them up he whispered she gets them out o this  and you back her up corp even when she says i was not your friend  it was like a t knife intil me replied loyal corp every time i forswore you it was like a t knife but i did it ay and ill go on doing it if you think my friendship cheapens you  tommy was much moved and gripped his old lieutenant by the hand he also called gavinia ben and before she could ward him off the masterful rogue had saluted her on the cheek that said tommy is to show you that i am as fond of the old times and my old friends as ever and the moment you deny it i shall take you to mean gavinia that you want another kiss  hes just the same corp remarked ecstatically when tommy had gone  i dinna deny gavinia said but what hes fell taking and for a time they ruminated  gavinia said corp suddenly i wouldna wonder but what hes a gey lad wi the women  what makes you think that she replied coldly and he had the prudence not to say he should have followed his hero home to be disabused of this monstrous notion for even while it was being propounded tommy was sitting in such an agony of silence in a womans presence that she could not resist smiling a crooked smile at him his want of words did not displease grizel she was of opinion that young men should always be a little awed by young ladies  he had found her with elspeth on his return home would grizel call and be friendly he had asked himself many times since he saw her in church yesterday and elspeth was as curious each wanted to know what the other thought of her but neither had the courage to inquire they both wanted to know so much her name had been mentioned but casually not a word to indicate that she had grown up since they saw her last the longer tommy remained silent the more he knew did elspeth suspect him he would have liked to say in a careless voice rather pretty isnt she but he felt that this little elspeth would see through him at once  for at the first glance he had seen what grizel was and a thrill of joy passed through him as he drank her in it was but the joy of the eyes for the first moment but it ran to his heart to say this is the little hunted girl that was and tommy was moved with a manly gladness that the girl who once was so fearful of the future had grown into this the same unselfish delight in her for her own sake came over him again when he shook hands with her in aarons parlor this glorious creature with the serene eyes and the noble shoulders had been the hunted child of the double dykes he would have liked to race back into the past and bring little grizel here to look how many boyish memories he recalled and she was in every one of them his heart held nothing but honest joy in this meeting after so many years he longed to tell her how sincerely he was still her friend well why dont you tell her tommy it is a thing you are good at and you have been polishing up the phrases ever since she passed down the aisle with master shiach in her arms you have even planned out a way of putting grizel at her ease and behold she is the only one of the three who is at ease what has come over you does the reader think it was love no it was only that pall of shyness he tried to fling it off but could not behold tommy being buried alive  elspeth showed less contemptibly than her brother but it was grizel who did most of the talking she nodded her head and smiled crookedly at tommy but she was watching him all the time she wore a dress in which brown and yellow mingled as in woods on an autumn day and the jacket had a high collar of fur over which she watched him let us say that she was watching to see whether any of the old tommy was left in him yet with this problem confronting her she also had time to study the outer man tommy the dandyhis velvet jacket a new one his brazen waistcoat his poetic neckerchief his spotless linen his velvet jacket was to become the derision of thrums but tommy took his bonneting haughtily like one who was glad to suffer for a cause there were to be meetings here and there where people told with awe how many shirts he sent weekly to the wash grizel disdained his dandy tastes why did not elspeth strip him of them and oh if he must wear that absurd waistcoat could she not see that it would look another thing if the second button was put half an inch farther back how sinful of him to spoil the shape of his silly velvet jacket by carrying so many letters in the pockets she learned afterwards that he carried all those letters because there was a check in one of them he did not know which and her sense of orderliness was outraged elspeth did not notice these things she helped tommy by her helplessness there is reason to believe that once in london when she had need of a new hat but money there was none tommy looking very defiant studied ladies hats in the shopwindows brought all his intellect to bear on them with the result that he did concoct out of elspeths old hat a new one which was the admired of op pym and friends who never knew the name of the artist but obviously he could not take proper care of himself and there is a kind of woman of whom grizel was one to whose breasts this helplessness makes an unfair appeal oh to dress him properly she could not help liking to be a mother to men she wanted them to be the most noble characters but completely dependent on her  tommy walked home with her and it seemed at first as if elspeths absence was to be no help to him he could not even plagiarize from sandys on woman no one knew so well the kind of thing he should be saying and no one could have been more anxious to say it but a weight of shyness sat on the lid of tommy having for half an hour raged internally at his misfortune he now sullenly embraced it if i am this sort of an ass let me be it in the superlative degree he may be conceived saying bitterly to himself he addressed grizel coldly as miss mcqueen a name she had taken by the doctors wish soon after she went to live with him  there is no reason why you should call me that she said call me grizel as you used to do  may i replied tommy idiotically he knew it was idiotic but that mood now had grip of him  but i mean to call you mr sandys she said decisively  he was really glad to hear it for to be called tommy by anyone was now detestable to him which is why i always call him tommy in these pages so it was like him to say with a sigh i had hoped to hear you use the old name  that sigh made her look at him sharply he knew that he must be careful with grizel and that she was irritated but he had to go on  it is strange to me said sentimental tommy to be back here after all those years walking this familiar road once more with you i thought it would make me feel myself a boy again but heighho it has just the opposite effect i never felt so old as i do today  his voice trembled a little i dont know why grizel frowned  but you never were as old as you are today were you she inquired politely it whisked tommy out of dangerous waters and laid him at her feet he laughed not perceptibly or audibly of course but somewhere inside him the bell rang no one could laugh more heartily at himself than tommy and none bore less malice to those who brought him to land  that at any rate makes me feel younger he said candidly and now the shyness was in full flight  why asked grizel still watchful  it is so like the kind of thing you used to say to me when we were boy and girl i used to enrage you very much i fear he said half gleefully  yes she admitted with a smile you did  and then how you rocked your arms at me grizel do you remember  she remembered it all so well this rocking of the arms as they called it was a trick of hers that signified sudden joy or pain they hung rigid by her side and then shook violently with emotion  do you ever rock them now when people annoy you he asked  there has been no one to annoy me she replied demurely since you went away  but i have come back tommy said looking hopefully at her arms  you see they take no notice of you  they dont remember me yet as soon as they do they will cry out  grizel shook her head confidently and in this she was pitting herself against tommy always a bold thing to do  i have been to see corps baby he said suddenly and this was so important that she stopped in the middle of the road  what do you think of him she asked quite anxiously  i thought replied tommy gravely and making use of one of grizels pet phrases i thought he was just sweet  isnt he she cried and then she knew that he was making fun of her her arms rocked  hurray cried tommy they recognize me now dont be angry grizel he begged her you taught me long ago what was the right thing to say about babies and how could i be sure it was you until i saw your arms rocking  it was so like you she said reproachfully to try to make me do it  it was so unlike you he replied craftily to let me succeed and after all grizel if i was horrid in the old days i always apologized  never she insisted  well then said tommy handsomely i do so now and then they both laughed gaily and i think grizel was not sorry that there was a little of the boy who had been horrid left in tommyjust enough to know him by  hell be vain her aged maid maggy ann said curiously to her that evening they were all curious about tommy  i dont know that he is vain grizel replied guardedly  if hes no vain maggy ann retorted hes the first son of adam it could be said o i jalouse its his bit book  he scarcely mentioned it  ay then its his beard  grizel was sure it was not that  then itll be the women said maggy ann  who knows said grizel of the watchful eyes but she smiled to herself she thought not incorrectly that she knew one woman of whom mr sandys was a little afraid  about the same time tommy and elspeth were discussing her elspeth was in bed and tommy had come into the room to kiss her goodnighthe had never once omitted doing it since they went to london and he was always to do it for neither of them was ever to marry  what do you think of her elspeth asked this was their great time for confidences  of whom tommy inquired lightly  grizel  he must be careful  rather pretty dont you think he said gazing at the ceiling  she was looking at him keenly but he managed to deceive her she was much relieved and could say what was in her heart tommy she said i think she is the most noblelooking girl i ever saw and if she were not so masterful in her manner she would be beautiful it was nice of elspeth to say it for she and grizel were never very great friends  tommy brought down his eyes did you think as much of her as that he said it struck me that her features were not quite classic her nose is a little tilted is it not  some people like that kind of nose replied elspeth  it is not classic tommy said sternly     chapter vi  ghosts that haunt the den   looking through the tommy papers of this period like a conscientious biographer i find among them manuscripts that remind me how diligently he set to work at his new book the moment he went north and also letters which if printed would show you what a wise and good man tommy was but while i was fingering those there floated from them to the floor a loose page and when i saw that it was a chemists bill for oil and liniment i remembered something i had nigh forgotten eureka i cried i shall tell the story of the chemists bill and some other biographer may print the letters  well well but to think that this scrap of paper should flutter into view to damn him after all those years  the date is saturday may 28 by which time tommy had been a week in thrums without doing anything very reprehensible so far as grizel knew she watched for telltales as for a mouse to show at its hole and at the worst i think she saw only its little head that was when tommy was talking beautifully to her about her dear doctor he would have done wisely to avoid this subject but he was so notoriously good at condolences that he had to say it he had thought it out you may remember a year ago but hesitated to post it and since then it had lain heavily within him as if it knew it was a good thing and pined to be up and strutting  he said it with emotion evidently dr mcqueen had been very dear to him and any other girl would have been touched but grizel stiffened and when he had finished this is what she said quite snappily  he never liked you  tommy was taken aback but replied with gentle dignity do you think grizel i would let that make any difference in my estimate of him  but you never liked him said she and now that he thought of it this was true also it was useless to say anything about the artistic instinct to her she did not know what it was and would have had plain words for it as soon as he told her please to picture tommy picking up his beautiful speech and ramming it back into his pocket as if it were a rejected manuscript  i am sorry you should think so meanly of me grizel he said with manly forbearance and when she thought it all out carefully that night she decided that she had been hasty she could not help watching tommy for backslidings but oh it was sweet to her to decide that she had not found any  it was i who was horrid she announced to him frankly and tommy forgave her at once she offered him a present when the doctor died i gave some of his things to his friends it is the scotch custom you know he had a new overcoat it had been worn but two or three times i should be so glad if you would let me give it to you for saying such sweet things about him i think it will need very little alteration  thus very simply came into tommys possession the coat that was to play so odd a part in his history but oh grizel said he with mock reproach you need not think that i dont see through you your deep design is to cover me up you despise my velvet jacket  it does not grizel began and stopped  it is not in keeping with my doleful countenance said tommy candidly that was what you were to say let me tell you a secret grizel i wear it to spite my face shant give up my velvet jacket for anybody grizel not even for you he was in gay spirits because he knew she liked him again and she saw that was the reason and it warmed her she was least able to resist tommy when he was most a boy and it was actually watchful grizel who proposed that he and she and elspeth should revisit the den together how often since the days of their childhood had grizel wandered it alone thinking of those dear times making up her mind that if ever tommy asked her to go into the den again with him she would not go the place was so much sweeter to her than it could be to him and yet it was grizel herself who was saying now let us go back to the den  tommy caught fire we shant go back he cried defiantly as men and women let us be boy and girl again grizel let us have that saturday we missed long ago i missed a saturday on purpose grizel so that we should have it now  she shook her head wistfully but she was glad that tommy would fain have had one of the saturdays back had he waxed sentimental she would not have gone a step of the way with him into the past but when he was so full of glee she could take his hand and run back into it  but we must wait until evening tommy said until corp is unharnessed we must not hurt the feelings of corp by going back to the den without him  how mean of me not to think of corp grizel cried but the next moment she was glad she had not thought of him it was so delicious to have proof that tommy was more loyal  but we cant turn back the clock can we corp she said to the fourth of the conspirators to which corp replied with his old sublime confidence hell find a way  and at first it really seemed as if tommy had found a way they did not go to the den four in a line or two abreastnothing so common as that in the wild spirits that mastered him he seemed to be the boy incarnate and it was always said of tommy by those who knew him best that if he leaped back into boyhood they had to jump with him those who knew him best were with him now he took command of them in the old way he whispered as if black cathro were still on the prowl for him corp of corp had to steal upon the den by way of the silent pool grizel by the queens bower elspeth up the burnside captain stroke down the reekie brothpot grizels arms rocked with delight in the dark and she was on her way to the cuttle well the trystingplace before she came to and saw with consternation that tommy had been ordering her about  she was quite a sedate young lady by the time she joined them at the well and tommy was the first to feel the change dont you think this is all rather silly she said when he addressed her as the lady griselda and it broke the spell two girls shot up into women a beard grew on tommys chin and corp became a father grizel had blown tommys pretty project to dust just when he was most gleeful over it yet instead of bearing resentment he pretended not even to know that she was the culprit  corp he said ruefully the game is up and listen he said when they had sat down crushed by the old cuttle well do you hear anything  it was a very still evening i hear nocht said corp but the trickle o the burn what did you hear  i thought i heard a baby cry replied tommy with a groan i think it was your baby corp did you hear it grizel  she understood and nodded  and you elspeth  yes  my bairn cried the astounded corp  yours said tommy reproachfully and he has done for us ladies and gentlemen the game is up  yes the game was up and she was glad grizel said to herself as they made their melancholy pilgrimage of what had once been an enchanted land but she felt that tommy had been very forbearing to her and that she did not deserve it undoubtedly he had ordered her about but in so doing had he not been making halfpathetic sport of his old selfand was it with him that she was annoyed for ordering or with herself for obeying and why should she not obey when it was all a jest it was as if she still had some lingering fear of tommy oh she was ashamed of herself she must say something nice to him at once about what about his book of course how base of her not to have done so already but how good of him to have overlooked her silence on that great topic  it was not ignorance of its contents that had kept her silent to confess the horrid truth grizel had read the book suspiciously looking as through a microscope for something wronghoping not to find it but peering minutely the book she knew was beautiful but it was the writer of the book she was peering forthe tommy she had known so well what had he grown into in her heart she had exulted from the first in his success and she should have been still more glad should she not to learn that his subject was woman but no that had irritated her what was perhaps even worse she had been still more irritated on hearing that the work was rich in sublime thoughts as a boy he had maddened her most in his grandest moments i can think of no other excuse for her  she would not accept it as an excuse for herself now what she saw with scorn was that she was always suspecting the worst of tommy very probably there was not a thought in the book that had been put in with his old complacent waggle of the head oh am i not a wonder he used to cry when he did anything big but that was no reason why she should suspect him of being conceited still very probably he really and truly felt what he wrotefelt it not only at the time but also next morning in his boyhood mr cathro had christened him sentimental tommy but he was a man now and surely the sentimentalities in which he had dressed himself were flung aside for ever like old suits of clothes so grizel decided eagerly and she was on the point of telling him how proud she was of his book when tommy who had thus far behaved so well of a sudden went to pieces  he and grizel were together elspeth was a little in front of them walking with a gentleman who still wondered what they meant by saying that they had heard his baby cry for hes no here corp had said earnestly to them all though im awid for the time to come when ill be able to bring him to the den and let him see the jacobites lair  there was nothing startling in this remark so far as grizel could discover but she saw that it had an immediate and incomprehensible effect on tommy first he blundered in his talk as if he was thinking deeply of something else then his face shone as it had been wont to light up in his boyhood when he was suddenly enraptured with himself and lastly down his cheek and into his beard there stole a tear of agony obviously tommy was in deep woe for somebody or something  it was a chance for a true lady to show that womanly sympathy of which such exquisite things are said in the first work of t sandys but it merely infuriated grizel who knew that tommy did not feel nearly so deeply as she this return to the den and therefore what was he in such distress about it was silly sentiment of some sort she was sure of that in the old days she would have asked him imperiously to tell her what was the matter with him but she must not do that nowshe dare not even rock her indignant arms she could only walk silently by his side longing fervently to shake him  he had quite forgotten her presence indeed she was not really there for a number of years had passed and he was corp shiach walking the den alone tomorrow he was to bring his boy to show him the old lair and other fondly remembered spots tonight he must revisit them alone so he set out blithely but to his bewilderment he could not find the lair it had not been a tiny hollow where muddy water gathered he remembered an impregnable fortress full of men whose armour rattled as they came and went so this could not be the lair he had taken the wrong way to it for the way was across a lagoon up a deepflowing river then by horse till the rocky ledge terrified all fourfooted things no up a grassy slope had never been the way he came night after night trying different ways but he could not find the golden ladder though all the time he knew that the lair lay somewhere over there when he stood still and listened he could hear the friends of his youth at play and they seemed to be calling are you coming corp why does not corp come back but he could never see them and when he pressed forward their voices died away then at last he said sadly to his boy i shall never be able to show you the lair for i cannot find the way to it and the boy was touched and he said take my hand father and i will lead you to the lair i found the way long ago for myself  it took tommy about two seconds to see all this and perhaps another halfminute was spent in sad but satisfactory contemplation of it then he felt that for the best effect corps home life was too comfortable so gavinia ran away with a soldier he was now so sorry for corp that the tear rolled down but at the same moment he saw how the effect could be still further heightened by doing away with his friends rude state of health and he immediately jammed him between the buffers of two railway carriages and gave him a wooden leg it was at this point that a lady who had kept her arms still too long rocked them frantically then said with cutting satire are you not feeling well or have you hurt yourself you seem to be very lame and tommy woke with a start to see that he was hobbling as if one of his legs were timber to the knee  it is nothing he said modestly something corp said set me thinking that is all  he had told the truth and if what he imagined was twenty times more real to him than what was really there how could tommy help it indignant grizel however who kept such a grip of facts would make no such excuse for him  elspeth she called  there is no need to tell her said tommy but grizel was obdurate  come here elspeth she cried vindictively something corp said a moment ago has made your brother lame  tommy was lame that was all elspeth and corp heard or could think of as they ran back to him when did it happen was he in great pain had he fallen oh why had he not told elspeth at once  it is nothing tommy insisted a little fiercely  he says so grizel explained not to alarm us but he is suffering horribly just before i called to you his face was all drawn up in pain  this made the sufferer wince that was another twinge she said promptly what is to be done elspeth  i think i could carry him suggested corp with a forward movement that made tommy stamp his footthe wooden one  i am all right he told them testily and looking uneasily at grizel  how brave of you to say so said she  it is just like him elspeth said pleased with grizels remark  i am sure it is grizel said so graciously  it was very naughty of her had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of grizels that had been his intention but now a devil entered into tommy and spoke for him  i must have slipped and sprained my ankle he said it is slightly painful but i shall be able to walk home all right corp if you let me use you as a staff  i think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this but as soon as it was said he liked it he was captain stroke playing in the den again after all and playing as well as ever nothing being so real to tommy as pretence i daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting him gently he begged of corp with a gallant smile and clenching his teeth so that the pain should not make him cry out before the ladies thus with his lieutenants help did stroke manage to reach aarons house making light of his mishap assuring them cheerily that he should be all right tomorrow and carefully avoiding grizels eye though he wanted very much to know what she thought of him and of herself now  there were moments when she did not know what to think and that always distressed grizel though it was a state of mind with which tommy could keep on very friendly terms the truth seemed too monstrous for belief was it possible she had misjudged him perhaps he really had sprained his ankle but he had made no pretence of that at first and besidesyes she could not be mistakenit was the other leg  she soon let him see what she was thinking i am afraid it is too serious a case for me she said in answer to a suggestion from corp who had a profound faith in her medical skill but if you likeshe was addressing tommy nowi shall call at dr gemmells on my way home and ask him to come to you  there is no necessity a nights rest is all i need he answered hastily  well you know best she said and there was a look on her face which thomas sandys could endure from no woman  on second thoughts he said i think it would be advisable to have a doctor thank you very much grizel corp can you help me to lift my foot on to that chair softlyahugh  his eyes did not fall before hers and would you mind asking him to come at once grizel he said sweetly  she went straight to the doctor     chapter vii  the beginning of the duel   it was among old dr mcqueens sayings that when he met a man who was certified to be in no way remarkable he wanted to give three cheers there are few of them even in a little place like thrums but david gemmell was one  so mcqueen had always said but grizel was not so sure he is very goodlooking and he does not know it she would point out oh what a remarkable man  she had known him intimately for nearly six years now ever since he became the old doctors assistant on the day when in the tail of some others he came to thrums aged twentyone to apply for the post grizel had even helped to choose him she had a quaint recollection of his being submitted to her by mcqueen who told her to look him over and say whether he would doan odd position in which to place a fourteenyearold girl but grizel had taken it most seriously and indeed of the two men only gemmell dared to laugh  you should not laugh when it is so important she said gravely and he stood abashed although i believe he chuckled again when he retired to his room for the night she was in that room next morning as soon as he had left it to smell the curtains he smoked and see whether he folded his things up neatly and used both the brush and the comb but did not use pomade and slept with his window open and really took a bath instead of merely pouring the water into it and laying the sponge on top oh she knew themand her decision after some days was that though far from perfect he would do if he loved her dear darling doctor sufficiently by this time david was openly afraid of her which grizel noticed and took to be in the circumstances a satisfactory sign  she watched him narrowly for the next year and after that she ceased to watch him at all she was like a congregation become so sure of its ministers soundness that it can risk going to sleep to begin with he was quite incapable of pretending to be anything he was not oh how unlike a boy she had once known his manner like his voice was quiet being himself the son of a doctor he did not dodder through life amazed at the splendid eminence he had climbed to which is the weakness of scottish students when they graduate and often for fifty years afterwards how sweet he was to dr mcqueen never forgetting the respect due to gray hairs never hinting that the new school of medicine knew many things that were hidden from the old and always having the sense to support mcqueen when she was scolding him for his numerous naughty ways when the old doctor came home now on cold nights it was not with his cravat in his pocket and grizel knew very well who had put it round his neck mcqueen never had the humiliation so distressing to an old doctor of being asked by patients to send his assistant instead of coming himself he thought they preferred him and twitted david about it but grizel knew that david had sometimes to order them to prefer the old man she knew that when he said goodnight and was supposed to have gone to his lodgings he was probably off to some poor house where if not he a tired woman must sit the long night through by a sufferers bedside and she realized with joy that his chief reason for not speaking of such things was that he took them as part of his natural work and never even knew that he was kind he was not specially skilful he had taken no honours either at school or college and he considered himself to be a very ordinary young man if you had said that on this point you disagreed with him his manner probably would have implied that he thought you a bit of an ass  when a new man arrives in thrums the women come to their doors to see whether he is goodlooking they said no of tommy when he came back but it had been an emphatic yes for dr gemmell he was tall and very slight and at twentyseven as at twentyone despite the growth of a heavy moustache there was a boyishness about his appearance which is i think what women love in a man more than anything else they are drawn to him by it and they love him out of pity when it goes i suppose it brings back to them some early beautiful stage in the worlds history when men and women played together without fear perhaps it lay in his smile which was so winning that wrinkled old dames spoke of it who had never met the word before smiles being little known in thrums where in a workaday world we find it sufficient either to laugh or to look thrawn his dark curly hair was what grizel was most suspicious of he must be vain of that she thought until she discovered that he was quite sensitive to its being mentioned having ever detested his curls as an eyesore and in his boyhood clipped them savagely to the roots he had such a firm chin if there had been another such chin going abegging i should have liked to clap it on to tommy sandys  tommy sandys all this time we have been neglecting that brave sufferer and while we talk his ankle is swelling and swelling well grizel was not so inconsiderate for she walked very fast and with an exceedingly determined mouth to dr gemmells lodgings he was still in lodgings having refused to turn grizel out of her house though she had offered to let it to him she left word the doctor not being in that he was wanted at once by mr sandys who had sprained his ankle  now then tommy  for an hour perhaps until she went to bed she remained merciless she saw the quiet doctor with the penetrating eyes examining that ankle asking a few questions and looking curiously at his patient then she saw him lift his hat and walk out of the house  it gave her pleasure no it did not while she thought of this tommy she despised there came in front of him a boy who had played with her long ago when no other child would play with her and now he said you have grown cold to me grizel and she nodded assent and little wells of water rose to her eyes and lay there because she had nodded assent  she had never liked dr gemmell so little as when she saw him approaching her house next morning the surgery was still attached to it and very often he came from there his visitingbook in his hand to tell her of his patients even to consult her indeed to talk to grizel about his work without consulting her would have been difficult for it was natural to her to decide what was best for everybody these consultations were very unprofessional but from her first coming to the old doctors house she had taken it as a matter of course that in his practice as in affairs relating to his boots and buttons she should tell him what to do and he should do it mcqueen had introduced his assistant to this partnership halfshamefacedly and with a cautious wink over the little girls head and gemmell fell into line at once showing her his new stethoscope as gravely as if he must abandon it at once should not she approve which fine behaviour however was quite thrown away on grizel who had he conducted himself otherwise would merely have wondered what was the matter with the man and as she was eighteen or more before she saw that she had exceeded her duties it was then of course too late to cease doing it  she knew now how good how forbearing he had been to the little girl and that it was partly because he was acquainted with her touching history the grave courtesy with which he had always treated herand which had sometimes given her as a girl a secret thrill of delight it was so sweet to grizel to be respectedshe knew now to be less his natural manner to women than something that came to him in her presence because he who knew her so well thought her worthy of deference and it helped her more far more than if she had seen it turn to love yet as she received him in her parlor nowher too spotless parlor for not even the ashes in the grate were visible which is a mistakeshe was not very friendly he had discovered what tommy was and as she had been the medium she could not blame him for that but how could he look as calm as ever when such a deplorable thing had happened  what you say is true i knew it before i asked you to go to him and i knew you would find it out but please to remember that he is a man of genius whom it is not for such as you to judge  that was the sort of haughty remark she held ready for him while they talked of other cases but it was never uttered for by and by he said  and then there is mr sandyss ankle a nasty accident i am afraid  was he jesting she looked at him sharply have you not been to see him yet she asked  he thought she had misunderstood him he had been to see mr sandys twice both last night and this morning  and he was sure it was a sprain  unfortunately it was something worsedislocation further mischief might show itself presently  haemorrhage into the neighbouring joint on inflammation she asked scientifically and with scorn  yes  grizel turned away from him i think not she said  well possibly not if mr sandys was careful and kept his foot from the ground for the next week the doctor did not know that she was despising him and he proceeded to pay tommy a compliment i had to reduce the dislocation of course he told her and he bore the wrench splendidly though there is almost no pain more acute  did he ask you to tell me that grizel was thirsting to inquire but she forbore unwittingly however the doctor answered the question i could see he said that mr sandys made light of his sufferings to save his sister pain i cannot recall ever having seen a brother and sister so attached  that was quite true grizel admitted to herself in all her recollections of tommy she could not remember one critical moment in which elspeth had not been foremost in his thoughts it passed through her head even now he must make sure that elspeth is in peace of mind before he can care to triumph over me and she would perhaps have felt less bitter had he put his triumph first  his triumph oh she would show him whether it was a triumph he had destroyed for ever her faith in david gemmell the quiet observant doctor who had such an eye for the false had been deceived as easily as all the others and it made her feel very lonely but never mind tommy should find out and that within the hour that there was one whom he could not cheat her first impulse always her first impulse was to go straight to his side and tell him what she thought of him her second which was neater was to send by messenger her compliments to mr and miss sandys and would they if not otherwise engaged come and have tea with her that afternoon not a word in the note about the ankle but a careful sentence to the effect that she had seen dr gemmell today and proposed asking him to meet them  maggy ann who had conveyed the message came back with the reply elspeth regretted that they could not accept grizels invitation owing to the accident to her brother being very much more serious than grizel seemed to think i cant understand elspeth added why dr gemmell did not tell you this when he saw you  is it a polite letter asked inquisitive maggy ann and grizel assured her that it was most polite i hardly expected it said the plainspoken dame for im thinking by their manner its more than can be said of yours  i merely invited them to come to tea  and him wi his leg broke did you no ken he was lying on chairs  i did not know it was so bad as that maggy ann so my letter seemed to annoy him did it said grizel eagerly and i fear well pleased  it angered her most terrible said maggy ann but no him he gave a sort of a laugh when he read it  a laugh  ay and syne she says it is most heartless of grizel she does not even ask how you are today one would think she did not know of the accident and she says i have a good mind to write her a very stiff letter and says he in a noble melancholic voice we must not hurt grizels feelings he says and she says grizel thinks it was nothing because you bore it so cheerfully oh how little she knows you she says and you are too forgiving she says and says he if i have anything to forgive grizel for i forgive her willingly and syne she quieted down and wrote the letter  forgive her oh how it enraged grizel how like the tommy of old to put it in that way there never had been a boy so good at forgiving people for his own crimes and he always looked so modest when he did it he was reclining on his chairs at this moment she was sure he was forgiving her in every sentence she could have endured it more easily had she felt sure that he was seeing himself as he was but she remembered him too well to have any hope of that  she put on her bonnet and took it off again a terrible thing remember for grizel to be in a state of indecision for the remainder of that day she was not wholly inactive meeting dr gemmell in the street she impressed upon him the advisability of not allowing mr sandys to move for at least a week  he might take a drive in a day or two the doctor thought with his sister  he would be sure to use his foot grizel maintained if you once let him rise from his chair you know they all do and gemmell agreed that she was right so she managed to give tommy as irksome a time as possible  but next day she called to go through another day without letting him see how despicable she thought him was beyond her endurance elspeth was a little stiff at first but tommy received her heartily and with nothing in his manner to show that she had hurt his finer feelings his leg the wrong leg as grizel remembered at once was extended on a chair in front of him but instead of nursing it ostentatiously as so many would have done he made humourous remarks at its expense the fact is he said cheerily that so long as i dont move i never felt better in my life and i daresay i could walk almost as well as either of you only my tyrant of a doctor wont let me try  he told me you had behaved splendidly said grizel while he was reducing the dislocation how brave you are you could not have endured more stoically though there had been nothing the matter with it  it was soon over tommy replied lightly i think elspeth suffered more than i  elspeth told the story of his heroism i could not stay in the room she said it was too terrible and grizel despised too tenderhearted elspeth for that she was so courageous at facing pain herself but tommy had guessed that elspeth was trembling behind the door and he had called out dont cry elspeth i am all right it is nothing at all  how noble was grizels comment when she heard of this and then elspeth was her friend again insisted on her staying to tea and went into the kitchen to prepare it aaron was out  the two were alone now and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize if such was her desire but tommys was a more generous nature his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that grizel should not suffer too much from remorse if she had asked his pardon then and there i am sure he would have replied right willingly grizel and begged her not to give another thought to the matter what is of more importance grizel was sure of this also and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her there seemed to be no disturbing it even when she said which foot is it he answered the one on the chair quite graciously as if she had asked a natural question  grizel pointed out that the other foot must be tired of being a foot in waiting it had got a little exercise tommy replied lightly last night and again this morning when it had helped to convey him to and from his bed  had he hopped she asked brutally  no he said he had shuffled along half rising he attempted to show her humourously how he walked nowadaystried not to wince but had to ugh that was a twinge grizel sarcastically offered her assistance and he took her shoulder gratefully they crossed the rooma tedious journey now let me see if you can manage alone she says and suddenly deserts him  he looked rather helplessly across the room few sights are so pathetic as the strong man of yesterday feeling that the chair by the fire is a distant object today tommy knew how pathetic it was but grizel did not seem to know  try it she said encouragingly it will do you good  illustration and clung to it his teeth set  he got as far as the table and clung to it his teeth set grizel clapped her hands excellently done she said with fell meaning and recommended him to move up and down the room for a little he would feel ever so much the better for it afterwards  the painwasconsiderable he said oh she saw that but he had already proved himself so good at bearing pain and the new school of surgeons held that it was wise to exercise an injured limb  even then it was not a reproachful glance that tommy gave her though there was some sadness in it he moved across the room several times a groan occasionally escaping him admirable said his critic bravo would you like to stop now  not until you tell me to he said determinedly but with a gasp  it must be dreadfully painful she replied coldly but i should like you to go on and he went on until suddenly he seemed to have lost the power to lift his feet his body swayed there was an appealing look on his face dont be afraid you wont fall said grizel but she had scarcely said it when he fainted dead away and went down at her feet  oh how dare you she cried in sudden flame and she drew back from him but after a moment she knew that he was shamming no longeror she knew it and yet could not quite believe it for hurrying out of the room for water she had no sooner passed the door than she swiftly put back her head as if to catch him unawares but he lay motionless  the sight of her dear brother on the floor paralyzed elspeth who could only weep for him and call to him to look at her and speak to her but in such an emergency grizel was as useful as any doctor and by the time gemmell arrived in haste the invalid was being brought to the doctor was a practical man who did not ask questions while there was something better to do had he asked any as he came in grizel would certainly have said he wanted to faint to make me believe he really has a bad ankle and somehow he managed to do it and if the doctor had replied that people cant faint by wishing she would have said that he did not know mr sandys  but with few words gemmell got his patient back to the chairs and proceeded to undo the bandages that were round his ankle grizel stood by assisting silently she had often assisted the doctors but never before with that scornful curl of her lip so the bandages were removed and the ankle laid bare it was very much swollen and discoloured and when grizel saw this she gave a little cry and the ointment she was holding slipped from her hand for the first time since he came to thrums she had failed gemmell at a patients side  i had not expected it to belike this she said in a quivering voice when he looked at her in surprise  it will look much worse tomorrow he assured them grimly i cant understand miss sandys how this came about  miss sandys was not in the room said grizel abjectly but i was and i  tommys face was begging her to stop he was still faint and in pain but all thought of himself left him in his desire to screen her i owe you an apology doctor he said quickly for disregarding your instructions it was entirely my own fault i would try to walk  every step must have been agony the doctor rapped out and grizel shuddered  not nearly so bad as that tommy said for her sake  agony insisted the doctor as if for once he enjoyed the word it was a mad thing to do as surely you could guess grizel why did you not prevent him  she certainly did her best to stop me tommy said hastily but i suppose i had some insane fit on me for do it i would i am very sorry doctor  his face was wincing with pain and he spoke jerkily but the doctor was still angry he felt that there was something between these two which he did not understand and it was strange to him and unpleasant to find grizel unable to speak for herself i think he doubted tommy from that hour all he said in reply however was it is unnecessary to apologize to me you yourself are the only sufferer  but was tommy the only sufferer gemmell left and elspeth followed him to listen to those precious words which doctors drop as from a vial on the other side of a patients door and then grizel who had been standing at the window with head averted turned slowly round and looked at the man she had wronged her arms which had been hanging rigid the fists closed went out to him to implore forgiveness i dont know how she held herself up and remained dryeyed her whole being wanted so much to sink by the side of his poor tortured foot and bathe it in her tears  so you see he had won nothing to do now but forgive her beautifully go on tommy you are good at it  but the unexpected only came out of tommy never was there a softer heart in london the old lady who sold matches at the street corner had got all his pence had he heard her or any other mourning a son sentenced to the gallows he would immediately have wondered whether he might take the condemned ones place what a speech tommy could have delivered from the scaffold there was nothing he would not jump at doing for a woman in distress except perhaps destroy his notebook and grizel was in anguish she was his suppliant his brave lonely little playmate of the past the noble girl of today grizel whom he liked so much as through a magnifyingglass he saw her topheavy with remorse for life unable to sleep of nights crushed and  he was not made of the stuff that could endure it the truth must out grizel he said impulsively you have nothing to be sorry for you were quite right i did not hurt my foot that night in the den but afterwards when i was alone before the doctor came i wricked it here intentionally in the door it sounds incredible but i set my teeth and did it grizel because you had challenged me to a duel and i would not give in  as soon as it was out he was proud of himself for having the generosity to confess it he looked at grizel expectantly  yes it sounded incredible and yet she saw that it was true as elspeth returned at that moment grizel could say nothing she stood looking at him only over her high collar of fur tommy actually thought that she was admiring him     chapter viii  what grizels eyes said   to be the admired of womenhow tommy had fought for it since first he drank of them in pyms sparkling pages to some it seems to be easy but to him it was a labour of sisyphus everything had been against him but he concentrated no labour was too herculean he was prepared if necessary to walk round the world to get to the other side of the wall across which some men can step and he did take a roundabout way it is my opinion for instance that he wrote his book in order to make a beginning with the ladies  that as it may be at all events he is on the right side of the wall now and here is even grizel looking wistfully at him had she admired him for something he was not and a good many of them did that he would have been ill satisfied he wanted her to think him splendid because he was splendid and the more he reflected the more clearly he saw that he had done a big thing how many men would have had the courage to wrick their foot as he had done he shivered when he thought of it and even of these spartans how many would have let the reward slip through their fingers rather than wound the feelings of a girl these had not been his thoughts when he made confession he had spoken on an impulse but now that he could step out and have a look at himself he saw that this made it a still bigger thing he was modestly pleased that he had not only got grizels admiration but earned it and he was very kind to her when next she came to see him no one could be more kind to them than he when they admired him he had the most grateful heart had our tommy  when next she came to see him that was while his ankle still nailed him to the chair a fortnight or so during which tommy was at his best sending gracious messages by elspeth to the many who called to inquire and writing hard at his new work pad on knee so like a brave soul whom no unmerited misfortune could subdue that it would have done you good merely to peep at him through the window grizel came several times and the three talked very ordinary things mostly reminiscences she was as much a plainspoken princess as ever but often he found her eyes fixed on him wistfully and he knew what they were saying they spoke so eloquently that he was a little nervous lest elspeth should notice it was delicious to tommy to feel that there was this little unspoken something between him and grizel he half regretted that the time could not be far distant when she must put it into wordsas soon say as elspeth left the room an exquisite moment no doubt but it would be the plucking of the flower  dont think that tommy conceived grizel to be in love with him on my sacred honour that would have horrified him  curiously enough she did not take the first opportunity elspeth gave her of telling him in words how much she admired his brave confession she was so honest that he expected her to begin the moment the door closed and now that the artistic time had come for it he wanted it but no he was not hurt but he wondered at her shyness and cast about for the reason he cast far back into the past and caught a little girl who had worn this same wistful face when she admired him most he compared those two faces of the anxious girl and the serene woman and in the wistfulness that sometimes lay on them both they looked alike was it possible that the fear of him which the years had driven out of the girl still lived a ghosts life to haunt the woman  at once he overflowed with pity as a boy he had exulted in grizels fear of him as a man he could feel only the pain of it there was no one he thought less to be dreaded of a woman than he oh so sure tommy was of that and he must lay this ghost he gave his whole heart to the laying of it  few men and never a woman could do a fine thing so delicately as he but of course it included a divergence from the truth for to tommy afloat on a generous scheme the truth was a buoy marking sunken rocks she had feared him in her childhood as he knew well he therefore proceeded to prove to her that she had never feared him she had thought him masterful and all his reminiscences now went to show that it was she who had been the masterful one  you must often laugh now he said to remember how i feared you the memory of it makes me afraid of you still i assure you i joukit back as corp would say that day i saw you in church it was the instinct of selfpreservation here comes grizel to lord it over me again i heard something inside me saying you called me masterful and yet i had always to give in to you that shows what a gentle yielding girl you were and what a masterful character i was  his intention you see was without letting grizel know what he was at to make her think he had forgotten certain unpleasant incidents in their past so that seeing they were no longer anything to him they might the sooner become nothing to her and she believed that he had forgotten and she was glad she smiled when he told her to go on being masterful for old acquaintance had made him like it hers indeed was a masterful nature she could not help it and if the time ever came when she must help it the glee of living would be gone from her  she did continue to be masterfulto a greater extent than tommy thus nobly behaving was prepared for and his shock came to him at the very moment when he was modestly expecting to receive the prize she had called when elspeth happened to be out and though now able to move about the room with the help of a staff he was still an interesting object he saw that she thought so and perhaps it made him hobble slightly more not vaingloriously but because he was such an artist he ceased to be an artist suddenly however when grizel made this unexpected remark  how vain you are  tommy sat down quite pale did you come here to say that to me grizel he inquired and she nodded frankly over her high collar of fur he knew it was true as grizel said it but though taken aback he could bear it for she was looking wistfully at him and he knew well what grizels wistful look meant so long as women admired him tommy could bear anything from them god knows i have little to be vain of he said humbly  those are the people who are most vain she replied and he laughed a short laugh which surprised her she was so very serious  your methods are so direct he explained but of what am i vain grizel is it my book  no she answered not about your book but about meaner things what else could have made you dislocate your ankle rather than admit that you had been rather silly  now silly is no word to apply to a gentleman and despite his forgiving nature tommy was a little disappointed in grizel  i suppose it was a silly thing to do he said with just a touch of stiffness  it was an ignoble thing said she sadly  i see and i myself am the meaner thing than the book am i  are you not she asked so eagerly that he laughed again  it is the first compliment you have paid my book he pointed out  i like the book very much she answered gravely no one can be more proud of your fame than i you are hurting me very much by pretending to think that it is a pleasure to me to find fault with you  there was no getting past the honesty of her and he was touched by it besides she did admire him and that after all is the great thing  then why say such things grizel he replied goodnaturedly  but if they are true  still let us avoid them said he and at that she was most distressed  it is so like what you used to say when you were a boy she cried  you are so anxious to have me grow up he replied with proper dolefulness if you like the book grizel you must have patience with the kind of thing that produced it that night in the den when i won your scorn i was in the preliminary stages of composition at such times an author should be locked up but i had got out you see i was so enamoured of my little fancies that i forgot i was with you no wonder you were angry  i was not angry with you for forgetting me she said sharply there was no catching grizel however artful you were but you were sighing to yourself you were looking as tragic as if some dreadful calamity had occurred  the idea that had suddenly come to me was a touching one he said  but you looked triumphant too  that was because i saw i could make something of it  why did you walk as if you were lame  the man i was thinking of tommy explained had broken his leg i dont mind telling you that it was corp  he ought to have minded telling her for it could only add to her indignation but he was too conceited to give weight to that  corps leg was not broken said practical grizel  i broke it for him replied tommy and when he had explained her eyes accused him of heartlessness  if it had been my own he said in selfdefence it should have gone crack just the same  poor gavinia had you no feeling for her  gavinia was not there tommy replied triumphantly she had run off with a soldier  you dared to conceive that  it helped  grizel stamped her foot you could take away dear gavinias character with a smile  on the contrary said tommy my heart bled for her did you not notice that i was crying but he could not make grizel smile so to please her he said with a smile that was not very sincere i wish i were different but that is how ideas come to meat least all those that are of any value  surely you could fight against them and drive them away  this to tommy who held out sugar to them to lure them to him but still he treated her with consideration  that would mean my giving up writing altogether grizel he said kindly  then why not give it up  really but she admired him and still he bore with her  i dont like the book she said if it is written at such a cost  people say the book has done them good grizel  what does that matter if it does you harm in her eagerness to persuade him her words came pellmell if writing makes you live in such an unreal world it must do you harm i see now what mr cathro meant long ago when he called you senti  tommy winced i remember what mr cathro called me he said with surprising hauteur for such a goodnatured man but he does not call me that now no one calls me that now except you grizel  what does that matter she replied distressfully if it is true in the definition of sentimentality in the dictionary  he rose indignantly you have been looking me up in the dictionary have you grizel  yes the night you told me you had hurt your ankle intentionally  he laughed without mirth now i thought you had put that down to vanity  i think she said it was vanity that gave you the courage to do it and he liked one word in this remark  then you do give me credit for a little courage  i think you could do the most courageous things she told him so long as there was no real reason why you should do them  it was a shot that rang the bell oh our tommy heard it ringing but to do him justice he bore no malice he was proud rather of grizels marksmanship at least he said meekly it was courageous of me to tell you the truth in the end but to his surprise she shook her head  no she replied it was sweet of you you did it impulsively because you were sorry for me and i think it was sweet but impulse is not courage  so now tommy knew all about it his plainspoken critic had been examining him with a candle and had paid particular attention to his defects but against them she set the fact that he had done something chivalrous for her and it held her heart though the others were in possession of the head how like a woman he thought with a pleased smile he knew them  still he was chagrined that she made so little of his courage and it was to stab her that he said with subdued bitterness i always had a suspicion that i was that sort of person and it is pleasant to have it pointed out by ones oldest friend no one will ever accuse you of want of courage grizel  she was looking straight at him and her eyes did not drop but they looked still more wistful tommy did not understand the courage that made her say what she had said but he knew he was hurting her he knew that if she was too plainspoken it was out of loyalty and that to wound grizel because she had to speak her mind was a shameyes he always knew that  but he could do it he could even go on and it is satisfactory that you have thought me out so thoroughly because you will not need to think me out any more you know me now grizel and can have no more fear of me  when was i ever afraid of you she demanded she was looking at him suspiciously now  never as a girl he asked it jumped out of him he was sorry as soon as he had said it  there was a long pause so you remembered it all the time she said quietly you have been making pretenceagain  he asked her to forgive him and she nodded her head at once but why did you pretend to have forgotten  i thought it would please you grizel  why should pretence please me she rose suddenly in a white heat you dont mean to say that you think i am afraid of you still  he said no a moment too late he knew it was too late  dont be angry with me grizel he begged her earnestly i am so glad i was mistaken it made me miserable i have been a terrible blunderer but i mean well i misread your eyes  my eyes  they have always seemed to be watching me and often there was such a wistful look in themit reminded me of the past  you thought i was still afraid of you say it said grizel stamping her foot but he would not say it it was not merely fear that he thought he had seen in her eyes you remember this was still his comfort and i suppose it gave the touch of complacency to his face that made grizel merciless she did not mean to be merciless but only to tell the truth if some of her words were scornful there was sadness in her voice all the time instead of triumph for years and years she said standing straight as an elvint i have been able to laugh at all the ignorant fears of my childhood and if you dont know why i have watched you and been unable to help watching you since you came back i shall tell you but i think you might have guessed you who write books about women it is because i liked you when you were a boy you were often horrid but you were my first friend when every other person was against me you let me play with you when no other boy or girl would let me play and so all the time you have been away i have been hoping that you were growing into a noble man and when you came back i watched to see whether you were the noble man i wanted you so much to be and you are not do you see now why my eyes look wistful it is because i wanted to admire you and i cant  she went away and the great authority on women raged about the room oh but he was galled there had been five feet nine of him but he was shrinking by and by the red light came into his eyes     chapter ix  gallant behaviour of t sandys   there were now no fewer than three men engaged each in his own way in the siege of grizel nothing in common between them except insulted vanity one was a broken fellow who took for granted that she preferred to pass him by in the street his bow was also an apology to her for his existence he not only knew that she thought him wholly despicable but agreed with her in the long ago yesterday for instance he had been happy courted esteemed he had even esteemed himself and so done useful work in the world but she had flung him to earth so heavily that he had made a hole in it out of which he could never climb there he lay damned hers the glory of destroying himhe hoped she was proud of her handiwork that was one thomas sandys the one perhaps who put on the velvet jacket in the morning but it might be number two who took that jacket off at night he was a goodnatured cynic vastly amused by the airs this little girl put on before a man of note and he took a malicious pleasure in letting her see that they entertained him he goaded her intentionally into expressions of temper because she looked prettiest then and trifled with her hair but this was in imagination only and called her a quaint child but this was beneath his breath the thirdhe might be the one who wore the jacketwas a haughty boy who was not only done with her for ever but meant to let her see it his soul cried oh oh for a conservatory and some of societys darlings and grizel at the window to watch how he got on with them and now that i think of it there was also a fourth sandys the grave author whose life in two vols 8vo i ought at this moment to be writing without a word about the other tommies they amused him a good deal when they were doing something big he would suddenly appear and take a note of it  the boy who was stiffly polite to her when tommy was angry he became very polite told her that he had been invited to the spittal the seat of the rintoul family and that he understood there were some charming girls there  i hope you will like them grizel said pleasantly  if you could see how they will like me he wanted to reply but of course he could not and unfortunately there was no one by to say it for him tommy often felt this want of a secretary  the abject one found a glove of grizels that she did not know she had lost and put it in his pocket there it lay unknown to her he knew that he must not even ask them to bury it with him in his grave this was a little thing to ask but too much for him he saw his effects being examined after all that was mortal of t sandys had been consigned to earth and this pathetic little glove coming to light ah then then grizel would know by the way what would she have known i am sure i cannot tell you nor could tommy forced to face the question in this vulgar way have told you yet whatever it was it gave him some moist moments if grizel saw him in this mood her reproachful look implied that he was sentimentalizing again how little this chit understood him  the man of the world sometimes came upon the glove in his pocket and laughed at it as such men do when they recall their callow youth he took walks with grizel without her knowing that she accompanied him or rather he let her come she was so eager in his imagination for bright were the dreams of thomas he saw her looking longingly after him just as the dog looks and then not being really a cruel man he would call over his shoulder put on your hat little woman you can come then he conceived her wandering with him through the den and caddam wood clinging to his arm and looking up adoringly at him what a loving little soul it is he said and pinched her ear whereat she glowed with pleasure but i forgot he would add bantering her you dont admire me heighho grizel wants to admire me but she cant he got some satisfaction out of these flights of fancy but it had a scurvy way of deserting him in the hour of greatest need where was it for instance when the real grizel appeared and fixed that inquiring eye on him  he went to the spittal several times elspeth with him when she cared to go for lady rintoul and all the others had to learn and remember that unless they made much of elspeth there could be no t sandys for them he glared at anyone male or female who on being introduced to elspeth did not remain obviously impressed by her side give pleasure to elspeth or away i go was written all over him and it had to be the right kind of pleasure too the ladies must feel that she was more innocent than they and talk accordingly he would walk the flowergarden with none of them until he knew for certain that the man walking it with little elspeth was a person to be trusted once he was convinced of this however he was very much at their service and so little to be trusted himself that perhaps they should have had careful brothers also he told them one at a time that they were strangely unlike all the other women he had known and held their hands a moment longer than was absolutely necessary and then went away leaving them and him a prey to conflicting and puzzling emotions  lord rintoul whose hair was so like his skin that in the family portraits he might have been painted in one colour could never rid himself of the feeling that it must be a great thing to a writing chap to get a good dinner but her ladyship always explained him away with an apologetic smile which went over his remarks like a piece of indiarubber so that in the end he had never said anything she was a slight pretty woman of nearly forty and liked tommy because he remembered so vividly her coming to the spittal as a bride he even remembered how she had been dressedher white bonnet for instance  for long tommy said musing i resented other women in white bonnets it seemed profanation  how absurd she told him laughing you must have been quite a small boy at the time  but with a lonely boys passionate admiration for beautiful things he answered and his gravity was a gentle rebuke to her it was all a long time ago he said taking both her hands in his but i never forget and dear lady i have often wanted to thank you what he was thanking her for is not precisely clear but she knew that the artistic temperament is an odd sort of thing and from this time lady rintoul liked tommy and even tried to find the right wife for him among the families of the surrounding clergy his step was sometimes quite springy when he left the spittal but grizels shadow was always waiting for him somewhere on the way home to take the life out of him and after that it was again oh sorrowful disillusion oh world gone gray grizel did not admire him t sandys was no longer a wonder to grizel he went home to that as surely as the labourer to his evening platter  and now we come to the affair of the slugs corp had got a holiday and they were off together fishing the drumly water by lord rintouls permission they had fished the drumly many a time without it and this was to be another such day as those of old the one who woke at four was to rouse the other never had either waked at four but one of them was married now and any woman can wake at any hour she chooses so at four corp was pushed out of bed and soon thereafter they took the road grizels blinds were already up do you mind corp said how often when we had boasted we were to start at four and didna get roaded till six we wriggled by that window so that grizel shouldna see us  she usually did see us tommy replied ruefully grizel always spotted us corp when we had anything to hide and missed us when we were anxious to be seen  there was no jouking her said corp do you mind how that used to bother you a senseless remark to a man whom it was bothering stillor shall we say to a boy for the boy came back to tommy when he heard the drumly singing it was as if he had suddenly seen his mother looking young again there had been a thundershower as they drew near followed by a rush of wind that pinned them to a dike swept the road bare banged every door in the glen and then sank suddenly as if it had never been like a mole in the sand but now the sun was out every fence and farmyard rope was a string of diamond drops there was one to every blade of grass they lurked among the wild roses larks drunken with song shook them from their wings the whole earth shone so gloriously with them that for a time tommy ceased to care whether he was admired we can pay nature no higher compliment  but when they came to the slugs the slugs of kenny is a wild crevice through which the drumly cuts its way black and treacherous into a lovely glade where it gambols for the rest of its short life you would not believe to see it laughing that it had so lately escaped from prison to the slugs they made their waynot to fish for any trout that are there are thinking for ever of the way out and of nothing else but to eat their luncheon and they ate it sitting on the mossy stones their persons had long ago helped to smooth and looking at a roanbranch which now as then was trailing in the water  there were no fish to catch but there was a boy trying to catch them he was on the opposite bank had crawled down it only other boys can tell how a barefooted urchin of ten or twelve with an enormous bagful of worms hanging from his jacket button to put a new worm on the hook without coming to destruction he first twisted his legs about a young birch and put his arms round it he was after a big one he informed corp though he might as well have been fishing in a treatise on the art of angling  corp exchanged pleasantries with him told him that tommy was captain ure and that he was his faithful servant alexander bett both of edinburgh since the birth of his child corp had become something of a humourist tommy was not listening as he lolled in the sun he was turning without his knowledge into one of the other tommies let us watch the process  he had found a halffledged mavis lying dead in the grass remember also how the larks had sung after rain  tommy lost sight and sound of corp and the boy what he seemed to see was a baby lark that had got out of its nest sideways a fall of half a foot only but a dreadful drop for a baby you can get back this way its mother said and showed it the way which was quite easy but when the baby tried to leap it fell on its back then the mother marked out lines on the ground from one to the other of which it was to practise hopping and soon it could hop beautifully so long as its mother was there to say every moment how beautifully you hop now teach me to hop up the little lark said meaning that it wanted to fly and the mother tried to do that also but in vain she could soar up up up bravely but could not explain how she did it this distressed her very much and she thought hard about how she had learned to fly long ago last year but all she could recall for certain was that you suddenly do it wait till the sun comes out after rain she said half remembering what is sun what is rain the little bird asked if you cannot teach me to fly teach me to sing when the sun comes out after rain the mother replied then you will know how to sing the rain came and glued the little birds wings together i shall never be able to fly nor to sing it wailed then of a sudden it had to blink its eyes for a glorious light had spread over the world catching every leaf and twig and blade of grass in tears and putting a smile into every tear the baby birds breast swelled it did not know why and it fluttered from the ground it did not know how the sun has come out after the rain it trilled thank you sun thank you thank you oh mother did you hear me i can sing and it floated up up up crying thank you thank you thank you to the sun oh mother do you see me i am flying and being but a baby it soon was gasping but still it trilled the same ecstasy and when it fell panting to earth it still trilled and the distracted mother called to it to take breath or it would die but it could not stop thank you thank you thank you it sang to the sun till its little heart burst  with filmy eyes tommy searched himself for the little pocketbook in which he took notes of such sad thoughts as these and in place of the book he found a glove wrapped in silk paper he sat there with it in his hand nodding his head over it so brokenheartedly you could not have believed that he had forgotten it for several days  death was still his subject but it was no longer a bird he saw it was a very noble young man and his white dead face stared at the sky from the bottom of a deep pool i dont know how he got there but a woman who would not admire him had something to do with it no sun after rain had come into that tragic life to the water that had ended it his white face seemed to be saying thank you thank you thank you it was the old story of a faithless woman he had given her his heart and she had played with it for her sake he had striven to be famous for her alone had he toiled through dreary years in london the goal her lap in which he should one day place his booka poor trivial little work he knew yet much admired by the best critics never had his thoughts wandered for one instant of that time to another woman he had been as faithful in life as in death and now she came to the edge of the pool and peered down at his staring eyes and laughed  he had got thus far when a shout from corp brought him dazed to his feet it had been preceded by another cry as the boy and the sapling he was twisted round toppled into the river together uprooted stones and clods pounding after them and discolouring the pool into which the torrent rushes between rocks to swirl frantically before it dives down a narrow channel and leaps into another caldron  there was no climbing down those precipitous rocks corp was shouting gesticulating impotent how can you stand so still he roared  for tommy was standing quite still like one not yet thoroughly awake the boys head was visible now and again as he was carried round in the seething water when he came to the outer ring down that channel he must infallibly go and every second or two he was in a wider circle  tommy was awake now and he could not stand still and see a boy drown before his eyes he knew that to attempt to save him was to face a terrible danger especially as he could not swim but he kicked off his boots there was some gallantry in the man  you wouldna dare corp cried aghast  tommy hesitated for a moment but he had abundance of physical courage he clenched his teeth and jumped but before he jumped he pushed the glove into corps hand saying give her that and tell her it never left my heart he did not say who she was he scarcely knew that he was saying it it was his dream intruding on reality as a wheel may revolve for a moment longer after the spring breaks  corp saw him strike the water and disappear he tore along the bank as he had never run before until he got to the waters edge below the slugs and climbed and fought his way to the scene of the disaster before he reached it however we should have had no hero had not the sapling the cause of all this pother made amends by barring the way down the narrow channel tommy was clinging to it and the boy to him and at some risk corp got them both ashore where they lay gasping like fish in a creel  the boy was the first to rise to look for his fishingrod and he was surprised to find no sixpounder at the end of it she has broke the line again he said for he was sure then and ever afterwards that a big one had pulled him in  corp slapped him for his ingratitude but the man who had saved this boys life wanted no thanks off to your home with you wherever it is he said to the boy who obeyed silently and then to corp he is a little fool corp but not such a fool as i am he lay on his face shivering not from cold not from shock but in a horror of himself i think it may fairly be said that he had done a brave if foolhardy thing it was certainly to save the boy that he had jumped and he had given himself a moments time in which to draw back if he chose which vastly enhances the merit of the deed but sentimentality had been there also and he was now shivering with a presentiment of the length to which it might one day carry him  they lit a fire among the rocks at which he dried his clothes and then they set out for home corp doing all the talking what a town there will be about this in thrums was his text and he was surprised when tommy at last broke silence by saying passionately never speak about this to me again corp as long as you live promise me that promise never to mention it to anyone i want no one to know what i did today and no one will ever know unless you tell the boy cant tell for we are strangers to him  he thinks you are a captain ure and that im alexander bett his servant said corp i telled him that for a divert  then let him continue to think that  of course corp promised and ill go to the stake afore i break my promise he swore happily remembering one of the jacobite oaths but he was puzzled they would make so much of tommy if they knew they would think him a wonder did he not want that  no tommy replied  you used to like it you used to like it most michty  i have changed  ay you have but since when since you took to making printed books  tommy did not say but it was more recently than that what he was surrendering no one could have needed to be told less than he the magnitude of the sacrifice was what enabled him to make it he was always at home among the superlatives it was the little things that bothered him in his present fear of the ride that sentimentality might yet goad him to he craved for mastery over self he knew that his struggles with his familiar usually ended in an embrace and he had made a passionate vow that it should be so no longer the best beginning of the new man was to deny himself the glory that would be his if his deed were advertised to the world even grizel must never know of itgrizel whose admiration was so dear to him thus he punished himself and again i think he deserves respect     chapter x  gavinia on the track   corp you remember had said that he would go to the stake rather than break his promise and he meant it too though what the stake was and why such a pother about going to it he did not know he was to learn now however for to the stake he had to go this was because gavinia when folding up his clothes found in one of the pockets a glove wrapped in silk paper  tommy had forgotten it until too late for when he asked corp for the glove it was already in gavinias possession and she had declined to return it without an explanation you must tell her nothing tommy said sternly he was uneasy but relieved to find that corp did not know whose glove it was nor even why gentlemen carry a ladys glove in their pocket  at first gavinia was mildly curious only but her husbands refusal to answer any questions roused her dander she tried cajolery fried his take of trout deliciously for him and he sat down to them sniffing they were small and the remainder of their brief career was in two parts first he lifted them by the tail then he laid down the tail but not a word about the glove  she tried tears dinna greet woman he said in distress what would the bairn say if he kent i made you greet  gavinia went on greeting and the baby waking up promptly took her side  dn the thing said corp  your ain bairn  i meant the glove he roared  it was curiosity only that troubled gavinia a reader of romance as you may remember she had encountered in the printed page a score of ladies who on finding such parcels in their husbands pockets left their homes at once and for ever and she had never doubted but that it was the only course to follow such is the power of the writer of fiction but when the case was her own she was merely curious such are the limitations of the writer of fiction that there was a woman in it she did not believe for a moment this of course did not prevent her saying with a sob wha is the woman  with great earnestness corp assured her that there was no woman he even proved it just listen to reason gavinia if i was sich a black as to be chief wi ony woman and she wanted to gie me a present weel she might gie me a pair o gloves but one glove what use would one glove be to me i tell you if a woman had the impidence to gie me one glove i would fling it in her face  nothing could have been clearer and he had put it thus considerately because when a woman even the shrewdest of them is excited any man knows this one has to explain matters to her as simply and patiently as if she were a fouryearold yet gavinia affected to be unconvinced and for several days she led corp the life of a lodger in his own house  hands off that poor innocent she said when he approached the baby  if he reproved her she replied meekly what can you expect frae a woman that doesna wear gloves  to the baby she said he despises you my bonny because you hae no gloves ay thats what maks him turn up his nose at you but your mother is fond o you gloves or no gloves  she told the baby the story of the glove daily with many monstrous additions  when corp came home from his work she said that a poor lovelorn female had called with a boot for him and a request that he should carry it in the pocket of his sabbath breeks  worst of all she listened to what he said in the night corp had a habit of talking in his sleep he was usually taking tickets at such times and it had been her custom to stop him violently but now she changed her tactics she encouraged him i would be lying in my bed he said to tommy dreaming that a man had fallen into the slugs and instead o trying to save him i cried out tickets there all tickets ready and first he hands me a glove and neist he hands me a boot and havers o that kind sich as onybody dreams but in the middle o my dream it comes ower me that i had better waken up to see what gavinias doing and i open my een and there she is sitting up hearkening avidly to my every word and putting sly questions to me about the glove  what glove tommy asked coldly  the glove in silk paper  i never heard of it said tommy  corp sighed no he said loyally neither did i and he went back to the station and sat gloomily in a wagon he got no help from tommy not even when rumours of the incident at the slugs became noised abroad  abody kens about the laddie now he said  what laddie tommy inquired  him that fell into the slugs  ah yes tommy said i have just been reading about it in the paper a plucky fellow this captain ure who saved him i wonder who he is  i wonder corp said with a groan  there was an alexander bett with him according to the papers tommy went on do you know any bett  its no a thrums name corp replied thankfully i just made it up  what do you mean tommy asked blankly  corp sighed and went back again to the wagon he was particularly truculent that evening when the sixoclock train came in tickets there look slippy wi your tickets his head bobbed up at the window of another compartment tick he began and then he ducked  the compartment contained a boy looking as scared as if he had just had his face washed and an old woman who was clutching a large linen bag as if expecting some scoundrel to appear through the floor and grip it with her other hand she held on to the boy and being unused to travel they were both sitting very selfconscious humble and defiant like persons in church who have forgotten to bring their bible the general effect however was lost on corp for whom it was enough that in one of them he recognized the boy of the slugs he thought he had seen the old lady before also but he could not give her a name it was quite a relief to him to notice that she was not wearing gloves  he heard her inquiring for one alexander bett and being told that there was no such person in thrums hes married on a woman of the name of gavinia said the old lady and then they directed her to the house of the only gavinia in the place with dark forebodings corp skulked after her he remembered who she was now she was the old woman with the nutcracker face on whom he had cried in more than a year ago to say that gavinia was to have him her mud cottage had been near the slugs yes and this was the boy who had been supping porridge with her corp guessed rightly that the boy had remembered his unlucky visit im doomed corp muttered to himselfpronouncing it in another way  the woman the boy and the bag entered the house of gavinia and presently she came out with them she was looking very important and terrible they went straight to ailies cottage and corp was wondering why when he suddenly remembered that tommy was to be there at tea today     chapter xi  the teaparty   it was quite a large teaparty and was held in what had been the schoolroom nothing there now however to recall an academic past for even the space against which a map of the world mercators projection had once hung was gone the colour of the rest of the walls and with it had faded away the last relic of the hanky school  it will not fade so quickly from my memory tommy said to please mrs mclean his affection for his old schoolmistress was as sincere as hers for him i could tell you of scores of pretty things he had done to give her pleasure since his return all carried out too with a delicacy which few men could rival and never a woman but they might make you like him so we shall pass them by  ailie said blushing that she had taught him very little everything i know he replied and then with a courteous bow to the gentleman opposite except what i learned from mr cathro  thank you cathro said shortly tommy had behaved splendidly to him and called him his dear preceptor and yet the dominie still itched to be at him with the tawse as of old and fine he knows im itching he reflected which made him itch the more  it should have been a most successful party for in the rehearsals between the hostess and her maid christina every conceivable difficulty had been ironed out ailie was wearing her black silk but without the honiton lace so that miss sophia innes need not become depressed and she had herself taken the chair with the weak back mr cathro who though a lean man needed a great deal of room at table had been seated far away from the spinet to allow christina to pass him without climbing miss sophia and grizel had the doctor between them and there was also a bachelor but an older one for elspeth mr mclean as stout and humoursome as of yore had solemnly promised his wife to be jocular but not too jocular neither minister could complain for if mr dishart had been asked to say grace mr gloag knew that he was to be called on for the benediction christina obeying strict orders glided round the table leisurely as if she were not in the least excited though she could be heard rushing along the passage like one who had entered for a race and lastly there was as chief guest the celebrated thomas sandys it should have been a triumph of a teaparty and yet it was not mrs mclean could not tell why  grizel could have told why her eyes told why every time they rested scornfully on mr sandys it was he they said who was spoiling the entertainment and for the pitiful reason that the company were not making enough of him he was the guest of the evening but they were talking admiringly of another man and so he sulked oh how she scorned tommy  that other man was of course the unknown captain ure gallant rescuer of boys hero of all who admire brave actions except the jealous sandys tommy had poohpoohed him from the first to grizels unutterable woe  have you not one word of praise for such a splendid deed she had asked in despair  i see nothing splendid about it he replied coldly  i advise you in your own interests not to talk in that way to others she said dont you see what they will say  i cant help that answered tommy the just if they ask my opinion i must give them the truth i thought you were fond of the truth grizel  to that she could only wring her hands and say nothing but it had never struck her that the truth could be so bitter  and now he was giving his opinion at mrs mcleans party and they were all against him except in a measure elspeths bachelor who said cheerily we should all have done it if we had been in captain ures place i would have done it myself miss elspeth though not fond of the water he addressed all single ladies by their christian name with a miss in front of it this is the mark of the confirmed bachelor and comes upon him at oneandtwenty  i could not have done it grizel replied decisively though she was much the bravest person present and he explained that he meant the men only his name was james bonthron let us call him mr james  men are so brave she responded with her eyes on tommy and he received the stab in silence had the blood spouted from the wound it would have been an additional gratification to him tommy was like those superb characters of romance who bare their breast to the enemy and say strike  well well mr cathro observed none of us was on the spot and so we had no opportunity of showing our heroism but you were near by mr sandys and if you had fished up the water that day instead of down you might have been called upon i wonder what you would have done  yes tommy was exasperating to him still as in the long ago and cathro said this maliciously yet feeling that he did a risky thing so convinced was he by old experience that you were getting in the way of a roadmachine when you opposed thomas sandys  i wonder tommy replied quietly  the answer made a poor impression and cathro longed to go on but he was always most dangerous when he was quiet he reflected uneasily and checked himself in sheer funk  mr gloag came as he thought to tommys defence if mr sandys questions he said heavily whether courage would have been vouchsafed to him at that trying hour it is right and fitting that he should admit it with christian humility  quite so quite so mr james agreed with heartiness he had begun to look solemn at the word vouchsafed  for we are differently gifted continued mr gloag now addressing his congregation to some is given courage to some learning to some grace each has his strong point he ended abruptly and tucked reverently into the jam which seemed to be his  if he would not have risked his life to save the boy elspeth interposed hotly it would have been because he was thinking of me  i should like to believe that thought of you would have checked me tommy said  i am sure it would said grizel  mr cathro was rubbing his hands together covertly yet half wishing he could take her aside and whisper be canny its grand to hear you but be canny he is looking most extraordinar meek and unless he has cast his skin since he was a laddie its not chancey to meddle with him when he is meek  the doctor also noticed that grizel was pressing tommy too hard and though he did not like the man he was surprisedhe had always thought her so fairminded  for my part he said i dont admire the unknown half so much for what he did as for his behaviour afterwards to risk his life was something but to disappear quietly without taking any credit for it was finer and i should say much more difficult  i think it was sweet of him grizel said  i dont see it said tommy and the silence that followed should have been unpleasant to him but he went on calmly doubtless it was a mere impulse that made him jump into the pool and impulse is not courage he was quoting grizel now you observe and though he did not look at her he knew her eyes were fixed on him reproachfully and so he concluded i suppose captain ure knew he had done no great thing and preferred to avoid exaggerated applause  even elspeth was troubled but she must defend her dear brother he would have avoided it himself she explained quickly he dislikes praise so much that he does not understand how sweet it is to smaller people  this made tommy wince he was always distressed when timid elspeth blurted out things of this sort in company and not the least of his merits was that he usually forbore from chiding her for it afterwards so reluctant was he to hurt her in a world where there were no women except elspeths tommy would have been a saint he saw the doctor smiling now and at once his annoyance with her changed to wrath against him for daring to smile at little elspeth she saw the smile too and blushed but she was not angry she knew that the people who smiled at her liked her and that no one smiled so much at her as dr gemmell  the dominie said fearfully i have no doubt that explains it miss sandys even as a boy i remember your brother had a horror of vulgar applause  now he said to himself he will rise up and smite me but no tommy replied quietly  i am afraid that was not my character mr cathro but i hope i have changed since then and that i could pull a boy out of the water without wanting to be extolled for it  that he could say such things before her was terrible to grizel it was perhaps conceivable that he might pull the boy out of the water as he so ungenerously expressed it but that he could refrain from basking in the glory thereof that she knew was quite impossible her eyes begged him to take back those shameful words but he bravely declined not even to please grizel could he pretend that what was not was no more sentiment for t sandys  the spirit has all gone out of him what am i afraid of reflected the dominie and he rose suddenly to make a speech teacup in hand cathro cathro you tattiedoolie you are riding to destruction said a warning voice within him but against his better judgment he stifled it and began he begged to propose the health of captain ure he was sure they would all join with him cordially in drinking it including mr sandys who unfortunately differed from them in his estimation of the hero that was only however as had been conclusively shown because he was a hero himself and so could make light of heroic deedswith other sly hits at mr sandys but when all the others rose to drink the toast tommy remained seated the dominie coughed  perhaps mr sandys means to reply grizel suggested icily and it was at this uncomfortable moment that christina appeared suddenly and in a state of suppressed excitement requested her mistress to speak with her behind the door all the knowing ones were aware that something terrible must have happened in the kitchen miss sophia thought it might be the china teapot she smiled reassuringly to signify that whatever it was she would help mrs mclean through and so did mr james he was a perfect lady  how dramatic it all was as ailie said frequently afterwards she was back in a moment with her hand on her heart mr sandys were her astounding words a lady wants to see you  tommy rose in surprise as did several of the others  was it really you ailie cried she says it was you  i dont understand mrs mclean he answered i have done nothing  but she saysand she is at the door  all eyes turned on the door so longingly that it opened under their pressure and a boy who had been at the keyhole stumbled forward  thats him he announced pointing a stern finger at mr sandys  but he says he did not do it ailie said  hes a liar said the boy  his manner was that of the police and it had come so sharply upon tommy that he looked not unlike a detected criminal  most of them thought he was being accused of something vile and the dominie demanded with a light heart who is the woman while mr james had a pleasant feeling that the ladies should be requested to retire but just then the woman came in and she was much older than they had expected  thats him granny the boy said still severely thats the man as saved my life at the slugs and then when the truth was dawning on them all and there were exclamations of wonder a pretty scene suddenly presented itself for the old lady who had entered with the timidest courtesy slipped down on her knees before tommy and kissed his hand that young rascal of a boy was all she had  they were all moved by her simplicity but none quite so much as tommy he gulped with genuine emotion and saw her through a maze of beautiful thoughts that delayed all sense of triumph and even made him forget for a little while to wonder what grizel was thinking of him now as the old lady poured out her thanks tremblingly he was excitedly planning her future he was a poor man but she was to be brought by him into thrums to a little cottage overgrown with roses no more hard work for these dear old hands she could sell scones perhaps she should have a cow he would send the boy to college and make a minister of him she should yet hear her grandson preach in the church to which as a boy  but here the old lady somewhat imperilled the picture by rising actively and dumping upon the table the contents of the baga fowl for tommy  she was as poor an old lady as ever put a halfpenny into the church plate on sundays but that she should present a hen to the preserver of her grandson her mind had been made up from the moment she had reason to think she could find him and it was to be the finest hen in all the country round she was an old lady of infinite spirit and daily dragging the boy with her lest he again went afishing she trudged to farms near and far to examine and feel their hens she was a brittle old lady who creaked as she walked and cracked like a whinpod in the heat but she did her dozen miles or more a day and passed all the fowls in review and could not be deceived by the craftiest of farmers wives and in the tail of the day she became possessor and did herself thraw the neck of the stoutest and toughest hen that ever entered a linen bag head foremost by this time the boy had given way in the legs and hence the railway journey its cost defrayed by admiring friends  with careful handling he should get a week out of her gift she explained complacently besides two makes of broth and she and the boy looked as if they would like dearly to sit opposite tommy during those seven days and watch him gorging  if you look at the matter aright it was a handsomer present than many a tiara but if you are of the same stuff as mr james it was only a hen mr james tittered and one or two others made ready to titter it was a moment to try tommy for there are doubtless heroes as gallant as he who do not know how to receive a present of a hen grizel who had been holding back moved a little nearer if he hurt that sweet old womans feelings she could never forgive himnever  he heard the titter and ridicule was terrible to him but he also knew why grizel had come closer and what she wanted of him our tommy in short had emerged from his emotion and once more knew what was what it was not his fault that he stood revealed a hero the little gods had done it therefore let him do credit to the chosen of the little gods the way he took that old ladys wrinkled hand and bowed over it and thanked her was an ode to manhood everyone was touched those who had been about to titter wondered what on earth mr james had seen to titter at and grizel almost clapped her hands with joy she would have done it altogether had not tommy just then made the mistake of looking at her for approval she fell back and intoxicated with himself he thought it was because her heart was too full for utterance tommy was now splendid and described the affair at the slugs with an adorable modesty  i assure you it was a much smaller thing to do than you imagine it was all over in a few minutes i knew that in your good nature you would make too much of it and sofoolishly i can see nowi tried to keep it from you as for the name captain ure it was an invention of that humourous dog corp  and so on with the most considerate remarks when they insisted on shaking hands with him i beseech you dont apologize to me i see clearly that the fault was entirely my own had i been in your place mr james i should have behaved precisely as you have done and had you been at the slugs you would have jumped in as i did mr cathro you pain me by holding back i assure you i esteem my old dominie more than ever for the way in which you stuck up for captain ure though you must see why i could not drink that gentlemans health  and mr cathro made the best of it wringing tommys hand effusively while muttering fool donnard stirk gowk he was addressing himself and any other person who might be so presumptuous as to try to get the better of thomas sandys cathro never tried it again had tommy died that week his old dominie would have been very chary of what he said at the funeral  they were in the garden now the gentlemen without their hats have you made your peace with him cathro asked grizel in a cautious voice he is a devils buckie and i advise you to follow my example miss mcqueen and capitulate i have always found him reasonable so long as you bend the knee to him  i am not his enemy replied grizel loftily and if he has done a noble thing i am proud of him and will tell him so  i would tell him so said the dominie whether he had done it or not  do you mean she asked indignantly that you think he did not do it  no no no he answered hurriedly or mercys sake dont tell him i think that and then as tommy was out of earshot but i see there is no necessity for my warning you against standing in his way again miss mcqueen for you are up in arms for him now  i admire brave men she replied and he is one is he not  youll find him reasonable said the dominie drily  but though it was thus that she defended tommy when others hinted doubts she had not yet said she was proud of him to the man who wanted most to hear it for one brief moment grizel had exulted on learning that he and captain ure were one and then suddenly to all the emotions now running within her a voice seemed to cry halt and she fell to watching sharply the doer of noble deeds her eyes were not wistful nor were they contemptuous but had tommy been less elated with himself he might have seen that they were puzzled and suspicious to mistrust him in face of such evidence seemed half a shame she was indignant with herself even while she did it but she could not help doing it the truth about tommy was such a vital thing to grizel she had known him so well too well up to a minute ago and this was not the man she had known  how unfair she was to tommy while she watched when the old lady was on her knees thanking him and every other lady was impressed by the feeling he showed it seemed to grizel that he was again in the arms of some such absurd sentiment as had mastered him in the den when he behaved so charmingly about the gift she was almost sure he looked at her as he had looked in the old days before striding his legs and screaming out oh am i not a wonder i see by your face that you think me a wonder all the time he was so considerately putting those who had misjudged him at their ease she believed he did it considerately that they might say to each other how considerate he is when she misread tommy in such comparative trifles as these is it to be wondered that she went into the garden still tortured by a doubt about the essential it was nothing less than torture to her when you discover what is in her mind tommy you may console yourself with that  he discovered what was in her mind as mr cathro left her she felt shy he thought of coming to him after what had taken place and with the generous intention of showing that she was forgiven he crossed goodnaturedly to her  you were very severe grizel he said but dont let that distress you for a moment it served me right for not telling the truth at once  she did not flinch do we know the truth now she asked looking at him steadfastly i dont want to hurt youyou know that but please tell me did you really do it i mean did you do it in the way we have been led to suppose  it was a great shock to tommy he had not forgotten his vows to change his nature and had she been sympathetic now he would have confessed to her the real reason of his silence he wanted boyishly to tell her though of course without mention of the glove but her words hardened him  grizel he cried reproachfully and then in a husky voice can you really think so badly of me as that  i dont know what to think she answered pressing her hands together i know you are very clever  he bowed slightly  did you she asked again she was no longer chiding herself for being overcareful she must know the truth  he was silent for a moment then grizel he said i am about to pain you very much but you give me no option i did do it precisely as you have heard and may god forgive you for doubting me he added with a quiver as freely as i do  you will scarcely believe this but a few minutes afterwards grizel having been the first to leave he saw her from the garden going not home but in the direction of corps house obviously to ask him whether tommy had done it tommy guessed her intention at once and he laughed a bitter hohoha and wiped her from his memory  farewell woman i am done with you are the terrible words you may conceive tommy saying next moment however he was hurriedly bidding his hostess goodnight could not even wait for elspeth clapped his hat on his head and was off after grizel it had suddenly struck him that now the rest of the story was out corp might tell her about the glove suppose gavinia showed it to her  sometimes he had kissed that glove passionately sometimes pressed his lips upon it with the long tenderness that is less intoxicating but makes you a better man but now for the first time he asked himself bluntly why he had done those things with the result that he was striding to corps house it was not only for his own sake that he hurried let us do him that justice it was chiefly to save grizel the pain of thinking that he whom she had been flouting loved her as she must think if she heard the story of the glove that it could be nothing but pain to her he was boyishly certain for assuredly this scornful girl wanted none of his love and though she was scornful she was still the dear companion of his boyhood tommy was honestly anxious to save grizel the pain of thinking that she had flouted a man who loved her  he took a different road from hers but to his annoyance they met at couthies corner he would have passed her with a distant bow but she would have none of that  you have followed me said grizel with the hateful directness that was no part of tommys character  grizel  you followed me to see whether i was going to question corp you were afraid he would tell me what really happened you wanted to see him first to tell him what to say  really grizel  is it not true  there are no questions so offensive to the artistic nature as those that demand a yes or no for answer it is useless for me to say it is not true he replied haughtily for you wont believe me  say it and i shall believe you said she  tommy tried standing on the other foot but it was no help i presume i may have reasons for wanting to see corp that you are unacquainted with he said  oh i am sure of it replied grizel scornfully she had been hoping until now but there was no more hope left in her  may i ask what it is that my oldest friend accuses me of perhaps you dont even believe that i was captain ure  i am no longer sure of it  how you read me grizel i could hoodwink the others but never you i suppose it is because you have such an eye for the worst in anyone  it was not the first time he had said something of this kind to her for he knew that she suspected herself of being too ready to find blemishes in others to the neglect of their better qualities and that this made her uneasy and also very sensitive to the charge today however her own imperfections did not matter to her she was as nothing to herself just now and scarcely felt his insinuations  i think you were captain ure she said slowly and i think you did it but not as the boy imagines  you may be quite sure he replied that i would not have done it had there been the least risk that i flatter myself is how you reason it out  it does not explain she said why you kept the matter secret  thank you grizel well at least i have not boasted of it  no and that is what makes me she paused  go on said he though i can guess what agreeable thing you were going to say  but she said something else you may have noticed that i took the boy aside and questioned him privately  i little thought then grizel that you suspected me of being an impostor  she clenched her hands again it was all so hard to say and yet she must say it i did not i saw he believed his story i was asking him whether you had planned his coming with it to mrs mcleans house at that dramatic moment  you actually thought me capable of that  it makes me horrid to myself she replied wofully but if i thought you had done that i could more readily believe the rest  very well grizel he said go on thinking the worst of me i would not deprive you of that pleasure if i could  oh cruel cruel she could have replied you know it is no pleasure you know it is a great pain but she did not speak  i have already told you that the boys story is true he said and now you ask me why i did not shout it from the housetops myself perhaps it was for your sake grizel perhaps it was to save you the distress of knowing that in a momentary impulse i could so far forget myself as to act the part of a man  she pressed her hands more tightly i may be wronging you she answered i should love to think so butyou have something you want to say to corp before i see him  not at all tommy said if you still want to see corp let us go together  she hesitated but she knew how clever he was i prefer to go alone she replied forgive me if i ask you to turn back  dont go he entreated her grizel i give you my word of honour it is to save you acute pain that i want to see corp first  she smiled wanly at that for though as we know it was true she misunderstood him he had to let her go on alone     chapter xii  in which a comedian challenges tragedy to bowls   when grizel opened the door of corps house she found husband and wife at home the baby in his fathers arms what is more gavinia was looking on smiling and saying you bonny litlin youre windy to have him dandling you and no wonder for hes a father to be proud o corp was accepting it all with a complacent smirk oh agreeable change since last we were in this house oh happy picture of domestic bliss ohbut no these are not the words what we meant to say was gavinia you limmer so you have got the better of that man of yours at last  how had she contrived it we have seen her escorting the old lady to the dovecot corp skulking behind our next peep at them shows gavinia back at her house corp peering through the window and wondering whether he dare venture in gavinia was still bothered for though she knew now the story of tommys heroism there was no glove in it and it was the glove that maddened her  no i ken nothing about a glove the old lady had assured her  not a sylup was said about a glove maintained christina who had given her a highly coloured narrative of what took place in mrs mcleans parlour  and yet theres a glove int as sure as theres a quirk int gavinia kept muttering to herself she rose to have another look at the hoddyplace in which she had concealed the glove from her husband and as she did so she caught sight of him at the window he bobbed at once but she hastened to the door to scarify him the clock had given only two ticks when she was upon him but in that time she had completely changed her plan of action she welcomed him with smiles of pride thus is the nimbleness of womens wit measured once and for all they need two seconds if they are to do the thing comfortably  never to have telled me and you behaved so grandly she cried with adoring glances that were as a carpet on which he strode pompously into the house  it wasna me that did it it was him said corp and even then he feared that he had told too much i kenna what youre speaking about he added loyally  corp she answered you needna be so canny for the laddie is in the town and mr sandys has confessed all  the whole ot  every risson  about the glove too  glove and all said wicked gavinia and she continued to feast her eyes so admiringly on her deceived husband that he passed quickly from the gratified to the dictatorial  let this be a lesson to you woman he said sternly and gavinia intimated with humility that she hoped to profit by it  having got the glove in so solemn a way he went on it would have been ill done of me to blab to you about it do you see that now woman  she said it was as clear as day to her and a solemn way it was she added and then waited eagerly  my opinion continued corp lowering his voice as if this were not matter for the child is that its a lovetoken frae some london woman  behears cried gavinia  else what he asked would make him hand it to me so solemnlike and tell me to pass it on to her if he was drowned i didna think o that at the time but it has come to me gavinia it has come  this was a mouthful indeed to gavinia so the glove was the property of mr sandys and he was in love with a london lady andno this is too slow for gavinia she saw these things in passing as one who jumps from the top of a house may have lightning glimpses through many windows on the way down what she jumped to was the vital question who was the woman  but she was too cunning to ask a leading question  ay shes his ladylove she said controlling herself but i forget her name it was a very wiselike thing o you to speir the womans name  but i didna  you didna  he was in the water in a klink  had gavinia been in corps place she would have had the name out of tommy water or no water but she did not tell her husband what she thought of him  ay of course she said pleasantly it was after you helped him out that he telled you her name  did he say he telled me her name  he did  well then ive fair forgot it  instead of boxing his ears she begged him to reflect result of reflection that if the name had been mentioned to corp which he doubted it began with m  was it mary  that was the name  or was it martha  it had a taste of martha about it  it was not margaret  it might have been margaret  or matilda  it was fell like matilda  and so on but wi a your wheedling corp reminded his wife bantering her from aloft you couldna get a scraping out o me till i was free to speak  he thought it a good opportunity for showing gavinia her place once and for all in small matters he said i gie you your ain way for though you may be wrang thinks i to mysel shes but a woman but in important things gavinia if i humoured you i would spoil you so let this be a telling to you that theres no diddling a determined man to which she replied by informing the baby that he had a father to be proud of  a father to be proud of they were the words heard by grizel as she entered she also saw gavinia looking admiringly at her man and in that doleful moment she thought she understood all it was corp who had done it and tommy had been the lookeron he had sought to keep the incident secret because though he was in it the glory had been won by another oh how base and now profiting by the boys mistake he was swaggering in that others clothes oh baser still everything was revealed to her in a flash and she stooped over the baby to hide a sudden tear she did not want to hear any more  the baby cried babies are aware that they cant do very much but all of them who knew grizel were almost contemptuously confident of their power over her and when this one saw they are very sharp that in his presence she could actually think of something else he was so hurt that he cried  was she to be blamed for thinking so meanly of tommy you can blame her with that tear in her eye if you choose but i can think only of the gladness that came afterwards when she knew she had been unjust to him thank you thank you thank you the bird sang to its creator when the sun came out after rain and it was grizels song as she listened to corps story of heroic tommy there was no room in her exultant heart for remorse it would have shown littleness to be able to think of herself at all when she could think so gloriously of him she was more than beautiful now she was radiant and it was because tommy was the man she wanted him to be as those who are cold hold out their hands to the fire did she warm her heart at what corp had to tell and the great joy that was lit within her made her radiant now the baby was in her lap smiling back to her he thought he had done it all so you thought you could resist me the baby crowed  the glove had not been mentioned yet the sweetest thing of all to me grizel said is that he did not want me to hear the story from you corp because he knew you would sing his praise so loudly  im thinking said gavinia archly he had another reason for no wanting you to question corp maybe he didna want you to ken about the london lady and her glove will you tell her man or will i  they told her together and what had been conjectures were now put forward as facts tommy had certainly said a london lady and as certainly he had given her name but what it was corp could not remember but give her this and tell her it never left my hearthe could swear to these words  and no words could be stronger gavinia said triumphantly she produced the glove and was about to take off its paper wrapping when grizel stopped her  we have no right gavinia  i suppose we hinna and im thinking the pocket it came out o is feeling gey toom without it will you take it back to him  it was very wrong of you to keep it grizel answered but i cant take it to him for i see now that his reason for wanting me not to come here was to prevent my hearing about it i am sorry you told me corp must take it back but when she saw it being crushed in corps rough hand a pity for the helpless glove came over her she said after all i do know about it so i cant pretend to him that i dont i will give it to him corp and she put the little package in her pocket with a brave smile  do you think the radiance had gone from her face now do you think the joy that had been lit in her heart was dead oh no no grizel had never asked that tommy should love her she had asked only that he should be a fine man she did not ask it for herself only for him she could not think of herself now only of him she did not think she loved him she thought a woman should not love any man until she knew he wanted her to love him  but if tommy had wanted it she would have been very glad she knew oh she knew so well that she could have helped him best many a noble woman has known it as she stood aside  in the meantime tommy had gone home in several states of mindreckless humble sentimental most practical defiant apprehensive at one moment he was crying now grizel now when it is too late you will see what you have lost at the next he quaked and implored the gods to help him out of his predicament it was apprehension that on the whole played most of the tunes for he was by no means sure that grizel would not look upon the affair of the glove as an offer of his hand and accept him they would show her the glove and she would of course know it to be her own give her this and tell her it never left my heart the words thumped within him now how was grizel to understand that he had meant nothing in particular by them  i wonder if you misread him so utterly as to believe that he thought himself something of a prize that is a vulgar way of looking at things of which our fastidious tommy was incapable as much as grizel herself he loathed the notion that women have a thirsty eye on man when he saw them cheapening themselves before the sex that should hold them beyond price he turned his head and would not let his mind dwell on the subject he was a sort of gentleman was tommy and he knew grizel so well that had all the other women in the world been of this kind it would not have persuaded him that there was a drop of such blood in her  then if he feared that she was willing to be his it must have been because he thought she loved him not a bit of it as already stated he thought he had abundant reason to think otherwise it was remorse that he feared might bring her to his feet the discovery that while she had been gibing at him he had been a heroic figure suffering in silence eating his heart for love of her undoubtedly that was how grizel must see things now he must seem to her to be an angel rather than a mere man and in sheer remorse she might cry i am yours vain though tommy was the picture gave him not a moments pleasure alarm was what he felt  of course he was exaggerating grizels feelings she had too much selfrespect and too little sentiment to be willing to marry any man because she had unintentionally wronged him but this was how tommy would have acted had he happened to be a lady remorse pity no one was so good at them as tommy  in his perturbation he was also good at maidenly reserve he felt strongly that the proper course for grizel was not to refer to the gloveto treat that incident as closed unless he chose to reopen it this was so obviously the correct procedure that he seemed to see her adopting it like a sensible girl and relief would have come to him had he not remembered that grizel usually took her own way and that it was seldom his way  there were other ways of escape for instance if she would only let him love her hopelessly oh grizel had but to tell him there was no hope and then how finely he would behave it would bring out all that was best in him he saw himself passing through life as her very perfect knight is there no hope for me he heard himself begging for hope and he heard also her firm answer none how he had always admired the outspokenness of grizel her none was as splendidly decisive as of yore  the conversation thus begun ran on in him tommy doing the speaking for both though his lips never moved and feeling the scene as vividly as if grizel had really been present and elspeth was not elspeth was sitting opposite him  at least let me wait grizel he implored i dont care for how long fix a time yourself and i shall keep to it and i promise never to speak one word of love to you until that time comes and then if you bid me go i shall go give me something to live for it binds you to nothing and oh it would make such a difference to me  then grizel seemed to reply gently but with the firmness he adored i know i cannot change and it would be mistaken kindness to do as you suggest no i can give you no hope but though i can never marry you i will watch your future with warm regard for you have today paid me the highest compliment a man can pay a woman  how charmingly it was all working out  tommy bowed with dignity and touched her hand with his lips what is it they do next in pym and even more expensive authors oh yes if at any time in your life dear grizel he said you are in need of a friend i hope you will turn first to me it does not matter where your message reaches me i will come to you without delay  in his enthusiasm he saw the letter being delivered to him in central africa and immediately he wheeled round on his way to thrums  there is one other little request i should like to make of you he said huskily perhaps i ask too much but it is this may i keep your glove  she nodded her head she was so touched that she could scarcely trust herself to speak but you will soon get over this she said at last another glove will take the place of mine the time will come when you will be glad that i said i could not marry you  grizel he cried in agony he was so carried away by his feelings that he said the word aloud  where asked elspeth looking at the window  was it not she who passed just now he replied promptly and they were still discussing his mistake when grizel did pass but only to stop at the door she came in  my brother must have the second sight declared elspeth gaily for he saw you coming before you came and she told what had happened while grizel looked happily at tommy and tommy looked apprehensively at her grizel he might have seen was not wearing the tragic face of sacrifice it was a face shining with gladness a girl still too happy in his nobility to think remorsefully of her own misdeeds to let him know that she was proud of him that was what she had come for chiefly and she was even glad that elspeth was there to hear it was an excuse to her to repeat corps story and she told it with defiant looks at tommy that said you are so modest you want to stop me but elspeth will listen it is nearly as sweet to elspeth as it is to me and i shall tell her every word yes and tell her a great deal of it twice  it was not modesty which made tommy so anxious that she should think less of him but naturally it had that appearance the most heroic fellows i am told can endure being extolled by pretty girls but here seemed to be one who could not stand it  you need not think it is of you we are proud she assured him lightheartedly it is really of ourselves i am proud of being your friend tomorrow when i hear the town ringing your praises i shall not say yes isnt he wonderful i shall say talk of me i too am an object of interest for i am his friend  i have often been pointed out as his sister said elspeth complacently  he did not choose his sister replied grizel but he chose his friends  for a time he could suck no sweetness from it she avoided the glove he was sure only because of elspeths presence but anon there arrived to cheer him a fond hope that she had not heard of it and as this became conviction exit the tommy who could not abide himself and enter another who was highly charmed therewith tommy had a notion that certain whimsical little gods protected him in return for the sport he gave them and he often kissed his hand to them when they came to the rescue he would have liked to kiss it now but gave a grateful glance instead to the corner in the ceiling where they sat chuckling at him grizel admired him at last tra la la what a dear girl she was into his manner there crept a certain masterfulness and instead of resisting it she beamed rumtitum  if you want to spoil me he said lazily you will bring me that footstool to rest my heroic feet upon  she smiled and brought it she even brought a cushion for his heroic head adoring little thing that she was he must be good to her  he was now looking forward eagerly to walking home with her i cant tell you how delicious he meant to be when she said she must go he skipped upstairs for his hat and wafted the gods their kiss but it was always the unexpected that lay in wait for tommy he and she were no sooner out of the house than grizel said i did not mention the glove as i was not sure whether elspeth knew of it  he had turned stonecold  corp and gavinia told me she went on quietly before i had time to stop them of course i should have preferred not to know until i heard it from yourself  oh how cold he was  but as i do know i want to tell you that it makes me very happy  they had stopped for his legs would carry him no farther get us out of this every bit of him was crying but not one word could tommy say  i knew you would want to have it again grizel said brightly producing the little parcel from her pocket so i brought it to you  the frozen man took it and held it passively in his hand his gods had flown away  no they were actually giving him another chance what was this grizel was saying i have not looked at it for to take it out of its wrapping would have been profanation corp told me she was a london girl but i know nothing more not even her name you are not angry with me for speaking of her are you surely i may wish you and her great happiness  he was saved the breath came back quickly to him he filled like a released ball had ever a heart better right to expand grizel looking so bright and pleased had snatched him from the slugs surely you will be nice to your preserver tommy you will not be less grateful than a country boy  ah me not even yet have we plumed his vanity but we are to do it now he could not have believed it of himself but in the midst of his rejoicings he grew bitter and for no better reason than that grizels face was bright  i am glad he said quite stiffly that it is such pleasant news to you  his tone surprised her but she was in a humble mood and answered without being offended it is sweet news to me how could you think otherwise  so it was sweet to her to think that he was anothers he who had been modestly flattering himself a few moments ago that he must take care not to go too far with this admiring little girl o woman woman how difficult it is to know you and how often when we think we know you at last have we to begin again at the beginning he had never asked an enduring love from her but surely after all that had passed between them he had a right to expect a little more than this was it maidenly to bring the glove and hand it to him without a tremor if she could do no more she might at least have turned a little pale when corp told her of it and then have walked quietly away next day she could have referred to it with just the slightest break in her voice but to come straight to him looking delighted  and after all i am entitled to know first grizel said for i am your oldest friend  friend he could not help repeating the word with bitter emphasis for her sake as it seemed to him now he had flung himself into the black waters of the drumly he had worn her glove upon his heart it had been the world to him and she could stand there and call herself his friend the cup was full tommy nodded his head sorrowfully three times  so be it grizel he said huskily so be it sentiment could now carry him where it willed the reins were broken  i dont understand  neither did he but why should you what is it to you he cried wildly better not to understand for it might give you five minutes pain grizel a whole five minutes and i should be sorry to give you that  what have i said what have i done  nothing he answered her nothing you have been most exemplary you have not even got any entertainment out of it the thing never struck you as possible it was too ludicrous  he laughed harshly at the package which was still in his hand poor little glove he said and she did not even take the trouble to look at you you might have looked at it grizel i have looked at it a good deal it meant something to me once upon a time when i was a vain fool take it and look at it before you fling it away it will make you laugh  now she knew and her arms rocked convulsively joy surged to her face and she drove it back she looked at him steadfastly over the collar of her jacket she looked long as if trying to be suspicious of him for the last time ah grizel you are saying goodbye to your best friend  as she looked at him thus there was a mournfulness in her brave face that went to tommys heart and almost made a man of him it was as if he knew that she was doomed  grizel he cried dont look at me in that way and he would have taken the package from her but she pressed it to her heart  dont come with me she said almost in a whisper and went away  he did not go back to the house he wandered into the country quite objectless when he was walking fastest seeing nothing when he stood still and stared elation and dread were his companions what elation whispered he could not yet believe no he could not believe it while he listened he knew that he must be making up the words by and by he found himself among the shadows of the den if he had loved grizel he would have known that it was here she would come to the sweet den where he and she had played as children the spot where she had loved him first she had always loved himalways always he did not know what figure it was by the cuttle well until he was quite close to her she was kissing the glove passionately and on her eyes lay little wells of gladness     chapter xiii  little wells of gladness   it was dusk and she had not seen him in the silent den he stood motionless within a few feet of her so amazed to find that grizel really loved him that for the moment self was blotted out of his mind he remembered he was there only when he heard his heavy breathing and then he tried to check it that he might steal away undiscovered divers emotions fought for the possession of him he was in the meeting of many waters each capable of whirling him where it chose but two only imperious the one the fierce joy of being loved the other an agonizing remorse he would fain have stolen away to think this tremendous thing over but it tossed him forward grizel he said in a husky whisper grizel  she did not start she was scarcely surprised to hear his voice she had been talking to him and he had answered had he not been there she would still have heard him answer she could not see him more clearly now than she had been seeing him through those little wells of gladness her love for him was the whole of her he came to her with the opening and the shutting of her eyes he was the wind that bit her and the sun that nourished her he was the lowliest object by the cuttle well and he was the wings on which her thoughts soared to eternity he could never leave her while her mortal frame endured  when he whispered her name she turned her swimming eyes to him and a strange birth had come into her face her eyes said so openly they were his and her mouth said it was his her whole being went out to him in the radiance of her face could be read immortal designs the maid kissing her farewell to innocence was there and the reason why it must be and the fate of the unborn it was the first stirring for weal or woe of a movement that has no end on earth but must roll on growing lusty on beauty or dishonour till the crack of time this birth which comes to every woman at that hour is gods gift to her in exchange for what he has taken away and when he has given it he stands back and watches the man  to this man she was a woman transformed the new bloom upon her face entranced him he knew what it meant he was looking on the face of love at last and it was love coming out smiling from its hidingplace because it thought it had heard him call the artist in him who had done this thing was entranced as if he had written an immortal page  but the man was appalled he knew that he had reached the critical moment in her life and his and that if he took one step farther forward he could never again draw back it would be comparatively easy to draw back now to remain a free man he had but to tell her the truth and he had a passionate desire to remain free he heard the voices of his little gods screaming to him to draw back but it could be done only at her expense and it seemed to him that to tell this noble girl who was waiting for him that he did not need her would be to spill for ever the happiness with which she overflowed and sap the pride that had been the marrow of her during her twenty years of life not thus would grizel have argued in his place but he could not change his nature and it was sentimental tommy in an agony of remorse for having brought dear grizel to this pass who had to decide her future and his in the time you may take to walk up a garden path either her mistake must be righted now or kept hidden from her for ever he was a sentimentalist but in that hard moment he was trying to be a man he took her in his arms and kissed her reverently knowing that after this there could be no drawing back in that act he gave himself loyally to her as a husband he knew he was not worthy of her but he was determined to try to be a little less unworthy and as he drew her to him a slight quiver went through her so that for a second she seemed to be holding backfor a second only and the quiver was the rustle of wings on which some part of the grizel we have known so long was taking flight from her then she pressed close to him passionately as if she grudged that pause i love her more than ever far more but she is never again quite the grizel we have known  he was not unhappy in the near hereafter he might be as miserable as the damnedthe little gods were waiting to catch him alone and terrify him but for the time having sacrificed himself tommy was aglow with the passion he had inspired he so loved the thing he had created that in his exultation he mistook it for her he believed all he was saying he looked at her long and adoringly not as he thought because he adored her but because it was thus that look should answer look he pressed her wet eyes reverently because thus it was written in his delicious part his heart throbbed with hers that they might beat in time he did not love but he was the perfect lover he was the artist trying in a mad moment to be as well as to do  love was their theme but how to know what was said when between lovers it is only the loose change of conversation that gets into words the important matters cannot wait so slow a messenger while the tongue is being charged with them a look a twitch of the mouth a movement of a finger transmits the story and the words arrive like blücher when the engagement is over  with a sudden pretty gestureah so like her mothersshe held the glove to his lips it is sad because you have forgotten it  i have kissed it so often grizel long before i thought i should ever kiss you  she pressed it to her innocent breast at that and had he really done so and which was the first time and the second and the third oh dear glove you know so much and your partner lies at home in a drawer knowing nothing grizel felt sorry for the other glove she whispered to tommy as a terrible thing i think i love this glove even more than i love youjust a tiny bit more she could not part with it it told me before you did she explained begging him to give it back to her  if you knew what it was to me in those unhappy days grizel  i want it to tell me she whispered  and did he really love her yes she knew he did but how could he  oh grizel how could i help it  he had to say it for it is the best answer but he said it with a sigh for it sounded like a quotation  but how could she love him i think her reply disappointed him  because you wanted me to she said with shining eyes it is probably the commonest reason why women love and perhaps it is the best but his vanity was woundedhe had expected to hear that he was possessed of an irresistible power  not until i wanted you to  i think i always wanted you to want me to she replied naïvely but i would never have let myself love you she continued very seriously until i was sure you loved me  you could have helped it grizel he drew a blank face  i did help it she answered i was always fighting the desire to love youi can see that plainlyand i always won i thought god had made a sort of compact with me that i should always be the kind of woman i wanted to be if i resisted the desire to love you until you loved me  but you always had the desire he said eagerly  always but it never won you see even you did not know of it you thought i did not even like you that was why you wanted to prevent corps telling me about the glove was it not you thought it would pain me only do you remember what you said it is to save you acute pain that i want to see corp first  all that seemed so long ago to tommy now  how could you think it would be a pain to me she cried  you concealed your feelings so well grizel  did i not she said joyously oh i wanted to be so careful and i was careful that is why i am so happy now her face was glowing she was full of odd delightful fancies tonight she kissed her hand to the gloaming no not to the gloamingto the little hunted anxious girl she had been  illustration she is standing behind that tree looking at us  she is looking at us she said she is standing behind that tree looking at us she wanted so much to grow into a dear good woman that she often comes and looks at me eagerly sometimes her face is so fearful i think she was a little alarmed when she heard you were coming back  she never liked me grizel  hush said grizel in a low voice she always liked you she always thought you a wonder but she would be distressed if she heard me telling you she thought it would not be safe for you to know i must tell him now dearest darlingest she suddenly called out boldly to the little self she had been so quaintly fond of because there was no other to love her i must tell him everything now for you are no longer your own you are his  she has gone away rocking her arms she said to tommy  no he replied i can hear her she is singing because you are so happy  she never knew how to sing  she has learned suddenly everybody can sing who has anything to sing about and do you know what she said about your dear wet eyes grizel she said they were just sweet and do you know why she left us so suddenly she ran home gleefully to stitch and dust and beat carpets and get baths ready and look after the affairs of everybody which she is sure must be going to rack and ruin because she has been away for half an hour  at his words there sparkled in her face the fond delight with which a woman assures herself that the beloved one knows her little weaknesses for she does not truly love unless she thirsts to have him understand the whole of her and to love her in spite of the foibles and for them if he does not love you a little for the foibles madam god help you from the day of the wedding  but though grizel was pleased she was not to be cajoled she wandered with him through the den stopping at the lair and the queens bower and many other places where the little girl used to watch tommy suspiciously and she called half merrily half plaintively are you there you foolish girl and are you wringing your hands over me i believe you are jealous because i love him best  we have loved each other so long she and i she said apologetically to tommy ah she said impulsively when he seemed to be hurt dont you see it is because she doubts you that i am so sorry for the poor thing  dearest darlingest she called to the child she had been dont think that you can come to me when he is away and whisper things against him to me do you think i will listen to your croakings you poor wetfaced thing  you child said tommy  do you think me a child because i blow kisses to her  do you like me to think you one he replied  i like you to call me child she said but not to think me one  then i shall think you one said he triumphantly he was so perfect an instrument for love to play upon that he let it play on and on and listened in a fever of delight how could grizel have doubted tommy the god of love himself would have sworn that there were a score of arrows in him he wanted to tell elspeth and the others at once that he and grizel were engaged i am glad to remember that it was he who urged this and grizel who insisted on its being deferred he even pretended to believe that elspeth would exult in the news but grizel smiled at him for saying this to please her she had never been a great friend of elspeths they were so dissimilar and she blamed herself for it now and said she wanted to try to make elspeth love her before they told her tommy begged her to let him tell his sister at once but she remained obdurate so anxious was she that her happiness when revealed should bring only happiness to others there had not come to grizel yet the longing to be recognized as his by the world this love was so beautiful and precious to her that there was an added joy in sharing the dear secret with him alone it was a live thing that might escape if she let anyone but him look between the fingers that held it  the crowning glory of loving and being loved is that the pair make no real progress however far they have advanced into the enchanted land during the day they must start again from the frontier next morning last night they had dredged the lovers lexicon for superlatives and not even blushed today is that the heavens cracking or merely someone whispering dear all this was very strange and wonderful to grizel she had never been so young in the days when she was a little girl  i can never be quite so happy again she had said with a wistful smile on the night of nights but early morn the time of the day that loves maidens best retold her the delicious secret as it kissed her on the eyes and her first impulse was to hurry to tommy when joy or sorrow came to her now her first impulse was to hurry with it to him  was he still the same quite the same she whom love had made a child of asked it fearfully as if to gaze upon him openly just at first might be blinding and he pretended not to understand the same as what grizel  are you stillwhat i think you  ah grizel not at all what you think me  but you do  coward you are afraid to say the word but i do  you dont ask whether i do  no  why is it because you are so sure of me  he nodded and she said it was cruel of him  you dont mean that grizel  dont i she was delighted that he knew it  no you mean that you like me to be sure of it  but i want to be sure of it myself  you are that was why you asked me if i loved you had you not been sure of it you would not have asked  how clever you are she said gleefully and caressed a button of his velvet coat but you dont know what that means it does not mean that i love younot merely that  no it means that you are glad i know you so well it is an ecstasy to you is it not to feel that i know you so well  it is sweet she said she asked curiously what did you do last night after you left me i cant guess though i daresay you can guess what i did  you put the glove under your pillow grizel she had got the precious glove  however could you guess  it has often lain under my own  oh said grizel breathless  could you not guess even that  i wanted to be sure did it do anything strange when you had it there  i used to hear its heart beating  yes exactly but this is still more remarkable i put it away at last in my sweetest drawer and when i woke in the morning it was under my pillow again you could never have guessed that  easily it often did the same thing with me  storyteller but what did you do when you went home  he could not have answered that exhaustively even if he would for his actions had been as contradictory as his emotions he had feared even while he exulted and exulted when plunged deep in fears there had been quite a procession of tommies all through the night one of them had been a very miserable man and the only thing he had been sure of was that he must be true to grizel but in so far as he did answer he told the truth  i went for a stroll among the stars he said i dont know when i got to bed i have found a way of reaching the stars i have to say only grizel loves me and i am there  without me  i took you with me  what did we see what did we do  you spoiled everything by thinking the stars were badly managed you wanted to take the supreme control they turned you out  and when we got back to earth  then i happened to catch sight of myself in a lookingglass and i was scared i did not see how you could possibly love me a terror came over me that in the den you must have mistaken me for someone else it was a darkish night you know  you are wanting me to say you are handsome  no no i am wanting you to say i am very very handsome tell me you love me grizel because i am beautiful  perhaps she replied i love you because your book is beautiful  then goodbye for ever he said sternly  would not that please you  it would break my heart  but i thought all authors  it is the commonest mistake in the world we are simple creatures grizel and yearn to be loved for our face alone  but i do love the book she said when they became more serious because it is part of you  rather that he told her than that you should love me because i am part of it but it is only a little part of me grizel only the best part it is tommy on tiptoes the other part the part that does not deserve your love is what needs it most  i am so glad she said eagerly i want to think you need me  how i need you  yes i think you doi am sure you do and it makes me so happy  ah he said now i know why grizel loves me and perhaps he did know now  she loved to think that she was more to him than the new book but was not always sure of it and sometimes this saddened her and again she decided that it was right and fitting she would hasten to him to say that this saddened her she would go just as impulsively to say that she thought it right  her discoveries about herself were many  what is it today he would say smiling fondly at her i see it is something dreadful by your face  it is something that struck me suddenly when i was thinking of you and i dont know whether to be glad or sorry  then be glad you child  it is this i used to think a good deal of myself the people here thought me haughty they said i had a proud walk  you have it still he assured her the vitality in her as she moved was ever a delicious thing to him to look upon  yes i feel i have she admitted but that is only because i am yours and it used to be because i was nobodys  do you expect my face to fall at that  no but i thought so much of myself once and now i am nobody at all at first it distressed me and then i was glad for it makes you everything and me nothing yes i am glad but i am just a little bit sorry that i should be so glad  poor grizel said he  poor grizel she echoed you are not angry with me are you for being almost sorry for her she used to be so different where is your independence grizel i say to her and she shakes her sorrowful head the little girl i used to be need not look for me any more if we were to meet in the den she would not know me now  ah if only tommy could have loved in this way he would have done it if he could if we could love by trying no one would ever have been more loved than grizel am i to be condemned because i cannot he sometimes said to himself in terrible anguish for though pretty thoughts came to him to say to her when she was with him he suffered anguish for her when he was alone he knew it was tragic that such love as hers should be given to him but what more could he do than he was doing     chapter xiv  elspeth   ever since the beginning of the book we have been neglecting elspeth so pointedly that were she not the most forgiving creature we should be afraid to face her now you are not angry with us are you elspeth we have been sitting with you talking with you thinking of you between the chapters and the only reason why you have so seldom got into them is that our pen insisted on running after your fascinating brother  that is the way to get round her  tommy it need not be said never neglected her the mere fact of his having an affair of his own at present is a sure sign that she is comfortable for unless all were well with elspeth no venture could have lured him from her side now i am ready for you he said to the world when elspeth had been figuratively speaking put to sleep but until she was nicely tucked up the world had to wait he was still as in his boyhood when he had to see her with a good book in her hand before he could set off on deeds of darkness if this was but the story of a brother and sister there were matter for it that would make the ladies want to kiss tommy on the brow  that dr gemmell disliked or at least distrusted him tommy knew before their acquaintance was an hour old yet that same evening he had said cordially to elspeth  this young doctor has a strong face  she was evidently glad that tommy had noticed it do you think him handsome she inquired  decidedly so he replied very handsomely for it is an indiscreet question to ask of a plain man  there was nothing small about tommy was there he spoke thus magnanimously because he had seen that the doctor liked elspeth and that she liked him for liking her elspeth never spoke to him of such things but he was aware that an extra pleasure in life came to her when she was admired it gave her a little of the selfconfidence she so wofully lacked the woman in her was stirred take such presents as these to elspeth and tommy would let you cast stones at himself for the rest of the day and shake your hand warmly on parting  in london elspeth had always known quickly almost at the first clash of eyes whether tommys friends were attracted by her but she had not known sooner than he those acquaintanceships had seldom ripened but perhaps this was because though he and she avoided talking of them he was all the time taking such terrifying care of her she was always little elspeth to him for whom he had done everything since the beginning of her a frail little female counterpart of himself that would never have dared to grow up had he not always been there to show her the way like a stronger plant in the same pot it was even pathetic to him that elspeth should have to become a woman while he was a man and he set to undaunted to help her in this matter also to be admired of men is a womans right and he knew it gratified elspeth therefore he brought them in to admire her but beyond profound respect they could not presume to go he was watching them so vigilantly he had done everything for her so far and it was evident that he was now ready to do the lovemaking also or at least to sift it before it reached her elspeth saw this and perhaps it annoyed her once or twice though on the whole she was deeply touched and the young gentlemen saw it also they saw that he would not leave them alone with her for a moment and that behind his cordial manner sat a tommy who had his eye on them  subjects suitable for conversation before elspeth seemed in presence of this strict brother to be limited you had just begun to tell her the plot of the new novel when t sandys fixed you with his gleaming orb you were in the middle of the rumour about mrs golightly when he let the poker fall if the newsboys were yelling the latest horror he quickly closed the window he made all visitors selfconscious if she was not in the room few of them dared to ask if she was quite well they paled before expressing the hope that she would feel stronger tomorrow yet when tommy went up to sit beside her which was the moment the front door closed he took care to mention incidentally that they had been inquiring after her one of them ventured on her birthday to bring her flowers but could not present them tommy looked so alarming a still more daring spirit once went the length of addressing her by her christian name she did not start up haughtily the most timid of women are a surprise at times but the poker fell with a crash  he knew elspeth so well that he could tell exactly how these poor young men should approach her as an artist as well as a brother he frowned when they blundered he would have liked to be the medium through which they talked so that he could give looks and words their proper force he had thought it all out so thoroughly for elspeths benefit that in an hour he could have drawn out a complete guide for her admirers  at the first meeting look at her wistfully when she does not see you she will see you it might have been rule one  rule two dont talk so glibly how often that was what the poker meant  being herself a timid creature elspeth showed best among the timid because her sympathetic heart immediately desired to put them at their ease the more glibly they could talk the less she knew were they impressed by her even a little boorishness was more complimentary than chatter sometimes when she played on the piano which tommy had hired for her the visitor was so shy that he could not even mutter thank you to his hat yet she might play to him again and not to the gallant who remarked briskly how very charming what is that called  to talk disparagingly of other women is so common a way among men of penetrating into the favour of one that of course some tried it with elspeth tommy could not excuse such blundering for they were making her despise them he got them out of the house and then he and she had a long talk not about them but about men and women in general from which she gathered once again that there was nobody like tommy  when they bade each other goodnight she would say to him i think you are the one perfect gentleman in the world  or he might say you expect so much of men elspeth  to which her reply you have taught me to do it and now i expect others to be like you sometimes she would even say when i see you so fond of me and taking such care of me i am ashamed you think me so much better than i am you consider me so pure and good while i know that i am often mean and even have wicked thoughts it makes me ashamed but so proud of you for i see that you are judging me by yourself  and then this tommy would put the gas out softly and go to his own room and let us hope blush a little  one stripling had proposed to elspeth and on her agitatedly declining him had flung out of the room in a pet it spoiled all her afterthoughts on the subject and so roused her brothers indignation with the fellow if the great baby had only left all the arrangements to tommy he could so easily have made that final scene one which elspeth would remember with gratification for the remainder of her days for of course pride in the offer could not be great unless she retained her respect for the man who made it from the tremulous proposal and the manly acceptance of his fate to his dignified exit dont grieve for me miss sandys you never gave me the least encouragement and to have loved you will always make me a better man even to a touching way of closing the door with one long last lingering look tommy could have fitted him like a tailor  from all which it will be seen that our splendid brother thought exclusively of what was best for elspeth and was willing that the gentlemen having served their purpose should if it pleased them go hang also though he thought out every other possible move for the suitor it never struck him to compose a successful proposal for the simple reason that he was quite certain elspeth would have none of them their attentions pleased her but exchange tommy for one of themnever he knew it from her confessions at all stages of her life he had felt it from the days when he began to be father and mother to her as well as brother in his heart he believed there was something of his own odd character in elspeth which made her as incapable of loving as himself and some of his devotion to her was due to this belief for perhaps nothing touches us to the quick more than the feeling that another suffers under our own curse certainly nothing draws two souls so close together in a lonely comradeship but though tommy had reflected about these things he did not trouble elspeth with his conclusions he merely gave her to understand that he loved her and she loved him so much that neither of them had any love to give to another it was very beautiful elspeth thought and a little tragic  you are quite sure that you mean that she might ask timidly and that you are not flinging away your life on me  you are all i need he answered cheerily and he believed it or if he was in another mood he might reflect that perhaps he was abstaining from love for elspeths sake and that made him cheery also  and now david gemmell was the man and tommy genially forgave him all else for liking elspeth he invited the doctor who so obviously distrusted him to drop in of an evening for a game at the dambrod which they both abominated but it was an easy excuse he asked him confidentially to come in and see aaron who had been coughing last night he put on all the airs of a hailfellowwellmet though they never became him and sat awkwardly on his face david always seemed eager to come and tried to rise above his suspicions of tommy as tommy saw and failed as tommy saw again elspeth dosed the doctor with stories of her brothers lovely qualities and tommy the forgiving honestly pitied the poor man for having to listen to them he knew that if all went well gemmell would presently propose and find that elspeth tearful at having to strike a blow could not accept him but he did not look forward maliciously to this as his revenge on the doctor he was thinking merely of what was good for elspeth  there was no open talk about david between the brother and sister some day tommy presumed she would announce that the doctor had asked her to marry him and oh how sorry she was and oh what a good man he was and oh tommy knew she had never encouraged him and oh she could never leave tommy but until that day arrived they avoided talking directly about what brought gemmell there that he came to see elspeth neither of them seemed to conceive as possible did tommy chuckle when he saw davids eyes following her no solemn as a cat blinking at the fire noticed nothing the most worldly chaperon the most loving mother could not have done more for elspeth yet it was not done to find her a husband but quite the reverse as we have seen on reflection tommy must smile at what he has been doing but not while he is working the figures the artist never smiles at himself until afterwards  and now he not only wondered at times how elspeth and david were getting on but whether she noticed how he was getting on with grizel for in matters relating to tommy elspeth was almost as sharp as he in matters that related to her and he knew it when he proposed to elspeth that they should ask gemmell to go fishing with them on the morrow he has been overworked of late and it would do him good he wanted to add in a careless voice we might invite grizel also but could not his lips suddenly went dry and when elspeth said the words that were so difficult to him he wondered did she say that because she knew i wished it but he decided that she did not for she was evidently looking forward to tomorrow and he knew she would be shuddering if she thought her tommy was slipping  i am so glad it was she who asked me grizel said to him when he told her dont you see what it means it means that she wants to get you out of the way you are not everything to her now as you used to be are you glad glad  if i could believe it tommy said  what else could make her want to be alone with him  nothing else could have made grizel want to be alone with him and she must always judge others by herself but tommy knew that elspeth was different and that a girl with some of himself in her might want to be alone with a man who admired her without wanting to marry him     chapter xv  by prosen water  that day by the banks of prosen water was one of grizels beautiful memories all the days when she thought he loved her became beautiful memories  it was the time of reds and whites for the glory of the broom had passed except at great heights and the wild roses were trooping in when the broom is in flame there seems to be no colour but yellow but when the wild roses come we remember that the broom was flaunting it was not quite a lady for it insisted on being looked at while these lighthearted things are too innocent to know that there is anyone to look grizel was sitting by the side of the stream adorning her hat fantastically with roses red and white and some that were neither they were those that cannot decide whether they look best in white or red and so waver for the whole of their little lives between the two colours there are many of them and it is the pathetic thing about wild roses she did not pay much heed to her handiwork what she was saying to herself was that in another minute he and she would be alone nothing else in the world mattered very much every bit of her was conscious of it as the supreme event her fingers pressed it upon the flowers it was in her eyes as much as in her heart he went on casting his line moving from stone to stone dropping down the bank ascending it as if the hooking of a trout was something to him was he feeling to his marrow that as soon as those other two figures rounded the bend in the stream he and she would have the world to themselves ah of course he felt it but was it quite as much to him as it was to her  not quite so much she said bravely to herself i dont want it to be quite so muchbut nearly  illustration she did not look up she waited  and now they were alone as no two can be except those who love for when the third person leaves them they have a universe to themselves and it is closed in by the heavens and the air of it is the consciousness of each others presence she sat motionless nowtrembling exulting she could no longer hear the talking of the water but she heard his step he was coming slowly towards her she did not look upshe waited and while she waited time was annihilated  he was coming to her to treat her as if she were a fond child that she of all women could permit it was still delicious to him and a marvel she had let him do it yesterday but perhaps she had regained her independence in the night as he hesitated he became another person in a flood of feeling he had a fierce desire to tell her the truth about himself but he did not know what it was he put aside his rod and sat down very miserably beside her  grizel i suppose i am a knave his lips parted to say it but no words came she had given him an adorable look that stopped them as if her dear hand had been placed upon his mouth  was he a knave he wanted honestly to know he had not tried to make her love him had he known in time he would even have warned her against it he would never have said he loved her had she not first as she thought found it out to tell her the truth then would have been brutal he had made believe in order that she might remain happy was it even makebelief assuredly he did love her in his own way in the only way he was capable of she was far more to him than any other person except elspeth he delighted in her and would have fought till he dropped rather than let any human being injure her all his feelings for her were pure he was prepared to marry her but if she had not made that mistake oh what a delight it would have been to him never to marry anyone he felt keenly miserable  grizel i seem to be different from all other men there seems to be some curse upon me that makes me unable to love as they do i want to love you dear one you are the only woman i ever wanted to love but apparently i cant i have decided to go on with this thing because it seems best for you but is it i would tell you all and leave the decision to you were it not that i fear you would think i wanted you to let me off  it would have been an honest speech and he might have said it had he begun at once for it was in a passion to be out so desirous was he that dear grizel should not be deceived but he tried its effect first upon himself and as he went on the tragedy he saw mastered him he forgot that she was there except as a figure needed to complete the picture of the man who could not love he saw himself a splendidly haggard creature with burning eyes standing aside while all the world rolled by in pursuit of the one thing needful it was a river and he must stand parched on the bank for ever and ever should he keep that sorrowful figure a man or turn it into a woman he tried a woman she was on the bank now her arms outstretched to the flood ah she would be so glad to drink though she must drown  grizel saw how mournful he had become as he gazed upon her in his face she had been seeing all the glories that can be given to mortals thoughts had come to her that drew her nearer to her god her trust in him stretched to eternity all that was given to her at that moment she thought was also given to him she seemed to know why with love lighting up their souls to each other he could yet grow mournful  oh she cried with a movement that was a passionate caress do you indeed love me so much as that i never wanted you to love me quite so much as that  it brought him back to himself but without a start those sudden returns to fact had ceased to bewilder him they were grown so common that he passed between dreams and reality as through tissuepaper  i did not mean she said at last in a tremor that i wanted you to love me less but i am almost sorry that you love me quite so much  he dared say nothing for he did not altogether understand  i have those fears too sometimes she went on i have had them when i was with you but more often when i was alone they come to me suddenly and i have such eager longings to run to you and tell you of them and ask you to drive them away but i never did it i kept them to myself  you could keep something back from me grizel  forgive me she implored i thought they would distress you and i had such a desire to bring you nothing but happiness to bear them by myself seemed to be helping you and i was glad i was proud to feel myself of use to you even to that little extent i did not know you had the same fears i thought that perhaps they came only to women have you had them before fears she continued so wistfully that it is too beautiful to end happily oh have you heard a voice crying it is too beautiful it can never be  he saw clearly now he saw so clearly that he was torn with emotion it is more than i can bear he said hoarsely surely he loved her  did you see me die she asked in a whisper i have seen you die  dont grizel he cried  but she had to go on tell me she begged i have told you  no no never that he answered her at the worst i have had only the feeling that you could never be mine  she smiled at that i am yours she said softly nothing can take away thatnothing nothing i say it to myself a hundred times a day it is so sweet nothing can separate us but death i have thought of all the other possible things and none of them is strong enough but when i think of your dying oh when i think of my being left without you  she rocked her arms in a frenzy and called him dearest darlingest all the sweet names that had been the child grizels and the old doctors were tommys now he soothed her ah surely as only a lover could soothe she was his grizel she was his beloved no mortal could have been more impassioned than tommy he must have loved her it could not have been merely sympathy or an exquisite delight in being the man or the desire to make her happy again in the quickest way or all three combined whatever it was he did not know all he knew was that he felt every word he said or seemed to feel it  it is a punishment to me grizel said setting her teeth for loving you too much i know i love you too much i think i love you more than god  she felt him shudder  but if i feel it she said shuddering also yet unable to deceive herself what difference do i make by saying it he must know it is so whether i say it or not  there was a tremendous difference to tommy but not of a kind he could explain and she went on she must tell him everything now  i pray every night and morning but that is nothingeveryone does it i know i thank god sincerely i thank him again and again and again do you remember how when i was a child you used to be horrified because i prayed standing i often say little prayers standing now i am always thanking him for giving me you but all the time it is a bargain with him so long as you are well i love him but if you were to die i would never pray again i have never said it in words until today but he must know it for it is behind all my prayers if he does not know there cannot be a god  she was watching his face half wofully half stubbornly as if whatever might be the issue of those words she had to say them she saw how pained he was to admit the possible nonexistence of a god when you can so easily leave the subject alone was horrible to tommy  i dont doubt him she continued i have believed in him ever since the time when i was such a lonely child that i did not know his name i shall always believe in him so long as he does not take you from me but if he does then i shall not believe in him any more it may be wrong but that is what i feel  it makes you care less for me she cried in anguish  no no dear  i dont think it makes god care less for me she said very seriously i think he is pleased that i dont try to cheat him  somehow tommy felt uncomfortable at that  there are people he said vaguely like one who thought it best to mention no names who would be afraid to challenge god in that way  he would not be worth believing in she answered if he could be revengeful he is too strong and too loving and too pitiful for that but she took hold of tommy as if to protect him had they been in physical danger her first impulse would have been to get in front of him to protect him the noblest women probably always love in this way and yet it is those who would hide behind them that men seem to love the best  i always feeloh i never can help feeling she said that nothing could happen to you that god himself could not take you from me while i had hold of you  grizel  i mean only that he could not have the heart she said hastily no i dont she had to add i meant what you thought i meant that is why i feel it would be so sweet to be married so that i could be close to you every moment and then no harm could come to you i would keep such a grip of you i should be such a part of you that you could not die without my dying also  oh do you care less for me now she cried i cant see things as clearly as you do dearest darlingest i have not a beautiful nature like yours i am naturally rebellious i have to struggle even to be as good as i am there are evil things in my blood you remember how we found out that god knew it too and he is compassionate i think he makes many pitying allowances for me it is not wicked is it to think that  you used to know me too well grizel to speak of my beautiful nature he said humbly  i did think you vain she replied how odd to remember that  but i was and am  i love to hear you proving you are not said she beaming upon him do you think she asked with a sudden change of manner to the childish like one trying to coax a compliment out of him that i have improved at all during those last days i think i am not quite such a horrid girl as i used to be and if i am not i owe it to you i am so glad to owe it to you she told him that she was trying to make herself a tiny bit more like him by studying his book it is not exactly the things you say of women that help me for though they are lovely i am not sure that they are quite true i almost hope they are not true for if they are then i am not even an average woman she buried her face in his coat you say women are naturally purer than men but i dont know perhaps we are more cunning only perhaps it is not even a thing to wish for if we were it would mean that we are good because there is less evil in us to fight against dear forgive me for saying that it may be all wrong but i think it is what nearly all women feel in their hearts though they keep it locked up till they die i dont even want you to believe me you think otherwise of us and it is so sweet of you that we try to be better than we areto undeceive you would hurt so it is not the book that makes me a better womanit is the man i see behind it  he was too much moved to be able to replytoo much humbled he vowed to himself that whether he could love or not he would be a good husband to this dear woman  ah grizel he declared by and by what a delicious book you are and how i wish i had written you with every word you say something within me is shouting am i not a wonder i warned you it would be so as soon as i felt that i had done anything really big and i have i have somehow made you love me ladies and gentlemen he exclaimed addressing the river and the trees and the roses i have somehow made her love me am i not a wonder  grizel clapped her hands gaily she was merry again she could always be what tommy wanted her to be ladies and gentlemen she cried how could i help it  david had been coming back for his flybook and though he did not hear their words he saw a light in grizels face that suddenly set him thinking for the rest of the day he paid little attention to elspeth some of his answers showed her that he was not even listening to her     chapter xvi  how could you hurt your grizel so   to concentrate on elspeth so that he might find out what was in her mind was as we have seen seldom necessary to tommy for he had learned her by heart long ago yet a time was now come when he had to concentrate and even then he was doubtful of the result so often he had put that mind of hers to rights that it was an open box to him or had been until he conceived the odd notion that perhaps it contained a secret drawer this would have been resented by most brothers but tommys chagrin was nothing compared to the exhilaration with which he perceived that he might be about to discover something new about woman he was like the digger whose hand is on the point of closing on a diamonda certain holiness added  what puzzled him was the state of affairs now existing between elspeth and the doctor a week had elapsed since the fishing excursion and david had not visited them too busy tommy knew that it is the busy people who can find time could it be that david had proposed to her at the waterside  no he could not read that in elspeths face he knew that she would be in distress lest her refusal should darken the doctors life for too long a time but yet shake your fist at him ladies for so misunderstanding you he expected also to note in that sympathetic face a look of subdued triumph and as it was not there david could not have proposed  the fact of her not having told him about it at once did not prove to tommy that there had been no proposal his feeling was that she would consider it too sacred a thing to tell even to him but that it would force its way out in a week or two  on the other hand she could not have resisted dropping shyly such remarks as these i think dr gemmell is a noble man or how wonderfully good dr gemmell is to the poor  also she would sometimes have given tommy a glance that said i wonder if you guess  had they quarrelled tommy smiled if it was but a quarrel he was not merely appeasedhe was pleased had he had the ordering of the affair he would certainly have included a lovers quarrel in it and had it not been that he wanted to give her the pleasure of finding these things out for herself he would have taken her aside and addressed her thus no need to look tragic elspeth for to a woman this must be really one of the most charming moments in the comedy you feel that he would not have quarrelled had he had any real caring for you and yet in your heart you know it is a proof that he has to a woman i who know assure you that nothing can be more delicious your feeling for him as you and i well know is but a sentiment of attraction because he loves you as you are unable to love him and as you are so pained by this quarrel consider how much more painful it must be to him you think you have been slighted that when a man has seemed to like you so much you have a right to be told so by him that you may help him with your sympathy oh elspeth you think yourself unhappy just now when you are really in the middle of one of the pleasantest bits of it love is a series of thrills the one leading to the other and as your careful guardian i would not have you miss one of them you will come to the final bang quickly enough and find it the finest thrill of all but it is soon over when you have had to tell him that you are not for him there are left only the pleasures of memory and the more of them there were the more there will be to look back to i beg you elspeth not to hurry loiter rather smelling the flowers and plucking them for you may never be this way again  all these things he might have pointed out to elspeth had he wanted her to look at the matter rationally but he had no such wish he wanted her to enjoy herself as the blessed do without knowing why no pity for the man you see but no ill will to him david was having his thrills also and though the last of them would seem a staggerer to him at the time it would gradually become a sunny memory the only tragedy is not to have known love so long as you have the experiences it does not greatly matter whether your suit was a failure or successful  so tommy decided but he feared at the same time that there had been no quarrelthat david had simply drawn back  how he saw through elspeths brave attempts to show that she had never for a moment thought of davids having any feeling for her save ordinary friendshipyes they were brave but not brave enough for tommy at times she would say something bitter about life not about the doctor for he was never mentioned and it was painful to her brother to see gentle elspeth grown cynical he suffered even more when her manner indicated that she knew she was too poor a creature to be loved by any man tommy was in great woe about elspeth at this time he was thinking much more about her than about grizel but do not blame him unreservedly for that the two women who were his dears were pulling him different ways and he could not accompany both he had made up his mind to be loyal to grizel and so all his pity could go to elspeth on the day he had his talk with the doctor therefore he had as it were put grizel aside only because she was happy just now and so had not elspeths need of him  the doctor and he had met on the hill whence the few who look may see one of the fairest views in scotland tommy was strolling up and down and the few other persons on the hill were glancing with goodhumoured suspicion at him as we all look at celebrated characters had he been happy he would have known that they were watching him and perhaps have put his hands behind his back to give them more for their money as the saying is but he was miserable his one consolation was that the blow he must strike elspeth when he told her of his engagement need not be struck just yet david could not have chosen a worse moment therefore for saying so bluntly what he said i hear you are to be married if so i should like to congratulate you  tommy winced like one charged with open cruelty to his sistercharged with it too by the real criminal  it is not true david asked quietly and tommy turned from him glaring i am sorry i spoke of it as it is not true the doctor said after a pause the crowsfeet showing round his eyes as always when he was in mental pain and presently he went away after giving tommy a contemptuous look did tommy deserve that look we must remember that he had wanted to make the engagement public at once if he shrank from admitting it for the present it was because of elspeths plight grizel you might have given her a little time to recover from this mans faithlessness was what his heart cried he believed that grizel had told david and for the last time in his life he was angry with her he strode down the hill savagely towards caddam wood where he knew he should find her  soon he saw her she was on one of the many tiny paths that lead the stranger into the middle of the wood and then leave him there maliciously or because they dare not venture any farther themselves they could play no tricks on grizel however for she knew and was fond of them all tommy had said that she loved them because they were such little paths that they appealed to her like babies and perhaps there was something in it  she came up the path with the swing of one who was gleefully happy some of the thrums people you remember said that grizel strutted because she was so satisfied with herself and if you like an ugly word we may say that she strutted today it was her whole being giving utterance to the joy within her that love had brought as grizel came up the path on that bright afternoon she could no more have helped strutting than the bud to open on the appointed day she was obeying one of natures laws i think i promised long ago to tell you of the day when grizel would strut no more well this is the day observe her strutting for the last time it was very strange and touching to her to remember in the after years that she had once strutted but it was still more strange and touching to tommy  she was like one overfilled with delight when she saw him how could she know that he was to strike her  he did not speak she was not displeased when anything so tremendous happened as the meeting of these two how could they find words at once  she bent and pressed her lips to his sleeve but he drew away with a gesture that startled her  you are not angry she said stopping  yes he replied doggedly  not with me her hand went to her heart with me a wounded animal could not have uttered a cry more pathetic not with me she clutched his arm  have i no cause to be angry he said  she looked at him in bewilderment could this be he oh could it be she  cause how could i give you cause  it seemed unanswerable to her how could grizel do anything that would give him the right to be angry with her oh men men will you never understand how absolutely all of her a womans love can be if she gives you everything how can she give you more she is not another person she is part of you does one finger of your hand plot against another  he told her sullenly of his scene with the doctor  i am very sorry she said but her eyes were still searching for the reason why tommy could be angry with her  you made me promise to tell no one he said and i have kept my promise but you  the anguish that was grizels then you cant think that i told him she cried and she held out her arms as if to remind him of who she was you can believe that of your grizel  i daresay you have not done it wittingly but this man has guessed and he could never have guessed it from look or word of mine  it must have been i she said slowly tell me she cried like a suppliant how have i done it  your manner your face he answered it must have been that i dont blame you grizel butyes it must have been that and it is hard on me  he was in misery and these words leaped out they meant only that it was hard on him if elspeth had to be told of his engagement in the hour of her dejection he did not mean to hurt grizel to the quick however terrible the loss of his freedom might be to the man who could not love he always intended to be true to her but she gave the words a deeper meaning  she stood so still she seemed to be pondering and at last she said quietly as if they had been discussing some problem outside themselves yes i think it must have been that she looked long at him it is very hard on you she said  i feel sure it was that she went on and now her figure was erect and again it broke and sometimes there was a noble scorn in her voice but more often there was only pitiful humility i feel sure it was that for i have often wondered how everybody did not know i have broken my promise i used always to be able to keep a promise i had every other faulti was hard and proud and intolerantbut i was true i think i was vain of that though i see now it was only something i could not help from the moment when i had a difficulty in keeping a promise i ceased to keep it i love you so much that i carry my love in my face for all to read they cannot see me meet you without knowing the truth they cannot hear me say your name but i betray myself i show how i love you in every movement i am full of you how can anyone look at me and not see you i should have been more carefuloh i could have been so much more careful had i loved you a little less it is very hard on you  the note of satire had died out of her voice her every look and gesture carried in it nothing but love for him but all the unhappy dog could say was something about selfrespect  her mouth opened as if for bitterness but no sound came how much selfrespect do you think is left for me after today she said mournfully at last and then she quickly took a step nearer her dear one as if to caress the spot where these words had struck him but she stopped and for a moment she was the grizel of old have no fear she said with a trembling crooked smile there is only one thing to be done now and i shall do it all the blame is mine you shall not be deprived of your selfrespect  he had not been asking for his freedom but he heard it running to him now and he knew that if he answered nothing he would be whistling it back for ever a madness to be free at any cost swept over him he let go his hold on selfrespect and clapped his hand on freedom  he answered nothing and the one thing for her to do was to go and she did it but it was only for a moment that she could be altogether the grizel of old she turned to take a long last look at him but the wofulness of herself was what she saw she cried with infinite pathos oh how could you hurt your grizel so  he controlled himself and let her go his freedom was fawning on him licking his hands and face and in that madness he actually let grizel go it was not until she was out of sight that he gave utterance to a harsh laugh he knew what he was at that moment as you and i shall never be able to know him eavesdrop how we may  he flung himself down in a blaeberrybed and lay there doggedly his weak mouth tightly closed a great silence reigned no not a great silence for he continued to hear the cry oh how could you hurt your grizel so she scarcely knew that she had said it but to him who knew what she had been and what he had changed her into and for what alone she was to blame there was an unconscious pathos in it that was terrible it was the epitome of all that was grizel all that was adorable and all that was pitiful in her it rang in his mind like a bell of doom he believed its echo would not be quite gone from his ears when he died if all the wise men in the world had met to consider how grizel could most effectively say farewell to tommy they could not have thought out a better sentence however completely he had put himself emotionally in her place with this same object he would have been inspired by nothing quite so good  but they were loves dying words he knew he could never again though he tried be to grizel what he had been the water was spilled on the ground she had thought him all that was glorious in manthat was what her love had meant and it was spilled there was only one way in which he could wound her more cruelly than she was already hurt and that was by daring to ask her to love him still to imply that he thought her pride so broken her independence her maidenly modesty all that make up the loveliness of a girl so lost that by entreaties he could persuade her to forgive him would destroy her altogether it would reveal to her how low he thought her capable of falling  i suppose we should all like to think that it would have been thus with grizel but our wishes are of small account it was not many minutes since she left tommy to be his no more his knife still in her heart but she had not reached the end of the wood when all in front of her seemed a world of goblins and a future without him not to be faced he might beat her or scorn her but not for an hour could she exist without him she wrung her arms in woe the horror of what she was doing tore her in pieces but not all this prevented her turning back it could not even make her go slowly she did not walk back she stole back in little runs she knew it was her destruction but her arms were outstretched to the spot where she had left him  he was no longer there and he saw her between the firs before she could see him as he realized what her coming back meant his frame shook with pity for her all the dignity had gone from her she looked as shamed as a dog stealing back after it had been whipped she knew she was shamed he saw she knew it the despairing rocking of her arms proved it yet she was coming back to him in little runs  pity chivalry oh surely love itself lifted him to his feet and all else passed out of him save an imperious desire to save her as much humiliation as he couldto give her back a few of those garments of pride and selfrespect that had fallen from her at least she should not think that she had to come all the way to him with a stifled sob he rose and ran up the path towards her  grizel it is you my beloved how could you leave me oh grizel my love how could you misunderstand me so  she gave a glad cry she sought feebly to hold him at arms length to look at him watchfully to read him as in the old days but the old days were gone he strained her to him oh surely it was love at last he thanked god that he loved at last     chapter xvii  how tommy saved the flag   he loved at last but had no time to exult just now for he could not rejoice with tommy while his dear one drooped in shame ah so well he understood that she believed she had done the unpardonable thing in woman and that while she thought so she must remain a broken column it was a great task he saw before himnothing less than to make her think that what she had done was not shameful but exquisite that she had not tarnished the flag of love but glorified it artfulness you will see was needed but remember he was now using all his arts in behalf of the woman he loved  you were so long in coming back to me grizel the agony of it did it seem long she spoke in a trembling voice hiding her face in him she listened like one anxious to seize his answer as it left his heart  so long he answered that it seemed to me we must be old when we met again i saw a future without you stretching before me to the grave and i turned and ran from it  that is how i felt she whispered  you tommy cried in excellent amazement  what else could have made me come  i thought it was pity that had brought youpity for me grizel i thought you had perhaps come back to be angry with me  how could i be she cried  how could you help it rather said he i was cruel grizel i spoke like a fool as well as like a dastard but it was only anxiety for elspeth that made me do it dear one be angry with me as often as you choose and whether i deserve it or not but dont go away from me never send me from you again anything but that  it was how she had felt again and her hold on him tightened with sudden joy so well he knew what that grip meant he did not tell her that he had not loved her fully until now he would have liked to tell her how true love had been born in him as he saw her stealing back to him but it was surely best for her not to know that any transformation had been needed i dont say that i love you more now than ever before he said carefully but one thing i do know that i never admired you quite so much  she looked up in surprise  i mean your character he said determinedly i have always known how strong and noble it was but i never quite thought you could do anything so beautiful as this  beautiful she could only echo the word  many women even of the best he told her would have resorted to little feminine ways of humbling such a blunderer as i have been they would have spurned him for weeks made him come to them on his knees perhaps have thought that his brutality of a moment outweighed all his love when i saw you coming to meet me halfwayoh grizel tell me that you were doing that  yes yes yes she answered eagerly so that she might not detain him a moment  when i saw you i realized that you were willing to forgive me that you were coming to say so that no thought of lowering me first was in your mind that yours was a love above the littleness of ordinary people and the adorableness of it filled me with a glorious joy i saw in that moment what woman in her highest development is capable of and that the noblest is the most womanly  she said womanly with a little cry it had always been such a sweet word to her and she thought it could never be hers again  it is by watching you he replied that i know the meaning of the word i thought i knew long ago but every day you give it a nobler meaning  if she could have believed it for a second or two she tried to believe it and then she shook her head  how dear of you to think that of me she answered she looked up at him with exquisite approval in her eyes she had always felt that men should have high ideas about women  but it was not to save you pain that i came back she said bravely there was something pathetic in the way the truth had always to come out of her i did not think you wanted me to come back i never expected you to be looking for me and when i saw you doing it my heart nearly stopped for gladness i thought you were wearied of me and would be annoyed when you saw me coming back i said to myself if i go back i shall be a disgrace to womanhood but i came and now do you know what my heart is saying and always will be saying it is that pride and honour and selfrespect are gone and the terrible thing is that i dont seem to care i who used to value them so much am willing to let them go if you dont send me away from you oh if you cant love me any longer let me still love you that is what i came back to say  grizel grizel he cried it was she who was wielding the knife now  but it is true she said  we could so easily pretend that it isnt that was not what he said though it was at his heart he sat down saying  this is a terrible blow but better you should tell it to me than leave me to find it out he was determined to save the flag for grizel though he had to try all the tommy ways one by one  have i hurt you she asked anxiously she could not bear to hurt him for a moment what did i say  it amounts to this he replied huskily you love me but you wish you did not that is what it means  he expected her to be appalled by this but she stood still thinking it over there was something pitiful in a grizel grown undecided  do i wish i did not she said helplessly i dont know perhaps that is what i do wish ah but what are wishes i know now that they dont matter at all  yes they matter he assured her in the voice of one looking upon death if you no longer want to love me you will cease to do it soon enough his manner changed to bitterness so dont be cast down grizel for the day of your deliverance is at hand  but again she disappointed him and as the flag must be saved at whatever cost he said  it has come already i see you no longer love me as you did her arms rose in anguish but he went on ruthlessly you will never persuade me that you do i shall never believe it again  i suppose it was a pitiable thing about grizelit was something he had discovered weeks ago and marvelled overthat nothing distressed her so much as the implication that she could love him less she knew she could not but that he should think it possible was the strangest woe to her it seemed to her to be loves only tragedy we have seen how difficult it was for grizel to cry when she said how could you hurt your grizel so she had not cried nor when she knew that if she went back to him her selfrespect must remain behind but a painful tear came to her eyes when he said that she loved him less it almost unmanned him but he proceeded for her good  i daresay you still care for me a little as the rank and file of people love what right had i of all people to expect a love so rare and beautiful as yours to last it had to burn out like a great fire as such love always does the experience of the world has proved it  oh she cried and her body was rocking if he did not stop she would weep herself to death  yes it seems sad tommy continued but if ever man knew that it served him right i know it and they maintain the wiseacres who have analyzed love that there is much to be said in favour of a calm affection the glory has gone but the material comforts are greater and in the end  she sank upon the ground he was bleeding for her was tommy he went on his knees beside her and it was terrible to him to feel that every part of her was alive with anguish he called her many sweet names and she listened for them between her sobs but still she sobbed he could bear it no longer he cried and called upon god to smite him she did not look up but her poor hands pulled him back you said i do not love you the same she moaned  grizel he answered as if in sad reproof it was not i who said thatit was you i put into words only what you have been telling me for the last ten minutes  no no she cried oh how could i  he flung up his arms in despair is this only pity for me grizel he implored looking into her face as if to learn his fate or is it love indeed  you know it is loveyou know  but what kind of love he demanded fiercely is it the same love that it was quick tell me i cant have less if it is but a little less you will kill me  the first gleam of sunshine swept across her face and oh how he was looking for it do you want it to be the samedo you really want it oh it is it is  and you would not cease to love me if you could  no no no she would have come closer to him but he held her back  one moment grizel he said in a hard voice that filled her with apprehension there must be no second mistake in saying that love and love alone brought you back you are admitting are you not that you were talking wildly about loss of pride and honour you did the loveliest thing you have ever done when you came back if i were you my character would be ruined from this houri should feel so proud of myself  she smiled at that and fondled his hand if you think so she said all is well  but he would not leave it thus you must think so also he insisted and when she still shook her head then i am proud of your love no longer said he doggedly how proud of it i have been a man cannot love a woman without reverencing her without being touched to the quick a score of times a day by the revelations she gives of herselfrevelations of such beauty and purity that he is abashed in her presence the unspoken prayers he offers up to god at those times he gives to her to carry and when such a one returns his love he is proud indeed to me you are the embodiment of all that is fair in woman and it is love that has made you so that has taken away your little imperfectionslove for me ah grizel i was so proud to think that somehow i had done it but even now in the moment when your love has manifested itself most splendidly you are ashamed of it and what i respect and reverence you for most are changes that have come about against your will if your love makes you sorrowful how can i be proud of it henceforth it will be my greatest curse  she started up wringing her hands it was something to have got her to her feet  surely he said like one puzzled as well as pained by her obtuseness you see clearly that it must be so true love as i conceive it must be something passing all knowledge irresistible something not to be resented for its power but worshipped for it something not to fight against but to glory in and such is your love but you give the proof of it with shame because your ideal of love is a humdrum sort of affection that is all you would like to feel grizel and because you feel something deeper and nobler you say you have lost your selfrespect i am the man who has taken it from you can i ever be proud of your love again  he paused overcome with emotion what it has been to me he cried i walked among my fellows as if i were a colossus it inspired me at my work i felt that there was nothing great i was not capable of and all because grizel loved me  she stood trembling with delight at what he said and with apprehension at what he seemed to threaten his head being bent he could not see her and amid his grief he wondered a little what she was doing now  but you spokeshe said it timidly as if to refer to the matter at all was cruel of heryou spoke as if i was disgracing you because i could not conceal my love you said it was hard on you she pressed her hands together yes that is what you said  this was awkward for tommy she believes i meant that he cried hoarsely grizel believes that of me i have behaved since then as if that was what i meant have i i meant only that it would be hard on me if elspeth learned of our love at the very moment when this man is treating her basely i look as if i had meant something worse do i i know myself at last grizel has shown me what i am  he covered his face with his hands strong man as he was he could not conceal his agony  dont she cried if i was wrong  if you were wrong  i was wrong i know i was wrong somehow it was a mistake i dont know how it arose but you love me and you want me to love you still that is all i know i thought you did not but you do if you wanted me to come back  if i wanted it  i know you wanted it now and i am no longer ashamed to have come i am glad i came and if you can still be proud of my love and respect me  oh grizel if  then i have got back my pride and my selfrespect again i cannot reason about it but they have come back again  it was she who was trying to comfort him by this time caressing his hair and his hands but he would not be appeased at once it was good for her to have something to do  you are sure you are happy again grizel you are not pretending in order to please me  so happy  but your eyes are still wet  that is because i have hurt you so oh how happy i should be if i could see you smile again  how i would smile if i saw you looking happy  then smile at once sir she could say presently for see how happy i am looking and as she beamed on him once more he smiled as well as he was able to grizel loved him so much that she actually knew when that face of his was smiling and soon she was saying gaily to his eyes oh silly eyes that wont sparkle what is the use of you and she pressed her own upon them and to his mouth she said mouth that does not know how to laughpoor tragic mouth he let her do nearly all the talking she sat there crooning over him as if he were her child  and so the flag was saved he begged her to let him tell their little world of his love for her and especially was he eager to go straight with it to the doctor but she would not have this david and elspeth shall know in good time she said very nobly i am sure they are fond of each other and they shall know of our happiness on the day when they tell us of their own and until that great day came she was not to look upon herself as engaged to tommy and he must never kiss her again until they were engaged i think it was a pleasure to her to insist on this it was her punishment to herself for ever having doubted tommy                                        part ii                                           chapter xviii  the girl she had been   as they sat amid the smell of rosin on that summer day she told him with a glance that said now you will laugh at me what had brought her into caddam wood  i came to rub something out  he reflected a memory  yes  of me  she nodded  an unhappy memory  not to me she replied leaning on him i have no memory of you i would rub out no not the unhappiest one for it was you and that makes it dear all memories however sad of loved ones become sweet dont they when we get far enough away from them  but to whom then is this memory painful grizel  again she cast that glance at him to her she whispered  that little girl  yes the child i used to be you see she never grew up and so they are not distant memories to her i try to rub them out of her mind by giving her prettier things to think of i go to the places where she was most unhappy and tell her sweet things about you i am not morbid am i in thinking of her still as some one apart from myself you know how it began in the lonely days when i used to look at her in mammas mirror and pity her and fancy that she was pitying me and entreating me to be careful always when i think i see her now she seems to be looking anxiously at me and saying oh do be careful and the sweet things i tell her about you are meant to show her how careful i have become are you laughing at me for this i sometimes laugh at it myself  no it is delicious he answered her speaking more lightly than he felt what a numskull you make grizel of any man who presumes to write about women i am at school again and you are miss ailie teaching me the alphabet but i thought you lost that serious little girl on the doleful day when she heard you say that you loved me best  she came back she has no one but me  and she still warns you against me  grizel laughed gleefully i am too clever for her she said i do all the talking i allow her to listen only and you must not blame her for distrusting you i have said such things against you to her oh the things i said on the first day i saw you for instance after you came back to thrums it was in church do you remember  i should like to know what you said to her about me that day  would you grizel asked merrily well let me see she was not at churchshe never went there you remember but of course she was curious to hear about you and i had no sooner got home than she came to me and said was he there yes i said is he much changed she asked he has a beard i said you know that is not what i really mean she said and then i said i dont think he is so much changed that it is impossible to recognize him again  tommy interrupted her now what did you mean by that  i meant that i thought you were a little annoyed to find the congregation looking at gavinias baby more than at you  grizel you are a wretch but perhaps you were right well what more did the little inquisitor want to know  she asked me if i felt any of my old fear of you and i said no and then she clapped her hands with joy and she asked whether you looked at me as if you were begging me to say i still thought you a wonder and i said i thought you did  grizel  oh i told her ever so many dreadful things as soon as i found them out i told her the whole story of your ankle sir for instance  on my word grizel you seem to have omitted nothing  ah but i did she cried i never told her how much i wanted you to be admirable i pretended that i despised you merely and in reality i was wringing my hands with woe every time you did not behave like a god  they will be worn away grizel if you go on doing that  i dont think so she replied nor can she think so if she believes half of what i have told her about you since she knows how you saved the boys life i told her that in the old lair because she had some harsh memories of you there and it was at the cuttle well that i told her about the glove  and where asked tommy severely did you tell her that you had been mistaken in thinking me jealous of a baby and anxious to be considered a wonder  she hid her face for a moment and then looked up roguishly into his i have not told her that yet she replied it was so audacious of her that he took her by the ears  if i were vain tommy said reflectively i would certainly shake you now you show a painful want of tact grizel in implying that i am not perfect nothing annoys men so much we can stand anything except that  his merriness gladdened her they are only little things she said and i have grown to love them i know they are flaws but i love them because  say because they are mine you owe me that  no but because they are weaknesses i dont have i have others but not those and it is sweet to me to know that you are weak in some matters in which i am strong it makes me feel that i can be of use to you  are you insinuating that there are more of them tommy demanded sitting up  you are not very practical she responded and i am  go on  and you arejust a littleinclined to be senti  hush i dont allow that word but you may say if you choose that i am sometimes carried away by a too generous impulse  and that it will be my part said she to seize you by the arm and hold you back oh you will give me a great deal to do that is one of the things i love you for it was one of the things i loved my dear dr mcqueen for she looked up suddenly i have told him also about you  lately grizel  yes in my parlour it was his parlour you know and i had kept nothing from him while he was alive that is to say he always knew what i was thinking of and i like to fancy that he knows still in the evenings he used to sit in the armchair by the fire and i sat talking or knitting at his feet and if i ceased to do anything except sit still looking straight before me he knew i was thinking the morbid thoughts that had troubled me in the old days at double dykes without knowing it i sometimes shuddered at those times and he was distressed it reminded him of my mamma  i understand tommy said hurriedly he meant let us avoid painful subjects  illustration i sit still by his armchair and tell him what is happening to his grizel  it is years she went on since those thoughts have troubled me and it was he who drove them away he was so kind he thought so much of my future that i still sit by his armchair and tell him what is happening to his grizel i dont speak aloud of course i scarcely say the words to myself even and yet we seem to have long talks together i told him i had given you his coat  well i dont think he was pleased at that grizel i have had a feeling for some time that the coat dislikes me it scratched my hand the first time i put it on my hand caught in the hook of the collar you will say but no that is not what i think in my opinion the deed was maliciously done mcqueen always distrusted me you know and i expect his coat was saying hands off my grizel  she took it as quite a jest he does not distrust you now she said smiling i have told him what i think of you and though he was surprised at first in the end his opinion was the same as mine  ah you saw to that grizel  i had nothing to do with it i merely told him everything and he had to agree with me how could he doubt when he saw that you had made me so happy even mamma does not doubt  you have told her all this is rather eerie grizel  you are not sorry are you she asked looking at him anxiously dr mcqueen wanted me to forget her he thought that would be best for me it was the only matter on which we differed i gave up speaking of her to him you are the only person i have mentioned her to since i became a woman but i often think of her i am sure there was a time before i was old enough to understand when she was very fond of me i was her baby and women cant help being fond of their babies even though they should never have had them i think she often hugged me tight  need we speak of this grizel  for this once she entreated you must remember that mamma often looked at me with hatred and said i was the cause of all her woe but sometimes in her last months she would give me such sad looks that i trembled and i felt that she was picturing me growing into the kind of woman she wished so much she had not become herself and that she longed to save me that is why i have told her that a good man loves me she is so glad my poor dear mamma that i tell her again and again and she loves to hear it as much as i to tell it what she loves to hear most is that you really do want to marry me she is so fond of hearing that because it is what my father would never say to her  tommy was so much moved that he could not speak but in his heart he gave thanks that what grizel said of him to her mamma was true at last  it makes her so happy grizel said that when i seem to see her now she looks as sweet and pure as she must have been in the days when she was an innocent girl i think she can enter into my feelings more than any other person could ever do is that because she was my mother she understands how i feel just as i can understand how in the end she was willing to be bad because he wanted it so much  no no grizel tommy cried passionately you dont understand that  she rocked her arms yes i do she said i do i could never have cared for such a man but i can understand how mamma yielded to him and i have no feeling for her except pity and i have told her so and it is what she loves to hear her daughter tell her best of all  they put the subject from them and she told him what it was that she had come to rub out in caddam if you have read of tommys boyhood you may remember the day it ended with his departure for the farm and that he and elspeth walked through caddam to the cart that was to take him from her and how to comfort her he swore that he loved her with his whole heart and grizel not at all and that grizel was in the wood and heard and how elspeth had promised to wave to tommy in the cart as long as it was visible but broke down and went home sobbing and how grizel took her place and waved pretending to be elspeth so that he might think she was bearing up bravely tommy had not known what grizel did for him that day and when he heard it now for the first time from her own lips he realized afresh what a glorious girl she was and had always been  you may try to rub that memory out of little grizels head he declared looking very proudly at her but you shall never rub it out of mine  it was by his wish that they went together to the spot where she had heard him say that he loved elspeth onlyif you can find it tommy said after all these years and she smiled at his mannish wordsshe had found it so often since there was the very clump of whin  and here was the boy to match oh who by striving could make himself a boy again as tommy could i tell you he was always irresistible then what is genius it is the power to be a boy again at will when i think of him flinging off the years and whistling childhood back not to himself only but to all who heard distributing it among them gaily imperiously calling on them to dance dance for they are boys and girls again until they stopwhen to recall him in those wild moods is to myself to grasp for a moment at the dear dead days that were so much the best i cannot wonder that grizel loved him i am his slave myself i see that all that was wrong with tommy was that he could not always be a boy  hide there again grizel he cried to her little tommy cried to her stroke the jacobite her captain cried to the lady griselda and he disappeared and presently marched down the path with an imaginary elspeth by his side i love you both elspeth he was going to say and my love for the one does not make me love the other less but he glanced at grizel and she was leaning forward to catch his words as if this were no play but life or death and he knew what she longed to hear him say and he said it i love you very much elspeth but however much i love you it would be idle to pretend that i dont love grizel more  a stifled cry of joy came from a clump of whin hard by and they were man and woman again  did you not know it grizel  no no you never told me  i never dreamed it was necessary to tell you  oh if you knew how i have longed that it might be so yes and sometimes hated elspeth because i feared it could not be i have tried so hard to be content with second place i have thought it all out and said to myself it was natural that elspeth should be first  my tragic love he said i can see you arguing in that way but i dont see you convincing yourself my passionate grizel is not the girl to accept second place from anyone if i know anything of her i know that  to his surprise she answered softly you are wrong i wonder at it myself but i had made up my mind to be content with second place and to be grateful for it  i could not have believed it he cried  i could not have believed it myself said she  are you the grizel he began  no she said i have changed a little and she looked pathetically at him  it stabs me he said to see you so humble  i am humbler than i was she answered huskily but she was looking at him with the fondest love  dont look at me so grizel he implored i am unworthy of it i am the man who has made you so humble  yes she answered and still she looked at him with the fondest love a film came over his eyes and she touched them softly with her handkerchief  those eyes that but a little while ago were looking so coldly at you he said  dear eyes said she  though i were to strike you he cried raising his hand  she took the hand in hers and kissed it  has it come to this he said and as she could not speak she nodded he fell upon his knees before her  i am glad you are a little sorry she said i am a little sorry myself     chapter xix  of the change in thomas   to find ways of making david propose to elspeth of making elspeth willing to exchange her brother for davidthey were heavy tasks but tommy yoked himself to them gallantly and tugged like an arab steed in the plough it should be almost as pleasant to us as to him to think that love was what made him do it for he was sure he loved grizel at last and that the one longing of his heart was to marry her the one marvel to him was that he had ever longed ardently for anything else well as you know she longed for it also but she was firm in her resolve that until elspeth was engaged tommy should be a single man she even made him promise not to kiss her again so long as their love had to be kept secret it will be so sweet to wait she said bravely as we shall see presently his efforts to put elspeth into the hands of david were apparently of no avail but though this would have embittered many men it drew only to the surface some of tommys noblest attributes as he suffered in silence he became gentler more considerate and acquired a new command over himself to conquer self for her sake this is in the letters to a young man is the highest tribute a man can pay to a woman it is the only real greatness and tommy had done it now i could give you a score of proofs let us take his treatment of aaron latta  one day about this time tommy found himself alone in the house with aaron and had he been the old tommy he would have waited but a moment to let aaron decide which of them should go elsewhere it was thus that these two ever so uncomfortable in each others presence contrived to keep the peace now note the change  aaron said tommy in the hush that had fallen on that house since quiet elspeth left it i have never thanked you in words for all that you have done for me and elspeth  dinna do it now then replied the warper fidgeting  i must tommy said cheerily i must and he did while aaron scowled  it was never done for you aaron informed him nor for the father you are the marrows o  it was done for my mother said tommy reverently  im none so sure ot aaron rapped out i think i brocht you twa here as bairns that the reminder of my shame should ever stand before me  but tommy shook his head and sat down sympathetically beside the warper you loved her aaron he said simply it was an undying love that made you adopt her orphan children a charming thought came to him when you brought us here he said with some elation elspeth used to cry at nights because our mothers spirit did not come to us to comfort us and i invented boyish explanations to appease her but i have learned since why we did not see that spirit for though it hovered round this house its first thought was not for us but for him who succoured us  he could have made it much better had he been able to revise it but surely it was touching and aaron need not have said damn which was what he did say  one knows how most men would have received so harsh an answer to such gentle words and we can conceive how a very holy man say a monk would have bowed to it even as the monk did tommy submit or say rather with the meekness of a nun  i wish i could help you in any way aaron he said with a sigh  you can replied aaron promptly by taking yourself off to london and leaving elspeth here wi me i never made pretence that i wanted you except because she wouldna come without you laddie and man as weel you ken you were aye a scunner to me  and yet said tommy looking at him admiringly you fed and housed and educated us ah aaron do you not see that your dislike gives me the more reason only to esteem you carried away by desire to help the old man he put his hand kindly on his shoulder you have never respected yourself he said since the night you and my mother parted at the cuttle well and my heart bleeds to think of it many a year ago by your kindness to two forlorn children you expiated that sin and it is blotted out from your account forget it aaron as every other person has forgotten it and let the spirit of jean myles see you tranquil once again  he patted aaron affectionately he seemed to be the older of the two  tak your hand off my shuther aaron cried fiercely  tommy removed his hand but he continued to look yearningly at the warper another beautiful thought came to him  what are you looking so holy about asked aaron with misgivings  aaron cried tommy suddenly inspired you are not always the gloomy man you pass for being you have glorious moments still you wake in the morning and for a second of time you are in the heyday of your youth and you and jean myles are to walk out tonight as you sit by this fire you think you hear her hand on the latch of the door as you pass down the street you seem to see her coming towards you it is for a moment only and then you are a grayhaired man again and she has been in her grave for many a year but you have that moment  aaron rose amazed and wrathful the deil tak you he cried how did you find out that  perhaps tommys nose turned up rapturously in reply for the best of us cannot command ourselves altogether at great moments but when he spoke he was modest again  it was sympathy that told me he explained and aaron if you will only believe me it tells me also that a little of the man you were still clings to you come out of the moroseness in which you have enveloped yourself so long think what a joy it would be to elspeth  its little she would care  if you want to hurt her tell her so  im no denying but what shes fell fond o me  then for her sake tommy pleaded  but the warper turned on him with baleful eyes she likes me he said in a grating voice and yet im as nothing to her we are all as nothing to her beside you if there hadna been you i should hae become the father to her i craved to be but you had mesmerized her she had eyes for none but you i sent you to the herding meaning to break your power over her and all she could think o was my cruelty in sindering you syne you ran aff wi her to london stealing her frae me i was without her while she was growing frae lassie to woman the years when maybe she could hae made o me what she willed magerful tam took the mother frae me and he lived again in you to tak the dochter  you really think me masterfulme tommy said smiling  i suppose you never were aaron replied ironically  yes tommy admitted frankly i was masterful as a boy ah and even quite lately how we change he said musingly  how we dinna change retorted aaron bitterly he had learned the truer philosophy  man he continued looking tommy over theres times when i see mair o your mother than your father in you she was a wonder at making believe the letters about her grandeur that she wrote to thrums when she was starving even you couldna hae wrote them better but she never managed to cheat hersel thats whaur you sail away frae her  i used to make believe aaron as you say tommy replied sadly if you knew how i feel the folly of it now perhaps even you would wish that i felt it less  but we must each of us dree his own weird he proceeded with wonderful sweetness when aaron did not answer and so far at least as elspeth is concerned surely i have done my duty i had the bringing up of her from the days when she was learning to speak  she got into the way o letting you do everything for her the warper responded sourly you thought for her you acted for her frae the first you toomed her and then filled her up wi yoursel  she always needed some one to lean on  ay because you had maimed her she grew up in the notion that you were all the earth and the wonder o the world  could i help that  help it did you try it was the one thing you were sure o yoursel it was the one thing you thought worth anybodys learning you stood before her crowing the whole day i said the now i wished you would go and leave her wi me but i wouldna dare to keep her shes helpless without you if you took your arm awa frae her now she would tumble to the ground  i fear it is true aaron tommy said with bent head whether she is so by nature or whether i have made her so i cannot tell but i fear that what you say is true  its true said aaron and yours is the wite theres no life for her now except what you mak she canna see beyond you go on thinking yoursel a wonder if you like but mind this if you were to cast her off frae you now she would die like an amputated hand  to tommy it was like listening to his doom ah aaron even you could not withhold your pity did you know how this man is being punished now for having made elspeth so dependent on him some such thought passed through tommys head but he was too brave to appeal for pity if that is so he said firmly i take the responsibility for it but i began this talk aaron not to intrude my troubles on you but hoping to lighten yours if i could see you smile aaron  drop it cried the warper and then going closer to him you would hae seen me smile ay and heard me laugh gin you had been here when mrs mclean came yont to read your book to me she fair insistit on reading the terrible noble bits to me and she grat they were so sublime but the sublimer they were the mair i laughed for i ken you tommy my man i ken you  he spoke with much vehemence and after all our hero was not perfect he withdrew stiffly to the other room i think it was the use of the word tommy that enraged him  but in a very few minutes he scorned himself and was possessed by a pensive wonder that one so tragically fated as he could resent an old mans gibe aaron misunderstood him was that any reason why he should not feel sorry for aaron he crossed the hallan to the kitchen door and stopped there overcome with pity the warper was still crouching by the fire but his head rested on his chest he was a weary desolate figure and at the other side of the hearth stood an empty chair the picture was the epitome of his life or so it seemed to the sympathetic soul at the door who saw him passing from youth to old age staring at the chair that must always be empty at the same moment tommy saw his own future and in it too an empty chair yet hard as was his own case at least he knew that he was loved if her chair must be empty the fault was as little hers as his while aaron  a noble compassion drew him forward and he put his hand determinedly on the dear old mans shoulder  aaron he said in a tremble of pity i know what is the real sorrow of your life and i rejoice because i can put an end to it you think that jean myles never cared for you but you are strangely wrong i was with my mother to the last aaron and i can tell you she asked me with her dying breath to say to you that she loved you all the time  aaron tried to rise but was pushed back into his chair love cannot die cried tommy triumphantly like the fairy in the pantomime love is always young  he stopped in midcareer at sight of aarons disappointing face are you done the warper inquired when you and me are alane in this house theres no room for the both o us and as ill never hae it said that i made jean myless bairn munt ill go out mysel  and out he went and sat on the dyke till elspeth came home it did not turn tommy sulky he nodded kindly to aaron from the window in token of forgiveness and next day he spent a valuable hour in making a cushion for the old mans chair he must be left with the impression that you made it tommy explained to elspeth for he would not take it from me  oh tommy how good you are  i am far from it elspeth  there is a serenity about you nowadays she said that i dont seem to have noticed before and indeed this was true it was the serenity that comes to those who having a mortal wound can no more be troubled by the pinpricks  there has been nothing to cause it has there elspeth asked timidly  only the feeling that i have much to be grateful for he replied i have you elspeth  and i have you she said and i want no more i could never care for anyone as i care for you tommy  she was speaking unselfishly she meant to imply delicately that the doctors defection need not make tommy think her unhappy are you glad she asked  he said yes bravely elspeth he was determined should never have the distress of knowing that for her sake he was giving up the one great joy which life contains he was a grander character than most men have often in the worlds history made a splendid sacrifice for women but if you turn up the annals you will find that the woman nearly always knew of it  he told grizel what aaron had said and what elspeth had said he could keep nothing from her now he was done with the world of makebelieve for ever and it seemed wicked of him to hope he declared or to let her hope i ought to give you up grizel he said with a groan  i wont let you she replied adorably  gemmell has not come near us for a week i ask him in but he avoids the house  i dont understand it grizel had to admit but i think he is fond of her i do indeed  even if that were so i fear she would not accept him i know elspeth so well that i feel i am deceiving you if i say there is any hope  nevertheless you must say it she answered brightly you must say it and leave me to think it and i do think it i believe that elspeth despite her timidity and her dependence on you is like other girls at heart and not more difficult to win  and even if it all comes to nothing she told him a little faintly i shall not be unhappy you dont really know me if you think i should love to be married soso much as all that  it is you grizel he replied who dont see that it is myself i am pitying it is i who want to be married as much as all that  her eyes shone with a soft light for of course it was what she wanted him to say these two seemed to have changed places that people could love each other and there the end had been his fond philosophy and her torment now it was she who argued for it and tommy who shook his head  they can be very very happy  no he said  but one of them is  not the other he insisted and of course it was again what she wanted him to say  and he was not always despairing he tried hard to find a way of bringing david to elspeths feet and once at least the apparently reluctant suitor almost succumbed tommy had met him near aarons house and invited him to come in and hear elspeth singing i did not know she sang david said hesitating  she is so shy about it tommy replied lightly that we can hear her by stealth only aaron and i listen at the door come and listen at the door  and david had yielded and listened at the door and afterwards gone in and remained like one who could not tear himself away what was more he and elspeth had touched upon the subject of love in their conversation tommy sitting at the window so engrossed in a letter to pym that he seemed to hear nothing though he could repeat everything afterwards to grizel  elspeth had said in her shrinking way that if she were a man she could love only a woman who was strong and courageous and helpfulsuch a woman as grizel she had said  and yet david replied women have been loved who had none of those qualities  in spite of the want of them elspeth asked  perhaps because of it said he  they are noble qualities elspeth maintained a little sadly and he assented and one of them at least is essential she said a woman has no right to be loved who is not helpful  she is helpful to the man who loves her david replied  he would have to do for her elspeth said the very things she should be doing for him  he may want very much to do them said david  then it is her weakness that appeals to him is not that loving her for the wrong thing  it may be the right thing david insisted for him  and at that point tommy said boyishly to grizel i ceased to hear them i was so elated i felt that everything was coming right i could not give another thought to their future i was so busy mapping out my own i heard a hammering do you know what it was it was our house going upyour house and mine our home grizel it was not here nor in london it was near the thames i wanted it to be upon the bank but you said no you were afraid of floods i wanted to superintend the building but you conducted me contemptuously to my desk you intimated that i did not know how to buildthat no one knew except yourself you instructed the architect and bullied the workmen and cried for more storeclosets grizel i saw the house go up i saw you the adoration and terror of your servants i heard you singing from room to room  he was touched by this all beautiful thoughts touched him  but as a rule though tommy tried to be brave for her sake it was usually she who was the comforter now and he the comforted and this was the arrangement that suited grizel best her one thought need no longer be that she loved him too much but how much he loved her it was not her selfrespect that must be humoured back but his if hers lagged what did it matter what are her own troubles to a woman when there is something to do for the man she loves  you are too anxious about the future she said to him if he had grown gloomy again can we not be happy in the present and leave the future to take care of itself how strange to know that it was grizel who said this to tommy and not tommy who said it to grizel  she delighted in playing the mother to him now you must go back to your desk she would say masterfully you have three hours work to do tonight yet  it can wait let me stay a little longer with you grizel he answered humbly ha it was tommy who was humble now not so long ago he would not have allowed his work to wait for anyone and grizel knew it and exulted  to work sir she ordered and you must put on your old coat before you sit down to write and pull up your cuffs so that they dont scrape on the desk also you must not think too much about me  she tried to look businesslike but she could scarce resist rocking her arms with delight when she heard herself saying such things to him it was as if she had the old doctor once more in her hands  what more grizel i like you to order me about  only this good afternoon  but i am to walk home with you he entreated  no she said decisively but she smiled once upon a time it had been she who asked for this  if you are good she said you shall perhaps see me tomorrow  perhaps only he was scared but she smiled happily again it had once been she who had to beg that there should be no perhaps  if you are good she repliedand you are not good when you have such a long face smile you silly boy smile when i order you if you dont i shall not so much as look out at my window tomorrow  he was the man who had caused her so much agony and she was looking at him with the eternally forgiving smile of the mother ah grizel tommy cried passionately how brave and unselfish and noble you are and what a glorious wife god intended you to be  she broke from him with a little cry but when she turned round again it was to nod and smile to him     chapter xx  a loveletter   some beautiful days followed so beautiful to grizel that as they passed away she kissed her hand to them do you see her standing on tiptoe to see the last of them they lit a fire in the chamber of her soul which is the home of all pure maids and the fagots that warmed grizel were every fond look that had been on her lovers face and every sweet word he had let fall she counted and fondled them and pretended that one was lost that she might hug it more than all the others when it was found to sit by that fire was almost better than having the days that lit it sometimes she could scarcely wait for the day to go  tommys fond looks and sweet words there was also a letter in those days and now that i remember a little garnet ring and there were a few other fagots but all so trifling it must seem incredible to you that they could have made so great a blazenothing else in it on my honour except a girls heart added by herself that the fire might burn a moment longer  and now what so chilly as the fire that has gone out gone out long ago dear grizel while you crouched over it you may put your hand in the ashes they will not burn you now ah grizel why do you sit there in the cold  the day of the letter it began in dread but ended so joyfully do you think grizel grudged the dread it became dear to her she loved to return to it and gaze at the joy it glorified as one sees the sunshine from a murky room when she heard the postmans knock she was not even curious so few letters came to her she thought this must be maggy anns monthly one from aberdeen and went on placidly dusting at last she lifted it from the floor for it had been slipped beneath the door and then grizel was standing in her little lobby panting as if at the end of a race the letter lay in both her hands and they rose slowly until they were pressed against her breast  she uttered some faint cries it was the only moment in which i have known grizel to be hysterical and then she ran to her room and locked herself inherself and it do you know why that look of elation had come suddenly to her face it was because he had not even written the address in a disguised hand to deceive the postmistress so much of the old grizel was gone that the pathos of her elation over this was lost to her  several times she almost opened it why did she pause why had that frightened look come into her eyes she put the letter on her table and drew away from it if she took a step nearer her hands went behind her back as if saying grizel dont ask us to open it we are afraid  perhaps it really did say the dear things that love writes perhaps it was aghast at the way she was treating it dear letter her mouth smiled to it but her hands remained afraid as she stood irresolute smiling and afraid she was a little like her mother i have put off as long as possible saying that grizel was ever like her mother the painted lady had never got any letters while she was in thrums but she looked wistfully at those of other people they are so pretty she had said but dont open them when you open them they break your heart grizel remembered what her mother had said  had the old grizel feared what might be inside it would have made her open the letter more quickly two minds to one person were unendurable to her but she seemed to be a coward now it was pitiable  perhaps it was quite a common little letter beginning dear grizel and saying nothing more delicious or more terrible than that he wanted her to lend him one of the doctors books she thought of a score of trivialities it might be about but the letter was still unopened when david gemmell called to talk over some cases in which he required her counsel he found her sitting listlessly something in her lap which she at once concealed she failed to follow his arguments and he went away puckering his brows some of the old doctors sayings about her ringing loud in his ears  one of them was things will be far wrong with grizel when she is able to sit idle with her hands in her lap  another she is almost pitifully straightforward man everything that is in grizel must out she can hide nothing  yet how cunningly she had concealed what was in her hands cunning applied to grizel david shuddered he thought of tommy and shut his mouth tight he could do this easily tommy could not do it without feeling breathless they were types of two kinds of men  david also remembered a promise he had given mcqueen and wondered as he had wondered a good deal of late whether the time had come to keep it  but grizel sat on with her unopened letter she was to meet tommy presently on the croquet lawn of the dovecot when ailie was to play mr james the champion and she decided that she must wait till then she would know what sort of letter it was the moment she saw his face and then she pressed her hands together  oh how base of her to doubt him she said it to herself then and often afterwards she looked mournfully in her mothers long mirror at this disloyal grizel as if the capacity to doubt him was the saddest of all the changes that had come to her he had been so true yesterday oh how could she tremble today beautiful yesterday but yesterday may seem so long ago how little a time had passed between the moment when she was greeting him joyously in caddam wood and that cry of the heart how could you hurt your grizel so no she could not open her letter she could kiss it but she could not open it  foolish fears for before she had shaken hands with tommy in mrs mcleans garden she knew he loved her still and that the letter proved it she was properly punished yet surely in excess for when she might have been reading her first loveletter she had to join in discussions with various ladies about berlin wool and the like and to applaud the prowess of mr james with the loathly croquet mallet it seemed quite a long time before tommy could get a private word with her then he began about the letter at once  you are not angry with me for writing it he asked anxiously i should not have done it i had no right but such a desire to do it came over me i had to it was such a glory to me to say in writing what you are to me  she smiled happily oh exquisite day i have so long wanted to have a letter from you she said i have almost wished you would go away for a little time so that i might have a letter from you  he had guessed this he had written to give her delight  did you like the first words of it grizel he asked eagerly  the lover and the artist spoke together  could she admit that the letter was unopened and why oh the pain to him she nodded assent it was not really an untruth she told herself she did like themoh how she liked them though she did not know what they were  i nearly began my beloved he said solemnly  somehow she had expected it to be this why didnt you she asked a little disappointed  i like the other so much better he replied to write it was so delicious to me i thought you would not mind  i dont mind she said hastily what could it be  but you would have preferred beloved  it is such a sweet name  surely not so sweet as the other grizel  no she said no oh what could it be  have you destroyed it he asked and the question was a shock to her her hand rose instinctively to defend something that lay near her heart  i could not she whispered  do you mean you wanted to he asked dolefully  i thought you wanted it she murmured  i he cried aghast and she was joyous again  cant you guess where it is she said  he understood grizel you carry my letter there  she was full of glee but she puzzled him presently  do you think i could go now she inquired eagerly  and leave me  it was dreadful of her but she nodded  i want to go home  is it not home grizel when you are with me  i want to go away from home then she said it as if she loved to tantalize him  but why  i wont tell you she was looking wistfully at the door i have something to do  it can wait  it has waited too long he might have heard an assenting rustle from beneath her bodice  do let me go she said coaxingly as if he held her  i cant understand he began and broke off she was facing him demurely but exultantly challenging him he could see to read her now just when i am flattering myself that i know everything about you grizel he said with a long face i suddenly wonder whether i know anything  she would have liked to clap her hands you must remember that we have changed places she told him it is i who understand you now  and i am devoutly glad he made answer with humble thankfulness and i must ask you grizel why you want to run away from me  but you think you know she retorted smartly you think i want to read my letter again  her cleverness staggered him but i am right am i not grizel  no she said triumphantly you are quite wrong oh if you knew how wrong you are and having thus again unhorsed him she made her excuses to ailie and slipped away dr gemmell who was present and had been watching her narrowly misread the flush on her face and her restless desire to be gone  is there anything between those two do you think mrs mclean had said in a twitter to him while tommy and grizel were talking and he had answered no almost sharply  people are beginning to think there is she said in selfdefence  they are mistaken he told her curtly and it was about this time that grizel left david followed her to her home soon afterwards and maggy ann who answered his summons did not accompany him upstairs he was in the house daily and she left him to find grizel for himself he opened the parlour door almost as he knocked and she was there but had not heard him he stopped short like one who had blundered unawares on what was not for him  she was on her knees on the hearthrug with her head buried in what had been dr mcqueens chair ragged had been the seat of it on the day when she first went to live with him but very early on the following morning or to be precise five minutes after daybreak he had risen to see if there were burglars in the parlour and behold it was his grateful little maid repadding the old armchair how a situation repeats itself without disturbing her the old doctor had slipped away with a full heart it was what the young doctor did now  but the situation was not quite the same she had been bubbling over with glee then she was sobbing now david could not know that it was a sob of joy he knew only that he had never seen her crying before and that it was the letter in her hands that had brought tears at last to those once tranquil and steadfast eyes  in an odd conversation which had once taken place in that room between the two doctors gemmell had said but the time may come without my knowing it and mcqueens reply was i dont think so for she is so open but ill tell you this david as a guide i never saw her eyes wet it is one of the touching things about her that she has the eyes of a man to whom it is a shame to cry if you ever see her greeting david im sore doubting that the time will have come  as david gemmell let himself softly out of the house to return to it presently he thought the time had come what he conceived he had to do was a hard thing but he never thought of not doing it he had kept himself in readiness to do it for many days now and he walked to it as firmly as if he were on his professional rounds he did not know that the skin round his eyes had contracted giving them the look of pain which always came there when he was sorry or pitiful or indignant he was not well acquainted with his eyes and had he glanced at them now in a glass would have presumed that this was their usual expression  grizel herself opened the door to him this time and maggy ann he is found she cried victoriously evidently she had heard of his previous visit we have searched every room in the house for you she said gaily and had you disappeared for much longer maggy ann would have had the carpets up  he excused himself on the ground that he had forgotten something and she chided him merrily for being forgetful as he sat with her david could have groaned aloud how vivacious she had become but she was sparkling in false colours after what he knew had been her distress of a few minutes ago it was a painted face to him she was trying to deceive him perhaps she suspected that he had seen her crying and now attired in all a womans wiles she was defying him to believe his eyes  grizel garbed in wiles alack the day she was shielding the man and gemmell could have driven her away roughly to get at him but she was also standing over her own pride lest anyone should see that it had fallen and do you think that david would have made her budge an inch  of course she saw that he had something on his mind she knew those puckered eyes so well and had so often smoothed them for him  what is it david she asked sympathetically i see you have come as a patient tonight  as one of those patients he rejoined who feel better at mere sight of the doctor  fear of the prescription said she  not if you prescribe yourself grizel  david she cried he had been paying compliments  i mean it  so i can see by your face oh david how stern you look  dr mcqueen and i he retorted used to hold private meetings after you had gone to bed at which we agreed that you should no longer be allowed to make fun of us they came to nothing do you know why  because i continued to do it  no but because we missed it so much if you stopped  you are nice tonight david she said dropping him a courtesy  we liked all your bullying ways he went on we were children in your masterful hands  i was a tyrant david she said looking properly ashamed i wonder you did not marry just to get rid of me  have you ever seriously wondered why i dont marry he asked quickly  oh david she exclaimed what else do you think your patients and i talk of when i am trying to nurse them it has agitated the town ever since you first walked up the marrywellbrae and we cant get on with our work for thinking of it  seriously grizel  she became grave at once if you could find the right woman she said wistfully  i have found her he answered and then she pressed her hands together too excited to speak  if she would only care a little for me he said  grizel rocked her arms i am sure she does she cried david i am so glad  he saw what her mistake was but pretended not to know that she had made one are you really glad that i love you grizel he asked  it seemed to daze her for a moment not me david she said softly as if correcting him you dont mean that it is me she said coaxingly david she cried say it is not me  he drooped his head but not before he had seen all the brightness die out of her face is it so painful to you even to hear me say it he asked gravely  her joy had been selfish as her sorrow was for nigh a minute she had been thinking of herself alone it meant so much to her but now she jumped up and took his hand in hers  poor david she said making much of his hand as if she had hurt it but david gemmells was too simple a face to oppose to her pitying eyes and presently she let his hand slip from her and stood regarding him curiously he had to look another way and then she even smiled a little forlornly  do you mind talking it over with me grizel he asked i have always been well aware that you did not care for me in that way but nevertheless i believe you might do worse  no woman could do better she answered gravely i should like you to talk it over david if you begin at the beginning and she sat down with her hands crossed  i wont say what a good thing it would be for me was his beginning we may take that for granted  i dont think we can she remarked but it scarcely matters at present that is not the beginning david  he was very anxious to make it the beginning  i am weary of living in lodgings he said the practice suffers by my not being married many patients dislike being attended by a single man i ought to be in mcqueens house it has been so long known as the doctors house and you should be a doctors wifeyou who could almost be the doctor it would be a shame grizel if you who are so much to patients were to marry out of the profession dont you follow me  i follow you she replied but what does it matter you have not begun at the beginning he looked at her inquiringly you must begin she informed him by saying why you ask me to marry you when you dont love me she added in answer to another look from him you know you dont there was a little reproach in it oh david what made you think i could be so easily taken in  he looked so miserable that by and by she smiled not so tremulously as before  how bad at it you are david she said  and how good at it she was he thought gloomily  shall i help you out she asked gently but speaking with dignity you think i am unhappy you believe i am in the position in which you placed yourself of caring for someone who does not care for me  grizel i mistrust him  she flushed she was not quite so gentle now and so you offer me your hand to save me it was a great selfsacrifice david but you used not to be fond of doing showy things  i did not mean it to be showy he answered  she was well aware of that butoh david she cried that you should believe i needed it how little you must think of me  does it look as if i thought little of you he said  little of my strength david little of my pride  i think so much of them that how could i stand by silently and watch them go  you think you have seen that she was agitated now  he hesitated yes he said courageously  her eyes cried david how could you be so cruel but they did not daunt him  have you not seen it yourself grizel he said  she pressed her hands together i was so happy she said until you came  have you not seen it yourself he asked again  there may be better things she retorted than those you rate so highly  not for you he said  if they are gone she told him with a flush of resentment it is not you who can bring them back  but let me try grizel said he  david can i not even make you angry with me  no grizel you cant i am very sorry that i can make you angry with me  i am not she said dispiritedly it would be contemptible in me and then eagerly but david you have made a great mistake indeed you have youyou are a dreadful bungler sir she was trying to make his face relax with a tremulous smile from herself to encourage him but the effort was not successful you see i cant even bully you now she said did that capacity go with the others david  try a little harder he replied i think you will find that i submit to it still  very well she forced some gaiety to her aid after all how could she let his monstrous stupidity wound a heart protected by such a letter  you have been a very foolish and presumptuous boy she began she was standing up smiling wagging a reproachful but nervous finger at him if it were not that i have a weakness for seeing medical men making themselves ridiculous so that i may put them right i should be very indignant with you sir  put me right grizel he said he was sure she was trying to blind him again  know then david that i am not the poorspirited humble creature you seem to have come here in search of  but you admitted  how dare you interrupt me sir yes i admit that i am not quite as i was but i glory in it i used to be ostentatiously independent now i am only independent enough my pride made me walk on air now i walk on the earth where there is less chance of falling i have still confidence in myself but i begin to see that ways are not necessarily right because they are my ways in short david i am evidently on the road to being a model character  they were gay words but she ended somewhat faintly  i was satisfied with you as you were was the doctors comment  i wanted to excel  you explain nothing grizel he said reproachfully why have you changed so  because i am so happy do you remember how in the old days i sometimes danced for joy i could do it now  are you engaged to be married grizel  she took a quiet breath you have no right to question me in this way she said i think i have been very good in bearing with you so long  but she laid aside her indignation at once he was so old a friend the sincerity of him had been so often tried if you must know david she said with a girlish frankness that became her better i am not engaged to be married and i must tell you nothing more she added shutting her mouth decisively she must be faithful to her promise  he forbids it gemmell asked mercilessly  she stamped her foot not in rage but in hopelessness how incapable you are of doing him justice she cried if you only knew  tell me i want to do him justice  she sat down again sighing my attempt to regain my old power over you has not been very successful has it david we must not quarrel thoughholding out her hand which he grasped and you wont question me any more she said it appealingly  never again he answered i never wanted to question you grizel i wanted only to marry you  and that cant be  i dont see it he said so stoutly that she was almost amused but he would not be pushed aside he had something more to say  dr mcqueen wished it he said above all else in the world he wished it he often told me so  he never said that to me grizel replied quickly  because he thought that to press you was no way to make you care for me he hoped that it would come about  it has not come about david with either of us she said gently i am sure that would have been sufficient answer to him  no grizel it would not not now  he had risen and his face was whiter than she had ever seen it  i am going to hurt you grizel he said and every word was a pang to him i see no other way it has got to be done dr mcqueen often talked to me about the things that troubled you when you were a little girlthe morbid fears you had then and that had all been swept away years before i knew you but though they had been long gone you were so much to him that he tried to think of everything that might happen to you in the future and he foresaw that they might possibly come back if she were ever to care for some false loon he has said to me and then grizel he could not go on  grizel beat her hands if he could not go on she said it was not because he feared what i should do  no no david answered eagerly he never feared for that but for your happiness he told me of a boy who used to torment you oh all so long ago and of such little account that he had forgotten his name but that boy has come back and you care for him and he is a false loon grizel  she had risen too and was flashing fire on david but he went on  if the time ever comes he said to me when you see her in torture from such a cause speak to her openly about it tell her it is i who am speaking through you it will be a hard task to you but wrestle through with it david in memory of any little kindness i may have done you and the great love i bore my grizel  she was standing rigid now is there any more david she said in a low voice  only this i admired you then as i admire you now i may not love you grizel but of this i am very surehe was speaking steadily he was forgetting no onethat you are the noblest and bravest woman i have ever known and i promisedhe did not draw the promise from me i gave it to himthat if i was a free man and could help you in any way without paining you by telling you these things i would try that way first  and this is the way  i could think of no other is it of no avail  she shook her head you have made such a dreadful mistake she cried miserably and you wont see it oh how you wrong him i am the happiest girl in the world and it is he who makes me so happy but i cant explain you need not ask me i promised and i wont  you used not to be so fond of mystery grizel  i am not fond of it now  ah it is he david said bitterly and he lifted his hat is there nothing you will let me do for you grizel he cried  i thought you were to do so much for me when you came into this room she admitted wistfully and said that you were in love i thought it was with another woman  he remembered that her face had brightened how could that have helped you he asked  she saw that she had but to tell him and for her sake he would do it at once but she could not be so selfish  we need not speak of that now she said  we must speak of it he answered grizel it is but fair to me it may be so important to me  you have shown that you dont care for her david and that ends it  who is it he was much stirred  if you dont know  is it elspeth  the question came out of him like a confession and hope turned grizel giddy  do you love her david she cried  but he hesitated is what you have told me true that it would help you he asked looking her full in the eyes  do you love her she implored but he was determined to have her answer first  is it grizel  yes yes do you david  and then he admitted that he did and she rocked her arms in joy  but oh david to say such things to me when you were not a free man how badly you have treated elspeth today  she does not care for me he said  have you asked herin alarm  no but could she  how could she help it she would not tell him what tommy thought oh she must do everything to encourage david  and still said he puzzling i dont see how it can affect you  and i cant tell you she moaned oh david do do find out why are you so blind she could have shaken him dont you see that once elspeth was willing to be taken care of by some other personi must not tell you  then he would marry you  she cried in anxiety have i told you or did you find out  i found out he said is it possible he is so fond of her as that  there never was such a brother she answered she could not help adding but he is still fonder of me  the doctor pulled his arm over his eyes and sat down again presently he was saying with a long face i came here to denounce the cause of your unhappiness and i begin to see it is myself  of course it is you stupid david she said gleefully she was very kind to the man who had been willing to do so much for her but as the door closed on him she forgot him she even ceased to hear the warning voice he had brought with him from the dead she was rereading the letter that began by calling her wife     chapter xxi  the attempt to carry elspeth by numbers   that was one of grizels beautiful days but there were others to follow as sweet if not so exciting she could travel back through the long length of them without coming once to a moment when she had held her breath in sudden fear and this was so delicious that she sometimes thought these were the best days of all  of course she had little anxieties but they were nearly all about david he was often at aarons house now and what exercised her was thisthat she could not be certain that he was approaching elspeth in the right way the masterful grizel seemed to have come to life again for evidently she was convinced that she alone knew the right way  oh david i would not have said that to her she told him when he reported progress and now she would warn him you are too humble and again you were overbold the doctor to his bewilderment frequently discovered on laying results before her that what he had looked upon as encouraging signs were really bad and that on the other hand he had often left the cottage disconsolately when he ought to have been strutting the issue was that he lost all faith in his own judgment and if grizel said that he was getting on well his face became foolishly triumphant but if she frowned it cried all is over  of the proposal tommy did not know it seemed to her that she had no right to tell even him of that but the rest she did tell him that david by his own confession was in love with elspeth and so pleased was tommy that his delight made another day for her to cherish  so now everything depended on elspeth oh if she only would grizel cried and for her sake tommy tried to look bright but his head shook in spite of him  do you mean that we should discourage david she asked dolefully but he said no to that  i was afraid she confessed that as you are so hopeless you might think it your duty to discourage him so as to save him the pain of a refusal  not at all tommy said with some hastiness  then you do really have a tiny bit of hope  while there is life there is hope he answered  she said i have been thinking it over for it is so important to us and i see various ways in which you could help david if you would  what would i not do grizel you have to name them only  well for instance you might show her that you have a very high opinion of him  agreed but she knows that already  then david is an only child dont you think you could say that men who have never had a sister are peculiarly gentle and considerate to women  oh grizel but i think i can say that  andand that having been so long accustomed to doing everything for themselves they dont need managing wives as men brought up among women need them  yes but how cunning you are grizel who would have believed it  and then she hesitated  go on i see by your manner that this is to be a big one  it would be such a help she said eagerly if you could be just a little less attentive to her i know you do ever so much of the housework because she is not fond of it and if she has a headache you sit with her all day and you beg her to play and sing to you though you really dislike music oh there are scores of things you do for her and if you were to do them a little less willingly in such a way as to show her that they interrupt your work and are a slight trial to you ii am sure that would help  she would see through me grizel elspeth is sharper than you think her  not if you did it very skilfully  then she would believe i had grown cold to her and it would break her heart  one of your failings replied grizel giving him her hand for a moment as recompense for what she was about to say is that you think womens hearts break so easily if at the slightest sign that she notices any change in you you think her heart is breaking and seize her in your arms crying elspeth dear little elspethand that is what your first impulse would be  how well you know me grizel groaned sentimental tommy  if that would be the result she went on better not do it at all but if you were to restrain yourself then she could not but reflect that many of the things you did for her with a sigh david did for pleasure and she would compare him and you  to my disadvantage tommy exclaimed with sad incredulity do you really think she could grizel  give her the chance grizel continued and if you find it hard you must remember that what you are doing is for her good  and for ours tommy cried fervently  every promise he made her at this time he fulfilled and more he was hopeless but all a man could do to make elspeth love david he did  the doctor was quite unaware of it fortunately her brother had a headache yesterday and was lying down he told grizel with calm brutality so i saw her alone for a few minutes  the fibs i have to invent said tommy to the same confidante to get myself out of their way  luckily he does not care for music david said so when she is at the piano he sometimes remains in the kitchen talking to aaron  tommy and aaron left together tommy described those scenes with much good humour i was amazed at first he said to grizel to find aaron determinedly enduring me but now i understand he wants what we want he says not a word about it but he is watching those two courting like a born matchmaker aaron has several reasons for hoping that elspeth will get our friend as he would express it one that this would keep her in thrums another that to be the wife of a doctor is second only in worldly grandeur to marrying the manse and thirdly and lastly because he is convinced that it would be such a staggerer to me for he thinks i have not a notion of what is going on and that if i had i would whisk her away to london  he gave grizel the most graphic solemn pictures of those evenings in the cottage conceive the four of us gathered round the kitchen firethree men and a maid the three men yearning to know what is in the maids mind and each concealing his anxiety from the others elspeth gives the doctor a look which may mean much or nothing and he glares at me as if i were in the way and i glance at aaron and he is on tenterhooks lest i have noticed anything next minute perhaps david gives utterance to a plaintive sigh and aaron and i pounce upon elspeth with our eyes to observe its effect on her and elspeth wonders why aaron is staring and he looks apprehensively at me and i am gazing absentmindedly at the fender  you may smile grizel tommy would say and now that i think of it i can smile myself but we are an eerie quartet at the time when the strain becomes unendurable one of us rises and mends the fire with his foot and then i think the rest of us could say thank you we talk desperately for a little after that but soon again the awful pall creeps down  if i were there cried grizel i would not have the parlour standing empty all this time  we are coming to the parlour tommy replies impressively the parlour grizel now begins to stir elspeth has disappeared from the kitchen we three men know not whither we did not notice her go we dont even observe that she has gonewe are too busy looking at the fire by and by the tremulous tinkling of an aged piano reaches us from an adjoining chamber and aaron looks at me through his fingers and i take a lightning glance at mr david and he uncrosses his legs and rises and sits down again aaron in the most unconcerned way proceeds to cut tobacco and rub it between his fingers and i stretch out my legs and contemplate them with passionate approval while we are thus occupied david has risen and he is so thoroughly at his ease that he has begun to hum he strolls round the kitchen looking with sudden interest at the mantelpiece ornaments he reads for the hundredth time the sampler on the wall next the clock engages his attention it is ticking and that seems to impress him as novel and curious by this time he has reached the door it opens to his touch and in a fit of abstraction he leaves the room  you dont follow him into the parlour asks grizel anxiously  follow whom tommy replies severely i dont even know that he has gone to the parlour now that i think of it i have not even noticed that he has left the kitchen nor has aaron noticed it aaron and i are not in a condition to notice such things we are conscious only that at last we have the opportunity for the quiet social chat we so much enjoy in each others company that at least is aarons way of looking at it and he keeps me there with talk of the most varied and absorbing character one topic down another up when very hard put to it he even questions me about my next book as if he would like to read the proofsheets and when i seem to be listening a little restively for sounds from the parlour the piano has stopped he has the face of one who would bar the door rather than lose my society aaron appreciates me at my true value at last grizel i had begun to despair almost of ever bringing him under my charm  i should be very angry with you grizel said warningly if i thought you teased the poor old man  tease him the consideration i show that poor old man grizel while i know all the time that he is plotting to diddle me you should see me when it is he who is fidgeting to know why the piano has stopped he stretches his head to listen and does something to his ear that sends it another inch nearer the door he chuckles and groans on the sly and ii notice nothing oh he is becoming quite fond of me he thinks me an idiot  why not tell him that you want it as much as he  he would not believe me aaron is firmly convinced that i am too jealous of elspeths affection to give away a thimbleful of it he blames me for preventing her caring much even for him  at any rate said grizel he is on our side and it is because he sees it would be so much the best thing for her  and at the same time such a shock to me that poor old man grizel i have seen him rubbing his hands together with glee and looking quite leery as he thought of what was coming to me  but grizel could not laugh now when tommy saw so well through aaron and david through everyone he came in contact with indeed what hope could there be that he was deceived in elspeth  and yet she knows what takes him there she must know it she cried  a woman tommy said is never sure that a man is in love with her until he proposes she may fancybut it is never safe to fancy as so many have discovered  she has no right declared grizel to wait until she is sure if she does not care for him if she fears that he is falling in love with her she knows how to discourage him there are surely a hundred easy kind ways of doing that  fears he is falling in love with her tommy repeated is any woman ever afraid of that  he really bewildered her no woman would like it grizel answered promptly for them all because she would not have liked it she must see that it would result only in pain to him  still said tommy  oh but how dense you are she said in surprise dont you understand that she would stop him though it were for no better reasons than selfish ones consider her shame if in thinking it over afterwards she saw that she might have stopped him sooner why she cried with a sudden smile it is in your book you say every maiden carries secretly in her heart an idea of love so pure and sacred that if by any act she is once false to that conception her punishment is that she never dares to look at it again and this is one of the acts you mean  i had not thought of it though he said humbly he was never prouder of grizel than at that moment if elspeths outlook he went on is different  it cant be different  if it is the fault is mine yes though i wrote the passage that you interpret so nobly grizel shall i tell you he said gently what i believe is elspeths outlook exactly just now she knows that the doctor is attracted by her and it gives her little thrills of exultation but that it can be loveshe puts that question in such a low voice as if to prevent herself hearing it and yet she listens grizel like one who would like to know elspeth is pitifully distrustful of anyones really loving her and she will never admit to herself that he does until he tells her  and then  tommy had to droop his head  i see you have still no hope she said  it would be so easy to pretend i have he replied with longing in order to cheer you for the moment oh it would even be easy to me to deceive myself but should i do it  no no she said anything but that i can bear anything but that and she shuddered but we seem to be treating david cruelly  i dont think so he assured her men like to have these things to look back to but if you want it grizel i have to say only a word to elspeth to bring it to an end she is as tender as she is innocent andbut it would be a hard task to me he admitted his heart suddenly going out to elspeth he had never deprived her of any gratification before still i am willing to do it  no grizel cried restraining him with her hand i am a coward i suppose but i cant help wanting to hope for a little longer and david wont grudge it to me  it was but a very little longer that they had to wait tommy returning home one day from a walk with his old schoolfriend gav dishart now ma found aaron suspiciously near the parlour keyhole  theres a better fire in the other end aaron said luring him into the kitchen so desirous was he of keeping tommy there fixed down on a stool that ill play you at the dambrod he said briskly  anyone with elspeth  some womenfolk you dinna like replied aaron  tommy rose aaron with a subdued snarl got between him and the door  i was wondering merely tommy said pointing pleasantly to something on the dresser why one of them wore the doctors hat  i forgot hes there too aaron said promptly but he looked at tommy with misgivings they sat down to their game  you begin said tommy youre black and aaron opened with the double corner but so preoccupied was he that it became a variation of the ayrshire lassie without his knowing his suspicions had to find vent in words you dinna speir wha the womenfolk are  no  do you think im just pretending theyre there aaron asked apprehensively  not at all said tommy with much politeness but i thought you might be mistaken he could have blown aaron immediately thereafter but with great consideration forbore the old man was so troubled that he could not lift a king without its falling in two his sleeve got in the way of his fingers at last he sat back in his chair do you ken what is going on man he demanded or do you no ken i can stand this doubt no longer  a less softhearted person might have affected not to understand but that was not tommys way i know aaron he admitted i have known all the time it was said in the kindliest manner but its effect on aaron was not soothing  curse you he cried with extraordinary vehemence you have been playing wi me a the time ay and wi him and wi her  what had aaron been doing with tommy but tommy did not ask that  i am sorry you think so badly of me he said quietly i have known all the time aaron but have i interfered  because you ken she winna take him i see it plain enough now you ken your power over her the honest man that thinks he could take her frae you is to you but a divert  he took a step nearer tommy listen he said when you came back he was on the point o speiring her i saw it in his face as she was playing the piano and she saw it too for her hands began to tremle and the tune wouldna play i daursay you think i was keeking but if i was i stoppit it when the piano stoppit it was a hard thing to me to do and it would hae been an easy thing no to do but i wouldna spy upon elspeth in her great hour  i like you for that aaron tommy said but aaron waved his likes aside  the reason i stood at the door he continued was to keep you out o that room i offered to play you at the dambrod to keep you out ay you ken that without my telling you but do you ken what makes me tell you now its to see whether youll go in and stop him lets see you do that and ill hae some hope yet he waited eagerly  you do puzzle me now tommy said  ay replied the old man bitterly youre dull in the uptak when you like i dinna ken i suppose and you dinna ken that if you had the least dread o her taking him you would be into that room full bend to stop it but youre so sure o her youre so michty sure that you can sit here and lauch instead  am i laughing aaron if you but knew elspeths marriage would be a far more joyful thing to me than it could ever be to you  the old warper laughed unpleasantly at that and ise uphaud he said youre none sure but what shell tak him youre no as sure shell refuse him as that theres a sun in the heavens and im a broken man  for a moment sympathy nigh compelled tommy to say a hopeful thing but he mastered himself it would be weakness was what he did say to pretend that there is any hope  aaron gave him an ugly look and was about to leave the house but tommy would not have it if one of us must go aaron he said with much gentleness let it be me and he went out passing the parlour door softly so that he might not disturb poor david the warper sat on by the fire his head sunk miserably in his shoulders the vehemence had passed out of him you would have hesitated to believe that such a listless shrunken man could have been vehement that same year it is a hardy proof of his faith in tommy that he did not even think it worth while to look up when by and by the parlour door opened and the doctor came in for his hat elspeth was with him  illustration they told aaron something  they told aaron something  it lifted him off his feet and bore him out at the door when he made up on himself he knew he was searching everywhere for tommy a terror seized him lest he should not be the first to convey the news  had he been left a fortune neighbours asked amazed at this unwonted sight and he replied as he ran i have and i want to share it wi him  it was his only joke people came to their doors to see aaron latta laughing     chapter xxii  grizels glorious hour   elspeth was to be his wife david had carried the wondrous promise straight to grizel and now he was gone and she was alone again  oh foolish grizel are you crying and i thought it was so hard to you to cry  me crying oh no  put your hand to your cheeks grizel are they not wet  they are wet and i did not know it it is hard to me to cry in sorrow but i can cry for joy i am crying because it has all come right and i was so much afraid that it never would  ah grizel i think you said you wanted nothing else so long as you had his love  but god has let it all come right just the same and i am thanking him that is why i did not know that i was crying  she was by the fireplace on the stool that had always been her favourite seat and of course she sat very straight when grizel walked or stood her strong round figure took a hundred beautiful poses but when she sat it had but one the old doctor in experimenting moods had sometimes compelled her to recline and then watched to see her body spring erect the moment he released his hold what a dreadful patient i should make she said contritely i would chloroform you miss said he  she sat thus for a long time she had so much for which to thank god though not with her lips for how could they keep pace with her heart her heart was very full chiefly i think with the tears that rolled down unknown to her  she thanked god in the name of the little hunted girl who had not been taught how to pray and so did it standing i do so want to be good oh how sweet it would be to be good she had said in that long ago she had said it out loud when she was alone on the chance of his hearing but she had not addressed him by name because she was not sure that he was really called god she had not even known that you should end by saying amen which tommy afterwards told her is the most solemn part of it  how sweet it would be to be good but how much sweeter it is to be good the woman that girl had grown into knew that she was good and she thanked god for that she thanked him for letting her help if he had said that she had not helped she would have rocked her arms and replied almost hotly you know i have and he did know he had seen her many times in the grip of inherited passions and watched her fighting with them and subduing them he had seen ugly thoughts stealing upon her as they crawl towards every child of man ah he had seen them leap into the heart of the painted ladys daughter as if a nest already made for them must be there and still she had driven them away grizel had helped the tears came more quickly now  she thanked god that she had never worn the ring but why had she never worn it when she wanted so much to do so and it was hers why had she watched herself more carefully than ever of late and forced happiness to her face when it was not in her heart and denied herself at fierce moments the luxuries of grief and despair and even of rebellion for she had carried about with her the capacity to rebel but she had hidden it and the reason was that she thought god was testing her if she fell he would not give her the thing she coveted unworthy reason for being good as she knew but god overlooked it and she thanked him for that  her hands pressed each other impulsively as if at the shock of a sudden beautiful thought and then perhaps she was thanking god for making her the one woman who could be the right wife for tommy she was so certain that no other woman could help him as she could none knew his virtues as she knew them had it not been for her his showy parts only would have been loved the dear quiet ones would never have heard how dear they were the showy ones were open to all the world but the quiet ones were her private garden his faults as well as his virtues passed before her and it is strange to know that it was about this time that grizel ceased to cry and began to smile instead i know why she smiled it was because sentimentality was one of the little monsters that came skipping into her view and tommy was so confident that he had got rid at last of it grizel knew better but she could look at it and smile perhaps she was not sorry that it was still there with the others it had so long led the procession i daresay she saw herself taking the leering distorted thing in hand and making something gallant of it she thought that she was too practical too much given to seeing but one side to a question too lacking in consideration for others too impatient too relentlessly just and she humbly thanked god for all these faults because tommys excesses were in the opposite direction and she could thus restore the balance she was full of humility while she saw how useful she could be to him but her face did not show this she had forgotten her face and elation had spread over it without her knowing perhaps god accepted the elation as part of the thanks  she thanked god for giving tommy what he wanted so muchherself ah she had thanked him for that before but she did it again and then she went on her knees by her dear doctors chair and prayed that she might be a good wife to tommy  when she rose the blood was not surging through her veins instead of a passion of joy it was a beautiful calm that possessed her and on noticing this she regarded herself with sudden suspicion as we put our ear to a watch to see if it has stopped she found that she was still going but no longer either fast or slow and she saw what had happened her old serene self had come back to her i think she thanked god for that most of all  and then she caught sight of her faceoh oh her first practical act as an engaged woman was to wash her face  engaged but was she grizel laughed it is not usually a laughing matter but she could not help that consider her predicament she could be engaged at once if she liked even before she wiped the water from her face or she might postpone it to let tommy share the careful reader will have noticed that this problem presented itself to her at an awkward moment she laughed in short while her face was still in the basin with the very proper result that she had to grope for the towel with her eyes shut  it was still a cold damp face grizel was always in such a hurry when she opened her most precious drawer and took from it a certain glove which was wrapped in silk paper but was not perhaps quite so conceited as it had been for alas and alack it was now used as a wrapper itself the ring was inside it if grizel wanted to be engaged absolutely and at once all she had to do was to slip that ring upon her finger  it had been hers for a week or more tommy had bought it in a certain scottish town whose merchant princes are so many and have risen splendidly from such small beginnings that after you have been there a short time you beg to be introduced to someone who has not got on when you look at them they slap their trouser pockets when they look at you they are wondering if you know how much they are worth tommy one day roaming their streets in which he was worth incredibly little and thinking sadly of what could never be saw the modest little garnet ring in a jewellers window and attached to it was a pathetic story no other person could have seen the story but it was as plain to him as though it had been beautifully written on the tag of paper which really contained the price with his hand on the door he paused overcome by that horror of entering shops without a lady to do the talking which all men of genius feel it is the one sure test hurried away came back went to and fro shyly until he saw that he was yielding once more to the indecision he thought he had so completely mastered whereupon he entered bravely though it was one of those detestable doors that ring a bell as they open and sternly ordered the jeweller who could have bought and sold our tommy with one slap on the trouser leg to hand the ring over to him  he had no intention of giving it to grizel that indeed was part of its great tragedy for this is the story tommy read into the ring there was once a sorrowful man of twentythree and forty and sixty ah how gray the beard has grown as we speak how thin the locks but still we know him for the same by that garnet ring since it became his no other eye has seen it and yet it is her engagement ring never can he give it to her but must always carry it about with him as the piteous memory of what had never been how innocent it looked in his hand and with an innocence that never wore off not even when he had reached his threescore years as it aged it took on another kind of innocence only it looked pitiable now for there is but a dishonoured age for a lonely little ring which can never see the finger it was made to span  a hairshirt such it was to him and he put it on willingly knowing it could be nothing else every smart it gave him pleased even while it pained if ever his mind roamed again to the world of makebelieve that ring would jerk him back to facts  grizel remembered well her finding of it she had been in his pockets she loved to rifle them to pull out his watch herself instead of asking him for the time to exclaim oh at the many things she found there when they should have been neatly docketed or in the fire and from his waistcoat pocket she drew the ring she seemed to understand all about it at once she was far ahead while he was explaining it seemed quite strange to her that there had ever been a time when she did not know of her garnet ring  how her arms rocked it was delicious to her to remember now with what agony her arms had rocked she kissed it she had not been the first to kiss it  it was oh how i wish i could have saved you this pain  but i love it she cried and i love the pain  it was am i not to see it on your finger once  no no we must not  let me grizel  is it right oh is it right  only this once  very well  i dare not grizel i cant what are we to do with it now  give it to me it is mine i will keep it beside my glove  let me keep it grizel  no it is mine  shall i fling it away  how can you be so cruel it is mine  let me bury it  it is mine  and of course she had got her way could he resist her in anything they had never spoken of it since it was such a sad little ring sad it was not in the least little bit sad grizel wondered as she looked at it now how she could ever have thought it sad  the object with which she put on her hat was to go to aarons cottage to congratulate elspeth so she said to herself oh grizel  but first she opened two drawers they were in a great press and full of beautiful linen woven in thrums that had come to dr mcqueen as a bad debt your marriage portion young lady he had said to grizel then but a slip of a girl whereupon without waiting to lengthen her frock she rushed rapturously at her workbasket not at all miss he cried ferociously you are here to look after this house not to be preparing for another and until you are respectably bespoken by some rash crittur of a man into the drawers with your linen and down with those murderous shears and she had obeyed no scissors the most relentless things in nature when in grizels hand had ever cleaved their way through that snowy expanse never a stitch had she put into her linen except with her eyes which became horribly like needles as she looked at it  and now at last she could begin oh but she was anxious to begin it is almost a fact that as she looked at those drawers she grudged the time that must be given today to tommy and his ring  do you see her now ready to start she was wearing her brown jacket with the fur collar over which she used to look so searchingly at tommy to think there was a time when that serene face had to look searchingly at him it nearly made her sad again she paused to bring out the ring and take another exultant look at it it was attached now to a ribbon round her neck sweet ring she put it to her eyes that was her way of letting her eyes kiss it then she rubbed them and it in case the one had left a tear upon the other  and then she went out joy surging in her heart for this was grizels glorious hour the end of it     chapter xxiii  tommy loses grizel   it was not aarons good fortune to find tommy he should have looked for him in the den  in that haunt of happier lovers than he tommy walked slowly pondering he scarce noticed that he had the den to himself or that since he was last here autumn had slipped away leaving all her garments on the ground by this time undoubtedly elspeth had said her gentle no but he was not railing against fate not even for striking the final blow at him through that innocent medium he had still too much to do for thatto help others there were three of them at present and by some sort of sympathetic jugglery he had an arm for each  lean on me grizeldear sister elspeth you little know the harm you have donedavid old friend your hand  thus loaded he bravely returned at the fitting time to the cottage his head was not even bent  had you asked tommy what elspeth would probably do when she dismissed david he might have replied that she would go up to his room and lock herself into it so that no one should disturb her for a time and this he discovered on returning home was actually what had happened how well he knew her how distinctly he heard every beat of her tender heart and how easy to him to tell why it was beating he did not go up he waited for little elspeth to come to him all in her own good time and when she came looking just as he knew she would look he had a brave bright face for her  she was shaking after her excitement or perhaps she had ceased to shake and begun again as she came down to him he pretended not to notice it he would notice it the moment he was sure she wanted him to but perhaps that would not be until she was in bed and he had come to say goodnight and put out her light for as we know she often kept her great confidences till then when she discovered that he already knew them  the doctor has been in  she began almost at once and in a quaking voice and from a distance as if in hope that the bullet might be spent before it reached her brother  i am sorry i missed him he replied cautiously what a fine fellow he is  you always liked him said elspeth clinging eagerly to that  no one could help liking him elspeth he has such winning ways said tommy perhaps a little in the voice with which at funerals we refer to the departed she loved his words but she knew she had a surprise for him this time and she tried to blurt it out  he said something to me heoh what a high opinion he has of you she really thought he had  was that the something tommy asked with a smile that helped her as it was meant to do  you understand dont you she said almost in a whisper  of course i do elspeth he answered reassuringly but somehow she still thought he didnt  no one could have been more manly and gentle and humble she said beseechingly  i am sure of it said tommy  he thinks nothing of himself she said  we shall always think a great deal of him replied tommy  yes but elspeth found the strangest difficulty in continuing for though it would have surprised him to be told so tommy was not helping her nearly as much as he imagined  i told him she said shaking that no one could be to me what you were i told him and then timid elspeth altogether broke down tommy drew her to him as he had so often done since she was the smallest child and pressed her head against his breast and waited so often he had waited thus upon elspeth  there is nothing to cry about dear he said tenderly when the time to speak came you have instead the right to be proud that so good a man loves you i am very proud of it elspeth  if i could be sure of that she gasped  dont you believe me dear  yes butthat is not what makes me cry tommy dont you see  yes he assured her i see you are crying because you feel so sorry for him but i dont feel sorry for him elspeth if i know anything at all it is this that no man needs pity who sincerely loves whether that love be returned or not he walks in a new and more beautiful world for evermore  she clutched his hand i dont understand how you know those things she whispered  please god was tommys reflection she should never know he saw most vividly the pathos of his case but he did not break down under it it helped him rather to proceed  it will be the test of gemmell he said how he bears this no man i am very sure was ever told that his dream could not come true more kindly and tenderly than you told it to him he was in the middle of the next sentence a fine one before her distress stopped him  tommy she cried you dont understand that is not what i told him at all  it was one of the few occasions on which the expression on the face of t sandys perceptibly changed  what did you tell him he asked almost sharply  i accepted him she said guiltily backing away from this alarming face  what  if you only knew how manly and gentle and humble he was she cried quickly as if something dire might happen if tommy were not assured of this at once  yousaid you would marry him elspeth  yes  and leave me  oh oh she flung her arms around his neck  yes but that is what you are prepared to do said he and he held her away from him and stared at her as if he had never seen elspeth before were you not afraid he exclaimed in amazement  i am not the least bit afraid she answered oh tommy if you knew how manly and then she remembered that she had said that already  you did not even say that you wouldconsult me  oh oh  why didnt you elspeth  ii forgot she moaned tommy you are angry she hugged him and he let her do it but all the time he was looking over her head fixedly with his mouth open  and i was always so sure of you were the words that came to him at last with a hard little laugh at the end of them  can you think it makes me love you less she sobbed because i love him too oh tommy i thought you would be so glad  he kissed her he put his hand fondly upon her head  i am glad he said with emotion when that which you want has come to you elspeth how can i but be glad but it takes me aback and if for a moment i felt forlorn if when i should have been rejoicing only in your happiness the selfish thought passed through my mind what is to become of me i hopei hope then he sat down and buried his face in the table  and he might have been telling her about grizel has the shock stunned you tommy elspeth thinks it has been a shock of pain may we lift your head to show her your joyous face  i am so proud she was saying that at last after you have done so much for me i can do a little thing for you for it is something to free you tommy you have always pretended for my sake that we could not do without each other but we both knew all the time that it was only i who was unable to do without you you cant deny it  he might deny it but it was true ah tommy you bore with her with infinite patience but did it never strike you that she kept you to the earth if elspeth could be happy without you you were sure she could not but if she couldhad that thought never made you flap your wings  i often had a pain at my heart she told him which i kept from you it was a feeling that your solicitude for me perhaps prevented your caring for any other woman it seemed terrible and unnatural that i should be a bar to that i felt that i was starving you and not you only but an unknown woman as well  so long as i had you elspeth he said reproachfully was not that enough  it seemed to be enough she answered gravely but even while i comforted myself with that i knew that it should not be enough and still i feared that if it was the blame was mine now i am no longer in the way and i hope so ardently that you will fall in love like other people if you never do i shall always have the fear that i am the cause that you lost the capacity in the days when i let you devote yourself too much to me  oh blind elspeth now is the time to tell her tommy and fill her cup of happiness to the brim  but it is she who is speaking still almost gaily now yet with a full heart what a time you have had with me tommy i told david all about it and what he has to look forward to but he says he is not afraid and when you find someone you can love she continued sweetly though she had a sigh to stifle i hope she will be someone quite unlike me for oh my dear good brother i know you need a change  not a word said tommy  she said timidly that she had begun to hope of late that grizel might be the woman and still he did not speak he drew elspeth closer to him that she might not see his face and the horror of himself that surely sat on it to the very marrow of him he was in such cold misery that i wonder his arms did not chill her  this poor devil of a sentimental tommy he had wakened up in the world of facts where he thought he had been dwelling of late to discover that he had not been here for weeks except at mealtimes during those weeks he had most honestly thought that he was in a passion to be married what do you say to pitying instead of cursing him it is a sudden idea of mine and we must be quick for joyous grizel is drawing near and this you know is the chapter in which her heart breaks                                       it was elspeth who opened the door to grizel does she know said elspeth to herself before either of them spoke  does she know it was what grizel was saying also  oh elspeth i am so glad david has told me  she does know elspeth told herself and she thought it was kind of grizel to come so quickly she said so  she doesnt know thought grizel and then these two kissed for the first time it was a kiss of thanks from each  but why does she not know grizel wondered a little as they entered the parlour where tommy was he had been standing with his teeth knit since he heard the knock as if in answer to the question elspeth said i have just broken it to tommy he has been in a few minutes only and he is so surprised he can scarcely speak  grizel laughed happily for that explained it tommy had not had time to tell her yet she laughed again at elspeth who had thought she had so much to tell and did not know half the story  elspeth begged tommy to listen to the beautiful things grizel was saying about david but truth to tell grizel scarcely heard them herself she had given tommy a shy rapturous glance she was wondering when he would begin what a delicious opening when he shook hands suppose he had kissed her instead or suppose he casually addressed her as darling he might do it at any moment now just for once she would not mind though he did it in public perhaps as soon as this new remark of elspeths was finished he meant to say you are not the only engaged person in the room miss elspeth i think i see another two grizel laughed as if she had heard him say it and then she ceased laughing suddenly for some little duty had called elspeth into the other room and as she went out she stopped the movement of the earth  these two were alone with their great joy  elspeth had said that she would be back in two minutes was grizel wasting a moment when she looked only at him her eyes filmy with love the crooked smile upon her face so happy that it could not stand still her arms made a slight gesture towards him her hands were open she was giving herself to him she could not see for a fraction of time the space between them seemed to be annihilated his arms were closing round her then she knew that neither of them had moved  grizel  he tried to be true to her by deceiving her it was the only way at last grizel he cried at last and he put joyousness into his voice it has all come right dear one he cried like an ecstatic lover never in his life had he tried so hard to deceive at the sacrifice of himself but he was fighting something as strong as the instinct of selfpreservation and his usually expressionless face gave the lie to his joyous words loud above his voice his ashen face was speaking to her and she cried in terror what is wrong even then he attempted to deceive her but suddenly she knew the truth  you dont want to be married  i think the room swam round with her when it was steady again you did not say that did you she asked she was sure he had not said it she was smiling again tremulously to show him that he had not said it  i want to be married above all else on earth he said imploringly but his face betrayed him still and she demanded the truth and he was forced to tell it  a little shiver passed through her that was all  do you mean that you dont love me she said you must tell me what you mean  that is how others would put it i suppose he replied i believe they would be wrong i think i love you in my own way but i thought i loved you in their way and it is the only way that counts in this world of theirs it does not seem to be my world i was given wings i think but i am never to know that i have left the earth until i come flop upon it with an arrow through them i crawl and wriggle here and yethe laughed harshlyi believe i am rather a fine fellow when i am flying  she nodded you mean you want me to let you off she asked you must tell me what you mean and as he did not answer instantly because i think i have some little claim upon you she said with a pleasant smile  i am as pitiful a puzzle to myself as i can be to you he replied all i know is that i dont want to marry anyone and yet i am sure i could die for you grizel  it was quite true a burning house and grizel among the flames and he would have been the first on the ladder but there is no such luck for you tommy  you are free was what she said dont look so tragic she added again with the pleasant smile it must be very distressing to you butyou will soon fly again her lips twitched tremulously i cant fly she said  she took the ring from her neck she took it off its ribbon  i brought it she said to let you put it on my finger i thought you would want to do that she said  grizel he cried can we not be as we have been  no she answered  it would all come right grizel i am sure it would i dont know why i am as i am but i shall try to change myself you have borne with me since we were children wont you bear with me for a little longer  she shook her head but did not trust herself to speak  i have lost you he said and she nodded  then i am lost indeed said he and he knew it too but with a gesture of the hand she begged him not to say that  without your love to help me he began  you shall always have that she told him with shining eyes always always and what could he do but look at her with the wonder and the awe that come to every man who for one moment in his life knows a woman well  you can love me still grizel his voice was shaky  just the same she answered and i suppose he looked uplifted but you should be sorry she said gravely and it was then that elspeth came back she had not much exceeded her two minutes  it was always terrible to tommy not to have the feelings of a hero at that moment he could not endure it in a splendid burst of selfsacrifice he suddenly startled both grizel and himself by crying elspeth i love grizel and i have just asked her to be my wife  yes the nobility of it amazed himself but bewitched him too and he turned gloriously to grizel never doubting but that she would have him still  he need not have spoken so impulsively nor looked so grand she swayed for an instant and then was erect again you must forgive me elspeth she said but i have refused him and that was the biggest surprise tommy ever got in his life  you dont care for him elspeth blurted out  not in the way he cares for me grizel replied quietly and when elspeth would have said more she begged her to desist the only thing for me to do now elspeth she said smiling is to run away but i want you first to accept a little weddinggift from me i wish you and david so much happiness you wont refuse it will you  elspeth still astounded took the gift it was a little garnet ring  it will have to be cut grizel said it was meant i think for a larger finger i have had it some time but i never wore it  elspeth said she would always treasure her ring and that it was beautiful  i used to think itrather sweet grizel admitted and then she said goodbye to them both and went away     chapter xxiv  the monster   tommys new character was that of a monster he always liked the big parts  concealed as usual in the garments that clung so oddly to him modesty generosity indifference to applause and all the nobler impulses he could not strip himself of them try as he would and so he found to his scornful amusement that he still escaped the public fury in the two months that preceded elspeths marriage there was positively scarce a soul in thrums who did not think rather well of him if they knew what i really am he cried with splendid bitterness how they would run from me  even david could no longer withhold the hand of fellowship for grizel would tell him nothing except that after all and for reasons sufficient to herself she had declined to become mrs sandys he sought in vain to discover how tommy could be to blame and now tommy said grimly to grizel our doctor thinks you have used me badly and that i am a fine fellow to bear no resentment elspeth told me that he admires the gentle and manly dignity with which i submit to the blow and i have no doubt that as soon as i heard that i made it more gentle and manly than ever  i have forbidden elspeth he told her to upbraid you for not accepting me with the result that she thinks me too good to live ha ha what do you think grizel  it became known in the town that she had refused him everybody was on tommys side they said she had treated him badly even aaron was staggered at the sight of tommy accepting his double defeat in such good part and all the time i am the greatest cur unhung says tommy why dont you laugh grizel  never they said had there been such a generous brother the town was astir about this poor mans gifts to the lucky bride there were rumours that among the articles was a silver coalscuttle but it proved to be a sugarbowl in that pattern three bandboxes came for her to select from somebody discovered who was on the watch but may i be struck dead if more than one went back yesterday it was bonnets today she is at tilliedrum again trying on her goingaway dress and she really was to go away in it a noticeable thing for in thrums society though they usually get a goingaway dress they are too canny to go away in it the local shops were not ignored but the best of the trousseau came from london that makes the second box this week as im a living sinner cries the lady on the watch again when boxes arrived at the station corp wheeled them up to elspeth without so much as looking at the label  ah what a brother they said it openly to their own brothers and to tommy in the way they looked at him  there has been nothing like it he assured grizel since red ridinghood and the wolf why cant i fling off my disguise and cry the better to eat you with  he always spoke to her now in this vein of magnificent bitterness but grizel seldom rewarded him by crying oh oh she might however give him a patient reproachful glance instead and it had the irritating effect of making him feel that perhaps he was under lifesize instead of over it  i daresay you are right says tommy savagely  i said nothing  you dont need to say it what a grand capacity you have for knocking me off my horse grizel  are you angry with me for that  no it is delicious to pick ones self out of the mud especially when you find it is a baby you are picking up instead of a brute am i a baby only grizel  i think it is childish of you she replied to say you are a brute  there is not to be even that satisfaction left to me you are hard on me grizel  i am trying to help you how can you be angry with me  the instinct of selfpreservation i suppose i see myself dwindling so rapidly under your treatment that soon there will be nothing of me left  it was said cruelly for he knew that the one thing grizel could not bear now was the implication that she saw his faults only she always went down under that blow with pitiful surrender showing the woman suddenly as if under a physical knouting  he apologized contritely but after all it proves my case he said for i could not hurt you in this way grizel if i were not a pretty wellgrown specimen of a monster  dont she said but she did not seek to help him by drawing him away to other subjects which would have been his way what is there monstrous she asked in your being so good to elspeth it is very kind of you to give her all these things  especially when by rights they are yours grizel  no not when you did not want to give them to me  he dared say nothing to that there were some matters on which he must not contradict grizel now  it is nice of you she said not to complain though elspeth is deserting you it must have been a blow  you and i only know why he answered but for her grizel i might be whining sentiment to you at this moment  that she said would be the monstrous thing  and it is not monstrous i suppose that i should let gemmell press my hand under the conviction that after all i am a trump  you dont pose as one  that makes them think the more highly of me nothing monstrous grizel in my standing quietly by while you are showing elspeth how to furnish her housei who know why you have the subject at your fingertips  for grizel had given all her sweet ideas to elspeth heighho how she had guarded them once confiding them half reluctantly even to tommy half reluctantly that is at the start because they were her very own but once she was embarked on the subject talking with such rapture that every minute or two he had to beg her to be calm she was the first person in that part of the world to think that old furniture need not be kept in the dark corners and she knew where there was an oak bedstead that was looked upon as a disgrace and where to obtain the dearest cupboards one of them in use as the retiringchamber of a rabbithutch and stately clocks made in the town a hundred years ago and quaint oldfarrant lamps and cogeys and sandglasses that apologized if you looked at them and yet were as willing to be loved again as any old lady in a mutch you will not buy them easily now the people will not chuckle at you when you bid for them now we have become so cute in thrums that when the fender breaks we think it may have increased in value and we preserve any old board lest the worms have made it artistic grizel however was in advance of her time she could lay her hands on all she wanted and she did but it was for elspeths house  and the tablecloths and the towels and the sheets said tommy nothing monstrous in my letting you give elspeth them  the linen you see was no longer in grizels press  i could not help making them she answered they were so longing to be made i did not mean to give them to her i think i meant to put them back in the press but when they were made it was natural that they should want to have something to do so i gave them to elspeth  with how many tears on them  not many but with some kisses  all which says tommy goes to prove that i have nothing with which to reproach myself  no i never said that she told him you have to reproach yourself with wanting me to love you  she paused a moment to let him say if he dared that he had not done that when she would have replied instantly you know you did he could have disabused her but it would have been cruel and so on this subject as ever he remained silent  but that is not what i have been trying to prove she continued you know as well as i that the cause of this unhappiness has beenwhat you call your wings  he was about to thank her for her delicacy in avoiding its real name when she added i mean your sentiment and he laughed instead  i flatter myself that i no longer fly at all events he said i know what i am at last grizel  it is flattery only she replied with her old directness this thing you are regarding with a morbid satisfaction is not you at all  he groaned which of them all is me grizel he asked gloomily  we shall see she said when we have got the wings off  they will have to come off a feather at a time  that she declared is what i have been trying to prove  it will be a weary task grizel  i wont weary at it she said smiling  her cheerfulness was a continual surprise to him you bear up wonderfully well yourself he sometimes said to her almost reproachfully and she never replied that perhaps that was one of her ways of trying to help him  she is not so heartbroken after all you may be saying and i had promised to break her heart but honestly i dont know how to do it more thoroughly and you must remember that we have not seen her alone yet  she tried to be very little alone she helped david in his work more than ever not a person for instance managed to escape the bath because grizels heart was broken you could never say that she was alone when her needle was going and the linen became sheets and the like in what was probably record time yet they could have been sewn more quickly for at times the needle stopped and she did not know it once a bedridden old woman with whom she had been sitting up lay watching her instead of sleeping and finally said what makes you sit staring at a cauld fire and speaking to yourself and there was a strange day when she had been too long in the den when she started for home she went in the direction of double dykes her old home instead  she could bear everything except doubt she had told him so when he wondered at her calmness she often said it to herself she could tread any path however drearily it stretched before her so long as she knew whither it led but there could be no more doubt oh he must never again disturb her mind with hope how clearly she showed him that and yet they had perhaps no more than parted when it seemed impossible to bear for the next hour the desolation she was sentenced to for life she lay quivering and tossing on the hearthrug of the parlour beating it with her fists rocking her arms and calling to him to give her doubt again that she might get through the days  let me doubt again here was grizel starting to beg it of him more than once she got halfway to aarons house before she could turn but she always did turn with the words unspoken never did tommy hear her say them but always that she was tranquil now was it pride that supported her in the trying hour oh no it was not pride that is an old garment which once became grizel well but she does not wear it now she takes it out of the closet perhaps at times to look at it what gave her strength when he was by was her promise to help him it was not by asking for leave to dream herself that she could make him dream the less all done for you tommy it might have helped you to loosen a few of the feathers  sometimes she thought it might not be tommy but herself who was so unlike other people that it was not he who was unable to love but she who could not be loved this idea did not agitate her as a terrible thing she could almost welcome it but she did not go to him with it while it might be but a fancy that was no way to help a man who was overfull of them it was the bare truth only that she wanted him to see and so she made elaborate inquiries into herself to discover whether she was quite unlovable i suppose it would have been quaint had she not been quite so much in earnest she examined herself in the long mirror most conscientiously and with a determinedly open mind to see whether she was too ugly for any man to love our beautiful grizel really did  she had always thought that she was a nice girl but was she no one had ever loved her except the old doctor and he began when she was so young that perhaps he had been inveigled into it like a father even david had not loved her was it because he knew her so well what was it in women that made men love them she asked it of david in such a way that he never knew she was putting him to the question he merely thought that he and she were having a pleasant chat about elspeth and as a result she decided that he loved elspeth because she was so helpless his head sat with uncommon pride on his shoulders while he talked of elspeths timidity there was a ring of boastfulness in his voice as he paraded the large number of useful things that elspeth could not do and yet david was a sensible and careful man  was it helplessness that man loved in woman then it seemed to be elspeths helplessness that had made tommy such a brother and how it had always appealed to aaron no woman could be less helpless than herself grizel knew she thought back and back and she could not come to a time when she was not managing somebody women she reflected fall more or less deeply in love with every baby they see while men even the best of them can look calmly at other peoples babies but when the helplessness of the child is in the woman then other women are unmoved but the great heart of man is stirredwoman is his baby she remembered that the language of love is in two sexesfor the woman superlatives for the man diminutives the more she loves the bigger he grows but in an ecstasy he could put her in his pocket had not tommy taught her this his little one his child perhaps he really had loved her in the days when they both made believe that she was infantile but soon she had shown with fatal clearness that she was not instead of needing to be taken care of she had obviously wanted to take care of him their positions were reversed perhaps said grizel to herself i should have been a man  if this was the true explanation then though tommy who had tried so hard could not love her he might be able to lovewhat is the phrasea more womanly woman or more popular phrase still a very woman some other woman might be the right wife for him she did not shrink from considering this theory and she considered so long that i for one cannot smile at her for deciding ultimately as she did that there was nothing in it  the strong like to be leaned upon and the weak to lean and this irrespective of sex this was the solution she woke up with one morning and it seemed to explain not only davids and elspeths love but her own so clearly that in her desire to help she put it before tommy it implied that she cared for him because he was weak and he drew a very long face  you dont know how the feathers hurt as they come out he explained  but so long as we do get them out she said  every other person who knows me thinks that strength is my great characteristic he maintained rather querulously  but when you know it is not said grizel you do know dont you she asked anxiously to know the truth about ones self that is the beginning of being strong  you seem determined he retorted to prevent my loving you  why she asked  you are to make me strong in spite of myself i understand but according to your theory the strong love the weak only are you to grow weak grizel as i grow strong  she had not thought of that and she would have liked to rock her arms but she was able to reply i am not trying to help you in order to make you love me you know quite well that all that is over and done with i am trying only to help you to be what a man should be  she could say that to him but to herself was she prepared to make a man of him at the cost of his possible love this faced her when she was alone with her passionate nature and she fought it and with her fists clenched she cried yes yes yes  do we know all that grizel had to fight there were times when tommys mind wandered to excuses for himself he knew what men were and he shuddered to think of the might have been had a girl who could love as grizel did loved such a man as her father he thanked his maker did tommy that he who was made as those other men had avoided raising passions in her i wonder how he was so sure do we know all that grizel had to fight                                       they spoke much during those days of the coming parting and she always said that she could bear it if she saw him go away more of a man than he had come  then anything i have suffered or may suffer she told him will have been done to help you and perhaps in time that will make me proud of my poor little lovestory it would be rather pitiful would it not if i have gone through so much for no end at all  she spoke he said almost reproachfully as if she thought he might go away on his wings after all  we cant be sure she murmured she was so eager to make him watchful  yes he said humbly but firmly i may be a scoundrel grizel i am a scoundrel but one thing you may be sure of i am done with sentiment but even as he said it even as he felt that he could tear himself asunder for being untrue to grizel a bird was singing at his heart because he was free again free to go out into the world and play as if it were but a larger den ah if only tommy could always have remained a boy  elspeths marriage day came round and i should like to linger in it and show you elspeth in her weddinggown and tommy standing behind to catch her if she fainted and ailie weeping and aaron latta rubbing his gleeful hands and a smiling bridesmaid who had once thought she might be a bride but that was a day in elspeths story not in tommys and grizels only one incident in their story crept into that happy day there were speeches at the feast and the rev mr dishart referred to tommy in the kindliest way called him my young friend quoted inaccurately from his book and expressed an opinion formed he might say when mr sandys was a lad at school cheers that he had a career before him tommy bore it well all except the quotation which he was burning to correct but sighed to find that it had set the dominies on his left talking about precocity to produce such a graybeard of a book at two and twenty mr sandys said cathro is amazing it partakes sir of the nature of the miraculous its onchancey by which we mean a deviation from the normal and so on to escape this kind of flattery he had so often heard it said by ladies who could say it so much better tommy turned to his neighbours on the right  oddly enough they also were discussing deviations from the normal on the table was a plant in full flower and ailie who had lent it was expressing surprise that it should bloom so late in the season  so early in its life i should rather say the doctor remarked after examining it it is a young plant and in the ordinary course would not have come to flower before next year but it is afraid that it will never see next year it is one of those poor little plants that bloom prematurely because they are diseased  tommy was a little startled he had often marvelled over his own precocity but never guessed that this might be the explanation why he was in flower at twentytwo is that a scientific fact he asked  it is a law of nature the doctor replied gravely and if anything more was said on the subject our tommy did not hear it what did he hear he was a child again in miserable lodgings and it was sometime in the long middle of the night and what he heard from his bed was his mother coughing away her life in hers there was an angry knock knock knock from somewhere near and he crept out of bed to tell his mother that the people through the wall were complaining because she would not die more quietly but when he reached her bed it was not his mother he saw lying there but himself aged twentyfour or thereabouts for tommy had inherited his mothers cough he had known it every winter but he remembered it as if for the first time now  did he hear anything else i think he heard his wings slipping to the floor  he asked ailie to give him the plant and he kept it in his room very lovingly though he forgot to water it he sat for long periods looking at it and his thoughts were very deep but all he actually said aloud was there are two of us aaron sometimes saw them together and thought they were an odd pair and perhaps they were  tommy did not tell grizel of the tragedy that was hanging over him he was determined to save her that pain he knew that most men in his position would have told her and was glad to find that he could keep it so gallantly to himself she was brave perhaps some day she would discover that he had been brave also when she talked of wings now what he seemed to see was a green grave his eyes were moist but he held his head high all this helped him  ah well but the world must jog along though you and i be damned elspeth was happily married and there came the day when tommy and grizel must say goodbye he was returning to london his luggage was already in corps barrow all but the insignificant part of it which yet made a bulky package in its authors pocket for it was his new manuscript for which he would have fought a regiment yes and beaten them little cared tommy what became of the rest of his luggage so long as that palpitating package was safe  and little you care grizel said in a moment of sudden bitterness whom you leave behind so long as you take it with you  he forgave her with a sad smile she did not know you see that this manuscript might be his last  and it was the only bitter thing she said even when he looked very sorry for her she took advantage of his emotion to help him only dont be too sorry for me she said calmly remember rather that there is one episode in a womans life to which she must always cling in memory whether it was a pride to her or a shame and that it rests with you to make mine proud or shameful  in other words he was to get rid of his wings how she harped on that  he wanted to kiss her on the brow but she would not have it he was about to do it not to gratify any selfish desire but of a beautiful impulse that if anything happened she would have this to remember as the last of him but she drew back almost angrily positively she was putting it down to sentiment and he forgave her even that  but she kissed the manuscript wish it luck he had begged of her you were always so fond of babies and this is my baby so grizel kissed tommys baby and then she turned away her face     chapter xxv  mr t sandys has returned to town   it is disquieting to reflect that we have devoted so much paper this is the third shillings worth to telling what a real biographer would almost certainly have summed up in a few pages caring nothing for glory engrossed in his work alone mr sandys soon after the publication of the letters sought the peace of his mothers native village and there alike undisturbing and undisturbed he gave his life as ever to laborious days and quiet contemplation the one vital fact in these six months of lofty endeavour is that he was making progress with the new book fishing and other distractions were occasionally indulged in but merely that he might rise fresher next morning to a book which absorbed etc  one can see exactly how it should be done it has been done so often before and there is a deal to be said for this method his book was what he had been at during nearly the whole of that time comparatively speaking the fishing and other distractions a neat phrase had got an occasional hour only but while we admire we cant do it in that way we seem fated to go on taking it for granted that you know the vital facts about tommy and devoting our attention to the things that the real biographer leaves out  tommy arrived in london with little more than ten pounds in his pockets all the rest he had spent on elspeth  he looked for furnished chambers in a fashionable quarter and they were much too expensive but the young lady who showed them to him asked if it was the mr sandys and he at once took the rooms her mother subsequently said that she understood he wrote books and would he deposit five pounds  such are the ups and downs of the literary calling  the book of course was unrequited love and the true story of how it was not given to the world by his first publishers has never been told they had the chance but they weighed the manuscript in their hands as if it were butter and said it was very small  if you knew how much time i have spent in making it smaller replied tommy haughtily  the madmen asked if he could not add a few chapters whereupon with a shudder he tucked baby under his wing and flew away that is how goldie  goldie got the book  for one who had left london a glittering star it was wonderful how little he brightened it by returning at the club they did not know that he had been away in society they seemed to have forgotten to expect him back  he had an eye for themwith a touch of red in it but he bided his time it was one of the terrible things about tommy that he could bide his time pym was the only person he called upon he took pym out to dinner and conducted him home again his kindness to pym the delicacy with which he pretended not to see that poor old pym was degraded and done forthey would have been pretty even in a woman and we treat tommy unfairly in passing them by with a bow  pym had the manuscript to read and you may be as sure he kept sober that night as that tommy lay awake for when literature had to be judged who could be so grim a critic as this usually lenient toper he could forgive much could pym you had run away without paying your rent was it well well come in and have a drink broken your wifes heart have you poor chap but you will soon get over it but if it was a split infinitive go to the devil sir  into a cocked hat was the verdict of pym meaning thereby that thus did tommys second work beat his first tommy broke down and wept  presently pym waxed sentimental and confided to tommy that he too had once loved in vain the sad case of those who love in vain you remember is the subject of the book the saddest of autobiographies it has been called  an odd thing this i think tearing home for the more he was engrossed in mind the quicker he walked tommy was not revelling in pyms praise he was neither blanching nor smiling at the thought that he of all people had written as one who was unloved he was not wondering what grizel would say to it he had even forgotten to sigh over his own coming dissolution indeed about this time the flowerpot began to fade from his memory what made him cut his way so excitedly through the streets was this pym had questioned his use of the word untimely in chapter eight and tommy had always been uneasy about that word  he glared at every person he passed and ran into perambulators he rushed past his chambers like one who no longer had a home he was in the park now and did not even notice that the row was empty that mighty round a deserted circus management riders clowns all the performers gone on their provincial tour or nearly all for a lady on horseback sees him remembers to some extent who he is and gives chase it is our dear mrs jerry  you wretch she said to compel me to pursue you nothing could have induced me to do anything so unwomanly except that you are the only man in town  she shook her whip so prettily at him that it was as seductive as a smile it was also a way of gaining time while she tried to remember what it was he was famous for  i believe you dont know me she said with a little shriek for tommy had looked bewildered that would be too mortifying please pretend you do  her look of appeal the way in which she put her plump little hands together as if about to say her prayers brought it all back to tommy the one thing he was not certain of was whether he had proposed to her  it was the one thing of which she was certain  you think i can forget so soon he replied reproachfully but carefully  then tell me my name said she she thought it might lead to his mentioning his own  i dont know what it is now it was mrs jerry once  it is mrs jerry still  then you did not marry him after all  no wild joy had surged to his face but when she answered yes he nodded his head with gentle melancholy three times he had not the smallest desire to deceive the lady he was simply an actor who had got his cue and liked his part  illustration but my friends still call me mrs jerry she said softly  but my friends still call me mrs jerry she said softly i suppose it suits me somehow  you will always be mrs jerry to me he replied huskily ah those meetings with old loves  if you minded so much mrs jerry said a little tremulously she had the softest heart though her memory was a trifle defective you might have discovered whether i had married him or not  was there no reason why i should not seek to discover it tommy asked with tremendous irony but not knowing in the least what he meant  it confused mrs jerry they always confused her when they were fierce and yet she liked them to be fierce when she remet them so few of them were  but she said the proper thing i am glad you have got over it  tommy maintained a masterly silence no wonder he was a power with women  i say i am glad you have got over it murmured mrs jerry again has it ever been noticed that the proper remark does not always gain in propriety with repetition  it is splendid to know that right feeling still kept tommy silent  yet she went on briskly as if he had told her something am i detaining you you were walking so quickly that i thought you were in pursuit of someone  it brought tommy back to earth and he could accept her now as an old friend he was glad to meet again you could not guess what i was in pursuit of mrs jerry he assured her and with confidence for words are not usually chased down the row  but though he made the sound of laughter that terrible face which mrs jerry remembered so well but could not give a name to took no part in the revelry he was as puzzling to her as those irritating authors who print their jokes without a note of exclamation at the end of them poor mrs jerry thought it must be a laugh of horrid bitterness and that he was referring to his dead self or something dreadful of that sort for which she was responsible  please dont tell me she said in such obvious alarm that again he laughed that awful laugh he promised with a profound sigh to carry his secret unspoken to the grave also to come to her at home if she sent him a card  he told her his address but not his name and she could not send the card to occupier  now tell me about yourself said mrs jerry with charming cunning did you go away  i came back a few days ago only  had you any shooting they nearly always threatened to make for a distant land where there was big game  tommy smiled he had never had any shooting except once in his boyhood when he and corp acted as beaters and he had wept passionately over the first bird killed and harangued the murderer  no he replied i was at work all the time  this at least told her that his work was of a kind which could be done out of london an inventor  when are we to see the result asked artful mrs jerry  very soon everything comes out about this time it is our season you know  mrs jerry pondered while she said how too entrancing what did come out this month oh plays and whose season was it the actors of course he could not be an actor with that beard butah she remembered now  are they really clever this time she asked roguishlyfor you must admit that they are usually sticks  tommy blinked at this i really believe mrs jerry he said slowly it is you who dont know who i am  you prepare the aristocracy for the stage dont you she said plaintively  i he thundered  he had a beard she said in selfdefence  who  oh i dont know please forgive me i do remember of course who you arei remember too well said mrs jerry generously  what is my name tommy demanded  she put her hands together again beseechingly please please she said i have such a dreadful memory for names butoh please  what am i he insisted  you are thethe man who invents those delightful thingumbobs she cried with an inspiration  i never invented anything except two books said tommy looking at her reproachfully  i know them by heart she cried  one of them is not published yet he informed her  i am looking forward to it so excitedly she said at once  and my name is sandys said he  thomas sandys she said correcting him triumphantly how is that dear darling little agneselspeth  you have me at last he admitted  sandys on woman exclaimed mrs jerry all rippling smiles once more can i ever forget it  i shall never pretend to know anything about women again tommy answered dolefully but with a creditable absence of vindictiveness  please please said the little hands again  it is a nasty jar mrs jerry  please  oh that i could forget so quickly  please  i forgive you if that is what you want  she waved her whip and you will come and see me  when i have got over this it needsa little time he really said this to please her  you shall talk to me of the new book she said confident that this would fetch him for he was not her first author by the way what is it about  can you ask mrs jerry replied tommy passionately oh woman woman can you ask  this puzzled her at the time but she understood what he had meant when the book came out dedicated to pym goodness gracious she said to herself as she went from chapter to chapter and she was very selfconscious when she heard the book discussed in society which was not quite as soon as it came out for at first the ladies seemed to have forgotten their tommy  but the journals made ample amends he had invented they said something new in literature a story that was yet not a story told in the form of essays which were no mere essays there was no character mentioned by name there was not a line of dialogue essays only they might say were the net result yet a human heart was laid bare and surely that was fiction in its highest form fiction founded on fact no doubt for it would be ostrichlike to deny that such a work must be the outcome of a painful personal experience but in those wise and penetrating pages mr sandys called no ones attention to himself his subject was an experience common to humanity to be borne this way or that and without vainglory he showed how it should be borne so that those looking into the deep waters of the book made clear by his pellucid style might see not the author but themselves  a few of the critics said that if the book added nothing to his reputation it detracted nothing from it but probably their pen added this mechanically when they were away what annoyed him more was the two or three who stated that much as they liked unrequited love they liked the letters still better he could not endure hearing a good word said for the letters now  the great public i believe always preferred the letters but among important sections of it the new book was a delight and for various reasons for instance it was no mere story that got the thoughtful public its style again got the public which knows it is the only public that counts  society still held aloof there was an african traveller on view that year but otherwise everything was going on well when the bolt came as ever from the quarter whence it was least expected it came in a letter from grizel so direct as to be almost as direct as this i think it is a horrid book the more beautifully it is written the more horrid it seems no one was ever loved more truly than you you can know nothing about unrequited love then why do you pretend to know i see why you always avoided telling me anything about the book even its title it was because you knew what i should say it is nothing but sentiment you were on your wings all the time you were writing it that is why you could treat me as you did even to the last moment you deceived me i suppose you deceived yourself also had i known what was in the manuscript i would not have kissed it i would have asked you to burn it had you not had the strength and you would not i should have burned it for you it would have been a proof of my love i have ceased to care whether you are a famous man or not i want you to be a real man but you will not let me help you i have cried all day grizel  fury dejection the heroic they came in that order  this is too much he cried at first i can stand a good deal grizel but there was once a worm that turned at last you know take care madam take care oh but you are a charming lady you can decide everything for everybody cant you what delicious letters you write something unexpected in everyone of them there are poor dogs of men grizel who open their letters from their loves knowing exactly what will be insidewords of cheer words of love of confidence of admiration which help them as they sit into the night at their work fighting for fame that they may lay it at their loved ones feet discouragement obloquy scorn they get in plenty from others but they are always sure of herdo you hear my original grizelthose other dogs are always sure of her hurrah grizel i was happy i was actually honoured it was helping me to do better and better when you quickly put an end to all that hurrah hurrah  i feel rather sorry for him if he had not told her about his book it was because she did not and never could understand what compels a man to write one book instead of another i had no say in the matter the thing demanded of me that i should do it and i had to do it some must write from their own experience they can make nothing of anything else but it is to me like a chariot that wont budge i have to assume a character grizel and then away we go i dont attempt to explain how i write i hate to discuss it all i know is that those who know how it should be done can never do it london is overrun with such and everyone of them is as cocksure as you you have taken everything else grizel surely you might leave me my books  yes everything else or nearly so he put upon the table all the feathers he had extracted since his return to london and they did make some little show if less than it seemed to him that little adventure in the park well if it started wrongly it but helped to show the change in him for he had determinedly kept away from mrs jerrys house he had met her once since the book came out and she had blushed exquisitely when referring to it and said how you have suffered i blame myself dreadfully yes and there was an unoccupied sofa near by and he had not sat down on it with her and continued the conversation was not that a feather and there were other ladies and without going into particulars they were several feathers between them how doggedly to punish himself he had stuck to the company of men a sex that never interested him  but all that is nothing i am beyond the pale i did so monstrous a thing that i must die for it what was this dreadful thing when i saw you with that glove i knew you loved me and that you thought i loved you and i had not the heart to dash your joy you dont know it but that was the crime for which i must be exterminated fiend that i am  gusts of fury came at intervals all the morning he wrote her appalling letters and destroyed them he shook his fist and snapped his fingers at her and went out for drink having none in the house and called a hansom to take him to mrs jerrys and tore round the park again and glared at everybody he rushed on and on but the one thing you shall never do grizel is to interfere with my work i swear it do you hear in all else i am yours to mangle at your will but touch it and i am a beast at bay  and still saying such things he drew near the publishing offices of goldie  goldie and circled round them less like a beast at bay than a bird that is taking a long way to its nest and about four of the afternoon what does this odd beast or bird or fish do but stalk into goldie  goldies and order unrequited love to be withdrawn from circulation  madam i have carried out your wishes and the man is hanged  not thus but in words to that effect did tommy announce his deed to grizel  i think you have done the right thing she wrote back and i admire you for it but he thought she did not admire him sufficiently for it and he did not answer her letter so it was the last that passed between them  such is the true explanation now first published of an affair that at the time created no small stir why withdraw the book goldie  goldie asked of tommy but he would give no reason why the public asked of goldie  goldie and they had to invent several the public invented the others the silliest were those you could know only by belonging to a club  i swear that tommy had not foreseen the result quite unwittingly the favoured of the gods had found a way again the talk about his incomprehensible action was the turningpoint in the fortunes of the book there were already a few thousand copies in circulation and now many thousand people wanted them sandys sandys sandys where had the ladies heard that name before society woke up sandys was again its hero the traveller had to go lecturing in the provinces  the ladies yes and their friends the men there was a tommy society in mayfair that winter nearly all of the members eminent or beautiful and they held each others hands both sexes were eligible married or single and the one rule was something about sympathy it afterwards became the souls but those in the know still call them the tommies  they blackballed mrs jerry she was rather plump but her married stepdaughter lady pippinworth who had been a miss ridgefulton was one of them indeed the ridgefultons are among the thinnest families in the country  t sandys was invited to join the society but declined and thus never quite knew what they did nor can any outsider know there being a regulation among the tommies against telling i believe however that they were a brotherhood with sisters you had to pass an examination in unrequited love showing how you had suffered and after that either the men or the women i forget which dressed in white to the throat and then each got some others old loves hand to hold and you all sat on the floor and thought hard there may have been even more in it than this for one got to know tommies at sight by a sort of careworn halo round the brow and it is said that the house of commons was several times nearly counted out because so many of its middleaged members were holding the floor in another place  of course there were also the antitommies who called themselves rather vulgarly the tummies many of them were that shape they held that though you had loved in vain it was no such mighty matter to boast of but they were poor in argument and their only really strong card was that mr sandys was stoutish himself  their organs in the press said that he was a man of true genius and slightly inclined to embonpoint  this maddened him but on the whole his return was a triumph and despite thoughts of grizel he was very very happy for he was at play again he was a boy and all the ladies were girls perhaps the lady he saw most frequently was mrs jerrys stepdaughter lady pippinworth was a friend of lady rintoul and had several times visited her at the spittal but that was not the sole reason why tommy so frequently drank tea with her they had met first at a country house where one night after the ladies had retired to rest lady pippinworth came stealing into the smokingroom with the tidings that there were burglars in the house as she approached her room she had heard whispers and then her door being ajar she had peeped upon the miscreants she had also seen a pile of her jewellery on the table and a pistol keeping guard on top of it there were several men in the house but that pistol cowed all of them save tommy if we could lock them in someone suggested but the key was on the wrong side of the door i shall put it on the right side tommy said pluckily if you others will prevent their escaping by the window and with characteristic courage he set off for her ladyships room his intention was to insert his hand whip out the key and lock the door on the outside a sufficiently hazardous enterprise but what does he do instead locks the door on the inside and goes for the burglars with his fists a happy recollection of corps famous one from the shoulder disposed at once of the man who had seized the pistol with the other gentleman tommy had a standup fight in which both of them took and gave but when support arrived one burglar was senseless on the floor and t sandys was sitting on the other courageous of tommy was it not but observe the end he was left in the diningroom to take charge of his captives until morning and by and by he was exhorting them in such noble language to mend their ways that they took the measure of him and so touching were their family histories that tommy wept and untied their cords and showed them out at the front door and gave them ten shillings each and the one who begged for the honour of shaking hands with him also took his watch thus did tommy and lady pippinworth become friends but it was not this that sent him so often to her house to tea she was a beautiful woman with a reputation for having broken many hearts without damaging her own he thought it an interesting case     chapter xxvi  grizel all alone   it was tommy who was the favoured of the gods you remember not grizel  elspeth wondered to see her after the publication of that book looking much as usual you know how he loved you now she said perhaps a little reproachfully  yes grizel answered i know i knew before the book came out  you must be sorry for him  grizel nodded  but proud of him also elspeth said you have a right to be proud  i am as proud grizel replied as i have a right to be  something in her voice touched elspeth who was so happy that she wanted everyone to be happy i want you to know grizel she said warmly that i dont blame you for not being able to love him we cant help those things nor need you blame yourself too much for i have often heard him say that artists must suffer in order to produce beautiful things  but i cannot remember elspeth had to admit with a sigh to david that she made any answer to that except thank you  grizel was nearly as reticent to david himself once only did she break down for a moment in his presence it was when he was telling her that the issue of the book had been stopped  but i see you know already he said perhaps you even know whythough he has not given any sufficient reason to elspeth  david had given his promise she reminded him not to ask her any questions about tommy  but i dont see why i should keep it he said bluntly  because you dislike him she replied  grizel he declared i have tried hard to like him i have thought and thought about it and i cant see that he has given me any just cause to dislike him  and that said grizel makes you dislike him more than ever  i know that you cared for him once david persisted and i know that he wanted to marry you  but she would not let him go on david she said i want to give up my house and i want you to take it it is the real doctors house of thrums and people in need of you still keep ringing me up of nights the only door to your surgery is through my passage it is i who should be in lodgings now  do you really think i would grizel he cried indignantly  rather than see the dear house go into anothers hands she answered steadily for i am determined to leave it dr mcqueen wont feel strange when he looks down david if it is only you he sees moving about the old rooms instead of me  you are doing this for me grizel and i wont have it  i give you my word she told him that i am doing it for myself alone i am tired of keeping a house and of all its worries men dont know what they are  she was smiling but his brows wrinkled in pain oh grizel he said and stopped and then he cried since when has grizel ceased to care for housekeeping  she did not say since when i dont know whether she knew but it was since she and tommy had ceased to correspond davids words showed her too suddenly how she had changed and it was then that she broke down before himbecause she had ceased to care for housekeeping  but she had her way and early in the new year david and his wife were established in their new home with all grizels furniture except such as was needed for the two rooms rented by her from gavinia she would have liked to take away the old doctors chair because it was the bit of him left behind when he died and then for that very reason she did not she no longer wanted him to see her always i am not so nice as i used to be and i want to keep it from you she said to the chair when she kissed it goodbye  was grizel not as nice as she used to be how can i answer who love her the more only there is one at least grizel who will never desert you  ah but was she  i seem again to hear the warning voice of grizel and this time she is crying you know i was not  she knew it so well that she could say it to herself quite calmly she knew that with whatever repugnance she drove those passions away they would come backyes and for a space be welcomed back why does she leave gavinias blue hearth this evening and seek the solitary den she has gone to summon them and she knows it they come thick in the den for they know the place it was there that her mother was wont to walk with them have they been waiting for you in the den grizel all this time have you found your mothers legacy at last  dont think that she sought them often it was never when she seemed to have anything to live for tommy would not write to her and so did not want her to write to him but if that bowed her head it never made her rebel she still had her many duties whatever she suffered so long as she could say i am helping him she was in heart and soul the grizel of old in his fits of remorse which were many he tried to produce work that would please her thus in a heroic attempt to be practical he wrote a political article in one of the reviews quite in the ordinary style but so much worse than the average of such things that they would never have printed it without his name he also contributed to a magazine a short talehe who could never write talesand he struck all the beautiful reflections out of it and never referred to himself once and the result was so imbecile that kindly people said there must be another writer of the same name show them to grizel tommy wrote to elspeth inclosing also some of the animadversions of the press and he meant grizel to see that he could write in his own way only but she read those two efforts with delight and said to elspeth tell him i am so proud of them  elspeth thought it very nice of grizel to defend the despised in this way even elspeth had fallen asleep over the political paper she did not understand that grizel loved them because they showed tommy trying to do without his wings  then another trifle by him appeared shorter even than the others but no man in england could have written it except t sandys it has not been reprinted and i forget everything about it except that its subject was love will not the friends of the man who can produce such a little masterpiece as this the journals said save him from wasting his time on lumber for the reviews and drivelling tales and tommy suggested to elspeth that she might show grizel this exhortation also  grizel saw she was not helping him at all if he would not fight why should she oh let her fall and fall it would not take her farther from him these were the thoughts that sent her into solitude to meet with worse ones she could not face the morrow what shall i do tomorrow she never shrank from todayit had its duties it could be got through but tomorrow was a neverending road oh how could she get through tomorrow  her great friend at this time was corp because he still retained his faith in tommy she could always talk of tommy to corp  how loyal corp was he still referred to tommy as him gavinia much distressed read aloud to corp a newspaper attack on the political article and all he said was hell find a wy  hes found it he went upstairs to announce to grizel when the praises of the little masterpiece arrived  yes i know corp she answered quietly she was sitting by the window where the plant was tommy had asked her to take care of it without telling her why  something in her appearance troubled the hulking blundering man he could not have told what it was i think it was simply thisthat grizel no longer sat erect in her chair  im nain easy in my mind about grizel he said that evening to gavinia theres something queery about her though i canna bottom t  yea said gavinia with mild contempt  he continued pulling at his pipe grunting as if in pleasant pain which was the way corp smoked  i could see shes no pleased though he has found a wy he said  what pleasure should she be able to sook out o his keeping dingdingdanging on about that woman retorted gavinia  what woman  the london besom that gae him the goby  was there sic a woman corp cried  of course there was and its her that hes aye writing about  havers gavinia its grizel hes aye writing about and it was grizel that gae him the goby its town talk  but whatever the town might say gavinia stuck to her opinion grizels no near so neat in her dressing as she was she informed corp and her hair is no aye tidy and that bonnet she was in yesterday didna set her  ive noticed it cried corp ive noticed it this while back though i didna ken i had noticed it gavinia i wonder what can be the reason  its because nobody cares gavinia replied sadly trust one woman to know another  we a care said corp stoutly  were a as nothing corp when he doesna care shes fond o him man  of course she is in a wy whaurs the woman that could help it  theres many a woman that could help it said gavinia tartly for the honour of her sex but shes no are o them to be candid gavinia was not one of them herself im thinking shes terrible fond o him she said and im nain sure that he has treated her weel  woman take care say a word agin him and ill mittle you corp thundered and she desisted in fear  but he made her reread the little essay to him in instalments and at the end he said victoriously you blethering crittur theres no sic woman its just another o his ploys  he marched upstairs to grizel with the news and she listened kindly i am sure you are right she said you understand him better than any of them corp and it was true  he thought he had settled the whole matter he was burning to be downstairs to tell gavinia that these things needed only a man and so youll be yoursel again grizel he said with great relief  she had not seen that he was aiming at her until now and it touched her am i so different corp  not at all he assured her delicately but she was maybe no quite so neatly dressed as she used to be and her hair wasna braided back so smooth and he didna think that bonnet quite set her  gavinia has been saying that to you  i noticed it mysel grizel im a terrible noticher  perhaps you are right she said reflecting after looking at herself for the first time for some days but to think of your caring corp  i care most michty he replied with terrific earnestness  i must try to satisfy you then she said smiling but corp please dont discuss me with gavinia  this request embarrassed him for soon again he did not know how to act there was grizels strange behaviour with the child for instance no i wont come down to see him today corp she had said somehow children weary me  such words from grizel his mouth would not shut and he could say nothing forgive me corp she cried remorsefully and ran downstairs and with many a passionate caress asked forgiveness of the child  corp followed her and for the moment he thought he must have been dreaming upstairs i wish i saw you wi bairns o your ain grizel he said looking on entranced but she gave him such a pitiful smile that he could not get it out of his head deprived of gavinias counsel and afraid to hurt elspeth he sought out the doctor and said bluntly to him how is it he never writes to grizel she misses him terrible  so david thought grizels dejection is becoming common talk damn him he said in a gust of fury  but this was too much for loyal corp damn you he roared  but in his heart he knew that the doctor was a just man and henceforth when he was meaning to comfort grizel he was often seeking comfort for himself  he did it all with elaborate cunning to prevent her guessing that he was disturbed about her asked permission to sit with her for instance because he was dull downstairs mentioned as a ludicrous thing that there were people who believed tommy could treat a woman badly and waited anxiously for the reply oh he was transparent was corp but you may be sure grizel never let him know that she saw through him tommy could not be blamed she pointed out though he did not care for some woman who perhaps cared for him  exacly said corp  and if he seemed grizel went on with momentary bitterness to treat her badly it could be only because she had made herself cheap  thats it said corp cheerfully then he added hurriedly no thats no it ava shes the last to mak hersel cheap then he saw that this might put grizel on the scent of course theres no sic woman he said artfully but if there was he would mak it a right she mightna see how it was to be done but kennin what a crittur he is she maun be sure he would find a wy she would never lose hope grizel  and then if grizel did not appease him instantly he would say appealingly i canna think less o him grizel no it would mak me just terrible low grizel he would cry sternly dinna tell me to think less o that laddie  then when she had reassured him he would recall the many instances in which tommy as a boy had found a way did we ever ken he was finding it grizel till he did find it many a time i says to mysel says i all is over and syne next minute that holy look comes ower his face and he stretches out his legs like as if he was riding on a horse and all that kens him says he has found a wy if i was the woman no that there is sic a woman i would say to mysel he was never beat i would say when he was a laddie and its no likely hell be beat when hes a man and i wouldna sit looking at the fire wi my hands fauded nor would i forget to keep my hair neat and i would wear the frock that set me best and i would play in my auld bonny wy wi bairns for says i to mysel im sure to hae bairns o my ain some day and  but grizel cried dont corp dont  i winna he answered miserably no i winna forgive me grizel i think ill be stepping and then when he got as far as the door he would say i canna do t grizel im just terrible wae for the woman if sic a woman there be but i canna think ill o him you mauna speir it o me  he was much brightened by a reflection that came to him one day in church here have i been near blaming him for no finding a wy and very like he doesna ken we want him to find a wy  how to inform tommy without letting grizel know she had tried twice long ago to teach him to write but he found it harder on the wrists than the heaviest luggage it was not safe for him even to think of the extra twirl that turned an n into an m without first removing any knickknacks that might be about nevertheless he now proposed a third setto and grizel acquiesced though she thought it but another of his inventions to keep her from brooding  the number of words in the english tongue excited him and he often lost all by not confining the chase to one like a dog after rabbits fortunately he knew which words he wanted to bag  change at tilliedrum tickets show your tickets and the like he much enjoyed meeting in the flesh so to speak  lets see find a wy grizel he would say ay ay and is that the crittur and soon the sly fellow could write it or at least draw it  he affected an ambition to write a letter to his son on that gentlemans first birthday and so lets see what i send you these few scrapes is like grizel she assured him that this is not essential in correspondence but all the letters he had ever heard read aloud began thus and he got his way  anon master shiach was surprised and gratified to receive the following epistle my dear sir i send you these few scrapes to tell you as you have found a way to be a year of age the morn all tickets ready in which gavinia joins so no more at present i am sir your obedt father corp shiach  the fame of this letter went abroad but not a soul knew of the next it said my dear sir i send you these few scrapes to tell you as grizel needs cheering up kindly oblidge by finding a way so no more at present i am sir your obedt servt corp shiach  to his bewilderment this produced no effect though only because tommy never got it and he wrote again more sternly requesting his hero to find a way immediately he was waiting restlessly for the answer at a time when elspeth called on grizel to tell her of something beautiful that tommy had done he had been very ill for nearly a fortnight it appeared but had kept it from her to save her anxiety just think grizel all the time he was in bed with bronchitis he was writing me cheerful letters every other day pretending there was nothing the matter with him he is better now i have heard about it from a mrs jerry a lady whom i knew in london and who has nursed him in the kindest way but this same mrs jerry had opened corps letters and destroyed them as of no importance he would never have mentioned it himself how like him grizel you remember i made him promise before he went back to london that if he was ill he would let me know at once so that i could go to him but he is so considerate he would not give me pain he wrote those letters grizel when he was gasping for breath  but she seemed quite unmoved elspeth said sadly to her husband afterwards  unmoved yes grizel remained apparently unmoved until elspeth had gone but thenthe torture she endured oh cruel cruel she cried and she could neither stand nor sit she flung herself down before the fire and rocked this way and that in a paroxysm of woe oh cruel cruel  it was tommy who was cruel to be ill near to dying apparently and not to send her word she could never never have let him go had he not made that promise to elspeth and he kept it thus oh wicked wicked  you would have gone to him at once elspeth you who are you that talks of going to him as your right he is not yours i tell you he is mine he is mine alone it is i who would go to him who is this woman that dares take my place by his side when he is ill  she rose to go to him to drive away all others i am sure that was what gave her strength to rise but she sank to the floor again and her passion lasted for hours and through the night she was crying to god that she would be brave no more in her despair she hoped he heard her  her mood had not changed when david came to see her next morning to admit too that tommy seemed to have done an unselfish thing in concealing his illness from them grizel nodded but he thought she was looking strangely reckless he had a message from elspeth tommy had asked her to let him know whether the plant was flourishing  so you and he dont correspond now david said with his old puzzled look  no was all her answer to that the plant she thought was dead she had not indeed paid much attention to it of late but she showed it to david and he said it would revive if more carefully tended he also told her its rather pathetic history which was new to grizel and of the talk at the wedding which had led to tommys taking pity on it fellowfeeling i suppose he said lightly you see they both blossomed prematurely  the words were forgotten by him as soon as spoken but grizel sat on with them for they were like a friendor was it an enemywho had come to tell her strange things yes the doctor was right now she knew why tommy had loved this plant of the way in which he would sit looking wistfully at it almost nursing it she had been told by aaron he had himself begged her to tend it lovingly fellowfeeling the doctor was shrewder than he thought  well what did it matter to her all that day she would do nothing for the plant but in the middle of the night she rose and ran to it and hugged it and for a time she was afraid to look at it by lamplight lest tommy was dead whether she had never been asleep that night or had awakened from a dream she never knew but she ran to the plant thinking it and tommy were as one and that they must die together no such thought had ever crossed his mind but it seemed to her that she had been told it by him and she lit her fire to give the plant warmth and often desisted to press it to her bosom the heat seemed to come so reluctantly from the fire this idea that his fate was bound up with that of the plant took strange possession of the once practical grizel it was as if some of tommys nature had passed into her to help her break the terrible monotony of the days  and from that time there was no ailing child more passionately tended than the plant and as spring advanced it began once more to put forth new leaves  and grizel also seemed glorified again she was her old self dark shapes still lingered for her in the den but she avoided them and if they tried to enter into her she struggled with them and cast them out as she saw herself able to fight and win once more her pride returned to her and one day she could ask david joyously to give her a present of the old doctors chair and she could kneel by its side and say to it you can watch me always i am just as i used to be  seeing her once more the incarnation of vigor and content singing gaily to his child and as eager to be at her duties betimes as a morning in may corp grunted with delight and was a hero for not telling her that it was he who had passed tommy the word for of course tommy had done it all  somebody has found a wy grizel he would say chuckling and she smiled an agreement  and yet says he puzzled ive watched and you hinna haen a letter frae him it defies the face o clay to find out how he has managed it oh the crittur ay i suppose you dinna want to tell me what it is that has lichted you up again  she could not tell him for it was a compact she had made with one who did not sign it i shall cease to be bitter and despairing and wicked and try every moment of my life to be good and do good so long as my plant flourishes but if it withers then i shall go to himi dont care what happens i shall go to him  it was the middle of june when she first noticed that the plant was beginning to droop     chapter xxvii  grizels journey   nothing could have been less expected in the beginning of may its leaves had lost something of their greenness the plant seemed to be hesitating but she coaxed it over the hill and since then it had scarcely needed her hand almost lightheadedly it hurried into its summer clothes and new buds broke out on it like smiles at the fascinating thought that there was to be a tomorrow grizels plant had never been so brave in its little life when suddenly it turned back  that was the day on which elspeth and david were leaving for a fortnights holiday with his relatives by the sea for elspeth needed and was getting special devotion just now and grizel knew why she was glad they were going it was well that they should not be there to ask questions if she also must set forth on a journey  for more than a week she waited and everything she could do for her plant she did she watched it so carefully that she might have deceived herself into believing that it was standing still only had there been no nighttime she thought she had not perhaps been sufficiently good and she tried to be more ostentatiously satisfied with her lot never had she forced herself to work quite so hard for others as in those few days and then when she came home it had drooped a little more  when she was quite sure that it was dying she told corp she was going to london by that nights train he is ill corp and i must go to him  ill but how had he let her know  he has found a way she said with a tremulous smile he wanted her to telegraph but no she would place no faith in telegrams  at least she could telegraph to elspeth and the doctor one of them would go  it is i who am going she said quietly i cant wait any longer it was a promise corp he loves me they were the only words she said which suggest that there was anything strange about grizel at this time  corp saw how determined she was when she revealed incidentally that she had drawn a sum of money out of the bank a week ago to be ready  what will folk say he cried  you can tell gavinia the truth when i am gone she told him she will know better than you what to say to other people and that was some comfort to him for it put the burden of invention upon his wife so it was corp who saw grizel off he was in great distress himself about tommy but he kept a courageous face for her and his last words flung in at the carriage window were now dinna be downhearted im nain downhearted mysel for were very sure hell find a wy and grizel smiled and nodded and the train turned the bend that shuts out the little town of thrums the town vanishes quickly but the quarry we howked it out of stands grim and red watching the train for many a mile  of grizels journey to london there are no particulars to tell she was wearing her brown jacket and fur cap because tommy had liked them and she sat straight and stiff all the way she had never been in a train since she was a baby except two or three times to tilliedrum and she thought this was the right way to sit always when the train stopped which was at long intervals she put her head out at the window and asked if this was the train to london every station a train stops at in the middle of the night is the infernal regions and she shuddered to hear lost souls clanking their chains which is what a milkcan becomes on its way to the van but still she asked if this was the train to london when fellowpassengers addressed her she was very modest and cautious in her replies sometimes a look of extraordinary happiness of radiance passed over her face and may have puzzled them it was part of the thought that however ill he might be she was to see him now  she did not see him as soon as she expected for at the door of tommys lodgings they told her that he had departed suddenly for the continent about a week ago he was to send an address by and by to which letters could be forwarded was he quite well when he went away grizel asked shaking  the landlady and her daughter thought he was rather peakish but he had not complained  he went away for his health grizel informed them and he was very ill now oh could they not tell her where he was all she knew was that he was very ill i am engaged to be married to him she said with dignity without this strange certainty that tommy loved her at last she could not have trod the road which faced her now even when she had left the house where at their suggestion she was to call tomorrow she found herself wondering at once what he would like her to do now and she went straight to a hotel and had her box sent to it from the station and she remained there all day because she thought that this was what he would like her to do she sat bolt upright on a cane chair in her bedroom praying to god with her eyes open she was begging him to let tommy tell her where he was and promising to return home at once if he did not need her  next morning they showed her at his lodgings two lines in a newspaper which said that he was ill with bronchitis at the hotel krone badplatten in switzerland  it may have been an answer to her prayer as she thought but we know now how the paragraph got into print on the previous evening the landlady had met mr pym on the ladder of an omnibus and told him before they could be plucked apart of the lady who knew that mr sandys was ill it must be bronchitis again pym was much troubled he knew that the krone at badplatten had been tommys destination he talked that day and one of the company was a reporter which accounts for the paragraph  grizel found out how she could get to badplatten she left her box behind her at the cloakroom of the railway station where i suppose it was sold years afterwards from dover she sent a telegram to tommy saying i am coming grizel  on entering the train at calais she had a railway journey of some thirty hours broken by two changes only she could speak a little french but all the use she made of it was to ask repeatedly if she was in the right train an english lady who travelled with her for many hours woke up now and again to notice that this quiet primlooking girl was always sitting erect with her hand on her umbrella as if ready to leave the train at any moment the lady pointed out some of the beauties of the scenery to her and grizel tried to listen i am afraid you are unhappy her companion said at last  that is not why i am crying grizel said i think i am crying because i am so hungry  the stranger gave her sandwiches and claret as cold as the rivers that raced the train and grizel told her quite frankly why she was going to badplatten she did not tell his name only that he was ill and that she was engaged to him and he had sent for her she believed it all the lady was very sympathetic and gave her information about the diligence by which the last part of grizels journey must be made and also said you must not neglect your meals if only for his sake for how can you nurse him back to health if you arrive at badplatten ill yourself consider his distress if he were to be told that you were in the inn but not able to go to him  oh grizel cried rocking her arms for the first time since she knew her plant was drooping she promised to be very practical henceforth so as to have strength to take her place by his side at once it was strange that she who was so good a nurse had forgotten these things so strange that it alarmed her as if she feared that without being able to check herself she was turning into some other person  the station where she alighted was in a hubbub of life everyone seemed to leave the train here and to resent the presence of all the others they were mostly english the men hung back as if now that there was business to be done in some foolish tongue they had better leave the ladies to do it many of them seemed prepared if there was dissension to disown their womankind and run for it they looked haughty and nervous such of them as had tried to shave in the train were boasting of it and holding handkerchiefs to their chins the ladies were moving about in a masterful way carrying bunches of keys when they had done everything the men went and stood by their sides again  outside the station buses and carriages were innumerable and everybody was shouting but grizel saw that nearly all her fellowpassengers were hurrying by foot or conveyance to one spot all desirous of being there first and she thought it must be the place where the diligence started from and pressed on with them it proved to be a hotel where they all wanted the best bedroom and many of them had telegraphed for it and they gathered round a man in uniform and demanded that room of him but he treated them as if they were little dogs and he was not the platter and soon they were begging for a room on the fourth floor at the back and swelling with triumph if they got it the scrimmage was still going on when grizel slipped out of the hotel having learned that the diligence would not start until the following morning it was still early in the afternoon how could she wait until tomorrow  badplatten was forty miles away the road was pointed out to her it began to climb at once she was to discover that for more than thirty miles it never ceased to climb she sat down hesitating on a little bridge that spanned a horrible rushing white stream poets have sung the glories of that stream but it sent a shiver through her on all sides she was caged in by a ring of splendid mountains but she did not give them one admiring glance there is a special spot where the guidebooks advise you to stop for a moment to do it her one passionate desire was to fling out her arms and knock them over  she had often walked twenty miles in a day in a hill country too without feeling tired and there seemed no reason why she should not set off now there were many inns on the way she was told where she could pass the night there she could get the diligence next day this would not bring her any sooner to him than if she waited here until tomorrow but how could she sit still till tomorrow she must be moving she seemed to have been sitting still for an eternity i must not do anything rash she told herself carefully i must arrive at badplatten able to sit down beside him the moment i have taken off my jacketoh without waiting to take off my jacket she went into the hotel and ate some food just to show herself how careful she had become about three oclock she set off she had a fierce desire to get away from that heartless white stream and the crack of whips and the doleful pine woods and at first she walked very quickly but she never got away from them for they marched with her it was not that day but the next that grizel thought anything was marching with her that day her head was quite clear and she kept her promise to herself and as soon as she felt tired she stopped for the night at a village inn but when she awoke very early next morning she seemed to have forgotten that she was to travel the rest of the way by diligence for after a slight meal she started off again on foot and she was walking all day  she passed through many villages so like each other that in time she thought they might be the same there was always a monster inn whence one carriage was departing as another drove up and there was a great stone watertank in which women drew their washing back and forward and there was always a big yellow dog that barked fiercely and then giggled and at the doors of painted houses children stood you knew they were children by their size only the one person she spoke to that day was a child who offered her a bunch of wild flowers no one was looking and grizel kissed her and then hurried on  the carriage passed and repassed her there must have been a hundred of them but in time they became one no sooner had it disappeared in dust in front of her than she heard the crack of its whip behind  it was a glorious day of sweltering sun but she was bewildered now and did not open the umbrella with which she had shielded her head yesterday in the foreground was always the same white road on both sides the same pine wood laughing with wild flowers the same roaring white stream from somewhere near came the tinkle of cowbells far away on heights if she looked up were villages made of matchboxes she saw what were surely the same villages if she looked down or the one was the reflection of the other in the sky above or in the valley below they stood out so vividly that they might have been within arms reach they were so small that she felt she could extinguish them with her umbrella near them was the detestably picturesque castle perched upon a bracket everywhere was that loathly waterfall here and there were squares of cultivated land that looked like doormats flung out upon the hillsides the huge mountains raised their jagged heads through the snow and were so sharpedged that they might have been clipped out of cardboard the sky was blue without a flaw but lost clouds crawled like snakes between heaven and earth all day the sun scorched her but the night was nipping cold  from early morn till evening she climbed to get away from them but they all marched with her they waited while she slept she woke up in an inn and could have cried with delight because she saw nothing but bare walls but as soon as she reached the door there they all were ready for her an hour after she set off she again reached that door and she stopped at it to ask if this was the inn where she had passed the night everything had turned with her two squalls of sudden rain drenched her that day and she forced her way through the first but sought a covering from the second  it was then afternoon and she was passing through a village by a lake since grizels time monster hotels have trampled the village to death and the shuddering lake reflects all day the most hideous of caravansaries flung together as with a giant shovel in one of the loveliest spots on earth even then some of the hotels had found it out grizel drew near to two of them and saw wet halls full of open umbrellas which covered the floor and looked like great beetles these buildings were too formidable and she dragged herself past them she came to a garden of hops and evergreens wet chairs were standing in the deserted walks and here and there was a little arbour she went into one of these arbours and sat down and soon slid to the floor  the place was st gian some miles from badplatten but one of the umbrellas she had seen was tommys others belonged to mrs jerry and lady pippinworth     chapter xxviii  two of them   when tommy started impulsively on what proved to be his only continental trip he had expected to join mrs jerry and her stepdaughter at badplatten they had been there for a fortnight and the place is a dream mrs jerry had said in the letter pressing him to come but it was at st gian that she met the diligence and told him to descend badplatten she explained was a horror  her fuller explanation was that she was becoming known there as the round lady  now am i as round as all that she said plaintively to tommy  mrs jerry he replied with emotion you must not ask me what i think of you he always treated her with extraordinary respect and chivalry now and it awed her  she had looked too too round because she was in the company of lady pippinworth everyone seemed to be too round or too large by the side of that gifted lady who somehow never looked too thin she knew her power when there were women in the room whom she disliked she merely went and stood beside them in the gyrations of the dance the onlooker would momentarily lose sight of her she came and went like a blinking candle men could not dance with her without its being said that they were getting stout there is nothing they dislike so much yet they did dance with her tommy having some slight reason was particularly sensitive about references to his figure yet it was lady pippinworth who had drawn him to switzerland what was her strange attraction  calmly considered she was preposterously thin but men at least could not think merely of her thinness unless when walking with her they became fascinated by its shadow on the ground she was tall and had a very clear pale complexion and lightbrown hair light brown too were her heavy eyelashes which were famous for being blacktipped as if a brush had touched them though it had not she made play with her eyelashes as with a fan and sometimes the upper and lower seemed to entangle for a moment and be in difficulties from which you wanted to extricate them in the tenderest manner and the more you wanted to help her the more disdainfully she looked at you yet though she looked disdainful she also looked helpless now we have the secret of her charm  this helpless disdain was the natural expression of her face and i am sure she fell asleep with a curl of the lip her scorn of men so maddened them that they could not keep away from her damn they said under their breath and rushed to her if rumour is to be believed sir harry pippinworth proposed to her in a fury brought on by the sneer with which she had surveyed his family portraits i know nothing more of sir harry except that she called him pips which seems to settle him  they will be calling me the round gentleman tommy said ruefully to her that evening as he strolled with her towards the lake and indeed he was looking stout mrs jerry did not accompany them she wanted to be seen with her trying stepdaughter as little as possible and tommys had been the happy proposal that he should attend them alternatelyfling away my own figure to save yours he had said gallantly to mrs jerry  do you mind lady pippinworth asked  i mind nothing he replied so long as i am with you  he had not meant to begin so near the point where they had last left off he had meant to begin much farther back but an irresistible desire came over him to make sure that she really did permit him to say this sort of thing  her only reply was a flutter of the little fans and a most contemptuous glance  alice said tommy in the old way  well  you dont understand what it is to me to say alice again  many people call me alice  but they have a right to  i supposed you thought you had a right to also  no said tommy that is why i do it  she strolled on more scornful and helpless than ever apparently it did not matter what one said to lady pippinworth her pout kept it within the proprieties  there was a magnificent sunset that evening which dyed a snowtopped mountain pink that is what i came all the way from london to see tommy remarked after they had gazed at it  i hope you feel repaid she said a little tartly  you mistake my meaning he replied i had heard of these wonderful sunsets and an intense desire came over me to see you looking disdainfully at them yes i feel amply repaid did you notice alice or was it but a fancy of my own that when he had seen the expression on your face the sun quite slunk away  i wonder you dont do so also she retorted she had no sense of humour and was rather stupid so it is no wonder that the men ran after her  i am more gallant than the sun said he if i had been up there in its place alice and you had been looking at me i could never have set  she pouted contemptuously which meant i think that she was well pleased yet though he seemed to be complimenting her she was not sure of him she had never been sure of tommy nor indeed he of her which was probably why they were so interested in each other still  do you know tommy said what i have told you is really at least half the truth if i did not come here to see you disdaining the sun i think i did come to see you disdaining me odd is it not if true that a man should travel so far to see a lip curl up  you dont seem to know what brought you she said  it seems so monstrous he replied musing oh yes i am quite certain that the curl of the lip is responsible for my being here it kept sending me constant telegrams but what i want to know is do i come for the pleasure of the thing or for the pain do i like your disdain alice or does it make me writhe am i here to beg you to do it again or to defy it  which are you doing now she inquired  i had hoped he said with a sigh that you could tell me that  on another occasion they reached the same point in this discussion and went a little beyond it it was on a wet afternoon too when tommy had vowed to himself to mend his ways that disdainful look is you he told her and i admire it more than anything in nature and yet alice and yet  well she answered coldly but not moving though he had come suddenly too near her they were on a private veranda of the hotel and she was lolling in a wicker chair  and yet he said intensely i am not certain that i would not give the world to have the power to drive that look from your face that i begin to think is what brought me here  but you are not sure she said with a shrug of the shoulder  it stung him into venturing further than he had ever gone with her before not too gently he took her head in both his hands and forced her to look up at him she submitted without a protest she was disdainful but helpless  well she said again  he withdrew his hands and she smiled mockingly  if i thought he cried with sudden passion and stopped  you think a great deal dont you she said she was going now  if i thought there was any blood in your veins you icy woman  or in your own said she but she said it a little fiercely and he noticed that  alice he cried i know now it is to drive that look from your face that i am here  she courtesied from the door she was quite herself again  but for that moment she had been moved he was convinced of it and his first feeling was of exultation as in an achievement i dont know what you are doing just now lady pippinworth but my compliments to you and t sandys is swelling  there followed on this exultation another feeling as sinceredevout thankfulness that he had gone no further he drew deep breaths of relief over his escape but knew that he had not himself to thank his friends the little sprites had done it in return for the amusement he seemed to give them they had stayed him in the nick of time but not earlier it was quite as if they wanted tommy to have his fun first so often they had saved him from being spitted how could he guess that the great catastrophe was fixed for tonight and that henceforth they were to sit round him counting his wriggles as if this new treatment of him tickled them even more than the other  but he was too clever not to know that they might be fattening him for some very special feast and his thanks took the form of a vow to need their help no more tomorrow he would begin to climb the mountains around st gian if he danced attendance on her dangerous ladyship again mrs jerry should be there also and he would walk circumspectly between them like a man with gyves upon his wrists he was in the midst of all the details of these reforms when suddenly he looked at himself thus occupied and laughed bitterly he had so often come upon tommy making grand resolves  he stopped operations and sat down beside them no one could have wished more heartily to be anybody else or have had less hope he had not even the excuse of being passionately drawn to this woman he remembered that she had never interested him until he heard of her effect upon other men her reputation as a duellist whose defence none of his sex could pass had led to his wondering what they saw in her and he had dressed himself in their sentiments and so approached her there were times in her company when he forgot that he was wearing borrowed garments when he went on flame but he always knew as now upon reflection nothing seemed easier at this moment than to fling them aside with one jerk they were on the floor obviously it was only vanity that had inspired him and vanity was satisfied the easier therefore to stop would you like to make the woman unhappy tommy you know you would not you have somewhere about you one of the softest hearts in the world then desist be satisfied that you did thaw her once and grateful that she so quickly froze again i am indeed i am he responds no one could have himself better in hand for the time being than i and if a competition in morals were now going on i should certainly take the medal but i cannot speak for myself an hour in advance i make a vow as i have done so often before but it does not help me to know what i may be at before the night is out  when his disgust with himself was at its height he suddenly felt like a little god his new book had come into view he flicked a finger at his reflection in a mirror that for you he said defiantly at least i can write i can write at last  the manuscript lay almost finished at the bottom of his trunk it could not easily have been stolen for one hour without his knowing just when he was about to start on a walk with one of the ladies he would run upstairs to make sure that it was still there he made sure by feeling and would turn again at the door to make sure by looking miser never listened to the crispness of banknotes with more avidity woman never spent more time in shutting and opening her jewelbox  i can write at last he knew that comparatively speaking he had never been able to write before he remembered the fuss that had been made about his former books pooh he said addressing them contemptuously  once more he drew his beloved manuscript from its hidingplace he did not mean to read only to fondle but his eye chancing to fall on a special passagetwo hours afterwards he was interrupted by the dinnergong he returned the pages to the box and wiped his eyes while dressing hurriedly he remembered with languid interest that lady pippinworth was staying in the same hotel  there were a hundred or more at dinner and they were all saying the same thing where have you been today really but the lower path is shadier is this your first visit the glacier is very nice were you caught in the rain the view from the top is very nice after all the rain lays the dust they give you two sweets at badplatten and an ice on sunday the sunset is very nice the poulet is very nice the hotel is open during the summer months only but probably the chairs in the diningroom and the knives and forks in their basket make these remarks to each other every evening throughout the winter  being a newcomer tommy had not been placed beside either of his friends who sat apart because mrs jerry said she calls me mamma and i am not going to stand that for some time he gave thought to neither of them he was engrossed in what he had been reading and it turned him into a fine and magnanimous character when gradually her ladyship began to flit among his reflections it was not to disturb them but because she harmonized he wanted to apologize to her the apology grew in grace as the dinner progressed it was so charmingly composed that he was profoundly stirred by it  the opportunity came presently in the hall where it is customary after dinner to lounge or stroll if you are afraid of the night air or if you do not care for music you can go into the drawingroom and listen to the piano  i am sure mamma is looking for you everywhere lady pippinworth said when tommy took a chair beside her it is her evening you know  surely you would not drive me away he replied with a languishing air and then smiled at himself for he was done with this sort of thing lady pippinworth said he firmlyit needs firmness when of late you have been saying alice  well  i have been thinking tommy began  i am sure you have she said  i have been thinking he went on determinedly that i played a poor part this afternoon i had no right to say what i said to you  as far as i can remember she answered you did not say very much  it is like your generosity lady pippinworth he said to make light of it but let us be frank i made love to you  anyone looking at his expressionless face and her lazy disdain and there were many in the hall would have guessed that their talk was of where were you today and what should i do tomorrow  you dont really mean that her ladyship said incredulously think mr sandys before you tell me anything more are you sure you are not confusing me with mamma  i did it said tommy remorsefully  in my absence she asked  when you were with me on the veranda  her eyes opened to their widest so surprised that the lashes had no time for their usual play  was that what you call making love mr sandys she inquired  i call a spade a spade  and now you are apologizing to me i understand  if you can in the goodness of your heart forgive me lady pippinworth  oh i do she said heartily i do but how stupid you must have thought me not even to know i feel that it is i who ought to apologize what a number of ways there seem to be of making love and yours is such an odd way  now to apologize for playing a poor part is one thing and to put up with the charge of playing a part poorly is quite another nevertheless he kept his temper  you have discovered an excellent way of punishing me he said manfully and i submit indeed i admire you the more so i am paying you a compliment when i whisper that i know you knew  but she would not have it you are so strangely dense tonight she said surely if i had known i would have stopped you you forget that i am a married woman she added remembering pips rather late in the day  there might be other reasons why you did not stop me he replied impulsively  such as  well youyou might have wanted me to go on  he blurted it out  so said she slowly you are apologizing to me for not going on  i implore you lady pippinworth tommy said in much distress not to think me capable of that if i moved you for a moment i am far from boasting of it it makes me only the more anxious to do what is best for you  this was not the way it had shaped during dinner and tommy would have acted wisely had he now gone out to cool his head if you moved me she repeated interrogatively but with the best intentions he continued to flounder  believe me he implored her had i known it could be done i should have checked myself but they always insist that you are an iceberg and am i so much to blame if that look of hauteur deceived me with the rest oh dear lady disdain he said warmly in answer to one of her most freezing glances it deceives me no longer from that moment i knew you had a heart and i was shamedas noble a heart as ever beat in woman he added he always tended to add generous bits when he found it coming out well  does the man think i am in love with him was lady disdains inadequate reply  no no indeed he assured her earnestly i am not so vain as to think that nor so selfish as to wish it but if for a moment you were moved  but i was not said she stamping her shoe  his dander began to rise as they say in the north but he kept grip of politeness  if you were moved for a moment lady pippinworth he went on in a slightly more determined voicei am far from saying that it was so but if  but as i was not she said  it was no use putting things prettily to her when she snapped you up in this way  you know you were he said reproachfully  i assure you said she i dont know what you are talking about but apparently it is something dreadful so perhaps one of us ought to go away  as he did not take this hint she opened a tattered tauchnitz which was lying at her elbow they are always lying at your elbow in a swiss hotel with the first pages missing  tommy watched her gloomily this is unworthy of you he said  what is  he was not quite sure but as he sat there misgivings entered his mind and began to gnaw was it all a mistake of his undeniably he did think too much after all had she not been moved sdeath  his restlessness made her look up it must be a great load off your mind she said with gentle laughter to know that your apology was unnecessary  it is tommy said it is sdeath  she resumed her book  so this was how one was rewarded for a generous impulse he felt very bitter so so he said inwardly also very well very well then he turned upon himself serve you right he said brutally better stick to your books thomas for you know nothing about women to think for one moment that he had moved her that streak of marble moved he fell to watching her again as if she were some troublesome sentence that needed licking into shape as she bent impertinently over her book she was an insult to man all tommys interest in her revived she infuriated him  alice he whispered  do keep quiet till i finish this chapter she begged lazily  it brought him at once to the boilingpoint  alice he said fervently  she had noticed the change in his voice people are looking she said without moving a muscle  there was some subtle flattery to him in the warning but he could not ask for more for just then mrs jerry came in she was cloaked for the garden and he had to go with her sulkily at the door she observed that the ground was still wet  are you wearing your goloshes said he brightening you must get them mrs jerry i insist  she hesitated her room was on the third floor it is very good of you to be so thoughtful of me she said but  but i have no right to try to take care of you he interposed in a melancholy voice it is true let us go  i shant be two minutes said mrs jerry in a flutter and went off hastily for her goloshes while he looked fondly after her at the turn of the stair she glanced back and his eyes were still begging her to hurry it was a gracious memory to her in the after years for she never saw him again  as soon as she was gone he returned to the hall and taking from a peg a cloak with a mother goose hood brought it to lady pippinworth who had watched her mamma trip upstairs  did i say i was going out she asked  yes said tommy and she rose to let him put the elegant thing round her she was one of those dangerous women who look their best when you are helping them to put on their cloaks  now he instructed her pull the hood over your head  is it so cold as that she said obeying  i want you to wear it he answered what he meant was that she never looked quite so impudent as in her hood and his vanity insisted that she should be armed to the teeth before they resumed hostilities the red light was in his eyes as he drew her into the garden where grizel lay     chapter xxix  the red light   it was an evening without stars but fair sufficient wind to make her ladyship cling haughtily to his arm as they turned corners many of the visitors were in the garden some grouped round a quartet of gaily attired minstrels but more sitting in little arbours or prowling in search of an arbour to sit in the night was so dark that when our two passed beyond the light of the hotel windows they could scarce see the shrubs they brushed against cigars without faces behind them sauntered past several times they thought they had found an unoccupied arbour at last when they heard the clink of coffeecups  i believe the castle dates from the fifteenth century tommy would then say suddenly though it was not of castles he had been talking  with a certain satisfaction he noticed that she permitted him without comment to bring in the castle thus and to drop it the moment the emergency had passed but he had little other encouragement even when she pressed his arm it was only as an intimation that the castle was needed  i cant even make her angry he said wrathfully to himself  you answer not a word he said in great dejection to her  i am afraid to speak she admitted i dont know who may hear  alice he said eagerly what would you say if you were not afraid to speak  they had stopped and he thought she trembled a little on his arm but he could not be sure he thoughtbut he was thinking too much again at least lady pippinworth seemed to come to that conclusion for with a galling little laugh she moved on he saw with amazing clearness that he had thought sufficiently for one day  on coming into the garden with her and for some time afterwards he had been studying her so coolly watching symptoms rather than words that there is nothing to compare the man to but a doctor who while he is chatting has his finger on your pulse but he was not so calm now whether or not he had stirred the woman he was rapidly firing himself  when next he saw her face by the light of a window she at the same instant turned her eyes on him it was as if each wanted to know correctly how the other had been looking in the darkness and the effect was a challenge  like one retreating a step she lowered her eyes i am tired she said i shall go in  let us stroll round once more  no i am going in  if you are afraid he said with a slight smile  she took his arm again though it is too bad of me to keep you out she said as they went on for you are shivering is it the night air that makes you shiver she asked mockingly  but she shivered a little herself as if with a presentiment that she might be less defiant if he were less thoughtful for a month or more she had burned to teach him a lesson but there was a time before that when had she been sure he was in earnest she would have preferred to be the pupil  two ladies came out of an arbour where they had been drinking coffee and sauntered towards the hotel it was a tiny building half concealed in hops and reached by three steps and tommy and his companion took possession he groped in the darkness for a chair for her and invited her tenderly to sit down she said she preferred to stand she was by the open window her fingers drumming on the sill though he could not see her face he knew exactly how she was looking  sit down he said rather masterfully  i prefer to stand she repeated languidly  he had a passionate desire to take her by the shoulders but put his hand on hers instead and she permitted it like one disdainful but helpless she said something unimportant about the stillness  is it so still he said in a low voice i seem to hear a great noise i think it must be the beating of my heart  i fancy that is what it is she drawled  do you hear it  no  did you ever hear your own heart beat alice  no  he had both her hands now would you like to hear it  she pulled away her hands sharply yes she replied with defiance  but you pulled away your hands first said he  he heard her breathe heavily for a moment but she said nothing yes he said as if she had spoken it is true  what is true  what you are saying to yourself just nowthat you hate me  she beat the floor with her foot  how you hate me alice  oh no  yes indeed you do  i wonder why she said and she trembled a little  i know why he had come close to her again shall i tell you why  she said no hurriedly  i am so glad you say no he spoke passionately and yet there was banter in his voice or so it seemed to her it is because you fear to be told it is because you had hoped that i did not know  tell me why i hate you she cried  tell me first that you do  oh i do i do indeed she said the words in a white heat of hatred  before she could prevent him he had raised her hand to his lips  dear alice he said  why is it she demanded  listen he said listen to your heart alice it is beating now it is telling you why does it need an interpreter it is saying you hate me because you think i dont love you  dont you she asked fiercely  no tommy said  her hands were tearing each other and she could not trust herself to speak she sat down deadly pale in the chair he had offered her  no man ever loved you he said leaning over her with his hand on the back of the chair you are smiling at that i know but it is true lady disdain they may have vowed to blow their brains out and seldom did it they may have let you walk over them and they may have become your fetchandcarry for you were always able to drive them crazy but love does not bring men so low they tried hard to love you and it was not that they could not love it was that you were unlovable that is a terrible thing to a woman you think you let them try to love you that you might make them your slaves when they succeeded but you made them your slaves because they failed it is a power given to your cold and selfish nature in place of the capacity for being able to be loved with which women not a hundredth part as beautiful as you are dowered and you have a raging desire alice to exercise it over me as over the others but you cant  had he seen her face then it might have warned him to take care but he heard her words only and they were not at all in keeping with her face  i see i cant was what she cried almost in a whisper  it is all true alice is it not  i suppose so i dont know i dont care she swung round in her chair and caught his sleeve her hands clung to it say you love me now she said i cannot live without your love after this what shall i do to make you love me tell me and i will do it  he could not stop himself for he mistrusted her still  i will not be your slave he said through his teeth you shall be mine  yes yes  you shall submit to me in everything if i say come you shall come to wheresoever it may be and if i say stay and leave you for ever you shall stay  very well she said eagerly she would have her revenge when he was her slave  you can continue to be the haughty lady disdain to others but you shall be only obedient little alice to me  very well she drew his arm towards her and pressed her lips upon it and for that you will love me a little wont you you will love me at last wont you she entreated  he was a masterful man up to a certain point only her humility now tapped him in a new place and before he knew what he was about he began to run pity  to humiliate you so alice i am a dastard i am not such a dastard as you think me i wanted to know that you would be willing to do all these things but i would never have let you do them  i am willing to do them  no no it was he who had her hands now it was brutal but i did it for you alicefor you dont you see i was doing it only to make a woman of you you were always adorable but in a coat of mail that would let love neither in nor out i have been hammering at it to break it only and free my glorious alice we had to fight and one of us had to give in you would have flung me away if i had yieldedi had to win to save you  now i am lost indeed he was saying to himself even as it came rushing out of him and what appalled him most was that worse had probably still to come he was astride two horses and both were at the gallop he flung out his arms as if seeking for something to check him  as he did so she had started to her feet listening it seemed to her that there was someone near them  he flung out his arms for help and they fell upon lady pippinworth and went round her he drew her to him she could hear no breathing now but his  alice i love you for you are love itself it is you i have been chasing since first love rose like a bird at my feet i never had a passing fancy for any other woman i always knew that somewhere in the world there must be you and sometime this starless night and you for me you were hidden behind walls of ice no man had passed them i broke them down and love leaped to love and you lie here my beautiful love in the arms of its lover  he was in a frenzy of passion now he meant every word of it and her intention was to turn upon him presently and mock him this man with whom she had been playing oh the jeering things she had to say but she could not say them yet she would give her fool another momentso she thought but she was giving it to herself and as she delayed she was in danger of melting in his arms  what does the world look like to you my darling you are in it for the first time you were born but a moment ago it is dark that you may not be blinded before you have used your eyes these are your eyes dear eyes that do not yet know their purpose they are for looking at me little alice and mine are for looking into yours i cannot see you i have never seen the face of my loveoh my love come into the light that i may see your face  they did not move her head had fallen on his shoulder she was to give it but a moment and thenbut the moment had passed and still her hair pressed his cheek her eyes were closed he seemed to have found the way to woo her neither of them spoke suddenly they jumped apart lady pippinworth stole to the door they held their breath and listened  it was not so loud now but it was distinctly heard it had been heavy breathing and now she was trying to check it and half succeedingbut at the cost of little cries they both knew it was a woman and that she was in the arbour on the other side of the little table she must have been there when they came in  who is that  there was no answer to him save the checked breathing and another broken cry she moved and it helped him to see vaguely the outlines of a girl who seemed to be drawing back from him in terror he thought she was crouching now in the farthest corner  come away he said but lady pippinworth would not let him go they must know who this woman was he remembered that a matchstand usually lay on the tables of those arbours and groped until he found one  who are you  he struck a match they were those french matches that play an infernal interlude before beginning to burn while he waited he knew that she was begging him with her hands and with cries that were too little to be words not to turn its light on her but he did  then she ceased to cower the girlish dignity that had been hers so long came running back to her as she faced him there was even a crooked smile upon her face  illustration i woke up she said  i woke up she said as if the words had no meaning to herself but might have some to him  the match burned out before he spoke but his face was terrible grizel he said appalled and then as if the discovery was as awful to her as to him she uttered a cry of horror and sped out into the night he called her name again and sprang after her but the hand of another woman detained him  who is this girl lady pippinworth demanded fiercely but he did not answer he recoiled from her with a shudder that she was not likely to forget and hurried on all that night he searched for grizel in vain     chapter xxx  the little gods desert him   and all next day he searched like a man whose eyes would never close again she had not passed the night in any inn or village house of st gian of that he made certain by inquiries from door to door none of the guides had seen her though they are astir so late and so early patiently waiting at the hotel doors to be hired that there seems to be no night for themdarkness only that blots them out for a time as they stand waiting at all hours there is in st gian the tinkle of bells the clatter of hoofs the crack of a whip dust in retreat but no coachman brought him news the streets were thronged with other coachmen on foot looking into every face in quest of some person who wanted to return to the lowlands but none had looked into her face  within five minutes of the hotel she might have been on any of half a dozen roads he wandered or rushed along them all for a space and came back one of them was short and ended in the lake all through that long and beautiful day this miserable man found himself coming back to the road that ended in the lake  there were moments when he cried to himself that it was an apparition he had seen and heard he had avoided his friends all day of the englishspeaking people in st gian one only knew why he was distraught and she was the last he wished to speak to but more than once he nearly sought her to say partner in my shame what did you see what did you hear in the afternoon he had a letter from elspeth telling him how she was enjoying her holiday by the sea and mentioning that david was at that moment writing to grizel in thrums but was it then all a dream he cried nearly convinced for the first time and he went into the arbour saying determinedly that it was a dream and in the arbour standing primly in a corner was grizels umbrella he knew that umbrella so well he remembered once being by while she replaced one of its ribs so deftly that he seemed to be looking on at a surgical operation the old doctor had given it to her and that was why she would not let it grow old before she was old herself tommy opened it now with trembling hands and looked at the little bits of grizel on it the beautiful stitching with which she had coaxed the slits to close again the one patch so artful that she had clapped her hands over it and he fell on his knees and kissed these little bits of grizel and called her beloved and cried to his gods to give him one more chance  i woke up it was all that she had said it was grizels excuse for inconveniencing him she had said it apologetically and as if she did not quite know how she came to be there herself there was no look of reproach on her face while the match burned there had been a pitiful smile as if she was begging him not to be very angry with her and then when he said her name she gave that little cry as if she had recognized herself and stole away he lived that moment over and over again and she never seemed to be horrorstricken until he cried grizel when her recognition of herself made her scream it was as if she had wakened up dazed by the terrible things that were being said and then by the light of that one word grizel suddenly knew who had been listening to them  did he know anything more he pressed his hands harshly on his temples and thought he knew that she was soaking wet that she had probably sought the arbour for protection from the rain and that if so she had been there for at least four hours she had wakened up she must have fallen asleep knocked down by fatigue what fatigue it must have been to make grizel lie there for hours he could guess and he beat his brow in anguish but why she had come he could not guess oh miserable man to seek for reasons he cried passionately to himself when it is grizelgrizel herselfyou should be seeking for  he walked and ran the round of the lake and it was not on the bank that his staring eyes were fixed  at last he came for a moment upon her track the people of an inn six miles from st gian remembered being asked yesterday by an english miss walking alone how far she was from badplatten she was wearing something brown and her boots were white with dust and these people had never seen a lady look so tired before when she stood still she had to lean against the wall they said she had redhot eyes  tommy was in an einspänner now the merry conveyance of the country and more intoxicating than its wines and he drove back through st gian to badplatten where again he heard from grizel though he did not find her what he found was her telegram from london i am coming grizel why had she come why had she sent that telegram what had taken her to london he was not losing time when he asked himself distractedly these questions for he was again in his gay carriage and driving back to the wayside inn he spent the night there afraid to go farther lest he should pass her in the darkness for he had decided that if alive she was on this road that she had walked all those forty miles uphill seemed certain and apparently the best he could hope was that she was walking back she had probably no money to enable her to take the diligence perhaps she had no money with which to buy food it might be that while he lay tossing in bed she was somewhere near dying for want of a franc  he was off by morning light and several times that day he heard of her twice from people who had seen her pass both going and coming and he knew it must be she when they said she rocked her arms as she walked oh he knew why she rocked her arms once he thought he had found her he heard of an english lady who was lying ill in the house of a sawmiller whose dog we know the dogs of these regions but not the people had found her prostrate in the wood some distance from the highroad leaving his einspänner in a village tommy climbed down the mountainside to this little house which he was long in discovering it was by the side of a roaring river and he arrived only an hour too late the lady had certainly been grizel but she was gone the sawyers wife described to him how her husband had brought her in and how she seemed so tired and bewildered that she fell asleep while they were questioning her she held her hands over her ears to shut out the noise of the river which seemed to terrify her so far as they could understand she told them that she was running away from the river she had been sleeping there for three hours and was still asleep when the good woman went off to meet her husband but when they returned she was gone  he searched the wood for miles around crying her name the sawyer and some of his fellowworkers left the trees they were stripping of bark to help him and for hours the wood rang with grizel grizel all the mountains round took up the cry but there never came an answer this long delay prevented his reaching the railway terminus until noon of the following day and there he was again too late but she had been here he traced her to that hotel whence we saw her setting forth and the portier had got a ticket for her for london he had talked with her for some little time and advised her as she seemed so tired to remain there for the night but she said she must go home at once she seemed to be passionately desirous to go home and had looked at him suspiciously as if fearing he might try to hold her back he had been called away and on returning had seen her disappearing over the bridge he had called to her and then she ran as if afraid he was pursuing her but he had observed her afterwards in the train  so she was not without money and she was on her way home the relief it brought him came to the surface in great breaths and at first every one of them was a prayer of thankfulness yet in time they were triumphant breaths translated into words they said that he had got off cheaply for the hundredth time his little gods had saved him again as they had saved him in the arbour by sending grizel to him he could do as he liked for they were always there to succour him they would never desert himnever in a moment of fierce elation he raised his hat to them then seemed to see grizel crying i woke up and in horror of himself clapped it on again it was but a momentary aberration and is recorded only to show that however remorseful he felt afterwards there was life in our tommy still  the train by which he was to follow her did not leave until evening and through those long hours he was picturing with horrible vividness and pain the progress of grizel up and down that terrible pass often his shoulders shook in agony over what he saw and he shuddered to the teeth he would have walked round the world on his knees to save her this long anguish and then again it was less something he saw than something he was writing and he altered it to make it more dramatic i woke up how awful that was but in this new scene she uttered no words lady pippinworth was in his arms when they heard a little cry so faint that a violin string makes as much moan when it snaps in a dread silence he lit a match and as it flared the figure of a girl was seen upon the floor she was dead and even as he knew that she was dead he recognized her grizel he cried the other woman who had lured him from his true love uttered a piercing scream and ran towards the hotel when she returned with men and lanterns there was no one in the arbour but there were what had been a man and a girl they lay side by side the startled onlookers unbared their heads a solemn voice said in death not divided  he was not the only occupant of the hotel readingroom as he saw all this and when his head fell forward and he groaned the others looked up from their papers a lady asked if he was unwell  i have had a great shock he replied in a daze pulling his hand across his forehead  something you have seen in your paper inquired a clergyman who had been complaining that there was no news  people i knew said tommy not yet certain which world he was in  dead the lady asked sympathetically  i knew them well he said and staggered into the fresh air  poor dog of a tommy he had been a total abstainer from sentiment as one may say for sixty hours and this was his only glass it was the nobler tommy sternly facing facts who by and by stepped into the train he even knew why he was going to thrums he was going to say certain things to her and he said them to himself again and again in the train and heard her answer the words might vary but they were always to the same effect  grizel i have come back  he saw himself say these words as he opened her door in gavinias little house and when he had said them he bowed his head  at his sudden appearance she started up then she stood pale and firm  why have you come back  not to ask your forgiveness he replied hoarsely not to attempt to excuse myself not with any hope that there remains one drop of the love you once gave me so abundantly i want only grizel to put my life into your hands i have made a sorry mess of it myself will you take charge of what may be left of it you always said you were ready to help me i have come back grizel for your help what you were once willing to do for love will you do for pity now  she turned away her head and he went nearer her there was always something of the mother in your love grizel but for that you would never have borne with me so long a mother they say can never quite forget her boyoh grizel is it true i am the prodigal come back grizel beloved i have sinned and i am unworthy but i am still your boy and i have come back am i to be sent away  at the word beloved her arms rocked impulsively you must not call me that she said  then i am to go he answered with a shudder for i must always call you that whether i am with you or away you shall always be beloved to me  you dont love me she cried oh do you love me at last and at that he fell upon his knees  grizel my love my love  but you dont want to be married she said  beloved i have come back to ask you on my knees to be my wife  that woman  she was a married woman grizel  oh oh oh  and now you know the worst of me it is the whole truth at last i dont know why you took that terrible journey dear grizel but i do know that you were sent there to save me oh my love you have done so much will you do no more  and so on till there came a time when his head was on her lap and her hand caressing it and she was whispering to her boy to look up and see her crooked smile again  he passed on to the wedding all the time between seemed to be spent in his fond entreaties to hasten the longedfor day how radiant she looked in her bridal gown oh beautiful one are you really mine oh world pause for a moment and look at the woman who has given herself to me  my wifethis is my wife they were in london now he was showing her to london how he swaggered there was a perpetual apology on her face it begged people to excuse him for looking so proudly at her it was a crooked apology and he hurried her into dark places and kissed it  do you see that tommy was doing all this for grizel and pretending to her that it was for himself he was passionately desirous of making amends and he was to do it in the most generous way perhaps he believed when he seemed to enter her room saying grizel i have come back that she loved him still perhaps he knew that he did not love in the way he said perhaps he saw a remorseful man making splendid atonement but never should she know these things tenderly as he had begun he would go on to the end here at last is a tommy worth looking at and he looked  yet as he drew near thrums after almost exactly two days of continuous travel many a shiver went down his back for he could not be sure that he should find grizel here he sometimes seemed to see her lying ill at some wayside station in switzerland in france everything that could have happened to her he conceived and he moved restlessly in the carriage his mouth went dry  has she come back  the train had stopped for the taking of tickets and his tremulous question checked the joy of corp at sight of him  shes back corp answered in an excited whisper and oh the relief to tommy she came back by the afternoon train but i had scarce a word wi her she was so awid to be hame i am going home she cried and hurried away up the brae ay and theres one queer thing  what  her luggage wasna in the van  tommy could smile at that but what sent her he asked eagerly on that journey  corp told him the little he knew but nobody kens except me and gavinia he said we pretend she gaed to london to see her father we said he had wrote to her wanting her to go to him gavinia said it would never do to let folk ken she had gaen to see you and even elspeth doesna ken  is elspeth back  they came back yesterday  did david know the truth from grizel was what tommy was asking himself now as he strode up the brae but again he was in luck for when he had explained away his abrupt return to elspeth and been joyfully welcomed by her she told him that her husband had been in one of the glens all day he does not know that grizel has come back she said oh she exclaimed but you dont even know that she has been away grizel has been in london  corp told me said tommy  and did he tell you why she had gone  yes  she came back an hour or two ago maggy ann saw her go past fancy her seeing her father at last it must have been an ordeal for her i wonder what took place  i think i had better go and ask her tommy said he was mightily relieved for grizels sake no one need ever know now what had called her away except corp and gavinia and even they thought she had merely been to london how well the little gods were managing the whole affair as he walked to grizels lodgings to say what he had been saying in the train the thought came to him for a moment that as no one need ever know where she had been there was less reason why he should do this generous thing but he put it from him with lofty disdain any effect it had was to make him walk more firmly to his sacrifice as if to show all ignoble impulses that they could find no home in that swelling breast he was pleased with himself was tommy  grizel i have come back he said it to the night and bowed his head he said it with head accompaniment to grizels lighted window he said it to himself as he reached the door he never said it again  for gavinias first words were its you mr sandys wherever is she for mercys sake dinna say youve come without her and when he blinked at this she took him roughly by the arm and cried wherevers grizel  she is here gavinia  shes no here  i saw her light  you saw my light  gavinia you are torturing me she came back today  what makes you say that youre dreaming she hasna come back  corp saw her come in by the afternoon train he spoke to her  gavinia shook her head incredulously youre just imagining that she said  he told me gavinia i must see for myself she stared after him as he went up the stairs you are very cruel gavinia he said when he came down tell me where she is  may i be struck mr sandys if ive seen or heard o her since she left this house eight days syne he knew she was speaking the truth he had to lean against the door for support it canna be so bad as you think she cried in pity if youre sure corp said he saw her she maun hae gone to the doctors house  she is not there but elspeth knew she had come back others have seen her besides corp my god gavinia what can have happened  in little more than an hour he knew what had happened many besides himself david among them towards the end were engaged in the search and strange stories began to fly about like nightbirds you will not search for a missing woman without rousing them why had she gone off to london without telling anyone had corp concocted that story about her father to blind them had she really been as far as london have you seen sandyshes back its said corp telegraphed to him to switzerland that she had disappeared its weel kent corp telegraphed sandys came at once he is in a terrible state look how white he is aneath that lamp what garred them telegraph for him how is it he is in sic a state fond o her was he yea yea even after she gave him the goby then its a weary sabbath for him if half they say be true what do they say they say she was queer when she came back corp doesna say that maybe no but francie crabb does he says he met her on the station brae and spoke to her and she said never a word but put up her hands like as if she feared he was to strike her the dundas lassies saw her frae their window and her hands were at her ears as if she was trying to drown the sound o something do you mind o her mother they say she was looking terrible like her mother  it was only between the station and gavinias house that she had been seen but they searched far afield tommy accompanied by corp even sought for her in the den do you remember the long lonely path between two ragged little dykes that led from the den to the house of the painted lady it was there that grizel had lived with her mamma the two men went down that path which is oppressed with trees elsewhere the night was not dark but as they had known so well when they were boys it is always dark after evenfall in the double dykes that is the legacy of the painted lady presently they saw the housescarcely the house but a lighted window tommy remembered the night when as a boy elspeth crouching beside him he had peered in fearfully at that corner window on grizel and her mamma and the shuddersome things he had seen he shuddered at them again  who lives there now he asked  nobody its toom  there is a light  some goingabout body they often tak bilbie in toom houses and that door is without a lock its keepit close wi slipping a stick aneath it do you mind how feared we used to be at that house  she was never afraid of it  it was her hame  he meant no more than he said but suddenly they both stopped dead  its no possible corp said as if in answer to a question its no possible he repeated beseechingly  wait for me here corp  i would rather come wi you  wait here tommy said almost fiercely and he went on alone to that little window it had needed an effort to make him look in when he was here before and it needed a bigger effort now but he looked  what light there was came from the fire and whether she had gathered the logs or found them in the room no one ever knew a vagrant stated afterwards that he had been in the house some days before and left his matchbox in it  by this fire grizel was crouching she was comparatively tidy and neat again the dust was gone from her boots even how she had managed to do it no one knows but you remember how she loved to be neat her hands were extended to the blaze and she was busy talking to herself  his hand struck the window heavily and she looked up and saw him she nodded and put her finger to her lips as a sign that he must be cautious she had often in the long ago seen her mother signing thus to an imaginary face at the windowthe face of the man who never came  tommy went into the house and she was so pleased to see him that she quite simpered he put his arms round her and she lay there with a little giggle of contentment she was in a plot of heat  grizel oh my god he said why do you look at me in that way  she passed her hand across her eyes like one trying to think  i woke up she said at last corp appeared at the window now and she pointed to him in terror thus had she seen her mother point in the long ago at faces that came there to frighten her  grizel tommy entreated her you know who i am dont you  she said his name at once but her eyes were on the window they want to take me away she whispered  but you must come away grizel you must come home  this is home she said it is sweet  after much coaxing he prevailed upon her to leave with his arm round her and a terrible woe on his face he took her to the doctors house she had her hands over her ears all the way she thought the white river and the mountains and the villages and the crack of whips were marching with her still     chapter xxxi  the man with the greetin eyes   for many days she lay in a fever at the doctors house seeming sometimes to know where she was but more often not and night after night a man with a drawn face sat watching her they entreated they forced him to let them take his place but from his room he heard her moan or speak or he thought he heard her or he heard a terrible stillness and he stole back to listen they might send him away but when they opened the door he was there with his drawn face and often they were glad to see him for there were times when he alone could interpret her wild demands and soothe those staring eyes  once a scream startled the house someone had struck a match in the darkened chamber and she thought she was in an arbour in st gian they had to hold her in her bed by force at times she had such a long way to walk before night she said  she would struggle into a sitting posture and put her hands over her ears  her great desire was not to sleep i should wake up she explained fearfully  she took a dislike to elspeth and called her alice  these ravings they said to each other must have reference to what happened to her when she was away and as they thought he knew no more of her wanderings than they everyone marvelled at the intuition with which he read her thoughts it was he who guessed that the striking of matches somehow terrified her he who discovered that it was a horrid roaring river she thought she heard and he pretended he heard it too and persuaded her that if she lay very still it would run past nothing she said or did puzzled him he read the raving of her mind they declared admiringly as if he held the cipher to it  and the cipher is his love mrs mclean said with wet eyes in the excitement of those days elspeth talked much to her of tommys love for grizel and how she had refused him and it went round the town with embellishments it was generally believed now that she really had gone to london to see her father and that his heartless behaviour had unhinged her mind  by davids advice corp and gavinia did not contradict this story it was as good as another he told them and better than the truth  but what was the truth they asked greedily  oh that he is a noble fellow david replied grimly  they knew that but  he would tell them no more however though he knew all tommy had made full confession to the doctor even made himself out worse than he was as had to be his way when he was not making himself out better  and i am willing to proclaim it all from the marketplace he said hoarsely if that is your wish  i daresay you would almost enjoy doing that said david rather cruelly  i daresay i should tommy said with a gulp and went back to grizels side it was not you may be sure to screen him that david kept the secret it was because he knew what many would say of grizel if the nature of her journey were revealed he dared not tell elspeth even for think of the woe to her if she learned that it was her wonderful brother who had brought grizel to this pass the elspeths of this world always have some man to devote himself to them if the tommies pass away the davids spring up for my own part i think elspeth would have found some excuse for tommy he said so himself to the doctor for he wanted her to be told  or you would find the excuse for her in time david responded  very likely tommy said he was humble enough now you see david could say one thing only which would rouse him namely that grizel was not to die in this fever and for long it seemed impossible to say that  would you have her live if her mind remains affected he asked and tommy said firmly yes  you think i suppose that then you would have less for which to blame yourself  i suppose that is it but dont waste time on me gemmell when you have her life to save if you can  well her life was saved and tommys nursing had more to do with it than davids skill david admitted it the town talked of it i aye kent he would find a wy corp said though he had been among the most anxious he and aaron latta were the first admitted to see her when she was able once more to sit in a chair they had been told to ask her no questions she chatted pleasantly to them and they thought she was quite her old self they wondered to see tommy still so sadeyed to ailie she spoke freely of her illness though not of what had occasioned it and told her almost gleefully that david had promised to let her sew a little next week there was one thing only that surprised ailie grizel had said that as soon as she was a little stronger she was going home  does she mean to her fathers house ailie asked  this was what started the report that touched no doubt by her illness grizels unknown father had after all offered her a home they discovered however what grizel meant by home when one afternoon she escaped unseen from the doctors house and was found again at double dykes very indignant because someone had stolen the furniture  she seemed to know all her old friends except elspeth who was still alice to her seldom now did she put her hands over her ears or see horrible mountains marching with her she no longer remembered save once or twice when she woke up that she had ever been out of thrums to those who saw her casually she was grizelgone thin and pale and weak intellectually but still the grizel of old except for the fixed idea that double dykes was her home  you must not humour her in that delusion david said sternly to tommy when we cease to fight it we have abandoned hope  so the weapon he always had his hand on was taken from tommy for he would not abandon hope he fought gallantly it was always he who brought her back from double dykes she would not leave it with any other person but she came away with him  its because shes so fond o him corp said  but it was not it was because she feared him as all knew who saw them together they were seen together a great deal when she was able to go out driving seemed to bring back the mountains to her eyes so she walked and it was always with the help of tommys arm its a most pitiful sight the people said they pitied him even more than her for though she might be talking gaily to him and leaning heavily on him they could see that she mistrusted him at the end of a sweet smile she would give him an ugly furtive look  shes like a cat youve forced into your lap they said and it lies quiet there ready to jump the moment you let go your grip  they wondered would he never weary he never wearied day after day he was saying the same things to her and the end was always as the beginning they came back to her entreaty that she should be allowed to go home as certainly as they came back to the doctors house  it is a long time you know grizel since you lived at double dykesnot since you were a child  not since i was a child she said as if she quite understood  then you went to live with your dear kind doctor you remember what was his name  dr mcqueen i love him  but he died and he left you his house to live in it is your home grizel he would be so grieved if he thought you did not make it your home  it is my home she said proudly but when they returned to it she was loath to go in i want to go home she begged  one day he took her to her rooms in corps house thinking her old furniture would please her and that was the day when she rocked her arms joyously again but it was not the furniture that made her so happy it was corps baby  oh oh she cried in rapture and held out her arms and he ran into them for there was still one person in thrums who had no fear of grizel  it will be a damned shame corp said huskily if that woman never has no bairns o her ain  they watched her crooning over the child playing with him for a long time you could not have believed that she required to be watched she told him with hugs that she had come back to him at last it was her first admission that she knew she had been away and a wild hope came to tommy that along the road he could not take her she might be drawn by this little child  she discovered a rent in the childs pinafore and must mend it at once she ran upstairs as a matter of course to her workbox and brought down a needle and thread it was quite as if she was at home at last  but you dont live here now grizel tommy said when she drew back at his proposal that they should go away you live at the doctors house  do i gavinia she said beseechingly  is it here you want to bide corp asked and she nodded her head several times  it would be so much more convenient she said looking at the child  would you take her back gavinia tommy asked humbly if she continues to want it  gavinia did not answer  woman cried corp  im mortal wae for her gavinia said slowly but she needs to be waited on hand and foot  i would come and do the waiting on her hand and foot gavinia tommy said  and so it came about that a week afterwards grizel was reinstalled in her old rooms every morning when tommy came to see her she asked him icily how alice was she seemed to think that alice as she called her was his wife he always replied you mean elspeth and she assented but only it was obvious because she feared to contradict him to corp and gavinia she would still say passionately i want to go home and probably add fearfully dont tell him  yet though this was not home to her she seemed to be less unhappy here than in the doctors house and she found a great deal to do all her old skill in needlework came back to her and she sewed for the child such exquisite garments that she clapped her hands over them  one day tommy came with a white face and asked gavinia if she knew whether a small brown parcel had been among the things brought by grizel from the doctors house  it was in the box sent after me from switzerland he told her and contained papers  gavinia had seen no such package  she may have hidden it he said and they searched but fruitlessly he questioned grizel gently but questions alarmed her and he desisted  it does not matter gavinia he said with a ghastly smile but on the following sunday when corp called at the doctors house the thought have they found it leaped in front of all thought of grizel this was only for the time it takes to ask a question with the eyes however for corp was looking very miserable  im sweer to say it he announced to tommy and david but it has to be said we canna keep her  evidently something had happened and tommy rose to go to grizel without even asking what it was wait david said wrinkling his eyebrows till corp tells us what he means by that i knew it might come corp go on  if it hadna been for the bairn said corp we would hae tholed wi her however queer she was but wi the bairn i tell you its no mous youll hae to tak her awa  whatever she has been to others tommy said she is always an angel with the child his own mother could not be fonder of him  thats it corp replied emphatically shes no the mother o him but theres whiles when she thinks she is we kept it frae you as long as we could  as long as she is so good to him david began  but at thae times shes not said corp she begins to shiver most terrible as if she saw fearsome things in her mind and syne we see her looking at him like as if she wanted to do him a mischief she says hes her brat she thinks hes hers and that he hasna been well come by  tommys hands rose in agony and then he covered his face with them  go on corp david said hoarsely we must have it all  sometimes corp went on painfully she canna help being fond o him though she thinks she shouldna hae had him ive heard her saying my brat and syne birsing him closer to her as though her shame just made him mair to her women are so queer about thae things ive seen her sitting by his cradle moaning to hersel i did so want to be good it would be sweet to be good and never stopping rocking the cradle and a the time the tears were rolling down  tommy cried if there is any more to tell corp be quick  theres what i come here to tell you it was no langer syne than jimply an hour we thocht the bairn was playing at the gavleend and that grizel was up the stair but they werena and i gaed straight to double dykes she wasna there but the bairn was lying greetin on the floor we found her in the den sitting by the burnside and she said we should never see him again for she had drowned him were sweer but youll need to tak her awa  we shall take her away david said and when he and tommy were left together he asked do you see what it means  it means that the horrors of her early days have come back to her and that she is confusing her mother with herself  davids hands were clenched that is not what i am thinking of we have to take her away they have done far more than we had any right to ask of them sandys where are we to take her to  do even you grow tired of her tommy cried  david said between his teeth we hope there will soon be a child in this house also god forgive me but i cannot bring her back here  she cannot be in a house where there is a child said tommy with a bitter laugh gemmell it is grizel we are speaking of do you remember what she was  i remember  well where are we to send her  david turned his pained eyes full on tommy  no tommy cried vehemently  sandys said david firmly that is what it has come to they will take good care of her he sat down with a groan have done with heroics he said savagely when tommy would have spoken i have been prepared for this there is no other way  i have been prepared for it too tommy said controlling himself but there is another way i can marry her and i am going to do it  i dont know that i can countenance that david said after a pause it seems an infernal shame  dont trouble about me replied tommy hoarsely i shall do it willingly  and then it was the doctors turn to laugh you he said with a terrible scorn as he looked tommy up and down i was not thinking of you all my thoughts were of her i was thinking how cruel to her if some day she came to her right mind and found herself tied for life to the man who had brought her to this pass  tommy winced and walked up and down  desire to marry her gone asked david savagely  no tommy said he sat down you have the key to me gemmell he went on quietly i gave it to you you know i am a man of sentiment only but you are without a scrap of it yourself and so you will never quite know what it is it has its good points we are a kindly people i was perhaps pluming myself on having made an heroic proposal and though you have made me see it just now as you see it as you see it i shall probably soon be putting on the same grand airs again lately i discovered that the children who see me with grizel call me the man with the greetin eyes if i have greetin eyes it was real grief that gave them to me but when i heard what i was called it made me selfconscious and i have tried to look still more lugubrious ever since it seems monstrous to you but that i believe is the kind of thing i shall always be doing but it does not mean that i feel no real remorse they were greetin eyes before i knew it and though i may pose grotesquely as a fine fellow for finding grizel a home where there is no child and can never be a child i shall not cease night nor day from tending her it will be a grim business gemmell as you know and if i am sentimental tommy through it all why grudge me my comic little strut  david said you cant take her to london  i shall take her to wherever she wants to go  there is one place only she wants to go to and that is double dykes  i am prepared to take her there  and your work  it must take second place now i must write it is the only thing i can do if i could make a living at anything else i would give up writing altogether  why  she would be pleased if she could understand and writing is the joy of my lifetwo reasons  but the doctor smiled  you are right said tommy i see i was really thinking what a fine picture of selfsacrifice i should make sitting in double dykes at a loom  they talked of ways and means and he had to admit that he had little money but the new book would bring in a good deal david supposed  the manuscript is lost tommy replied crushing down his agitation  lost when where  i dont know it was in the bag i left behind at st gian and i supposed it was still in it when the bag was forwarded to me here i did not look for more than a month i took credit to myself for neglecting my manuscript and when at last i looked it was not there i telegraphed and wrote to the innkeeper at st gian and he replied that my things had been packed at his request in presence of my friends there the two ladies you know of i wrote to them and they replied that this was so and said they thought they remembered seeing in the bottom of the bag some such parcel in brown paper as i described but it is not there now and i have given up all hope of ever seeing it again no i have no other copy every page was written half a dozen times but i kept the final copy only  it is scarcely a thing anyone would steal  no i suppose they took it out of the bag at st gian and forgot to pack it again it was probably flung away as of no account  could it have been taken out on the way here  the key was tied to the handle so that the custom officials might be able to open the bag perhaps they are fonder of english manuscripts than one would expect or more careless of them  you can think of no other way in which it might have disappeared  none tommy said and then the doctor faced him squarely  are you trying to screen grizel he asked is it true what people are saying  what are they saying  that she destroyed it i heard that yesterday and told them your manuscript was in my house as i thought it was was it she  no no gavinia must have started that story i did look for the package among grizels things  what made you think of that  i had seen her looking into my bag one day and she used to say i loved my manuscripts too much ever to love her but i am sure she did not do it  be truthful sandys you know how she always loved the truth  well then i suppose it was she  after a pause the doctor said it must be about as bad as having a limb lopped off  if only i had been offered that alternative tommy replied  and yet david mused better pleased with him you have not cried out  have i not i have rolled about in agony and invoked the gods and cursed and whimpered only i take care that no one shall see me  and that no one should know poor grizel had done this thing i admire you for that sandys  but it has leaked out you see tommy said and they will all be admiring me for it at the wedding and no doubt i shall be cocking my greetin eyes at them to note how much they are admiring  but when the weddingday came he was not doing that while he and grizel stood up before mr dishart in the doctors parlour he was thinking of her only his eyes never left her not even when he had to reply i do his hand pressed hers all the time he kept giving her reassuring little nods and smiles and it was thus that he helped grizel through  had mr dishart understood what was in her mind he would not have married them to her it was no real marriage she thought they were tricking the minister so that she should be able to go home they had rehearsed the ceremony together many times and oh she was eager to make no mistake  if they were to find out she would say apprehensively and then perhaps giggle at the slyness of it all tommy had to make merry with her as if it was one of his boyish plays if he was overcome with the pain of it she sobbed at once and wrung her hands  she was married in gray silk she had made the dress herself as beautifully as all her things were made tommy remembered how once long ago she had told him as a most exquisite secret that she had decided on gray silk  corp and gavinia and ailie and aaron latta were the only persons asked to the wedding and when it was over they said they never saw anyone stand up by a womans side looking so anxious to be her man and i am sure that in this they did tommy no more than justice  it was a sad day to elspeth could she be expected to smile while her noble brother did this great deed of sacrifice but she bore up bravely partly for his sake partly for the sake of one unborn  the ring was no plain hoop of gold it was garnets all the way round she had seen it on elspeths finger and craved it so greedily that it became her weddingring and from the moment she had it she ceased to dislike elspeth and pitied her very much as if she thought happiness went with the ring poor alice she said when she saw elspeth crying at the wedding and having started to go away with tommy she came back to say again poor poor alice  corp flung an old shoe after them     chapter xxxii  tommys best work   and thus was begun a year and a half of as great devotion as remorseful man ever gave to woman when she was asleep and he could not write his mind would sometimes roam after abandoned things it sought them in the night as a savage beast steals forth for water to slake the thirst of many days but if she stirred in her sleep they were all dispelled there was not a moment in that eighteen months when he was twenty yards from grizels side  he would not let himself lose hope all the others lost it the only thing you can do is to humour her even david was reduced in time to saying but tommy replied cheerily not a bit of it every morning he had to begin at the same place as on the previous morning and he was always as ready to do it and as patient as if this were the first time  i think she is a little more herself today he would say determinedly till david wondered to hear him  she makes no progress sandys  i can at least keep her from slipping back  and he did and there is no doubt that this was what saved grizel in the end how he strove to prevent her slipping back the morning was the time when she was least troubled and had he humoured her then they would often have been easy hours for him but it was the time when he tried most doggedly with a gentleness she could not ruffle to teach her the alphabet of who she was she coaxed him to let her off those mental struggles she turned petulant and sulky she was willing to be good and sweet if he would permit her to sew or to sing to herself instead or to sit staring at the fire but he would not yield he promised those things as the reward and in the end she stood before him like a child at lessons  what is your name the catechism always began thus  grizel she said obediently if it was a day when she wanted to please him  and my name  tommy once to his great delight she said sentimental tommy he quite bragged about this to david  where is your home  here she was never in doubt about this and it was always a pleasure to her to say it  did you live here long ago  she nodded  and then did you live for a long time somewhere else  yes  where was it  here  no it was with the old doctor you were his little housekeeper dont you remember try to remember grizel he loved you so much  she tried to think her face was very painful when she tried to think it hurts she said  do you remember him grizel  please let me sing she begged such a sweet song  do you remember the old doctor who called you his little housekeeper he used to sit in that chair  the old chair was among grizels many possessions that had been brought to double dykes and her face lit up with recollection she ran to the chair and kissed it  what was his name grizel  i should love to know his name she said wistfully  he told her the name many times and she repeated it docilely  or perhaps she remembered her dear doctor quite well today and thought tommy was some one in need of his services  he has gone into the country she said as she had so often said to anxious people at the door but he wont be long and i shall give him your message the moment he comes in  but tommy would not pass that he explained to her again and again that the doctor was dead and perhaps she would remember or perhaps without remembering she said she was glad he was dead  why are you glad grizel  she whispered as if frightened she might be overheard i dont want him to see me like this it was one of the pathetic things about her that she seemed at times to have some vague understanding of her condition and then she would sob her tears were anguish to him but it was at those times that she clung to him as if she knew he was trying to do something for her and that encouraged him to go on he went over step by step the time when she lived alone in the doctors house the time of his own coming back her love for him and his treatment of her the story of the garnet ring her coming to switzerland her terrible walk her return he would miss out nothing for he was fighting for her day after day month by month it went on and tomorrow perhaps she would insist that the old doctor and this man who asked her so many questions were one and tommy argued with her until he had driven that notion out to make way for another and then he fought it and so on and on all round the circle of her delusions day by day and month by month  she knew that he sometimes wrote while she was asleep for she might start up from her bed or from the sofa and there he was laying down his pen to come to her her eyes were never open for any large fraction of a minute without his knowing and immediately he went to her nodding and smiling lest she had wakened with some fear upon her perhaps she refused to sleep again unless he promised to put away those horrid papers for the night and however intoxicating a point he had reached in his labours he always promised and kept his word he was most scrupulous in keeping any promise he made her and one great result was that she trusted him implicitly whatever others promised she doubted them  there were times when she seemed to be casting about in her mind for something to do that would please him and then she would bring pieces of paper to him and pen and ink and tell him to write she thought this very clever of her and expected to be praised for it  but she might also bring him writing materials at times when she hated him very much then there would be sly smiles even pretended affection on her face unless she thought he was not looking when she cast him ugly glances her intention was to trick him into forgetting her so that she might talk to herself or slip out of the room to the den just as her mother had done in the days when it was grizel who had to be tricked he would not let her talk to herself until he had tried endless ways of exorcising that demon by interesting her in some sort of work by going out with her by talking of one thing and another till at last a subject was lit upon that made her forget to brood  but sometimes it seemed best to let her go to the den she was in such a quiver of desire to go she hurried to it so that he had to stride to keep up with her and he said little until they got there for she was too excited to listen she was very like her mother again but it was not the man who never came that she went in search ofit was a lost child i have not the heart to tell of the pitiful scenes in the den while grizel searched for her child they always ended in those two walking silently home and for a day or two grizel would be ill and tommy tended her so that she was soon able to hasten to the den again holding out her arms as she ran  she makes no progress david said  i can keep her from slipping back tommy still replied the doctor marvelled but even he did not know the half of all her husband did for grizel none could know half who was not there by night here at least was one day ending placidly they might say when she was in a tractable moodso tractable that she seemed to be one of themselvesand tommy assented brightly though he knew and he alone that you could never be sure the long day had ended till the next began  often the happiest beginning had the most painful ending the greatest pleasure he could give her was to take her to see elspeths baby girl or that sturdy rogue young shiach who could now count with ease up to seven but swayed at eight and toppled over on his way to ten or their mothers brought them to her and grizel understood quite well who her visitors were sometimes even called elspeth by her right name and did the honours of her house irreproachably and presided at the teatable and was rapture personified when she held the baby jean called after tommys mother and sat gaily on the floor ready to catch little corp when he would not stop at seven but tommy whom nothing escaped knew with what depression she might pay for her joy when they had gone despite all his efforts she might sit talking to herself at first of pleasant things and then of things less pleasant or she stared at her reflection in the long mirror and said isnt she sweet or she is not really sweet and she did so want to be good or instead of that she would suddenly go upon her knees and say with clasped hands the childish prayer save me from masterful men which jean myles had told tommy to teach elspeth no one could have looked less masterful at those times than tommy but grizel did not seem to think so and probably they had that night once more to search the den  the children do her harm she must not see them again he decided  they give her pleasure at the time david said it lightens your task now and then  it is the future i am thinking of gemmell if she cannot progress she shall not fall back as for me never mind me  elspeth is in a sad state about you though and you can get through so little work  enough for all our wants he was writing magazine papers only  the public will forget you  they have forgotten me  david was openly sorry for him now if only your manuscript had been saved  yes i never thought the little gods would treat me so scurvily as that  who  did i never tell you of my little gods i so often emerged triumphant from my troubles and so undeservedly that i thought i was especially looked after by certain tricky spirits in return for the entertainment i gave them my little gods i called them and we had quite a bowing acquaintance but you see at the critical moment they flew away laughing  he always knew that the lost manuscript was his great work my seventh wave he called it and though all the conditions were favourable he said i know that i could run to nothing more than little waves at present as for rewriting that book i cant i have tried  yet he was not asking for commiseration tell elspeth not to worry about me if i have no big ideas just now i have some very passable little ones and one in particular that he drew a great breath if only grizel were better that breath said i think tommy sandys could find a way of making the public remember him again  so david interpreted it and though he had been about to say how changed you are he did not say it  and tommy who had been keeping an eye on her all this time returned to grizel as she had been through that long year so she was during the first half of the next and day by day and night by night he tended her and still the same scenes were enacted in infinite variety and still he would not give in everything seemed to change with the seasons except grizel and tommys devotion to her  yet you know that she recovered ever afterwards to be herself again and though it seemed to come in the end as suddenly as the sight may be restored by the removal of a bandage i suppose it had been going on all the time and that her reason was given back to her on the day she had strength to make use of it tommy was the instrument of her recovery he had fought against her slipping backward so that she could not do it it was as if he had built a wall behind her and in time her mind accepted that wall as impregnable and took a forward movement and with every step she took he pushed the wall after her so that still if she moved it must be forward thus grizel progressed imperceptibly as along a dark corridor towards the door that shut out the light and on a day in early spring the door fell  many of them had cried for a shock as her only chance but it came most quietly she had lain down on the sofa that afternoon to rest and when she woke she was grizel again at first she was not surprised to find herself in that room nor to see that man nodding and smiling reassuringly they had come out of the long dream with her to make the awakening less abrupt  he did not know what had happened when he knew a terror that this could not last seized him he was concealing it while he answered her puzzled questions all the time he was telling her how they came to be there he was watching in agony for the change  she remembered everything up to her return to thrums then she walked into a mist  the truth she begged of him when he would have led her off by pretending that she had been ill only surely it was the real grizel who begged for the truth she took his hand and held it when he told her of their marriage she cried softly because she feared that she might again become as she had been but he said that was impossible and smiled confidently and all the time he was watching in agony for the change  do you forgive me grizel i have always had a dread that when you recovered you would cease to care for me he knew that this would please her if she was the real grizel and he was so anxious to make her happy for evermore  she put his hand to her lips and smiled at him through her tears hers was a love that could never change suddenly she sat up whose baby was it she asked  i dont know what you mean grizel he said uneasily  i remember vaguely she told him a baby in white whom i seemed to chase but i could never catch her was it a dream only  you are thinking of elspeths little girl perhaps she was often brought to see you  has elspeth a baby she rose to go exultantly to elspeth  but too small a baby grizel to run from you even if she wanted to  what is she like  she is always laughing  the sweet grizel rocked her arms in rapture and smiled her crooked smile at the thought of a child who was always laughing but i dont remember her she said it was a sad little baby i seemed to see     chapter xxxiii  the little gods return with a lady   grizels clear searching eyes that were always asking for the truth came back to her and i seem to see them on me now watching lest i shirk the end  thus i can make no pretence to please you that it was a new tommy at last we have seen how he gave his life to her during those eighteen months but he could not make himself anew they say we can do it so i suppose he did not try hard enough but god knows how hard he tried  he went on trying in those first days she sometimes asked him did you do it out of love or was it pity only and he always said it was love he said it adoringly he told her all that love meant to him and it meant everything that he thought grizel would like it to mean when she ceased to ask this question he thought it was because he had convinced her  they had a honeymoon by the sea he insisted upon it with boyish eagerness and as they walked on the links or sat in their room he would exclaim ecstatically how happy i am i wonder if there were ever two people quite so happy as you and i  and if he waited for an answer as he usually did she might smile lightly and say few people have gone through so much  is there any woman in the world grizel with whom you would change places  no none she said at once and when he was sure of it but never until he was sure he would give his mind a little holiday and then perhaps those candid eyes would rest searchingly upon him but always with a brave smile ready should he chance to look up  and it was just the same when they returned to double dykes which they added to and turned into a comfortable hometommy trying to become a lover by taking thought and grizel not letting on that it could not be done in that way she thought it was very sweet of him to try so hardsweeter of him than if he really had loved her though not of course quite so sweet to her he was a boy only she knew that despite all he had gone through he was still a boy and boys cannot love oh who would be so cruel as to ask a boy to love  that grizels honeymoon should never end was his grand ambition and he took elaborate precautions against becoming a matteroffact husband every morning he ordered himself to gaze at her with rapture as if he had wakened to the glorious thought that she was his wife  i cant help it grizel it comes to me every morning with the same shock of delight and i begin the day with a song of joy you make the world as fresh and interesting to me as if i had just broken like a chicken through the egg shell he rose at the earliest hours so that i can have the longer day with you he said gaily  if when sitting at his work he forgot her for an hour or two he reproached himself for it afterwards and next day he was more careful grizel he would cry suddenly flinging down his pen you are my wife do you hear me madam you hear and yet you can sit there calmly darning socks excuse me he would say to his work while i do a dance  he rose impulsively and brought his papers nearer her with a table between them she was several feet away from him which was more he said than he could endure  sit down for a moment grizel and let me look at you i want to write something most splendiferous today and i am sure to find it in your face i have ceased to be an original writer all the purple patches are cribbed from you  he made a point of taking her head in his hands and looking long at her with thoughts too deep for utterance then he would fall on his knees and kiss the hem of her dress and so back to his book again  and in time it was all sweet to grizel she could not be deceived but she loved to see him playing so kind a part and after some sadness to which she could not help giving way she put all vain longings aside she folded them up and put them away like the beautiful linen so that she might see more clearly what was left to her and how best to turn it to account  he did not love her not as i love him she said to herselfnot as married people ought to love but in the other way he loves me dearly by the other way she meant that he loved her as he loved elspeth and loved them both just as he had loved them when all three played in the den  he would love me if he could she was certain of that she decided that love does not come to all people as is the common notion that there are some who cannot fall in love and that he was one of them he was complete in himself she decided  is it a pity for him that he married me it would be a pity if he could love some other woman but i am sure he could never do that if he could love anyone it would be me we both want it so much he does not need a wife but he needs someone to take care of himall men need that and i can do it much better than any other person had he not married me he never would have married but he may fall ill and then how useful i shall be to him he will grow old and perhaps it wont be quite so lonely to him when i am there it would have been a pity for him to marry me if i had been a foolish woman who asked for more love than he can give but i shall never do that so i think it is not a pity  is it a pity for me oh no no no  is he sorry he did it at times is he just a weeny bit sorry she watched him and decided rightly that he was not sorry the weeniest bit it was a sweet consolation to her is he really happy yes of course he is happy when he is writing but is he quite contented at other times i do honestly think he is and if he is happy now how much happier i shall be able to make him when i have put away all my selfish thoughts and think only of him  the most exquisite thing in human life is to be married to one who loves you as you love him there could be no doubt of that but she saw also that the next best thing was the kind of love this boy gave to her and she would always be grateful for the second best in her prayers she thanked god for giving it to her and promised him to try to merit it and all day and every day she kept her promise there could not have been a brighter or more energetic wife than grizel the amount of work she found to do in that small house which his devotion had made so dear to her that she could not leave it her gaiety her masterful airs when he wanted something that was not good for him the artfulness with which she sought to help him in various matters without his knowing her satisfaction when he caught her at it as clever tommy was constantly doing what a success it has turned out david would say delightedly to himself and grizel was almost as jubilant because it was so far from being a failure it was only sometimes in the night that she lay very still with little wells of water on her eyes and through them saw onethe dream of womanwhom she feared could never be hers that boy tommy never knew why she did not want to have a child he thought that for the present she was afraid but the reason was that she believed it would be wicked when he did not love her as she loved him she could not be sureshe had to think it all out for herself with little wells of sadness on her eyes she prayed in the still night to god to tell her but she could never hear his answer  she no longer sought to teach tommy how he should write that quaint desire was abandoned from the day when she learned that she had destroyed his greatest work she had not destroyed it as we shall see but she presumed she had as tommy thought so he had tried to conceal this from her to save her pain but she had found it out and it seemed to grizel grown distrustful of herself that the man who could bear such a loss as he had borne it was best left to write as he chose  it was not that i did not love your books she said but that i loved you more and i thought they did you harm  in the days when i had wings he answered and she smiled any feathers left do you think grizel he asked jocularly and turned his shoulders to her for examination  a great many sir she said and i am glad i used to want to pull them all out but now i like to know that they are still there for it means that you remain among the facts not because you cant fly but because you wont  i still have my little fights with myself he blurted out boyishly though it was a thing he had never meant to tell her and grizel pressed his hand for telling her what she already knew so well  the new book of course was the wandering child i wonder whether any of you read it now your fathers and mothers thought a great deal of that slim volume but it would make little stir in an age in which all the authors are trying who can say damn loudest it is but a reverie about a child who is lost and his parents search for him in terror of what may have befallen but they find him in a wood singing joyfully to himself because he is free and he fears to be caged again so runs farther from them into the wood and is running still singing to himself because he is free free free that is really all but t sandys knew how to tell it the moment he conceived the idea we have seen him speaking of it to the doctor he knew that it was the idea for him he forgot at once that he did not really care for children he said reverently to himself i can pull it off and as was always the way with him the better he pulled it off the more he seemed to love them  it is myself who is writing at last grizel he said as he read it to her  she thought and you can guess whether she was right that it was the book he loved rather than the children she thought and you can guess again that it was not his ideas about children that had got into the book but hers but she did not say so she said it was the sweetest of his books to her  i have heard of another reading he gave this was after the publication of the book he had gone into corps house one sunday and gavinia was there reading the work to her lord and master while little corp disported on the floor she read as if all the words meant the same thing and it was more than tommy could endure he read for her and his eyes grew moist as he read for it was the most exquisite of his chapters about the lost child you would have said that no one loved children quite so much as t sandys but little corp would not keep quiet and suddenly tommy jumped up and boxed his ears he then proceeded with the reading while gavinia glowered and corp senior scratched his head  on the way home he saw what had happened and laughed at the humour of it then grew depressed then laughed recklessly is it sentimental tommy still he said to himself with a groan seldom a week passed without his being reminded in some such sudden way that it was sentimental tommy still but she shall never know he vowed and he continued to be half a hero  his name was once more in many mouths come back and be made of more than ever cried that society which he had once enlivened come and hear the pretty things we are saying about you come and make the prettier replies that are already on the tip of your tongue for oh tommy you know they are bring her with you if you must but dont you think that the nice quiet country with the thingumbobs all in bloom would suit her best it is essential that you should run up to see your publisher is it not the men have dinners for you if you want them but we know you dont your yearning eyes are on the ladies tommy we are making up theatreparties of the old entrancing kind you should see our new gowns please come back and help us to put on our cloaks tommy there is a dance on mondaycome and sit it out with us do you remember the gardenparty where you saidwell the laurel walk is still there the beauties of two years ago are still here and there are new beauties and their noses are slightly tilted but no man can move them ha do you pull yourself together at that we were always the reward for your labours tommy your books are move one in the game of making love to us dont be afraid that we shall forget it is a game we know it is and that is why we suit you come and play in london as you used to play in the den it is all you need of women come and have your fill and we shall send you back refreshed we are not asking you to be disloyal to her only to leave her happy and contented and take a holiday  illustration he heard their seductive voices they danced around him in numbers  he heard their seductive voices they danced around him in numbers for they knew that the more there were of them the better he would be pleased they whispered in his ear and then ran away looking over their shoulders but he would not budge  there was one more dangerous than the rest her he saw before the others came and after they had gone she was a tall incredibly slight woman with eyelashes that needed help and a most disdainful mouth and nose and she seemed to look scornfully at tommy and then stand waiting he was in two minds about what she was waiting for and often he had a fierce desire to go to london to find out but he never went he played the lover to grizel as beforenot to intoxicate himself but always to make life sunnier to her if she stayed longer with elspeth than the promised time he became anxious and went in search of her i have not been away an hour she said laughing at him holding little jean up to laugh at him but i cannot do without you for an hour he answered ardently he still laid down his pen to gaze with rapture at her and cry my wife  she wanted him to go to london for a change and without her and his heart leaped into his mouth to prevent his saying no yet he said it though in the tommy way  without you he exclaimed oh grizel do you think i could find happiness apart from you for a day and could you let me go and he looked with agonized reproach at her and sat down clutching his head  it would be very hard to me she said softly but if the change did you good  a change from you oh grizel grizel  or i could go with you  when you dont want to go he cried huskily you think i could ask it of you  he quite broke down and she had to comfort him she was smiling divinely at him all the time as if sympathy had brought her to love even the tommy way of saying things i thought it would be sweet to you to see how great my faith in you is now she said  this was the true reason why generous grizel had proposed to him to go she knew he was more afraid than she of sentimental tommy and she thought her faith would be a helping hand to him as it was  he had no regard for lady pippinworth of all the women he had dallied with she was the one he liked the least for he never liked where he could not esteem perhaps she had some good in her but the good in her had never appealed to him and he knew it and refused to harbour her in his thoughts now he cast her out determinedly when she seemed to enter them unbidden but still he was vain she came disdainfully and stood waiting we have seen him wondering what she waited for but though he could not be sure and so was drawn to her he took it as acknowledgment of his prowess and so was helped to run away  to walk away would be the more exact term for his favourite method of exorcising this lady was to rise from his chair and take a long walk with grizel occasionally if she was occupied and a number of duties our busy grizel found to hand he walked alone and he would not let himself brood someone had once walked from thrums to the top of the law and back in three hours and tommy made several gamesome attempts to beat the record setting out to escape that willowy woman soon walking her down and returning in a glow of animal spirits it was on one of these occasions when there was nothing in his head but ambition to do the fifth mile within the eleven minutes that he suddenly met her ladyship face to face  we have now come to the last fortnight of tommys life     chapter xxxiv  a way is found for tommy   the moment for which he had tried to prepare himself was come and tommy gulped down his courage which had risen suddenly to his mouth leaving his chest in a panic outwardly he seemed unmoved but within he was beating to arms this is the test of us all that was good in him cried as it answered his summons  they began by shaking hands as is always the custom in the ring then without any preliminary sparring lady pippinworth immediately knocked him down that is to say she remarked with a little laugh how very stout you are getting  i swear by all the gods that it was untrue he had not got very stout though undeniably he had got stouter how well you are looking would have been a very ladylike way of saying it but his girth was best not referred to at all those who liked him had learned this long ago and grizel always shifted the buttons without comment  her malicious ladyship had found his one weak spot at once he had a reply ready for every other opening in the english tongue but now he could writhe only  who would have expected to meet her here he said at last feebly she explained and he had guessed it already that she was again staying with the rintouls the castle indeed was not half a mile from where they stood  but i think i really came to see you she informed him with engaging frankness  it was very good of her he intimated stiffly but the stiffness was chiefly because she was still looking in an irritating way at his waist  suddenly she looked up to tommy it was as if she had raised the siege why arent you nice to me she asked prettily  i want to be he replied  she showed him a way when i saw you steaming towards the castle so swiftly she said dropping badinage the hope entered my head that you had heard of my arrival  she had come a step nearer and it was like an invitation to return to the arbour this is the test of us all that was good in tommy cried once more to him  no i had not heard he replied bravely if baldly i was taking a smart walk only  why so smart as that  he hesitated and her eyes left his face and travelled downward  were you trying to walk it off she asked sympathetically  he was stung and replied in words that were regretted as soon as spoken i was trying to walk you off  a smile of satisfaction crossed her impudent face  i succeeded he added sharply  how cruel of you to say so when you had made me so very happy do you often take smart walks mr sandys  often  and always with me  i leave you behind  with mrs sandys  had she seemed to be in the least affected by their meeting it would have been easy to him to be a contrite man at once any sign of shame on her part would have filled him with desire to take all the blame upon himself had she cut him dead he would have begun to respect her but she smiled disdainfully only and stood waking she was still as ever a cold passion inviting his warm ones to leap at it he shuddered a little but controlled himself and did not answer her  i suppose she is the lady of the arbour lady pippinworth inquired with mild interest  she is the lady of my heart tommy replied valiantly  alas said lady pippinworth putting her hand over her own  but he felt himself more secure now and could even smile at the woman for thinking she was able to provoke him  look upon me she requested as a deputation sent north to discover why you have gone into hiding  i suppose a country life does seem exile to you he replied calmly and suddenly his bosom rose with pride in what was coming tommy always heard his finest things coming a moment before they came if i have retired he went on windily from the insincerities and glitter of life in townbut it was not his face she was looking at it was his waistthe reason is obvious he rapped out  she nodded assent without raising her eyes  yet he still controlled himself his waist like some fair tortured lady of romance was calling to his knighthood for defence but with the truer courage he affected not to hear i am in hiding as you call it he said doggedly because my life here is such a round of happiness as i never hoped to find on earth and i owe it all to my wife if you dont believe me ask lord or lady rintoul or any other person in this countryside who knows her  but her ladyship had already asked and been annoyed by the answer  she assured tommy that she believed he was happy i have often heard she said musingly that the stout people are the happiest  i am not so stout he barked  now i call that brave of you said she admiringly that is so much the wisest way to take it and i am sure you are right not to return to town after what you were it would be a pity somehow itand again her eyes were on the wrong placeit does not seem to go with the books and yet she said philosophically i daresay you feel just the same  i feel very much the same he replied warningly  that is the tragedy of it said she  she told him that the new book had brought the tommy society to life again and it could not hold its meetings with the old enthusiasm could it she asked sweetly if you came back oh i think you act most judiciously fancy how melancholy if they had to announce that the society had been wound up owing to the stoutness of the master  tommys mouth opened twice before any words could come out take care he cried  of what said she curling her lip  he begged her pardon you dont like me lady pippinworth he said watching himself and i dont wonder at it and you have discovered a way of hurting me of which you make rather unmerciful use well i dont wonder at that either if i amstoutish i have at least the satisfaction of knowing that it gives you entertainment and i owe you that amend and more he was really in a fury and burning to go onfor i did have the whiphand of you once madam etc etc but by a fine effort he held his rage a prisoner and the admiration of himself that this engendered lifted him into the sublime  for i so far forgot myself said tommy in a glow as to try to make you love me you were beautiful and cold no man had ever stirred you my one excuse is that to be loved by such as you was no small ambition my fitting punishment is that i failed he knew he had not failed and so could be magnanimous i failed utterly he said with grandeur you were laughing at me all the time if proof of it were needed you have given it now by coming here to mock me i thought i was stronger than you but i was ludicrously mistaken and you taught me a lesson i richly deserved you did me good and i thank you for it believe me lady pippinworth when i say that i admit my discomfiture and remain your very humble and humbled servant  now was not that good of tommy you would think it still better were i to tell you what part of his person she was looking at while he said it  he held out his hand generously there was no noble act he could not have performed for her just now but whatever her ladyship wanted it was not to say goodbye do you mean that you never cared for me she asked with the tremor that always made tommy kind  never cared for you he exclaimed fervently what were you not to me in those golden days it was really a magnanimous cry meant to help her selfrespect nothing more but it alarmed the good in him and he said sternly but of course that is all over now it is only a sweet memory he added to make these two remarks mix  the sentiment of this was so agreeable to him that he was half thinking of raising her hand chivalrously to his lips when lady pippinworth said  but if it is all over now why have you still to walk me off  have you never had to walk me off said tommy forgetting himself and to his surprise she answered yes  but this meeting has cured me she said with dangerous graciousness  dear lady pippinworth replied tommy ardently thinking that his generosity had touched her if anything i have said  it is not so much what you have said she answered and again she looked at the wrong part of him  he gave way in the waist and then drew himself up if so little a thing as that helps you he began haughtily  little she cried reproachfully  he tried to go away he turned there was a time he thundered  it is over said she  when you were at my feet said tommy  it is over she said  it could come again  she laughed a contemptuous no  yes tommy cried  too stout said she with a drawl  he went closer to her she stood waiting disdainfully and his arms fell  too stout she repeated  let us put it in that way since it pleases you said tommy heavily i am too stout he could not help adding and be thankful lady pippinworth let us both be thankful that there is some reason to prevent my trying  she bowed mockingly as he raised his hat i wish you well he said and these are my last words to you and he retired not without distinction he retired shall we say as conscious of his waist as if it were some poor soldier he was supporting from a stricken field he said many things to himself on the way home and he was many tommies but all with the same waist it intruded on his noblest reflections and kept ringing up the worst in him like some devil at the telephone  no one could have been more thankful that on the whole he had kept his passions in check it made a strong man of him it turned him into a joyous boy and he tingled with hurrahs then suddenly he would hear that jeering bell clanging too stout too stout take care he roared oh the vanity of tommy  he did not tell grizel that he had met her ladyship all she knew was that he came back to her more tender and kind if that were possible than he had gone away his eyes followed her about the room until she made merry over it and still they dwelt upon her how much more beautiful you are than any other woman i ever saw grizel he said and it was not only true but he knew it was true what was lady pippinworth beside this glorious woman what was her damnable coldness compared to the love of grizel was he unforgivable or was it some flaw in the making of him for which he was not responsible with clenched hands he asked himself these questions this love that all his books were aboutwhat was it was it a compromise between affection and passion countenanced by god for the continuance of the race made beautiful by him where the ingredients are in right proportion a flower springing from a soil that is not all divine oh so exquisite a flower he cried for he knew his grizel but he could not love her he gave her all his affection but his passion like an outlaw had ever to hunt alone  was it that and if it was did there remain in him enough of humanity to give him the right to ask a little sympathy of those who can love so tommy in his despairing moods and the question ought to find some place in his epitaph which by the way it is almost time to write  on the day following his meeting with lady pippinworth came a note from lady rintoul inviting grizel and him to lunch they had been to rintoul once or twice before but this time tommy said decisively we shant go he guessed who had prompted the invitation though her name was not mentioned in it  why not grizel asked she was always afraid that she kept tommy too much to herself  because i object to being disturbed during the honeymoon he replied lightly their honeymoon you know was never to end they would separate us for hours grizel think of it but pooh the thing is not to be thought of tell her ladyship courteously that she must be mad  but though he could speak thus to grizel there came to him tempestuous desires to be by the side of the woman who could mock him and then stand waiting  had she shown any fear of him all would have been well with tommy he could have kept away from her complacently but she had flung down the glove and laughed to see him edge away from it he knew exactly what was in her mind he was too clever not to know that her one desire was to make him a miserable man to remember how he had subdued and left her would be gall to lady pippinworth until she achieved the same triumph over him how confident she was that he could never prove the stronger of the two again what were all her mockings but a beckoning to him to come on take care said tommy between his teeth  and then again horror of himself would come to his rescue the man he had been a moment ago was vile to him and all his thoughts were now heroic you may remember that he had once taken grizel to a seaside place they went there again it was tommys proposal but he did not go to flee from temptation however his worse nature had been stirred and his vanity pricked he was too determinedly grizels to fear that in any fierce hour he might rush into danger he wanted grizel to come away from the place where she always found so much to do for him so that there might be the more for him to do for her and that week was as the time they had spent there before all that devotion which had to be planned could do for woman he did grizel saw him planning it and never admitted that she saw in the after years it was sweet to her to recall that week and the hundred laboriously loverlike things tommy had done in it she knew by this time that tommy had never tried to make her love him and that it was only when her love for him revealed itself in the den that desire to save her pride made him pretend to be in love with her this knowledge would have been a great pain to her once but now it had more of pleasure in it for it showed that even in those days he had struggled a little for her  we must hasten to the end those of you who took in the newspapers a quarter of a century ago know what it was but none of you know why he climbed the wall  they returned to thrums in a week they had meant to stay longer but suddenly tommy wanted to go back yes it was lady pippinworth who recalled him but dont think too meanly of tommy it was not that he yielded to one of those fierce desires to lift the gauntlet he had got rid of them in fair fight when her letter reached him forwarded from thrums did you really think your manuscript was lost it said that was what took tommy back grizel did not know the reason he gave her another he thought very little about her that day he thought still less about lady pippinworth how could he think of anything but it she had it evidently she had it she must have stolen it from his bag he could not even spare time to denounce her it was alivehis manuscript was alive and every moment brought him nearer to it he was a miser and soon his hands would be deep among the gold he was a mother whose son mourned for dead is knocking at the door he was a swain and his beloveds arms were outstretched to him who said that tommy could not love  the ecstasies that came over him and would not let him sit still made grizel wonder is it a book she asked and he said it was a booksuch a book grizel when he started for the castle next morning she thought he wanted to be alone to think of the book of it and you he said and having started he came back to kiss her again he never forgot to have an impulse to do that but all the way to the spittal it was of his book he thought it was his book he was kissing his heart sang within him and the songs were sonnets to his beloved to be worthy of his beautiful manuscripthe prayed for that as lovers do that his love should be his his alone was as wondrous to him as to any of them  but we are not noticing what proved to be the chief thing though there was some sun the air was shrewd and he was wearing the old doctors coat should you have taken it with you tommy it loved grizel for it was a bit of him and what think you would the old doctor have cared for your manuscript had he known that you were gone out to meet that woman it was cruel no not cruel but thoughtless to wear the old doctors coat  he found no one at the spittal the men were out shooting and the ladies had followed to lunch with them on the moors he came upon them a gay party in the hollow of a hill where was a spring suddenly converted into a winecellar and soon the men if not the ladies were surprised to find that tommy could be the gayest of them all he was in hilarious spirits and had a gallantly forgiving glance for the only one of them who knew why his spirits were hilarious but he would not consent to remain to dinner the wretch is so hopelessly in love with his wife lady rintoul said flinging a twig of heather at him it was one of the many trivial things said on that occasion and long remembered the only person who afterwards professed her inability to remember what tommy said to her that day and she to him was lady pippinworth and yet you walked back to the castle with him they reminded her  if i had known that anything was to happen she replied indolently i should have taken more note of what was said but as it was i think we talked of our chance of finding white heather we were looking for it and that is why we fell behind you  that was not why tommy and her ladyship fell behind the others and it was not of white heather that they talked you know why i am here alice he said as soon as there was no one but her to hear him  she was in as great tension at that moment as he but more anxious not to show it why do you call me that she replied with a little laugh  because i want you to know at once he said and it was the truth that i have no vindictive feelings you have kept my manuscript from me all this time but severe though the punishment has been i deserved it yes every day of it  lady pippinworth smiled  you took it from my bag did you not said tommy  yes  where is it alice have you got it here  no  but you know where it is  oh yes she said graciously and then it seemed that nothing could ever disturb him again she enjoyed his boyish glee she walked by his side listening airily to it  had there been a fire in the room that day i should have burned the thing she said without emotion  it would have been no more than my deserts tommy replied cheerfully  i did burn it three months afterwards said she calmly  he stopped but she walked on he sprang after her you dont mean that alice  i do mean it  with a gesture fierce and yet imploring he compelled her to stop before god is this true he cried  yes she said it is true and indeed it was the truth about his manuscript at last  but you had a copy of it made first say you had  i had not  she seemed to have no fear of him though his face was rather terrible i meant to destroy it from the first she said coldly but i was afraid to i took it back with me to london one day i read in a paper that your wife was supposed to have burned it while she was insane she was insane was she not ah well that is not my affair but i burned it for her that afternoon  they were moving on again he stopped her once more  why have you told me this he cried was it not enough for you that i should think she did it  no lady pippinworth answered that was not enough for me i always wanted you to know that i had done it  and you wrote that letter you filled me with joy so that you should gloat over my disappointment  horrid of me was it not said she  why did you not tell me when we met the other day  i bided my time as the tragedians say  you would not have told me tommy said staring into her face if you had thought i cared for you had you thought i cared for you a little jot  i should have waited she confessed until you cared for me a great deal and then i should have told you that i admit was my intention  she had returned his gaze smilingly and as she strolled on she gave him another smile over her shoulder it became a protesting pout almost when she saw that he was not accompanying her tommy stood still for some minutes his hands his teeth every bit of him that could close tight clenched when he made up on her the devil was in him she had been gathering a nosegay of wild flowers pretty are they not she said to him he took hold of her harshly by both wrists she let him do it and stood waiting disdainfully but she was less unprepared for a blow than for what came  how you love me alice he said in a voice shaking with passion  how i have proved it she replied promptly  love or hate he went on in a torrent of words they are the same thing with you i dont care what you call it it has made you come back to me you tried hard to stay away how you fought alice but you had to come i knew you would come all this time you have been longing for me to go to you you have stamped your pretty feet because i did not go you have cried he shall come you have vowed you would not go one step of the way to meet me i saw you i heard you and i wanted you as much as you wanted me but i was always the stronger and i could resist it is i who have not gone a step towards you and it is my proud little alice who has come all the way proud little alicebut she is to be my obedient little alice now  his passion hurled him along and it had its effect on her she might curl her mouth as she chose but her bosom rose and fell  obedient she cried with a laugh  obedient said tommy quivering with his intensity obedient not because i want it for i prefer you as you are but because you are longing for it my ladybecause it is what you came here for you have been a virago only because you feared you were not to get it why have you grown so quiet alice where are the words you want to torment me with say them i love to hear them from your lips i love the demon in youthe demon that burned my book i love you the more for that it was your love that made you do it why dont you scratch and struggle for the last time i am half sorry that little alice is to scratch and struggle no more  go on said little alice you talk beautifully but though her tongue could mock him all the rest of her was enchained  whether i shall love you when you are tamed he went on with vehemence i dont know you must take the risk of that but i love you now we were made for one another you and i and i love you alicei love you and you love me you love me my peerless alice dont you say you love me your melting eyes are saying it how you tremble sweet alice is that your way of saying it i want to hear you say it you have been longing to say it for two years come love say it now  it was not within this womans power to resist him she tried to draw away from him but could not she was breathing quickly the mocking light quivered on her face only because it had been there so long if it went out she would be helpless he put his hands on her shoulders and she was helpless it brought her mouth nearer his she was offering him her mouth  no said tommy masterfully i wont kiss you until you say it  if there had not been a look of triumph in his eyes she would have said it as it was she broke from him panting she laughed next minute and with that laugh his power fell among the heather  really said lady pippinworth you are much too stout for this kind of thing she looked him up and down with a comic sigh you talk as well as ever she said condolingly but heighho you dont look the same i have done the best i could for you for the sake of old times but i forgot to shut my eyes shall we go on  and they went on silently one of them very white i believe you are blaming me her ladyship said making a face just before they overtook the others when you know it was your own fault forshe suddenly rippledfor not waiting until it was too dark for me to see you  they strolled with some others of the party to the flowergarden which was some distance from the house and surrounded by a high wall studded with iron spikes and glass lady rintoul cut him some flowers for grizel but he left them on a gardenseataccidentally everyone thought afterwards in the drawingroom when they were missed but he had laid them down because how could those degraded hands of his carry flowers again to grizel there was great remorse in him but there was a shrieking vanity also and though the one told him to be gone the other kept him lagging on they had torn him a dozen times from each others arms before he was man enough to go  it was gloaming when he set off waving his hat to those who had come to the door with him lady pippinworth was not among them he had not seen her to bid her goodbye nor wanted to for the better side of him had prevailedso he thought it was a man shamestricken and determined to kill the devil in him that went down that long avenueso he thought  a tall thin woman was standing some twenty yards off among some hollytrees she kissed her hand mockingly to him and beckoned and laughed when he stood irresolute he thought he heard her cry too stout he took some fierce steps towards her she ran on looking over her shoulder and he forgot all else and followed her she darted into the flowergarden pulling the gate to after her it was a gate that locked when it closed and the key was gone lady pippinworth clapped her hands because he could not reach her when she saw that he was climbing the wall she ran farther into the garden  he climbed the wall but as he was descending one of the iron spikes on the top of it pierced his coat which was buttoned to the throat and he hung there by the neck he struggled as he choked but he could not help himself he was unable to cry out the collar of the old doctors coat held him fast  they say that in such a moment a man reviews all his past life i dont know whether tommy did that but his last reflection before he passed into unconsciousness was serves me right perhaps it was only a little bit of sentiment for the end  lady disdain came back to the gate by and by to see why he had not followed her she screamed and then hid in the recesses of the garden he had been dead for some time when they found him they left the gate creaking in the evening wind after a long time a terrified woman stole out by it     chapter xxxv  the perfect lover   tommy has not lasted more than once since it became known that i was writing his life i have been asked whether there ever really was such a person and i am afraid to inquire for his books at the library lest they are no longer there a recent project to bring out a new edition with introductions by some other tommy received so little support that it fell to the ground it must be admitted that so far as the great public is concerned thomas sandys is done for  they have even forgotten the manner of his death though probably no young writer with an eye on posterity ever had a better sendoff we really thought at the time that tommy had found a way  the surmise at rintoul immediately accepted by the world as a fact was that he had been climbing the wall to obtain for grizel the flowers accidentally left in the garden and it at once tipped the tragedy with gold the newspapers which were in the middle of the dull season thanked their gods for tommy and enthusiastically set to work on him great minds wrote criticisms of what they called his lifework the many persons who had been the first to discover him said so again his friends were in demand for the most trivial reminiscences unhappy pym cleared £ll 10s  shall we quote it is nearly always done at this stage of the biography so now for the testimonials to prove that our hero was without a flaw a few specimens will suffice if we select some that are very like many of the others it keeps grizel waiting but tommy as you have seen was always the great one she existed only that he might show how great he was busy among us of late says one has been the grim visitor who knocks with equal confidence at the doors of the gifted and the ungifted the pauper and the prince and twice in one short month has he taken from us men of an eminence greater perhaps than that of mr sandys but of them it could be said their work was finished while his sun sinks tragically when it is yet day not by what his riper years might have achieved can this pure spirit now be judged and to us we confess there is something infinitely pathetic in that thought we would fain shut our eyes and open them again at twenty years hence with mr sandys in the fulness of his powers it is not to be what he might have become is hidden from us what he was we know he was little more than a stripling when he burst upon the town to be its marveland to die a marvellous boy indeed yet how unlike in character and in the nobility of his short life as in the mournful yet lovely circumstances of his death to that other mighthavebeen who perished in his pride our young men of letters have travelled far since the days of chatterton time was when a riotous life was considered part of their callingwhen they shunned the domestic ties and actually held that the consummate artist is able to love nothing but the creations of his fancy it is such men as thomas sandys who have exploded that pernicious fallacy  whether his name will march down the ages is not for us his contemporaries to determine he had the most modest opinion of his own work and was humbled rather than elated when he heard it praised no one ever loved praise less to be pointed at as a man of distinction was abhorrent to his shrinking nature he seldom indeed knew that he was being pointed at for his eyes were ever on the ground he set no great store by the remarkable popularity of his works nothing he has been heard to say to one of those gushing ladies who were his aversion nothing will so certainly perish as the talk of the town it may be so but if so the greater the pity that he has gone from among us before he had time to put the copingstone upon his work there is a beautiful passage in one of his own books in which he sees the spirits of gallant youth who died too young for immortality haunting the portals of the elysian fields and the great shades come to the portal and talk with them we venture to say that he is at least one of these  what was the individuality behind the work they discussed it in leading articles and in the correspondence columns and the man proved to be greater than his books his distaste for admiration is again and again insisted on and illustrated by many characteristic anecdotes he owed much to his parents though he had the misfortune to lose them when he was but a child little is known of his father but we understand that he was a retired military officer in easy circumstances the mother was a canny scotchwoman of lowly birth conspicuous for her devoutness even in a land where it is everyones birthright and on their marriage which was a singularly happy one they settled in london going little into society the world forgetting by the world forgot and devoting themselves to each other and to their two children of these thomas was the elder and as the twig was early bent so did the tree incline from his earliest years he was noted for the modesty which those who remember his boyhood in scotland whither the children went to an uncle on the death of their parents still speak of with glistening eyes in another column will be found some interesting recollections of mr sandys by his old schoolmaster mr david cathro ma who testifies with natural pride to the industry and amiability of his famous pupil to know him says mr cathro was to love him  according to another authority t sandys got his early modesty from his father who was of a very sweet disposition and some instances of this modesty are given they are all things that elspeth did but tommy is now represented as the person who had done them on the other hand his strong will singleness of purpose and enviable capacity for knowing what he wanted to be at were a heritage from his practical and sagacious mother i think he was a little proud of his strength of will writes the ra who painted his portrait now in america for i remember his anxiety that it should be suggested in the picture but another acquaintance a lady replies he was not proud of his strong will but he liked to hear it spoken of and he once told me the reason this strength of will was not as is generally supposed inherited by him he was born without it and acquired it by a tremendous effort i believe i am the only person to whom he confided this for he shrank from talk about himself looking upon it as a form of that sentimentality which his soul abhorred  he seems often to have warned ladies against this essentially womanish tendency to the sentimental it is an odious onion dear lady he would say holding both her hands in his if men in his presence talked sentimentally to ladies he was so irritated that he soon found a pretext for leaving the room yet let it not be thought says one who knew him well that because he was so sternly practical himself he was intolerant of the outpourings of the sentimental the man in short reflected the views on this subject which are so admirably phrased in his books works that seem to me to found one of their chief claims to distinction on this that at last we have a writer who can treat intimately of human love without leaving one smear of the onion upon his pages  on the whole it may be noticed comparatively few ladies contribute to the obituary reflections for the simple reason says a simple man that he went but little into female society he who could write so eloquently about women never seemed to know what to say to them ordinary tittletattle from them disappointed him i should say that to him there was so much of the divine in women that he was depressed when they hid their wings this view is supported by clubman who notes that tommy would never join in the somewhat free talk about the other sex in which many men indulge i remember he says a mans dinner at which two of those present both persons of eminence started a theory that every man who is blessed or cursed with the artistic instinct has at some period of his life wanted to marry a barmaid mr sandys gave them such a look that they at once apologized trivial perhaps but significant on another occasion i was in a club smokingroom when the talk was of a similar kind mr sandys was not present a member said with a laugh i wonder for how long men can be together without talking gamesomely of women before any answer could be given mr sandys strolled in and immediately the atmosphere cleared as if someone had opened the windows when he had gone the member addressed turned to him who had propounded the problem and said there is your answeras long as sandys is in the room  a fitting epitaph this for thomas sandys says the paper that quotes it if we could not find a better mr sandys was from first to last a man of character but why when others falter was he always so surefooted it is in the answer to this question that we find the key to the books and to the man who was greater than the books he was the perfect lover as he died seeking flowers for her who had the high honour to be his wife so he had always lived he gave his affection to her as our correspondent miss or mrs ailie mclean shows in his earliest boyhood and from this his one romance he never swerved to the moment of his death all his beautiful thoughts were flowers plucked for her his books were bunches of them gathered to place at her feet no harm now in reading between the lines of his books and culling what is the common knowledge of his friends in the north that he had to serve a long apprenticeship before he won her for long his attachment was unreciprocated though she was ever his loyal friend and the volume called unrequited love belongs to the period when he thought his life must be lived alone the circumstances of their marriage are at once too beautiful and too painful to be dwelt on here enough to say that should the particulars ever be given to the world with the simple story of his life a finer memorial will have been raised to him than anything in stone such as we see a committee is already being formed to erect we venture to propose as a title for his biography the story of the perfect lover  yes that memorial committee was formed but so soon do people forget the hero of yesterdays paper that only the secretary attended the first meeting and he never called another but here five and twenty years later is the biography with the title changed you may wonder that i had the heart to write it i do it i have sometimes pretended to myself that we may all laugh at the stripling of a rogue but that was never my reason have i been too cunning or have you seen through me all the time have you discovered that i was really pitying the boy who was so fond of boyhood that he could not with years become a man telling nothing about him that was not true but doing it with unnecessary scorn in the hope that i might goad you into crying come come you are too hard on him  perhaps the manner in which he went to his death deprives him of these words had the castle gone on fire that day while he was at tea and he perished in the flames in a splendid attempt to save the life of his enemy a very probable thing then you might have felt a little liking for him yet he would have been precisely the same person i dont blame you but you are a tommy  grizel knew how he died she found lady pippinworths letter to him and understood who the woman was but it was only in hopes of obtaining the lost manuscript that she went to see her then lady pippinworth told her all are you sorry that grizel knew i am not sorryi am glad as a child as a girl and as a wife the truth had been all she wanted and she wanted it just the same when she was a widow we have a right to know the truth no right to ask anything else from god but the right to ask that  and to her latest breath she went on loving tommy just the same she thought everything out calmly for herself she saw that there is no great man on this earth except the man who conquers self and that in some the accursed thing which is in all of us may be so strong that to battle with it and be beaten is not altogether to fail it is foolish to demand complete success of those we want to love we should rejoice when they rise for a moment above themselves and sympathize with them when they fall in their heyday young lovers think each other perfect but a nobler love comes when they see the failings also and this higher love is so much more worth attaining to that they need not cry out though it has to be beaten into them with rods so they learn humanitys limitations and that the accursed thing to me is not the accursed thing to you but all have it and from this comes pity for those who have sinned and the desire to help each other springs for knowledge is sympathy and sympathy is love and to learn it the son of god became a man  and grizel also thought anxiously about herself and how from the time when she was the smallest girl she had longed to be a good woman and feared that perhaps she never should and as she looked back at the road she had travelled there came along it the little girl to judge her she came trembling but determined to know the truth and she looked at grizel until she saw into her soul and then she smiled well pleased  grizel lived on at double dykes helping david in the old way she was too strong and fine a nature to succumb even her brightness came back to her they sometimes wondered at the serenity of her face some still thought her a little standoffish for though the pride had gone from her walk a distinction of manner grew upon her and made her seem a finer lady than before there was no other noticeable change except that with the years she lost her beautiful contours and became a little angularthe old maids figure i believe it is sometimes called  no one would have dared to smile at grizel become an old maid before some of the young men of thrums they were people who would have suffered much for her and all because she had the courage to talk to them of some things before their marriageday came round and for their young wives who had tidings to whisper to her about the unborn she had the pretty idea that they should live with beautiful thoughts so that these might become part of the child  when gavinia told this to corp he gulped and said i wonder god could hae haen the heart  lifes a queerer thing gavinia replied sadly enough than we used to think it when we was bairns in the den  he spoke of it to grizel she let corp speak of anything to her because he was so loyal to tommy  youve given away a your bonny things grizel he said one by one and this notion is the bonniest o them a im thinking that when it cam into your head you meant it for yoursel  grizel smiled at him  i mind corp went on how when you was little you couldna see a bairn without rocking your arms in a waeful kind o a way and we could never thole the meaning ot it just comes over me this minute as it meant that when you was a woman you would like terrible to hae bairns o your ain and you doubted you never should  she raised her hand to stop him you see i was not meant to have them corp she said i think that when women are too fond of other peoples babies they never have any of their own  but corp shook his head i dinna understand it he told her but im sure you was meant to hae them somethings gane wrang  she was still smiling at him but her eyes were wet now and she drew him on to talk of the days when tommy was a boy it was sweet to grizel to listen while elspeth and david told her of the thousand things tommy had done for her when she was ill but she loved best to talk with corp of the time when they were all children in the den the days of childhood are the best  she lived so long after tommy that she was almost a middleaged woman when she died  and so the painted ladys daughter has found a way of making tommys life the story of a perfect lover after all the little girl she had been comes stealing back into the book and rocks her arms joyfully and we see grizels crooked smile for the last time
