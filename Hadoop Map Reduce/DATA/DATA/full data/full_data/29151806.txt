             the curtain falls     the curtain rises again at once  scene ii       in the barthwicks diningroom  jack is still asleep the      morning light is coming through the curtains  the time is      halfpast eight  wheeler brisk person enters with a dustpan      and mrs jones more slowly with a scuttle  wheeler  drawing the curtains  that precious husband of yours was round for you after youd gone yesterday mrs jones  wanted your money for drink i suppose  he hangs about the corner here half the time  i saw him outside the goat and bells when i went to the post last night  if i were you i would nt live with him  i would nt live with a man that raised his hand to me  i wouldnt put up with it  why dont you take your children and leave him  if you put up with im itll only make him worse  i never can see why because a mans married you he should knock you about  mrs jones  slim darkeyed and darkhaired ovalfaced and with a smooth soft even voice her manner patient her way of talking quite impersonal she wears a blue linen dress and boots with holes  it was nearly two last night before he come home and he wasnt himself  he made me get up and he knocked me about he didnt seem to know what he was saying or doing  of course i would leave him but im really afraid of what hed do to me  he s such a violent man when hes not himself  wheeler  why dont you get him locked up  youll never have any peace until you get him locked up  if i were you id go to the police court tomorrow  thats what i would do  mrs jones  of course i ought to go because he does treat me so badly when hes not himself  but you see bettina he has a very hard timehe s been out of work two months and it preys upon his mind  when hes in work he behaves himself much better  its when hes out of work that hes so violent  wheeler  well if you wont take any steps you ll never get rid of him  mrs jones  of course its very wearing to me i dont get my sleep at nights  and it s not as if i were getting help from him because i have to do for the children and all of us  and he throws such dreadful things up at me talks of my having men to follow me about  such a thing never happens no man ever speaks to me  and of course its just the other way  its what he does thats wrong and makes me so unhappy  and then he s always threatenin to cut my throat if i leave him  its all the drink and things preying on his mind he s not a bad man really  sometimes hell speak quite kind to me but ive stood so much from him i dont feel it in me to speak kind back but just keep myself to myself  and hes all right with the children too except when hes not himself  wheeler  you mean when hes drunk the beauty  mrs jones  yes  without change of voice  theres the young gentleman asleep on the sofa       they both look silently at jack  mrs jones  at last in her soft voice  he does nt look quite himself  wheeler  hes a young limb thats what he is  it s my belief he was tipsy last night like your husband  it s another kind of bein out of work that sets him to drink  i ll go and tell marlow this is his job       she goes       mrs jones upon her knees begins a gentle sweeping  jack  waking  whos there  what is it  mrs jones  its me sir mrs jones  jack  sitting up and looking round  where is itwhatwhat time is it  mrs jones  its getting on for nine oclock sir  jack  for nine  whywhat  rising and loosening his tongue putting hands to his head and staring hard at mrs jones  look here you mrsmrs jonesdont you say you caught me asleep here  mrs jones  no sir of course i wont sir  jack  its quite an accident i dont know how it happened  i must have forgotten to go to bed  its a queer thing  i ve got a most beastly headache  mind you dont say anything mrs jones       goes out and passes marlow in the doorway  marlow is young      and quiet he is cleanshaven and his hair is brushed high from      his forehead in a coxcomb  incidentally a butler he is first      a man  he looks at mrs jones and smiles a private smile  marlow  not the first time and wont be the last  looked a bit dicky eh mrs jones  mrs jones  he did nt look quite himself  of course i did nt take notice  marlow  youre used to them  hows your old man  mrs jones  softly as throughout  well he was very bad last night he did nt seem to know what he was about  he was very late and he was most abusive  but now of course hes asleep  marlow  thats his way of finding a job eh  mrs jones  as a rule mr marlow he goes out early every morning looking for work and sometimes he comes in fit to dropand of course i cant say he does nt try to get it because he does trades very bad  she stands quite still her fan and brush before her at the beginning and the end of long vistas of experience traversing them with her impersonal eye  but hes not a good husband to melast night he hit me and he was so dreadfully abusive  marlow  bank oliday eh  he s too fond of the goat and bells thats whats the matter with him  i see him at the corner late every night  he hangs about  mrs jones  he gets to feeling very low walking about all day after work and being refused so often and then when he gets a drop in him it goes to his head  but he shouldnt treat his wife as he treats me  sometimes i ve had to go and walk about at night when he wouldnt let me stay in the room but hes sorry for it afterwards  and he hangs about after me he waits for me in the street and i dont think he ought to because i ve always been a good wife to him  and i tell him mrs barthwick wouldnt like him coming about the place  but that only makes him angry and he says dreadful things about the gentry  of course it was through me that he first lost his place through his not treating me right and thats made him bitter against the gentry  he had a very good place as groom in the country but it made such a stir because of course he did nt treat me right  marlow  got the sack  mrs jones  yes his employer said he couldnt keep him because there was a great deal of talk and he said it was such a bad example  but its very important for me to keep my work here i have the three children and i dont want him to come about after me in the streets and make a disturbance as he sometimes does  marlow  holding up the empty decanter  not a drain  next time he hits you get a witness and go down to the court  mrs jones  yes i think i ve made up my mind  i think i ought to  marlow  thats right  wheres the ciga       he searches for the silver box he looks at mrs jones who is      sweeping on her hands and knees he checks himself and stands      reflecting  from the tray he picks two halfsmoked cigarettes      and reads the name on them  nestorwhere the deuce       with a meditative air he looks again at mrs jones and      taking up jacks overcoat he searches in the pockets      wheeler with a tray of breakfast things comes in  marlow  aside to wheeler  have you seen the cigarettebox  wheeler  no  marlow  well its gone  i put it on the tray last night  and hes been smoking  showing her the ends of cigarettes  its not in these pockets  he cant have taken it upstairs this morning have a good look in his room when he comes down  whos been in here  wheeler  only me and mrs jones  mrs jones  i ve finished here shall i do the drawingroom now  wheeler  looking at her doubtfully  have you seenbetter do the boudwower first       mrs jones goes out with pan and brush  marlow and wheeler      look each other in the face  marlow  itll turn up  wheeler  hesitating  you dont think she nodding at the door  marlow  stoutly  i donti never believes anything of anybody  wheeler  but the masterll have to be told  marlow  you wait a bit and see if it dont turn up  suspicions no business of ours  i set my mind against it                       the curtain falls                    the curtain rises again at once    scene iii       barthwick and mrs barthwick are seated at the breakfast table      he is a man between fifty and sixty quietly important with a      bald forehead and pincenez and the times in his hand  she      is a lady of nearly fifty well dressed with greyish hair      good features and a decided manner  they face each other  barthwick  from behind his paper  the labour man has got in at the byelection for barnside my dear  mrs barthwick  another labour  i cant think what on earth the country is about  barthwick  i predicted it  its not a matter of vast importance  mrs barthwick  not  how can you take it so calmly john  to me its simply outrageous  and there you sit you liberals and pretend to encourage these people  barthwick  frowning  the representation of all parties is necessary for any proper reform for any proper social policy  mrs barthwick  ive no patience with your talk of reformall that nonsense about social policy  we know perfectly well what it is they want they want things for themselves  those socialists and labour men are an absolutely selfish set of people  they have no sense of patriotism like the upper classes they simply want what weve got  barthwick  want what weve got  he stares into space  my dear what are you talking about  with a contortion  i m no alarmist  mrs barthwick  cream  quite uneducated men  wait until they begin to tax our investments  i m convinced that when they once get a chance they will tax everythingthey ve no feeling for the country  you liberals and conservatives you re all alike you dont see an inch before your noses  youve no imagination not a scrap of imagination between you  you ought to join hands and nip it in the bud  barthwick  you re talking nonsense  how is it possible for liberals and conservatives to join hands as you call it  that shows how absurd it is for womenwhy the very essence of a liberal is to trust in the people  mrs barthwick  now john eat your breakfast  as if there were any real difference between you and the conservatives  all the upper classes have the same interests to protect and the same principles  calmly  oh  youre sitting upon a volcano john  barthwick  what  mrs barthwick  i read a letter in the paper yesterday  i forget the mans name but it made the whole thing perfectly clear  you dont look things in the face  barthwick  indeed  heavily  i am a liberal  drop the subject please  mrs barthwick  toast  i quite agree with what this man says education is simply ruining the lower classes  it unsettles them and thats the worst thing for us all  i see an enormous difference in the manner of servants  barthwick with suspicious emphasis  i welcome any change that will lead to something better  he opens a letter  hm  this is that affair of master jacks again  high street oxford  sir we have received mr john barthwick seniors draft for forty pounds oh the letters to him  we now enclose the cheque you cashed with us which as we stated in our previous letter was not met on presentation at your bank  we are sir yours obediently moss and sons tailors  h m  staring at the cheque  a pretty business altogether  the boy might have been prosecuted  mrs barthwick  come john you know jack did nt mean anything he only thought he was overdrawing  i still think his bank ought to have cashed that cheque  they must know your position  barthwick  replacing in the envelope the letter and the cheque much good that would have done him in a court of law       he stops as jack comes in fastening his waistcoat and      staunching a razor cut upon his chin  jack  sitting down between them and speaking with an artificial joviality  sorry i m late  he looks lugubriously at the dishes  tea please mother  any letters for me  barthwick hands the letter to him  but look here i say this has been opened  i do wish you would nt  barthwick  touching the envelope  i suppose i m entitled to this name  jack  sulkily  well i cant help having your name father  he reads the letter and mutters  brutes  barthwick  eyeing him  you dont deserve to be so well out of that  jack  havent you ragged me enough dad  mrs barthwick  yes john let jack have his breakfast  barthwick  if you hadnt had me to come to where would you have been  its the merest accidentsuppose you had been the son of a poor man or a clerk  obtaining money with a cheque you knew your bank could not meet  it might have ruined you for life  i cant see whats to become of you if these are your principles  i never did anything of the sort myself  jack  i expect you always had lots of money  if youve got plenty of money of course  barthwick  on the contrary i had not your advantages  my father kept me very short of money  jack  how much had you dad  barthwick  its not material  the question is do you feel the gravity of what you did  jack  i dont know about the gravity  of course i m very sorry if you think it was wrong  have nt i said so  i should never have done it at all if i had nt been so jolly hard up  barthwick  how much of that forty pounds have you got left jack  jack  hesitating  i dont knownot much  barthwick  how much  jack  desperately  i have nt got any  barthwick  what  jack  i know i ve got the most beastly headache       he leans his head on his hand  mrs barthwick  headache  my dear boy  cant you eat any breakfast  jack  drawing in his breath  too jolly bad  mrs barthwick  im so sorry  come with me dear ill give you something that will take it away at once       they leave the room and barthwick tearing up the letter      goes to the fireplace and puts the pieces in the fire  while      he is doing this marlow comes in and looking round him is      about quietly to withdraw  barthwick  whats that  what d you want  marlow  i was looking for mr john sir  barthwick  what d you want mr john for  marlow  with hesitation  i thought i should find him here sir  barthwick  suspiciously  yes but what do you want him for  marlow  offhandedly  theres a lady calledasked to speak to him for a minute sir  barthwick  a lady at this time in the morning  what sort of a lady

returns ushering in a young pale lady with dark eyes and      pretty figure in a modish black but rather shabby dress a      black and white trimmed hat with a bunch of parma violets      wrongly placed and fuzzyspotted veil  at the sight of mr      barthwick she exhibits every sign of nervousness  marlow goes      out  unknown lady  oh  buti beg pardon theres some mistakei she turns to fly

avid drops her face on them                            the curtain falls     scene ii       the barthwicks diningroom the same evening  the barthwicks      are seated at dessert  mrs barthwick  john  a silence broken by the cracking of nuts john  barthwick  i wish youd speak about the nuts theyre uneatable he puts one in his mouth  mrs barthwick  its not the season for them  i called on the holyroods       barthwick fills his glass with port  jack  crackers please dad       barthwick passes the crackers  his demeanour is reflective  mrs barthwick  lady holyrood has got very stout  i ve noticed it coming for a long time  barthwick  gloomily  stout  he takes up the crackerswith transparent airiness  the holyroods had some trouble with their servants had nt they  jack  crackers please dad  barthwick  passing the crackers  it got into the papers  the cook was nt it  mrs barthwick  no the ladys maid  i was talking it over with lady holyrood  the girl used to have her young man to see her  barthwick  uneasily  im not sure they were wise  mrs barthwick  my dear john what are you talking about  how could there be any alternative  think of the effect on the other servants  barthwick  of course in principlei wasnt thinking of that  jack  maliciously  crackers please dad       barthwick is compelled to pass the crackers  mrs barthwick  lady holyrood told me i had her up she said i said to her youll leave my house at once i think your conduct disgraceful  i cant tell i dont know and i dont wish to know what you were doing  i send you away on principle you need not come to me for a character  and the girl said if you dont give me my notice my lady i want a months wages  im perfectly respectable  ive done nothingdone nothing  barthwick  hm  mrs barthwick  servants have too much license  they hang together so terribly you never can tell what theyre really thinking its as if they were all in a conspiracy to keep you in the dark  even with marlow you feel that he never lets you know whats really in his mind  i hate that secretiveness it destroys all confidence  i feel sometimes i should like to shake him  jack  marlows a most decent chap  its simply beastly every one knowing your affairs  barthwick  the less you say about that the better  mrs barthwick  it goes all through the lower classes  you can not tell when they are speaking the truth  today when i was shopping after leaving the holyroods one of these unemployed came up and spoke to me  i suppose i only had twenty yards or so to walk to the carnage but he seemed to spring up in the street  barthwick  ah  you must be very careful whom you speak to in these days  mrs barthwick  i did nt answer him of course  but i could see at once that he wasnt telling the truth  barthwick  cracking a nut  theres one very good rulelook at their eyes  jack  crackers please dad  barthwick  passing the crackers  if their eyes are straightforward i sometimes give them sixpence  it s against my principles but its most difficult to refuse  if you see that theyre desperate and dull and shiftylooking as so many of them are its certain to mean drink or crime or something unsatisfactory  mrs barthwick  this man had dreadful eyes  he looked as if he could commit a murder  i ve ad nothing to eat today he said just like that  barthwick  what was william about  he ought to have been waiting  jack  raising his wineglass to his nose  is this the 63 dad       barthwick holding his wineglass to his eye lowers it and      passes it before his nose  mrs barthwick  i hate people that cant speak the truth  father and son exchange a look behind their port  it s just as easy to speak the truth as not  ive always found it easy enough  it makes it impossible to tell what is genuine one feels as if one were continually being taken in  barthwick  sententiously  the lower classes are their own enemies  if they would only trust us they would get on so much better  mrs barthwick  but even then its so often their own fault  look at that mrs jones this morning  barthwick  i only want to do whats right in that matter  i had occasion to see roper this afternoon  i mentioned it to him  hes coming in this evening  it all depends on what the detective says ive had my doubts  ive been thinking it over  mrs barthwick  the woman impressed me most unfavourably  she seemed to have no shame  that affair she was talking aboutshe and the man when they were young so immoral  and before you and jack i could have put her out of the room  barthwick  oh  i dont want to excuse them but in looking at these matters one must consider  mrs barthwick  perhaps youll say the mans employer was wrong in dismissing him  barthwick  of course not  its not there that i feel doubt  what i ask myself is  jack  port please dad  barthwick  circulating the decanter in religious imitation of the rising and setting of the sun  i ask myself whether we are sufficiently careful in making inquiries about people before we engage them especially as regards moral conduct  jack  pass theport please mother  mrs barthwick  passing it  my dear boy are nt you drinking too much       jack fills his glass  marlow  entering  detective snow to see you sir  barthwick  uneasily  ah  say ill be with him in a minute  mrs barthwick  without turning  let him come in here marlow       snow enters in an overcoat his bowler hat in hand  barthwick  halfrising  oh  good evening  snow  good evening sir good evening maam i ve called round to report what i ve done rather late i m afraidanother case took me away  he takes the silver box out o f his pocket causing a sensation in the barthwick family  this is the identical article i believe  barthwick  certainly certainly  snow  havin your crest and cypher as you described to me sir i d no hesitation in the matter  barthwick  excellent  will you have a glass of he glances at the waning portersherrypours out sherry  jack just give mr snow this       jack rises and gives the glass to snow then lolling in his      chair regards him indolently  snow  drinking off wine and putting down the glass  after seeing you i went round to this womans lodgings sir  its a low neighborhood and i thought it as well to place a constable below and not without e was wanted as things turned out  barthwick  indeed  snow  yes sir i ad some trouble  i asked her to account for the presence of the article  she could give me no answer except to deny the theft so i took her into custody then her husband came for me so i was obliged to take him too for assault  he was very violent on the way to the stationvery violentthreatened you and your son and altogether he was a handful i can till you  mrs barthwick  what a ruffian he must be  snow  yes maam a rough customer  jack  sipping his mine bemused  punch the beggars head  snow  given to drink as i understand sir  mrs barthwick  its to be hoped he will get a severe punishment  snow  the odd thing is sir that he persists in sayin he took the box himself  barthwick  took the box himself  he smiles  what does he think to gain by that  snow  he says the young gentleman was intoxicated last night       jack stops the cracking of a nut and looks at snow       barthwick losing his smile has put his wineglass down      there is a silencesnow looking from face to face remarks  took him into the house and gave him whisky and under the influence of an empty stomach the man says he took the box  mrs barthwick  the impudent wretch  barthwick  d you mean that heerintends to put this forward tomorrow  snow  thatll be his line sir but whether hes endeavouring to shield his wife or whether he looks at jack  theres something in it will be for the magistrate to say  mrs barthwick  haughtily  something in what  i dont understand you  as if my son would bring a man like that into the house  barthwick  from the fireplace with an effort to be calm  my son can speak for himself no doubt  well jack what do you say  mrs barthwick  sharply  what does he say  why of course he says the whole storys stuff  jack  embarrassed  well of course iof course i dont know anything about it  mrs barthwick  i should think not indeed  to snow  the man is an audacious ruffian  barthwick  suppressing jumps  but in view of my sons saying theres nothing in thisthis fablewill it be necessary to proceed against the man under the circumstances  snow  we shall have to charge him with the assault sir  it would be as well for your son to come down to the court  therell be a remand no doubt  the queer thing is there was quite a sum of money found on him and a crimson silk purse       barthwick starts jack rises and sits dozen again  i suppose the lady has nt missed her purse  barthwick  hastily  oh no  oh  no  jack  no  mrs barthwick  dreamily  no  to snow  i ve been inquiring of the servants  this man does hang about the house  i shall feel much safer if he gets a good long sentence i do think we ought to be protected against such ruffians  barthwick  yes yes of course on principle but in this case we have a number of things to think of  to snow  i suppose as you say the man must be charged eh  snow  no question about that sir  barthwick  staring gloomily at jack  this prosecution goes very much against the grain with me  i have great sympathy with the poor  in my position i m bound to recognise the distress there is amongst them  the condition of the people leaves much to be desired  d you follow me  i wish i could see my way to drop it  mrs barthwick  sharply  john  its simply not fair to other people  its putting property at the mercy of any one who likes to take it  barthwick  trying to make signs to her aside  i m not defending him not at all  im trying to look at the matter broadly  mrs barthwick  nonsense john theres a time for everything  snow  rather sardonically  i might point out sir that to withdraw the charge of stealing would not make much difference because the facts must come out he looks significantly at jack  in reference to the assault and as i said that charge will have to go forward  barthwick  hastily  yes oh  exactly  its entirely on the womans accountentirely a matter of my own private feelings  snow  if i were you sir i should let things take their course its not likely therell be much difficulty  these things are very quick settled  barthwick  doubtfully  you think soyou think so  jack  rousing himself  i say what shall i have to swear to  snow  thats best known to yourself sir  retreating to the door  better employ a solicitor sir in case anything should arise  we shall have the butler to prove the loss of the article youll excuse me going i m rather pressed tonight  the case may come on any time after eleven  good evening sir good evening maam  i shall have to produce the box in court tomorrow so if youll excuse me sir i may as well take it with me       he takes the silver box and leaves them with a little bow       barthwick makes a move to follow him then dashing his hands      beneath his coat tails speaks with desperation  barthwick  i do wish youd leave me to manage things myself  you will put your nose into matters you know nothing of  a pretty mess youve made of this  mrs barthwick  coldly  i dont in the least know what youre talking about  if you cant stand up for your rights i can  i ve no patience with your principles its such nonsense  barthwick  principles  good heavens  what have principles to do with it for goodness sake  dont you know that jack was drunk last night  jack  dad  mrs barthwick  in horror rising  jack  jack  look here motheri had supper  everybody does  i mean to sayyou know what i meanits absurd to call it being drunk  at oxford everybody gets a bit on sometimes  mrs barthwick  well i think its most dreadful  if that is really what you do at oxford  jack  angrily  well why did you send me there  one must do as other fellows do  its such nonsense i mean to call it being drunk  of course i m awfully sorry  i ve had such a beastly headache all day  barthwick  tcha  if youd only had the common decency to remember what happened when you came in  then we should know what truth there was in what this fellow saysas it is its all the most confounded darkness  jack  staring as though at halfformed visions  i just get a and thenit s gone  mrs barthwick  oh jack  do you mean to

on me  magistrate  protruding his neck  yesyesbut what did he say to you  mrs jones  i asked him whatever came over him to do such a thing and he said it was the drink  he said he had had too much to drink and something came over him  and of course your worship he had had very little to eat all day and the drink does go to the head when you have not had enough to eat  your worship may not know but it is the truth  and i would like to say that all through his married life i have never known him to do such a thing before though we have passed through great hardships and speaking with soft emphasis  i am quite sure he would not have done it if he had been himself at the time  magistrate  yes yes  but dont you know that that is no excuse  mrs jones  yes your worship  i know that it is no excuse       the magistrate leans over and parleys with his clerk  jack  leaning over from his seat behind  i say dad  barthwick  tsst  sheltering his mouth he speaks to roper roper you had better get

part of  bald constable  hssshh       roper shakes his head  magistrate  now supposing what you say and what your husband says is true what i have to consider ishow did he obtain access to this house

said all you have to say and you will be quiet       there is a silence the magistrate bends over and parleys with      his clerk  yes i think i may discharge the woman  in a kindly voice he addresses mrs jones who stands unmoving with her hands crossed on the rail  it is very unfortunate for you that this man has behaved as he has  it is not the consequences to him but the consequences to you  you

whispering groan  magistrate  we will now adjourn for lunch  he rises from his seat       the court is in a stir  roper gets up and speaks to the      reporter  jack throwing up his head walks with a swagger to      the corridor barthwick follows  mrs jones  turning to him zenith a humble gesture  oh  sir       barthwick hesitates then yielding to his nerves he makes a      shamefaced gesture of refusal and hurries out of court  mrs      jones stands looking after him                            the curtain falls
