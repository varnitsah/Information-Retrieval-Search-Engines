after   mr   mrs   dr        look not for roses in attalus his garden or wholesome      flowers in a venomous plantation and since there is scarce      any one bad but some others are the worse for him tempt      not contagion by proximity and hazard not thyself in the      shadow of corruption             sir thomas browne      chapter one  the churchyard in which arthur lawford found himself wandering that mild and golden september afternoon was old green and refreshingly still the silence in which it lay seemed as keen and mellow as the lightthe pale almost heatless sunlight that filled the air here and there robins sang across the stones elvishly shrill in the quiet of harvest the only other living creature there seemed to lawford to be his own rather fair not insubstantial rather languid self who at the noise of the birds had raised his head and glanced as if between content and incredulity across his still and solitary surroundings an increasing inclination for such lonely ramblings together with the feeling that his continued illhealth had grown a little irksome to his wife and that now that he was really better she would be relieved at his absence had induced him to wander on from home without much considering where the quiet lanes were leading him and in spite of a peculiar melancholy that had welled up into his mind during these last few days he had certainly smiled with a faint sense of the irony of things on lifting his eyes in an unusually depressed moodiness to find himself looking down on the shadows and peace of widderstone  with that anxious irresolution which illness so often brings in its train he had hesitated for a few minutes before actually entering the graveyard but once safely within he had begun to feel extremely loth to think of turning back again and this not the less at remembering with a real foreboding that it was now drawing towards evening that another day was nearly done he trailed his umbrella behind him over the grassgrown paths staying here and there to read some timeworn inscription stooping a little broodingly over the dark green graves not for the first time during the long laborious convalescence that had followed apparently so slight an indisposition a fleeting sense almost as if of an unintelligible remorse had overtaken him a vague thought that behind all these past years hidden as it were from his daily life lay something not yet quite reckoned with how often as a boy had he been rapped into a galvanic activity out of the deep reveries he used to fall intothose fits of a kind of fishlike daydream how often and even far beyond boyhood had he found himself bent on some distant thought or fleeting vision that the sudden clash of selfpossession had made to seem quite illusory and yet had left so strangely haunting and now the old habit had stirred out of its long sleep and through the gate that influenza in departing had left ajar had returned upon him  but i suppose we are all pretty much the same if we only knew it he had consoled himself we keep our crazy side to ourselves thats all we just go on for years and years doing and saying whatever happens to come upand really keen about it toohe had glanced up with a kind of challenge in his face at the squat little belfryand then without the slightest reason or warning down you go and it all begins to wear thin and you get wondering what on earth it all means memory slipped back for an instant to the life that in so unusual a fashion seemed to have floated a little aloof fortunately he had not discussed these inward symptoms with his wife how surprised sheila would be to see him loafing in this old crooked churchyard how she would lift her dark eyebrows with that handsome indifferent tolerance he smiled but a little confusedly yet the thought gave even a spice of adventure to the evenings ramble  he loitered on scarcely thinking at all now stooping here and there these faint listless ideas made no more stir than the sunlight gilding the fading leaves the crisp turf underfoot with a slight effort he stooped even once again       stranger a moment pause and stay      in this dim chamber hidden away      lies one who once found life as dear      as now he finds his slumbers here      pray then the judgement but increase      his deep everlasting peace  but then do you know you lie at peace lawford audibly questioned gazing at the doggerel and yet as his eyes wandered over the blunt green stone and the rambling crimsonberried brier that had almost encircled it with its thorns the echo of that whisper rather jarred he was he supposed rather a dull creatureat least people seemed to think soand he seldom felt at ease even with his own small facetiousness besides just that kind of question was getting very common now that cleverness was the fashion most people were clevereven perfect fools and cleverness after all was often only a bore all head and no body he turned languidly to the small crossshaped stone on the other side       here lies the body of ann hard who died in childbed                  also of james her infant son  he muttered the words over with a kind of mournful bitterness thats just itjust it thats just how it goes he yawned softly the pathway had come to an end beyond him lay ranker grass one and another obscurer mounds an old scarred oak seat shadowed by a few everlastingly green cypresses and coralfruited yewtrees and above and beyond all hung a pale blue arch of sky with a few voyaging clouds like silvered wool and the calm wide curves of stubble field and pasture land he stood with vacant eyes not in the least aware how queer a figure he made with his gloves and his umbrella and his hat among the stained and tottering gravestones then just to linger out his hour and half sunken in reverie he walked slowly over to the few solitary graves beneath the cypresses  one only was commemorated with a tombstone a rather unusual ovalheaded stone carved at each corner into what might be the heads of angels or of pagan dryads blindly facing each other with wornout sightless faces a low curved granite canopy arched over the grave with a crevice so wide between its stones that lawford actually bent down and slid in his gloved fingers between them he straightened himself with a sigh and followed with extreme difficulty the wellnigh illegible inscription       here lie ye bones of one      nicholas sabathier a stranger to this parish      who fell by his own hand on ye      eve of ste michael and all angels      mdccxxxix  of the date he was a little uncertain the hand had lost its n and d and all the angels rain had erased he was not quite sure even of the stranger there was a great rich s and the twisted tail of a g and whether or not lawford smilingly thought he is no stranger now but how rare and how memorable a name french evidently probably huguenot and the huguenots he remembered vaguely were a rather remarkable crowd he had he thought even played at huguenots once what was the mans name coligny yes of course coligny and i suppose lawford continued muttering to himself i suppose this poor beggar was put here out of the way they might you know he added confidentially raising the ferrule of his umbrella they might have stuck a stake through you and buried you at the crossroads and again a feeling of ennui a faint disgust at his poor little witticism clouded over his mind it was a pity thoughts always ran the easiest way like water in old ditches  here lie ye bones of one nicholas sabathier he began murmuring againmerely bones mind you brains and heart are quite another story and its pretty certain the fellow had some kind of brains besides poor devil he killed himself that seems to hint at brains oh for goodness sake he cried out so loud that the sound of his voice alarmed even a robin that had perched on a twig almost within touch with glittering eye intent above its dim red breast on this other and even rarer stranger  i wonder if it is xxxix it might be lxxix lawford cast a cautious glance over his round grey shoulder then laboriously knelt down beside the stone and peeped into the gaping cranny there he encountered merely the tiny palegreen faintly conspicuous eyes of a large spider confronting his own it was for the moment an alarming and yet a faintly fascinating experience the little almost colourless fires remained so changeless but still even when at last they had actually vanished into the recesses of that quiet habitation lawford did not rise from his knees an utterly unreasonable feeling of dismay a sudden weakness and weariness had come over him  what is the good of it all he asked himself inconsequentlythis monotonous restless stupid life to which he was soon to be returning and for good he began to realize how ludicrous a spectacle he must be kneeling here amid the weeds and grass beneath the solemn cypresses well you cant have everything seemed loosely to express his disquiet  he stared vacantly at the green and fretted gravestone dimly aware that his heart was beating with an unusual effort he felt ill and weak he leant his hand on the stone and lifted himself on to the low wooden seat nearby he drew off his glove and thrust his bare hand under his waistcoat with his mouth a little ajar and his eyes fixed on the dark square turret its bell sharply defined against the evening sky  dead a bitter inward voice seemed to break into speech dead the viewless air seemed to be flocking with hidden listeners the very clearness and the crystal silence were their ambush he alone seemed to be the target of cold and hostile scrutiny there was not a breath to breathe in this crisp pale sunshine it was all too rare too thin the shadows lay like wings everlastingly folded the robin that had been his only living witness lifted its throat and broke as if from the uttermost outskirts of reality into its shrill passionless song lawford moved heavy eyes from one object to anotherbirdsungilded stonethose two small earthworn faceshis handsa stirring in the grass as of some creature labouring to climb up it was useless to sit here any longer he must go back now fancies were all very well for a change but must be only occasional guests in a world devoted to reality he leaned his hand on the dark grey wood and closed his eyes the lids presently unsealed a little momentarily revealing astonished aggrieved pupils and softly slowly they again descended  the flaming rose that had swiftly surged from the west into the zenith dyeing all the churchyard grass a wild and vivid green and the stooping stones above it a pure faint purple waned softly back like a falling fountain into its basin in a few minutes only a faint orange burned in the west dimly illuminating with its band of light the huddled figure on his low wood seat his right hand still pressed against a faintly beating heart dusk gathered the first white stars appeared out of the shadowy fields a nightjar purred but there was only the silence of the falling dew among the graves down here under the inkblack cypresses the blades of the grass were stooping with cold drops and darkness lay like the hem of an enormous cloak whose jewels above the breast of its wearer might be in the unfathomable clearness the glittering constellations  in his small cage of darkness lawford shuddered and raised a furtive head he stood up and peered eagerly and strangely from side to side he stayed quite still listening as raptly as some wandering nightbeast to the indiscriminate stir and echoings of the darkness he cocked his head above his shoulder and listened again then turned upon the soundless grass towards the hill he felt not the faintest astonishment or strangeness in his solitude here only a little chilled and physically uneasy and yet in this vast darkness a faint spiritual exaltation seemed to hover  he hastened up the narrow path walking with knees a little bent like an old labourer who has lived a life of stooping and came out into the dry and dusty lane one moment his instinct hesitated as to which turn to takeonly a moment he was soon walking swiftly almost trotting downhill with this vivid exaltation in the huge dark night in his heart and sheila merely a little angry titianesque cloud on a scarcely perceptible horizon he had no notion of the time the golden hands of his watch were indiscernible in the gloom but presently as he passed by he pressed his face close to the cold glass of a little shopwindow and pierced that out by an old swiss cuckooclock he would if he hurried just be home before dinner  he broke into a slow steady trot gaining speed as he ran on vaguely elated to find how well his breath was serving him an odd smile darkened his face at remembrance of the thoughts he had been thinking there could be little amiss with the heart of a man who could shamble along like this taking even pleasure an increasing pleasure in this long wolflike stride he turned round occasionally to look into the face of some fellowwayfarer whom he had overtaken for he felt not only this unusual animation this peculiar zest but that like a boy on some secret errand he had slightly disguised his very presence was going masked as it were even his clothes seemed to have connived at this queer illusion no tailor had for these ten years allowed him so much latitude he cautiously at last opened his garden gate and with soundless agility mounted the six stone steps his latchkey ready in his gloveless hand and softly let himself into the house  sheila was out it seemed for the maid had forgotten to light the lamp without pausing to take off his greatcoat he hung up his hat ran nimbly upstairs and knocked with a light knuckle on his bedroom door it was closed but no answer came he opened it shut it locked it and sat down on the bedside for a moment in the darkness so that he could scarcely hear any other sound as he sat erect and still like some night animal wary of danger attentively alert then he rose from the bed threw off his coat which was clammy with dew and lit a candle on the dressingtable  its narrow flame lengthened drooped brightened gleamed clearly he glanced around him unusually contentedat the ruddiness of the low fire the brass bedstead the warm red curtains the soft silveriness here and there it seemed as if a heavy and dull dream had withdrawn out of his mind he would go again some day and sit on the little hard seat beside the crooked tombstone of the friendless old huguenot he opened a drawer took out his razors and faintly whistling returned to the table and lit a second candle and still with this strange heightened sense of life stirring in his mind he drew his hand gently over his chin and looked unto the glass  for an instant he stood head to foot icily still without the least feeling or thought or stirstaring into the lookingglass then an inconceivable drumming beat on his ear a warm surge like the onset of a wave broke in him flooding neck face forehead even his hands with colour he caught himself up and wheeled deliberately and completely round his eyes darting to and fro suddenly to fix themselves in a prolonged stare while he took a deep breath caught back his selfpossession and paused then he turned and once more confronted the changed strange face in the glass  without a sound he drew up a chair and sat down just as he was frigid and appalled at the foot of the bed to sit like this with a kind of incredibly swift torrent of consciousness bearing echoes and images like straws and bubbles on its surface could not be called thinking some stealthy hand had thrust open the sluice of memory and words voices faces of mockery streamed through without connection tendency or sense his hands hung between his knees a deep and settled frown darkened the features stooping out of the direct rays of the light and his eyes wandered like busy and inquisitive but stupid animals over the floor  if in that flood of unintelligible thoughts anything clearly recurred at all it was the memory of sheila he saw her face lit transfigured distorted stricken appealing horrified his lids narrowed a vague terror and horror mastered him he hid his eyes in his hands and cried without sound without tears without hope like a desolate child he ceased crying and sat without stirring and it seemed after an age of vacancy and meaninglessness he heard a door shut downstairs a distant voice and then the rustle of some one slowly ascending the stairs some one turned the handle in vain tapped is that you arthur  for an instant lawford paused then like a child listening for an echo answered yes sheila and a sigh broke from him his voice except for a little huskiness was singularly unchanged  may i come in lawford stood softly up and glanced once more into the glass his lips set tight and a slight frown settled between the long narrow intensely dark eyes  just one moment sheila he answered slowly just one moment  how long will you be  he stood erect and raised his voice gazing the while impassively into the glass  its no use he began as if repeating a lesson its no use your asking me sheila please give me a moment ai am not quite myself dear he added quite gravely  the faintest hint of vexation was in the answer  what is the matter cant i help its so very absurd  what is absurd he asked dully  why standing like this outside my own bedroom door are you ill i will send for dr simon  please sheila do nothing of the kind i am not ill i merely want a little time to think in there was again a brief pause and then a slight rattling at the handle  arthur i insist on knowing at once whats wrong this does not sound a bit like yourself it is not even quite like your own voice  it is myself he replied stubbornly staring fixedly into the glass you must give me a few moments sheila something has happened my face come back in an hour  dont be absurd its simply wicked to talk like that how do i know what you are doing as if i can leave you for an hour in uncertainty your face if you dont open at once i shall believe theres something seriously wrong i shall send ada for assistance  if you do that sheila it will be disastrous i cannot answer for the con go quietly downstairs say i am unwell dont wait dinner for me come back in an hour oh half an hour  the answer broke out angrily you must be mad beside yourself to ask such a thing i shall wait in the next room until you call  wait where you please lawford replied but tell them downstairs  then if i tell them to wait until halfpast eight you will come down you say you are not ill the dinner will be ruined its absurd  lawford made no answer he listened a while then he deliberately sat down once more to try to think like a squirrel in a cage his mind seemed to be aimlessly unceasingly astir what is it really what is it reallyreally he sat there and it seemed to him his body was transparent as glass it seemed he had no body at allonly the memory of an hallucinatory reflection in the glass and this inward voice crying arguing questioning threatening out of the silencewhat is it reallyreallyreally and at last cold wearied out he rose once more and leaned between the two long candleflames and stared ononon into the glass  he gave that long dark face that had been foisted on him tricks to dolift an eyebrow frown there was scarcely any perceptible pause between the wish and its performance he found to his discomfiture that the face answered instantaneously to the slightest emotion even to his fainter secondary thoughts as if these unfamiliar features were not entirely within control he could not in fact without the glass before him tell precisely what that face was expressing he was still it seemed keenly sane that he would discover for certain when sheila returned terror rage horror had fallen back if only he felt ill or was in pain he would have rejoiced at it he was simply caught in some unheardof snarecaught how when where by whom    chapter two  but the coolness and deliberation of his scrutiny had to a certain extent calmed lawfords mind and given him confidence hitherto he had met the little difficulties of life only to vanquish them with ease and applause now he was standing face to face with the unknown he burst out laughing into a long low helpless laughter then he arose and began to walk softly swiftly to and fro across the roomfrom wall to wall seven paces and at the fourth that awful unseen brightlylit profile passed as swiftly over the tranquil surface of the lookingglass the power of concentration was gone again he simply paced on mechanically listening to a babel of questions a conflicting medley of answers but above all the confusion and turmoil of his brain as a boatswains whistle rises above a storm so sounded that same infinitesimal voice incessantly repeating another question now what are you going to do what are you going to do  and in the midst of this confusion out of the infinite as it were came another sharp tap at the door and all within sank to utter stillness again  its nearly halfpast eight arthur i cant wait any longer  lawford cast a last fleeting look into the glass turned and confronted the closed door very well sheila you shall not wait any longer he crossed over to the door and suddenly a swift crafty idea flashed into his mind  he tapped on the panel sheila he said softly i want you first before you come in to get me something out of my old writingdesk in the smokingroom here is the key he pushed a tiny keyfrom off the ring he carriedbeneath the door in the third little drawer from the top on the left side is a letter please dont say anything now it is the letter you wrote me you will remember after i had asked you to marry me you scribbled in the corner under your signature the initials ysoado you remember they meant you silly old arthurdo you remember will you please get that letter at once  arthur answered the voice from without empty of all expression what does all this mean this mystery this hopeless nonsense about a silly letter what has happened is this a miserable form of persecution are you madi refuse to get the letter  lawford stooped black and angular against the door i am not mad oh i am in the deadliest earnest sheila you must get the letter if only for your own peace of mind he heard his wife hesitate as she turned he heard a sob and once more he waited  i have brought the letter came the low toneless voice again  have you opened it  there was a rustle of paper are the letters there underlined three timesysoa  the letters are there  and the date of the month is underneath april 3rd no one else in the whole world living or dead could know of this but ourselves sheila  will you please open the door  no one  i suppose notno one  then come in he unlocked the door and opened it a dark rather handsome woman with sleek hair in a silk dress of a dark rich colour entered lawford closed the door but his face was in shadow he had still a moments respite  i need not ask you to be patient he began quickly if i could possibly have spared youif there had been anybody in the world to go to i am in horrible horrible trouble sheila it is inconceivable i said i was sane so i am but the fact isi went out for a walk it was rather stupid perhaps so soon and i think i was taken ill or somethingmy heart a kind of fit a nervous fit possibly i am a little unstrung and its all its mainly fancy but i think i cant help thinking it has a little distortedchanged my face everything sheila except of course myself would you mind looking he walked slowly and with face averted towards the dressingtable  simply a nervousto make such a fuss to scare began his wife following him  without a word he took up the two old china candlesticks and held them one in each lankfingered hand before his face and turned  lawford could see his wifeevery tint and curve and line as distinctly as she could see him her cheeks never had much colour now her whole face visibly darkened from pallor to a dusky leaden grey as she gazed it was not an illusion then not a miserable hallucination the unbelievable the inconceivable had happened he replaced the candles with trembling fingers and sat down  well he said what is it really what is it really sheila what on earth are we to do  is the door locked she whispered he nodded with eyes fixed stirlessly on his face sheila unsteadily seated herself a little out of the candlelight in the shadow lawford rose and put the key of the door on his wifes little rosewood prayerdesk at her elbow and deliberately sat down again  you said a fitwhere  i supposeisis it very differenthopeless you will understand my being o sheila what am i to do his wife sat perfectly still watching him with unflinching attention  you gave me to understanda nervous fit where  lawford took a deep breath and quietly faced her again in the old churchyard widderstone i was looking atat the gravestones  a fit in the old churchyard widderstoneyou were looking at the gravestones  lawford shut his mouth i suppose soa fit he said presently my heart went a little queer and i sat down and fell into a kind of dozea stupor i suppose i dont remember anything more and then i woke like this  how do you know  how do i know what  like that  he turned slowly towards the lookingglass why here i am  she gazed at him steadily and a hard incredulous almost cunning glint came into her wide blue eyes she took up the key carelessly glanced at it glanced at him it has made mei mean the first shock you knowit has made me a little faint she walked slowly deliberately to the door and unlocked it ill get a little sal volatile she softly drew out the key and without once removing her eyes from his face opened the door and pushed the key noiselessly in on the other side please stay there i wont be a minute  lawfords face smileda rather desperate yet for all that a patient resolute smile oh yes of course he said almost to himself i had not foreseenat leastyou must do precisely what you please sheila you were going to lock me in you will however before taking any final step please think over what it will entail i did not think you would after such proof in this awful troublei did not think you would simply disbelieve me sheila who else is there to help me you have the letter in your hand isnt that sufficient proof it was overwhelming proof to me and even i doubted too doubted myself but never mind why i should have dreamed you would believe me or taken this awful thing differently i dont know its rather awful to have to go on alone but there think it over i shall not stir until i hear the voices and then honestly sheila i couldnt face quite that id sooner give up altogether any proof you can think ofi will o god i cannot bear it he covered his face with his hands but in a moment looked up unmoved once more why for that matter he added slowly and as it were with infinite pains a faint thin smile again stealing into his face i think he turned wearily to the glass i think its almost an improvement  something deep in those dark clear pupils out of that lean adventurous face gleamed back at him the distant flash of a heliograph as it were height to height flashing courage he shuddered and shut his eyes but i would really rather he aided in a quiet childlike way i would really rather sheila you left me alone now  his wife stood irresolute i understand you to explain she said that you went out of this house just your usual self this afternoon for a walk that for some reason you went to widderstoneto read the tombstones that you had a heart attack or as you said at first a fit that you fell into a stupor and came home likelike this am i likely to believe all that am i likely to believe such a story as that whoever you are whoever you may be is it likely i am not in the least afraid i thought at first it was some silly practical joke i thought that at first she paused but no answer came well i suppose in a civilised country there is a remedy even for a joke as wicked as that  lawford listened patiently she is pretending she is trying me she is feeling her way he kept repeating to himself she knows i am i but hasnt the courage let her talk  i shall leave the door open sheila continued i am not as you no doubt very naturally assumedi am not going to do anything either senseless or heedless i am merely going to ask your brother cecil to come in if he is at home and if not no doubt our old friend mr montgomery wouldwould help us her scrutiny was still and concentrated like that of a cat above a mouses hole  lawford sat crouched together in the candlelight by all means sheila he said slowly choosing his words if you think poor old cecil who next january will have been three years in his grave will be of any use in our difficulty who mr montgomery is his voice dropped in utter weariness you did it very well my dear he added softly  sheila gently closed the door and sat down on the bed he heard her softly crying he heard the bed shaken with her sobs but a slow glance towards the steady candleflames restrained him he let her cry on alone when she had become a little more composed he stood up you have had no dinner he managed to blurt out at last you will be faint its useless to talk even to think any more tonight leave me to myself for a while dont look at me any more perhaps i can sleep perhaps if i sleep it will come right again when the servants are gone up i will come down just let me have somesome medical book or other and some more candles dont think sheila dont even think  sheila paid him no attention for a while you tell me not to think she began in a low almost listless voice whyi wonder i am in my right mind and eat how can you have the heartlessness to suggest it you dont seem in the least to realize what you say you seem to have lost allall consciousness i quite agree it is useless for me to burden you with my company while you are in your present condition of mind but you will at least promise me that you wont take any further steps in this awful business she could not try as she would bring herself again to look at him she rose softly paused a moment with sidelong eyes then turned deliberately towards the door what what have i done to deserve all this  from behind her that voice so extraordinarily likeand yet in some vague fashion more arresting more resonant than her husbands broke incredibly out once more you will please leave the key sheila i am ill but i am not yet in the padded room and please understand i take no further steps in this awful business until i hear a strange voice in the house sheila paused but the quiet voice rang in her ear desperately yet convincingly she took the key out of the lock placed it on the bed and with a sigh that was not quite without a hint of relief in its misery she furtively extinguished the gaslight on the landing and rustled downstairs  she speedily returned i have brought the book she said hastily i could only find the one volume i have said you have taken a fresh chill no one will disturb you  lawford took the book without a word and once more with eyes stonily averted his wife left him to his own company and that of the face in the glass  when completely deserted lawford with fumbling fingers opened quains dictionary of medicine he had never had much curiosity and had always hated what he disbelieved but none the less he had heard occasionally of absurd and questionable experiments he remembered even to have glanced over reports of cases in the newspapers concerning disappearances loss of memory dual personality cranks oh yes he thought now with a sense of cold humiliating relief there had been such cases as his before they were no doubt curable they must be comparatively common in americathat land of jangled nerves possibly bromide rest a battery but quain it seemed shared his prejudices at least in this edition or had hidden away all such apocryphal matter beneath technical terms where no sensible man could find it besides he muttered angrily whats the good of your one volume he flung it down and strode to the bed and rang the bell then suddenly recollecting himself he paused and listened there came a tap on the door is that you sheila he called doubtfully  no sir its me came the answer  oh dont trouble i only wanted to speak to your mistress its all right  mrs lawford has gone out sir replied the voice  gone out  yes sir she told me not to mention it but i suppose as you asked  oh thats all right never mind i didnt ring he stood with face uplifted thinking  can i do anything sir came the faint nervous question after a long pause  one moment ada he called in a loud voice he took out his pocketbook sat down and scribbled a little note he hardly noticed how changed his handwriting wasthe clear round letters crabbed and irregular  are you there ada he called i am slipping a note beneath the door just draw back the mat thats it take it at once please to mr critchetts and be sure to wait for an answer then come back direct to me up here i dont think ada your mistress believes much in critchett but i have fully explained what i want he has made me up many prescriptions explain that to his assistant if he is not there go at once and you will be back before she is i should be so very much obliged tell him mr arthur lawford  the minutes slowly drifted by he sat quite still in the clear untroubled light waiting in the silence of the empty house and for the first time he was confronted with the cold incredible horror of his ordeal who would believe who could believe that behind this strange and awful yet how simple mask lay himself what test what heapedup evidence of identity would break it down it was all a loathsome ignominy it was utterly absurd it was  suddenly with a kind of apelike cunning he deliberately raised a long lean forefinger and pointed it at the shadowy crystal of the lookingglass perhaps he was dead was really and indeed changed in body was fated really and indeed to change in soul into that its that beastly voice again lawford cried out loud looking vacantly at his upstretched finger and then hand and arm not too willingly as it were obeyed relaxed and fell to his side you must keep a tight hold old man he muttered to himself once once you lose yourselfthe least symptom of thatthe least symptom and its all up and the fools the heartless preposterous fools had brought him one volume  when on earth was ada coming back she was lagging on purpose she was in the conspiracy too oh it should be a lesson to sheila oh if only daylight would come what are you going to doto doto do he rose once more and paced his silent cage to and fro thinking no more just using his eyes compelling them to wander from picture to picture bedpost to bedpost now counting aloud his footsteps now humming only only to keep himself from thinking at last he took out a drawer and actually began arranging its medley of contents ties letters studs concert and theatre programmesall higgledypiggledy and in the midst of this childish strategem he heard a faint sound as of heavy water trickling from a height he turned a thief was in one of the candles it was guttering out he would be left in darkness he turned hastily without a moments heed to call for light flung the door open and full in the flare of a lamp illuminating her pale forehead and astonished face beneath her black straw hat stood face to face with ada  with one swift dexterous movement he drew the door to after him looking straight into her almost colourless steady eyes ah he said instantly in a high faint voice the powder thank you yes mr lawfords powder thank you thank you he must be kept absolutely quietabsolutely mrs lawford is following please tell her that i am here when she returns mr critchett was in then thank you extreme extreme silence please again that knotted melodramatic finger raised itself on high and within that lean cadaverous body the soul of its lodger quailed at this spectral boldness but it was triumphant the maid at once left him and went downstairs he heard faint voices in muffled consultation and in a moment sheilas silks rustled once more on the staircase lawford put down the lamp and watched her deliberately close the door  what does this mean she began swiftly i understand thatada tells me a stranger is here giving orders directions who is he where is he you bound yourself on your solemn promise not to stir till i returned you how can i how can we get decently through this horrible business if you are so wretchedly indiscreet you sent ada to the chemists what for what for i say  lawford watched his wife with an almost extraneous interest she was certainly extremely interesting from that point of view that very novel point of view its quite useless he said to get in the least nervous or hysterical i dont care for the darkness just now that was all tell the girl i am a strange doctordr simons new partner you are clever at conventionalities sheila invent i said our patient must be kept quieti really think he must that is all so far as ada is concerned what on earth else are we to say he broke out that for the present to everybody is our only possible story it will give us what we must havetime and nextwhere is the second volume of quain i want that and nextwhy have you broken faith with me mrs lawford sat down this sudden and baffling outburst had stupefied her  i cant i cant make head or tail of what you say and as for having broken faith as you call it would any wife would any sane woman face what you have brought on us a situation like this without seeking advice and help mr bethany will be perfectly discreetif he thinks discretion desirable he is the only available friend we have close enough to ask at once and things of this kind are i suppose if anybodys concern his its certain to leak out everybody will hear of it dont flatter yourself you are going to hush up a thing like this for long you cant keep living skeletons in a cupboard you think only of yourself only of your own misfortune but whos to know pray that you really are my husbandif you are the sooner i get the vicar on my side the better for us both who in the whole of the parishi ask youand you must have the sense left to see thatwho will believe that a respectable man a gentleman a churchman would deliberately go out to seek an afternoons amusement in a poky little country churchyard why apart from everything else that was absolutely mad to start with can you really wonder at the result  probably because she still steadfastly refused to look at him her memory kept losing its hold on the appalling fact facing them she realised fully only that she was in a great unwarrantable and insurmountable difficulty but until she actually lifted her eyes for a moment she had not fully realised what that difficulty was she got up with a sudden and horrible nausea one moment she said i will see if the servants have gone to bed  that long saturnine face behind which lawford lay in a dull and desperate ambush smiled something partaking of its clay some reflex ghost of its rather remarkable features was even a little amused at sheila  she returned in a moment and stood in profile in the doorway will you come down she remarked distantly  one moment sheila lawford began miserably before we take this irrevocable step a step i implore you to postpone awhilefor what comes i suppose may gowhat precisely have you told the vicar i must in fairness know that  in fairness she began ironically and suddenly broke off her husband had turned the flame of the lamp low down in the vacant room behind them the corridor was lit obscurely by the chandelier far down in the hall below a faint inexplicable dread fell softly and coldly on her heart have you no trust in me she murmured a little bitterly i have simply told him the truth  they softly descended the stairs she first the dark figure following close behind her    chapter three  mr bethany sat awaiting them in the diningroom a large heavilyfurnished room with a great benign lookingglass on the mantelpiece a marble clock and with rich old damask curtains fleecy silver hair was all that was visible of their visitor when they entered but mr bethany rose out of his chair when he heard them and with a little jerk turned sharply round thus it was that the goldspectacled vicar and lawford first confronted each other the one brightly illuminated the other framed in the gloom of the doorway mr bethanys first scrutiny was timid and courteous but beneath it he tried to be keen and himself hastened round the table almost at a trot to obtain as delicately as possible a closer view but lawford having shut the door behind him had gone straight to the fire and seated himself leaning his face in his hands mr bethany smiled faintly waved his hand almost as if in blessing but certainly in peace and tapped mrs lawford into the chair upon the other side but he himself remained standing  mrs lawford has i declare been telling family secrets he began and paused peering but there you will forgive an old friends intrusionthis little confidence about a change my dear fellowabout a ramble and a change he sat down put up his kind little puckered face and peered again at lawford and then very hastily at his wife but all her attention was centred on the bowed figure opposite to her lawford responded to this cautious advance without raising his head  you do not wish me to repeat all that my wife tells me she has told you  dear me no said mr bethany cheerfully i wish nothing nothing old friend you must not burden yourself with me if i may be of any help here i am oh no no he paused with blinking eyes but wits still shrewd and alert why doesnt the man raise his head he thought a mere domestic dispute  i thought he went on ruminatingly i thought on tuesday yes on tuesday that you werent looking quite the thing indeed i remarked on it but now i understand from mrs lawford that the malady has taken a graver turneh lawford an heretical turn i hear you have been wandering from the true fold mr bethany leaned forward with what might be described as a very large smile in a very small compass and that of course entailed instant retribution he broke off solemnly i know widderstone churchyard well a most verdant and beautiful spot the late rector a mr strickland was a very old friend of mine and his wife dear good alicia used to set out her babies in the morning to sleep and to play there twenty dear me perhaps twentyfive years ago but i did not know my dear lawford that you and suddenly without an instants warning something seemed to shout at him look look he is looking at you he stopped faltered and a slight warmth came into his face and and you were taken ill there his voice had fallen flat and faint  i fell asleepor something of that sort came the stubborn reply  yes said mr bethany brightly so your wife was saying fell asleep so have i tooscores of times he beamed with beads of sweat glistening on his forehead and then im not im not persisting  then i woke refreshed i think as it seemedi felt much better and came home  ah yes said his visitor and after that there was a long brightly lit intense pause at the end of which lawford raised his face and again looked firmly at his friend  mr bethany was now a shrunken old man he sat perfectly still his head craned a little forward and his veined hands clutching his bent spare knees  there wasnt the least sign of devilry or outfacingness or insolence in that lean shadowy steady head and yet he himself was compelled to sidle his glance away so much the face shook him he closed his eyes too as a cat does after exchanging too direct a scrutiny with human eyes he put out towards and withdrew a groping hand from mrs lawford  is it came a voice from somewhere is it a great change sir i thought perhaps i may have exaggeratedcandlelight you know  mr bethany remained still and silent striving to entertain one thought at a time his lips moved as if he were talking to himself and again it was lawfords faltering voice that broke the silence you see he said i have never no fit or anything of that kind before i remember on tuesday oh yes quite well i did feel seedy very and we talked didnt weharvest festival mrs wines flowers the new offertorybags and all that for gods sake vicar it is not as bad asas they make out  mr bethany woke with a start he leaned forward and stretched out a long black wrinkled sleeve just managing to reach far enough to tap lawfords knee dont worry dont worry he said soothingly we believe we believe  it was none the less a sheer act of faith he took off his spectacles and took out his handkerchief what we must do eh my dear he half turned to mrs lawford what we must do is to consult yes consult together and laterwe must have advicemedical advice unless as i very much suspect it is merely a little quite temporary physical aberration science i am told is making great strides experimenting groping after things which no sane man has ever dreamed of beforewithout being burned alive for it whats in a name nerves especially lawford  mrs lawford sat perfectly still absorbedly listening turning her face first this way then that to each speaker in turn that is what i thought she said and cast one fleeting glance across at the fireplace but  the little old gentleman turned sharply with halfblind eyes and lips tight shut i think he said with a hind of austere humour i think do you know i see no but he paused as if to catch the echo and added its our only course he continued to polish round and round his glasses mrs lawford rather magnificently rose  perhaps if i were to leave you together awhile i shall not be far off it is she explained as if into a huge vacuum it is a terrible visitation she moved gravely round the table and very softly and firmly closed the door after her  lawford took a deep breath of course he said you realise my wife does not believe me she thinks he explained naively as if to himself she thinks i am an imposter goodness knows what she does think i cant think much myselffor long  the vicar rubbed busily on i have found lawford he said smoothly that in all real difficulties the only feasible plan isis to face the main issue the others right themselves now to take a plunge into your generosity you have let me in far enough to make it impossible for me to get outmay i hear then exactly the whole story all that i know now so far as i could gather from your wife poor soul is of course inconceivable that you went out one man and came home another you will understand my dear man i am speaking as it were by rote god has mercifully ordered that the human brain works slowly first the blow hours afterwards the bruise oh dear me that man humeon miraclespositively amazing so that too please you will be quite clear about credonot quia impossible est but because you lawford have told me now then if it wont be too wearisome to you the whole story he sat lean and erect in his big chair a hand resting loosely on each knee in one spectacles in the other a dangling pocket handkerchief and the dark sallow aquiline formidable figure with its oddly changing voice retold the whole story from the beginning  you were aware then of nothing different i understand until you actually looked into the glass  only vaguely i mean that after waking i felt much better more alert and my thoughts  ah yes your thoughts  i hardly knowoh clear as if i had had a real long rest it was just like being a boy again influenza dispirits one so  mr bethany gazed without stirring and yet you know he said i can hardly believe i mean conceive howyou have been taking no drugs no quackery lawford  i never dose myself said lawford with sombre pride  god bless me thats lawford to the echo thought his visitor and before he went on gently i really cannot conceive you see how a mere fit could before you sat down you were quite alone he stuck out his head there was nobody with you  with me oh no came the soft answer  what had you been thinking of in these days of faithcures and hypnotism and telepathy and subliminalitieswhy the simple old world grows very confusing but rarely very rarely novel you were thinking you say do you remember perhaps just the drift  well began lawford ruminatingly there was something curious even then perhaps i remember for instance i knelt down to read an old tombstone there was a little seatno back and an epitaph the sun was just setting some french name and there was a long jagged crack in the stone like the black line you know one sees after lightning i mean its as clear as that even now in memory oh yes i remember and then i suppose came the sleepstupid sluggish and then well here i am  you are absolutely certain then persisted mr bethany almost querulously there was no living creature near you bless me lawford i see no unkindness in believing what the bible itself relates there are powers supernatural saul and so on we are all convinced of that no one  i remember distinctly replied lawford in a calm stubborn voice i looked up all around me while i was kneeling there and there wasnt a soul to be seen because you see it even then occurred to me that it would have looked rather queermy wandering about like that i mean facing me there were some cypresstrees and beyond a low sunken fence and then just open country up above there were the gravestones toppling down the hill where i had just strolled down and sunshine he suddenly threw up his hand oh marvellous streaming in goldflaming like gods own antechamber  there was a very pregnant pause mr bethany shrunk back a little into his chair his lips moved he folded his spectacles  yes yes he said and then very quietly he stole one molelike look into his sidesmans face  what is dr simons number he said lawford was gazing gloomily into the fire oh annandale he replied absently i dont know the number  do you believe in him your wife mentioned him is he clever  oh hes new said lawford old james was our doctor hehe killed my father he laughed out shamefacedly  a sound lovable man said mr bethany one of the kindest men i ever knew and a very old friend of mine  and suddenly the dark face turned with a shudder from the fire and spoke in a low trembling voice only one thingonly one thingmy sanity my sanity if once i forget who will believe me he thrust his long lean fingers beneath his coat and mad he added i would sooner die  mr bethany deliberately adjusted his spectacles may i may i experiment he said boldly there came a tap on the door  bless me said the vicar taking out his watch it is a quarter to twelve yes yes mrs lawford he trotted round to the door we are beginning to see lighta ray  but ii can see in the dark whispered lawford as if at a cue turning with an inscrutable smile to the fire  the vicar came again wrapped up in a little tight grey greatcoat and a white silk muffler he looked up unflinching into lawfords face and tears stood in his eyes patience patience my dear fellow he repeated gravely squeezing his hand and rest complete rest is imperative just till the first thing tomorrow and till then he turned to mrs lawford where she stood looking in at the doorway oh yes complete quiet and caution  mrs lawford let him out he shook his head once or twice holding her fingers oh yes he whispered it is your husband not the smallest doubt i tried for myself but somethingsomething has happened dont fret him now have patience oh yes it is incredible the change but there the very first thing tomorrow she closed the door gently after him and stepping softly back to the diningroom peered in her husbands back was turned but he could see her in the lookingglass stooping a little with set face watching him in the silvery stillness  well he said is the old he doggedly met the fixed eyes facing him there is our old friend gone  yes said sheila hes gone lawford sighed and turned round its useless talking now sheila no more questions i cannot tell you how tired i am and my head  what is wrong with your head inquired his wife discreetly  the haggard face turned gravely and patiently only one of my old headaches he smiled my old bilious headachesthe hereditary lawford variety but his voice fell low again we must get to bed  with a rather pretty and childish movement sheila gently drew her hands across her silk skirts yes dear she said i have made up a bed for you in the large spare room it is thoroughly aired she came softly in hastened over to a closed worktable that stood under the curtains and opened it  lawford watched her utterly expressionless utterly motionless he opened his mouth and shut it again still watching his wife as she stooped with ridiculously too busy fingers searching through her coloured silks  again he opened his mouth yes he said and stalked slowly towards the door but there he paused god knows he said strangely and meekly i am sorry sorry for all this you will forgive me sheila  she looked up swiftly its very tiresome i cant find anywhere she murmured i cant find anywhere thethe little red box key  lawfords cheek turned more sallow than ever you are only pretending to look for it he said to try me we both know perfectly well the lock is broken ada broke it  sheila let fall the lid and yet for a while her eyes roved over it as if in violent search for something then she turned i am so very glad the vicar was at home she said brightly and mind mind you rest arthur theres nothing so bad but it might be worse oh i cant i cant bear it she sat down in the chair and huddled her face between her hands sobbing on and on without a tear  lawford listened and stared solemnly whatever it may be sheila i will be loyal he said  her sobs hushed and again cold horror crept over her nobody in the whole world could have said that i will be loyal quite like thatnobody but arthur she stood up patting her hair i dont think my brain would bear much more its useless to talk if you will go up i will put out the lamp    chapter four  one solitary and tall candle burned on the great dressingtable faint solitary pictures broke the blankness of each wall the carpet was rich the bed impressive and the basins on the washstand as uninviting as the bed lawford sat down on the edge of it in complete isolation he sat without stirring listening to his watch ticking in his pocket the china clock on the chimney piece pointed cheerfully to the hour of dawn it was exactly he computed carefully five hours and seven minutes fast not the slightest sound broke the stillness until he heard very very softly and gradually the key of his door turn in the oiled wards and realized that he was a prisoner  women were strange creatures how often he had heard that said he thought lamely he felt no anger no surprise or resentment at the trick it was only to be expected he could sit on till morning easily till morning he had never noticed before how empty a wellfurnished room could seem it was his own room too his best visitors room his fatherinlaw had slept here with his whiskers on that pillow his wifes most formidable aunt had been all night here alone with these pictures she certainly was but what are you doing here cried a voice suddenly out of his reverie  he started up and stretched himself and taking out the neat little packet that the maid had brought from the chemists he drew up a chair and sat down once more in front of the glass he sighed vacantly rose and lifted down from the wall above the fireplace a tinted photograph of himself that sheila had had enlarged about twelve years ago it was a brighter younger hairier but unmistakably the same dull indolent lawford who had ventured into widderstone churchyard that afternoon the cheek was a little plumper the eyes not quite so fulllidded the hair a little more precisely parted the upper lip graced with a small blonde moustache he tilted the portrait into the candlelight and compared it with this reflection in the glass of what had come out of widderstone feature with feature with perfect composure and extreme care then he laid down the massive frame on the table and gazed quietly at the tiny packet  it was to be a day of queer experiences he had never before realized with how many miracles mere everyday life is besieged here in this small punctilious packet lay a sesamea power of transformation beside which the transformation of that rather flaccid face of the noonday into this tense sinister face of midnight was but as a moving from house to housea change just as irrevocable and complete and yet so very normal which should it be that orhis face lifted itself once more to the icelike gloom of the lookingglassthat or this  it simply gazed back with a kind of quizzical pity on its lean features under the scrutiny of eyes so deep so meaningful so desolate and yet so indomitably courageous in the brain behind them a slow and stolid argument was in progress the one baffling reply on the one side to every appeal on the other being still simply what dreams may come  those eyes surely knew something of dreams else why this violent and stubborn endeavour to keep awake  lawford did indeed once actually frame the question but who the devil are you and it really seemed the eyes perceptibly widened or brightened the mere vexation of his unparalleled position sheilas pathetic incredulity his old vicars laborious kindness the tiresome network of experience into which he would be dragged struggling on the morrow and on the morrow after that and after thatthe thought of all these things faded for the moment from his mind lost if not their significance at least their instancy  he simply sat face to face with the sheer difficulty of living on at all he even concluded in a kind of lethargy that if nothing had occurred no change he might still be sitting here arthur rennet lawford in his best visitors room deciding between inscrutable life and justdeath he supposed he was tired out his thoughts hadnt even the energy to complete themselves none cared but himself and thisthis silence  but what does it all mean the insistent voice he was getting to know so well began tediously inquiring again and every time he raised his eyes or rather as in many cases it seemed his eyes raised themselves they saw this haunting face therea face he no longer bitterly rebelled at nor dimmed with scrutiny but a face that was becoming a kind of hold on life even a kind of refuge an ally it was a face that might have come out of a rather flashy book or such as is revered on the stage a rotten bad face he whispered at it in his own familiar slang after some such abrupt encounter a fearless packed daring fascinating face with evenwhata spice of genius in it whose the devils face was it what on earth was the matter brazen it out a jubilant thought cried suddenly follow it up play the game give me just one opening thinkthink what ive risked  and all these voices thought lawford in deadly lassitude meant only one thinginsanity a blazing impotent indignation seized him he leaned near peering as it were out of a red dusky mist he snatched up the china candlestick and poised it above the sardonic reflection as if to throw then slowly with infinite pains he drew back from the glass and replaced the candlestick on the table stuffed his paper packet into his pocket took off his boots and threw himself on to the bed in a little while in the faint still light he opened drowsily wondering eyes poor old thing his voice murmured poor old sheila    chapter five  it was but little after daybreak when mrs lawford after listening at his door a while turned the key and looked in on her husband bluegrey light from between the venetian blinds just dusked the room she stood in a bluish dressinggown her hand on her bosom looking down on the lean impassive face for the briefest instant her heart had leapt with an indescribable surmise to fall dull as lead once more breathing equably and quietly the strange figure lay stretched upon the bed how can he sleep how can he sleep she whispered with a black and hopeless indignation what a night she had had and he  she turned noiselessly away the candle had guttered to extinction the big glass reflected her voluminous and wan her darkringed eyes full lips rich glossy hair and rounded chin yes yes it seemed to murmur mournfully she turned away and drawing stealthily near stooped once more quite low and examined the face on the pillow with lynxlike concentration and though every nerve revolted at the thought she was finally convinced unwillingly but assuredly that her husband was here indeed if it were not so how could she for a single moment have accepted the possibility that he was a stranger he seemed to haunt like a ghostly emanation this strange detestable faceas memory supplies the features concealed beneath a mask the face was still and stony like one dead or imaged in wax yet beneath it dreams were passingsilly ordinary lawford dreams she was almost alarmed at the terribly rancorous hatred she felt for the face it was just like arthur to be so taken in  then she too remembered quain and remembered also in the slowly paling dusk that the house would soon be stirring she went out and noiselessly locked the door again but it was useless to begin looking for quain nowher husband had a good many dull books most of them his eccentric fathers what must the servants be thinking and what was all that talk about a mysterious visitor she would have to question adadiplomatically she returned to her room and sat down in an armchair and waited in sheer weariness she fell into a doze and woke at the sound of dustpan and broom she rang the bell and asked for hot water tea and a basin of cornflour  and please ada be as quiet as possible over your work your master is in a nice sleep and must not be disturbed on any account in the front bedroom she looked up suddenly by the way who let dr ferguson in last night it was dangerous but successful  dr ferguson maam oh you mean he was in  sheila smiled resignedly was in what do you mean was in and where were you then  i had been sent out to critchetts the chemists  of course of course so cook let dr ferguson in then why didnt you say so before ada and did you bring the medicine with you  it was a packet in an envelope maam but cook is sure she heard no knocknot while i was out so dr ferguson must have come in quite unbeknown  well really said sheila it seems very difficult to get at the truth sometimes and when illness is in the house i cannot understand why there should be no one available to answer the door you must have left it ajar unsecured when you went out and pray what if dr ferguson had been some common tramp that would have been a nice thing  i am quite certain said ada a little flatly that i did shut the door and cook says she never so much as stirred from the kitchen till i came down the area steps with the packet and thats all i know about it maam except that he was here when i came back i did not know even there was a dr ferguson and my mother has lived here nineteen years  we must be thankful your mother enjoys such good health replied mrs lawford suavely please tell cook to be very careful with the cornflourto be sure its well mixed and thoroughly done  mrs lawfords eyes followed with a certain discomfort those narrow print shoulders descending the stairs and this abominable ruse wasarthurs she ran up lightly and listened with her ear to the panel of his door and just as she was about to turn away again there came a little light knock at the front door  mrs lawford paused at the loop of the staircase and not altogether with gratitude or relief she heard the voice of mr bethany inquiring in cautious but quite audible tones after her husband  she dressed quickly and went down the little white old man looked very solitary in the long fireless drawingroom  i could not sleep he said i dont think i grasped in the least i dont indeed until i was nearly home the complexity of our problem i came in fact to a lamppost it was casting a peculiar shadow and thenyou know how such thoughts seize us my dearlike a sudden inspiration i realised how tenuous how appallingly tenuous a hold we every one of us have on our mere personality but that he continued rapidly thats only for ourselvesand after the event ours just now is to act and first  you really do thenyou really are convinced began mrs lawford  but mr bethany was too quick we must be most circumspect my dear friend we must be most circumspect for all our sakes and this youll say he added smiling stretching out his arms his soft hat in one hand his umbrella in the otherthis is being circumspecta seven oclock in the morning call but you see my dear i have come as i took the precaution of explaining to the maid because its now or never today it does so happen that i have to take a wedding for an old friends niece at witchett so when in need you see providence enables us to tell even the conventional truth now really how is he has he slept has he recalled himself at all is there any changeand dear me how are you  mrs lawford sighed a broken night is really very little to a mother she said he is still asleep he hasnt i think stirred all night  not stirred mr bethany repeated you baffle me and you have watched  oh no was the cheerful answer i felt that quiet solitude space was everything he preferred it so hehe changed alone i suppose dont you think it almost stands to reason that he will be alonewhen he comes back was i right but there its useless its worse than useless to talk like this my husband is gone some terrible thing has happened whatever the mystery may be he will never come back alive my only fear is that i am dragging you into a matter that should from the beginning have been entrusted tooh its monstrous it appeared for a moment as if she were blinking to keep back her tears yet her scrutiny seemed merely to harden  only the merest flicker of the folded eyelids over the greenish eyes of her visitor answered the challenge he stood small and black peeping fixedly out of the window at the sunflecked laurels  last night he said slowly when i said goodbye to your husband on the tip of my tongue were the words i have used in season and out of season for nearly fortyfive yearsgod knows best well my dear lady a sense of humour a sense of reverence or perhaps even a taint of scepticismcall it what you willjust intercepted them oh no not any of these my child just pity overwhelming pity god does know best but in a matter like this it is not even my place to say so it would be good for none of us to endanger our souls even with verbal cant now if do you think i had just five minutes talkfive minutes would it disquiet him  only by an almost undignified haste for the vicar was remarkably agile sheila managed to unlock the bedroom door without apparently his perceiving it and with a warning finger she preceded him into the great bedroom oh yes yes he was whispering to himself alonewell well he hung his hat on his umbrella and leaned it in a corner and then he turned  i dont think you know an old friend does him any wrong but last night i had no real oppor he firmly adjusted his spectacles and looked long into the dark dispassioned face  hm he said and fidgeted and peered again mrs lawford watched him keenly  do you still she began  but at the same moment he too broke silence suddenly stepping back with the innocent remark has hehas he asked for anything  only for quain  quain  the medical dictionary  oh yes bless me of course a calm complete sleep of utter prostrationutter nervous prostration and can one wonder poor fellow poor fellow he walked to the window and peered between the blinds sparrows sunshineyes and heres the postman he said as if to himself then he turned sharply round with mind made up  now do you leave me here he said take half an hours quiet rest he will be glad of a dull old fellow like me when he wakes and as for my pretty bride if i miss the train she must wait till the next good discipline my dear oh dear me i dont change what a precious experience now this would have been for a tottery talkative owlish old parochial creature like me but there there light words make heavy hearts i see i shall be quite comfortable no no i breakfasted at home theres hat and umbrella at 93 i can fly  mrs lawford thanked him mutely he smilingly but firmly bowed her out and closed the door  but eyes and brain had been very busy he had looked at the gutted candle at the tinted bland portrait on the dressingtable at the chair drawnup at the boots and now again he turned almost with a groan towards the sleeper then he took out an envelope on which he had jotted various memoranda and waited awhile minutes passed and at last the sleeper faintly stirred muttering  mr bethany stooped quickly what is it what is it he whispered  lawford sighed i was only dreaming sheila he said and softly peacefully opened his eyes i dreamed i was in the his lids narrowed his dark eyes fixed themselves on the anxious spectacled face bending over him mr bethany where whats wrong  his friend put out his hand there there he said soothingly do not be disturbed do not disquiet yourself  lawford struggled up slowly painfully consciousness returned to him he glanced furtively round the room at his clothes slinkingly at the vicar licked his lips flushed with extraordinary rapidity and suddenly burst into tears  mr bethany sat without movement waiting till he should have spent himself now lawford he said gently compose yourself old friend we must face the musiclike men he went to the window drew up the blind peeped out and took off his spectacles  the first thing to be done he said returning briskly to his chair is to send for simon now does simon know you well lawford shook his head would he recognise you i mean  i have only met him oncein the evening  good let him come immediately then tell him just the facts if i am not mistaken he will poohpooh the whole thing tell you to keep quiet not to worry and so on my dear fellow if we realised say typhoid whod dare to face it that will give us time to wait a while to recover our breath to see what happens next and ifas i dont believe for a momentwhy in that case i heard the other day of a most excellent mangrosser of wimpole street nerves he would be absorbed hell bottle you in spirit lawford well have him down quietly you see but there wont be any necessity oh no by then light will have come we shall remember what i mean is this he crossed his legs and pushed out his lips we are on quaky ground and its absolutely essential that you keep cool and trust i am yours heart and soulyou know that i own frankly at first i was shaken and i have i confess been very cunning but first faith then evidence to bolster it up the faith was absolutehe placed one firm hand on lawfords kneewhy i cannot explain but it was the evidence is convincing but there are others to think of the shock the incredibleness the consequences we must not scan too closely think with never against and bang go all the arguments your wife poor dear believes but of course of course she is horribly he broke off of course she is shaken you old simpleton time will heal all that time will wear out the mask time will tire out this detestable physical witchcraft the mind the selfs the thing old fogey though i may seem for saying itthat must be kept unsmirched we wont go wearily over the painful subject again you told me last night dear old friend that you were absolutely alone at widderstone that is enough but here we have visible facts tangible effects and there must have been a definite reason and a cause for them i believe in the devil in the powers of darkness lawford as firmly as i believe he and they are powerlessin the long run theywhat shall we sayhave surrendered their intrinsicality you can just go through evil as you can go through a sewer and come out on the other side too a loathsome process too but therewe are not speaking of any such monstrosities and even if we were you and i with gods help would just tire them out and that ally gone our poor dear old mrs grundy will at once capitulate eh eh  through all this long and arduous harangue consciousness like the gradual light of dawn had been flooding that other brain and the face that now confronted mr bethany though with his feeble unaided sight he could only very obscurely discern it was vigilant and keen in every sharpcut hungry feature  a rather prolonged silence followed the visitor peering mutely the black eyes nearly closed the face turned slowly towards the window saw burntout candle comprehensive glass  yes yes he said ill send for simon at once  good said mr bethany and more doubtfully repeated good now theres only one thing left he went on cheerfully i have jotted down a few test questions here they are questions no one on this earth could answer but you lawford they are merely for external proofs you wont you cant mistake my motive we cannot foretell or foresee what need may arise for just such jogtrot primitive evidence i propose that you now answer them here in writing  lawford stood up and walked to the lookingglass and paused he put his hand to his head es he said of course its a rattling good move im not quite awake myself i mean ill do it now he took out a pencil case and tore another leaf from his pocketbook what are they  mr bethany rang the bell sheila herself answered it she stood on the threshold and looked across through a shaft of autumnal sunshine at her husband and her husband with a quiet strange smile looked across through the sunshine at his wife mr bethany waited in vain  i am just going to put the archimpostor through his credentials he said tartly now then lawford he read out the questions one by one from his crafty little list pursing his lips between each and one by one lawford seated at the dressingtable fluently scribbled his answers then question and answer were rigorously compared by mr bethany with small white head bent close and spectacles poised upon the powerful nose and signed and dated and passed to mrs lawford without a word  mrs lawford read question and answer where she stood in complete silence she looked up many of these questions i dont know the answers to myself she said  it is immaterial said mr bethany  one answer isis inaccurate yes yes quite so due to a mistake in a letter from myself  mrs lawford read quietly on folded the papers and held them out between finger and thumb thehandwriting she remarked very softly  wonderful isnt it said mr bethany warmly all the general look and run of the thing different but every real essential feature unchanged now into the envelope and now a little wax  mrs lawford stood waiting theres a green piece of sealingwax almost drawled the quiet voice in the top right drawer of the nest in the study which old james gave me the christmas before last he glanced with lowered eyelids at his wifes flushed cheek their eyes met  thank you she said  when she returned the vicar was sitting in a chair leaning his chin on the knobbed handle of his umbrella he rose and lit a taper for her with a match from a little green pot on the table and mrs lawford with trembling fingers sealed the letter as he directed with his own seal  there he said triumphantly how many more such brilliant lawyers i wonder lie dormant in the church and who shall keep this why all three of course he went on without pausing some little drawer now secret and undetectable with a lock just such a little drawer that locked itself with a spring lay by chance in the lookingglass there the letter was hidden and mr bethany looked at his watch nineteen minutes he said the next thing my dear childwere getting on swimminglyand its astonishing how things are simplified by mere usethe next thing is to send for simon  sheila took a deep breath but did not look up i am entirely in your hands she replied  so be it said he crisply get to bed lawford its better so and ill look in on my way back from witchett i came my dear fellow in gloomy disturbance of mind it was getting up too early it fogs old brains goodbye goodbye  he squeezed lawfords hand then with umbrella under his arm his hat on his head his spectacles readjusted he hurried out of the room mrs lawford followed him for a few minutes lawford sat motionless with head bent a little and eyes restlessly scanning the door then he rose abruptly and in a quarter of an hour was in bed alone with his slow thoughts while a basin of cornflour stood untasted on a little table at his bedside and a cheerful fire burned in the best visitors rooms tiny grate  at halfpast eleven dr simon entered this soundless seclusion he sat down beside lawford and took temperature and pulse then he half closed his lids and scanned his patient out of an unusually dark unenglish face with straight black hair and listened attentively to his rather incoherent story it was a story very much modified and rounded off nor did lawford draw dr simons attention to the portrait now smiling conventionally above their heads from the wall over the fireplace  it was rather bleakthe wind and i think perhaps i had had a touch of influenza it was a silly thing to do but still dr simon one doesnt expectwell there i dont feel the same manphysically i really cannot explain how great a change has taken place and yet i feel perfectly fit in myself and if it were not forfor being laughed at go back to town today why my wife scarcely recognised me  dr simon continued his scrutiny try as he would lawford could not raise his downcast eyes to meet direct the doctors polite attention  and what said dr simon what precisely is the nature of the change have you any pain  no not the least pain said lawford i think perhaps or rather my face is a little shrunkenand yet lengthened at least it feels so and a faint twinge of rheumatism but my hairwell i dont know its difficult to say ones self he could get on so very much better he thought if only his mind would be at peace and these preposterous promptings and voices were still  dr simon faced the window and drew his hand softly over his head we never can be too cautious at a certain age and especially after influenza he said it undermines the whole system and in particular the nervous system leaving the mind the prey of the most melancholy fancies i should astound you mr lawford with the devil influenza plays a slight nervous shock and a chill quite slight i hope a few days rest and plenty of nourishment theres nothing temperature inconsiderable all perfectly intelligible most certainly reassure yourself and as for the change you speak ofhe looked steadily at the dark face on the pillow and smiled amiablyi dont think we need worry much about that it certainly was a bleak wind yesterdayand a cemetery my dear sir it was indiscreetyes very he held out his hand you must not be alarmed he said very distinctly with the merest trace of an accent air sunshine quiet nourishment sleepthat is all the little window might be a few inches open andand any light reading  he opened the door and joined mrs lawford on the staircase he talked to her quietly over his shoulder all the way downstairs it was it was sporting with providencea wind believe me nearly due east in spite of the warm sunshine  but the changethe change mrs lawford managed to murmur tragically as he strode to the door dr simon smiled and gracefully tapped his forehead with a redgloved forefinger  humour him humour him he repeated indulgently rest and quiet will soon put that little trouble out of his head oh yes i did notice itthe set drawn look and the droop quite so good morning  mrs lawford gently closed the door after him a glimpse of ada crossing from room to room suggested a precaution she called out in her clearest notes if dr ferguson should call while i am out ada will you please tell him that dr simon regretted that he was unable to wait thank you she paused with hand on the balusters then slowly ascended the stairs her husbands face was turned to the ceiling his hands clasped above his head she took up her stand by the fireplace resting one silkslippered foot on the fender dr simon is reassuring she said but i do hope arthur you will follow his advice he looks a fairly clever man but with a big practice do you think dear he quite realised the extent of thethe change  i told him what happened said her husbands voice out of the bedclothes  yes yes i know said sheila soothingly but we must remember he is comparatively a stranger he would not detect  what did he tell you asked the voice  mrs lawford deliberately considered if only he would always thus keep his face concealed how much easier it would be to discuss matters rationally you see dear she said softly i know of course nothing about the nerves but personally i think his suggestion absurd no mere fancy surely can make a lasting alteration in ones face and your hairi dont want to say anything that may seem unkindbut isnt it really quite a distinct shade darker arthur  any great strain will change the colour of a mans hair said lawford stolidly at any rate to white why i read once of a fellow in india a hindoo or something who  but have you had any intense strain or anxiety broke in sheila you might at least have confided in me that is unlessbut there dont you think really arthur it would be much more satisfactory in every way if we had further advice at once alice will be home next week tomorrow is the harvest festival and next week of course the dedication and in any case the bazaar is out of the question they will have to find another stallholder we must do our utmost to avoid comment or scandal every minute must help toto fix a thing like that i own even now i cannot realise what this awful calamity means its useless to brood on it we must as the poor dear old vicar said only last night keep our heads clear but i am sure dr simon was under a misapprehension if now it was explained to him a little more fully arthura photograph oh anything on earth but this dreadful wearing uncertainty and suspense besides is simon quite an english name  lawford drew further into his pillow do as you think best sheila he said for my own part i believe it may be as he suggestspartly an illusion a touch of nervous breakdown it simply cant be as bad as i think it is if it were you would not be here talking like this and bethany wouldnt have believed a word i said whatever it is its no good crying it on the housetops give me time just time besides how do we know what he really thought doctors dont tell their patients everything give the poor chap a chance and more so if he is a foreigner heshis voice sank almost to a whisperhes no darker than this and do please sheila take this infernal stuff away and let me have something solid im not illin that way all i want is peace and quiet time to think let me fight it out alone its been sprung on me the worsts not over but ill win through wait and if notwell you shall not suffer sheila dont be afraid there are other ways out  sheila broke down any one would think to hear you talk that i was perfectly heartless i told ada to be most careful about the cornflour and as for other ways out its a positively wicked thing to say to me when im nearly distracted with trouble and anxiety what motive could you have had for loitering in an old cemetery and in an east wind its useless for me to remain here arthur to be accused of every horrible thing that comes into a morbid imagination i will leave you as you suggest in peace  one moment sheila answered the muffled voice i have accused you of nothing if you knew all if you could read my thoughts you would be surprised perhaps at mybut never mind that on the other hand i really do think it would be better for the present to discuss the thing no more today is friday give this miserable face a week talk it over with bethany if you like but i forbidhe struggled up in bed sallow and sinisteri flatly forbid please understand any other interference till then afterwards you must do exactly as you please send round the town crier but till then silence  sheila with raised head confronted him this then is your gratitude so be it silence no doubt until its too late to take action until you have wormed your way in and think you are safe to have believed where is my husband that is what i am asking you now when and how you have learned his secrets god only knows and your conscience but he always was a simpleton at heart i warn you then until next thursday i consent to say nothing provided you remain quiet make no disturbance no scandal here the servants and all who inquire shall simply be told that my husband is confined to his room withwith a nervous breakdown as you have yourself so glibly suggested i am at your mercy i own it the vicar believes your preposterous storywith his spectacles off you would convince anybody with the wicked cunning with which you have cajoled and wheedled him with which you have deceived and fooled a foreign doctor but you will not convince me you will not convince alice i have friends in the world though you may not be aware of it who will not be quite so apt to believe any cockandbull story you may see fit to invent that is all i have to say tonight i tell the vicar all that i have just told you and from this moment please we are strangers i shall come into the room no more than necessity dictates on friday we resume our real parts my husbandarthurtoto connive at phh  rage had transfigured her she scarcely heard her own words they poured out senselessly monotonously one calling up another as if from the lips of a cassandra lawford sank back into bed clutching the sheets with both lean hands he took a deep breath and shut his mouth  it reminds me sheila he began arduously of our first quarrel before we were married the evening after your aunt rose died at llandudnodo you remember you threw open the window and i thinki saved your life a pause followed then a queer almost inarticulate voice added at least i am afraid so  a cold and awful quietness fell on sheilas heart she stared fixedly at the tuft of dark hair the only visible sign of her husband on the pillow then taking up the basin of cold cornflour she left the room in a quarter of an hour she reappeared carrying a tray with ham and eggs and coffee and honey invitingly displayed she laid it down  there is only one other question she said with perfect composurethat of money your signature as it appears on thethe document drawn up this morning would of course be quite useless on a cheque i have taken all the money i could find it is in safety you may however conceivably be in need of some yourself here is five pounds i have my own chequebook and shall therefore have no need to consider the question again forfor the present so far as you are concerned i shall be guided solely by mr bethany he will i do not doubt take full responsibility  and may the lord have mercy on my soul uttered a stifled unfamiliar voice from the bed mrs lawford stooped arthur she cried faintly arthur  lawford raised himself on his elbow with a sigh that was very near to being a sob oh sheila if youd only be your real self what is the use of all this pretence just consider my position a little the fear and horror are not all on your side you called me arthur even then id willingly do anything you wish to save you pain you know that cant we be friends even in thisthis ghastlywont you sheila  mrs lawford drew back struggling with a doubtful heart  i think she said it would be better not to discuss that now  the rest of the morning lawford remained in solitude    chapter six  there were three books in the roomjeremy taylors holy living and dying a volume of the quiver and a little gilded book on wildflowers he read in vain he lay and listened to the uproar of his thoughts on which an occasional soundthe droning of a fly the cry of a milkman the noise of a passing vanobtruded from the workaday world the pale gold sunlight edged softly over the bed he ate up everything on his tray he even on the shoals of nightmare dreamed awhile but by and by as the hours wheeled slowly on he grew less calm less strenuously resolved on lying there inactive every sparrow that twittered cried reveille through his brain he longed with an ardour strange to his temperament to be up and doing  what if his misfortune was as he had in the excitement of the moment suggested to sheila only a morbid delusion of mind shared too in part by sheer force of his absurd confession even if he was going mad who knows how peaceful a release that might not be could his shrewd old vicar have implicitly believed in him if the change were as complete as he supposed it he flung off the bedclothes and locked the door he dressed himself noticing he fancied with a deadly revulsion of feeling that his coat was a little too short in the sleeves his waistcoat too loose in the midst of his dressing came sheila bringing his luncheon im sorry he called out stooping quickly beside the bed i cant talk now please put the tray down  about half an hour afterwards he heard the outer door close and peeping from behind the curtains saw his wife go out all was drowsily quiet in the house he devoured his lunch like a schoolboy that finished to the last crumb without a moments delay he covered his face with a towel locked the door behind him put the key in his pocket and ran lightly downstairs he stuffed the towel into an ulster pocket put on a soft widebrimmed hat and noiselessly let himself out then he turned with an almost hysterical delight and ranran like the wind without pausing without thinking straight on up one turning down another until he reached a broad open common thickly wooded sprinkled with gorse and hazel and may and faintly purple with fading heather there he flung himself down in the beautiful sunlight among the yellowing bracken to recover his breath  he lay there for many minutes thinking almost with composure flight it seemed had for the moment quietened the demands of that other feebly struggling personality which was beginning to insinuate itself into his consciousness which had so miraculously broken in and taken possession of his body he would not think now all he needed was a little quiet and patience before he threw off for good and all his right to be free to be his own master to call himself sane  he scrambled up and turned his face towards the westering sun what was there in the stillness of its beautiful splendour that seemed to sharpen his horror and difficulty and yet to stir him to such a daring and devilry as he had never known since he was a boy there was little sound of life somewhere an unknown bird was singing and a few late bees were droning in the bracken all these years he had like an old blind horse stolidly plodded round and round in a dull selfset routine and now just when the spirit had come for rebellion the mood for a harmless truancy there had fallen with them too this hideous enigma he sat there with the dusky silhouette of the face that was now drenched with sunlight in his minds eye he set off again up the stony incline  why not walk on and on in time real wholesome weariness would come he could sleep at ease in some pleasant wayside inn without once meeting the eyes that stood as it were like a window between himself and a shrewd incredulous scoffing world that would turn him into a monstrosity and his story into a fable and in a little while perhaps in three days he would awaken out of this engrossing nightmare and know he was free this black dog gone from his back and as the old saying expressed it without any one dreaming what it really meant his own man again how astonished sheila would be how warmly she would welcome him oh yes of course she would  he came again to a standstill no voice answered him out of that illimitable gold and blue nothing seemed aware of him but as he stood there doubtful as cain on the outskirts of the unknown he caught the sound of a footfall on the lonely and stonestrewn path  the ground sloped steeply away to the left and slowly mounting the hillside came mildly on an old lady he knew a miss sinnet an old friend of his mothers there was just such a little seat as that other he knew so well on the brow of the hill he made his way to it intending to sit quietly there until the little old lady had passed by up and up she came her large bonnet appeared and then her mild white face inclined a little towards him as she ascended evidently this very seat was her goal and evasion was impossible evasion memory rushed back and set his pulses beating he turned boldly to the sun and the old lady with a brief glance into his face composed herself at the other end of the little seat she gazed out of a gentle reverie into the golden valley and so they sat a while and almost as if she had felt the bond of acquaintance between them she presently sighed and addressed him a very very beautiful view sir  lawford paused then turned a gloomy earnest face gilded with sunshine beautiful indeed he said but not for me no miss sinnet not for me  the old lady gravely turned and examined the aquiline profile well i confess she remarked urbanely you have the advantage of me  lawford smiled uneasily believe me it is little advantage  my sight said miss sinnet precisely is not so good as i might wish though better perhaps than i might have hoped i fear i am not much wiser your face is still unfamiliar to me  it is not unfamiliar to me said lawford whose trickery was this he thought putting such affected stuff into his mouth  a faint lightening of pity came into the silvery and scrupulous countenance ah dear me yes she said courteously  lawford rested a lean hand on the seat and have you he asked not the least recollection in the world of my face  now really she said smiling blandly is that quite fair think of all the scores and scores of faces in seventy long years and how very treacherous memory is you shall do me the service of reminding me of one whose name has for the moment escaped me  i am the son of a very old friend of yours miss sinnet said lawford quietly a friend that was once your schoolfellow at brighton  well now said the old lady grasping her umbrella that is undoubtedly a clue but then you see all but one of the friends of my girlhood are dead and if i have never had the pleasure of meeting her son unless there is a decided resemblance how am i to recollect her by looking at him  there is i believe a likeness said lawford  she nodded her great bonnet at him with gentle amusement you are insistent in your fancy well let me think again the last to leave me was fanny urquhart that waslet me seelast october now you are certainly not fanny urquharts son she stooped austerely for she never had one last year too i heard that my dear dear mrs jameson was dead her i hadnt met for many many years but if i may venture to say so yours is not a scottish face and she not only married a scottish husband but was herself a dunbar no i am still at a loss  a miserable strife was in her chance companions mind a strife of anger and recrimination he turned his eyes wearily to the fast declining sun you will forgive my persistency but i assure you it is a matter of life or death to me is there no one my face recalls my voice  miss sinnet drew her long lips together her eyebrows lifted with the faintest perturbation but he certainly knows my name she said to herself she turned once more and in the still autumnal beauty beneath that pale blue arch of evening these two human beings confronted one another again she eyed him blandly yet with a certain grave directness  i dont really think she said you can be mary lawfords son i could scarcely have mistaken him  lawford gulped and turned away he hardly knew what this surge of feeling meant was it hope despair resentment had he caught even the echo of an unholy joy his mind for a moment became confused as if in the tumult of a struggle he heard himself expostulate ah miss bennett i fear i set you too difficult a task  the old lady drew abruptly in like a trustful and gentle snail into its shocked house bennett sir but my name is not bennett  and again lawford accepted the miserable prompting not bennett how can i ever then apologise for so frantic a mistake  the little old lady took firm hold of her umbrella she did not answer him the likeness the likeness he began unctuously and stopped for the glance that dwelt fleetingly on him was cold with the formidable dignity and displeasure of age he raised his hat and turned miserably home he strode on out of the last gold into the blue twilight what fantastic foolery of mind was mastering him he cast a hurried look over his shoulder at the kindly and offended old figure sitting there solitary on the little seat in her great bonnet with back turned resolutely upon himthe friend of his dead mother who might have proved in his need a friend indeed to him and he had by this insane caprice hopelessly estranged her  she would remember this face well enough now he thought bitterly and would take her place among his quiet enemies if ever the day of reckoning should come it was scandalous it was banal to have abused her trust and courtesy oh it was hopeless to struggle any more the fates were against him they had played him a trick he was to be their transitory sport as many a better man he could himself recollect had been before him he would go home and give in let sheila do with him what she pleased no one but a lunatic could have acted as he had with just that frantic hint of method so remarkable in the insane  he left the common a lamplighter was lighting the lamps a thin evening haze was on the air if only he had stayed at home that fateful afternoon who what had induced him enticed him to venture out and even with the thought welled up into his mind an intense desire to go to the old green timeworn churchyard again to sit there contentedly alone where none heeded the completest metamorphosis down beside the yewtrees what a fool he had been there alone of course lay his only possible chance of recovery he would go tomorrow perhaps sheila had not yet discovered his absence and there would be no difficulty in repeating so successful a stratagem  remembrance of his miserable mistake of miss sinnet faintly returned to him as he swiftly mounted the steps to his porch poor old lady he would make amends for his discourtesy when he was quite himself again she should some day hear perhaps his infinitely tragic infinitely comic experience from his own lips he would take her some flowers some old keepsake of his mothers what would he not do when the old moods and brains of the stupid arthur lawford whom he had appreciated so little and so superficially came back to him  he ran up the steps and stopped dead his hand in his pocket chilled and aghast sheila had taken his keys he stood there dazed and still beneath the dim yellow of his own fanlight and once again that inward spring flew back brazen it out brazen it out knock and ring  he knocked flamboyantly and rang  there came a quiet step and the door opened dr simon of course has called he inquired suavely  yes sir  ah and goneas i feared and mrs lawford  i think mrs lawford is in sir  lawford put out a detaining hand we will not disturb her we will not disturb her i can find my way up oh yes thank you  but ada still palely barred the way i think sir she said mrs lawford would prefer to see you herself she told me most particularly all callers and mr lawford was not to be disturbed on any account  disturbed god forbid said lawford but his dark eyes failed to move these lightest hazel well he continued nonchalantly perhapsperhaps itwould be as well if mrs lawford should know that i am here no thank you i wont come in please go and tell but even as the maid turned to obey sheila herself appeared at the diningroom door in hat and veil  lawford hesitated an immeasurable moment in one swift glance he perceived the lamplit mystery of evening beckoning calling pleadingfly fly homes here for you begin again begin again and there before him in quiet and hostile decorum stood maid and mistress he took off his hat and stepped quickly in  so late so very late i fear he began glibly a sudden call a perfectly impossible distance shall we disturb him do you think  wouldnt it began sheila softly be rather a pity perhaps dr simon seemed to think but of course you must decide that  ada turned quiet small eyes  no no by no means he almost mumbled  and a hard slow smile passed over sheilas face excuse me one moment she said i will see if he is awake she swept swiftly forward superb and triumphant beneath the gaze of those dark restless eyes but so still was home and street that quite distinctly a clear and youthful laughter was heard and light footsteps approaching sheila paused ada in the act of closing the door peered out miss alice maam she said  and in this infinitesimal advantage of time dr ferguson had seized his vanishing opportunity and was already swiftly mounting the stairs mrs lawford stood with veil half raised and coldly smiling lips and as if it were by prearrangement her daughters laughing greeting from the garden and from the landing above her a faint ah and how are we now broke out simultaneously and ada silent and discreet had thrown open the door again to the twilight and to the young people ascending the steps  lawford was still sitting on his bed before a cold and ashy hearth when sheila knocked at the door  yes he said whos there no answer followed he rose with a shuddering sigh and turned the key his wife entered  that little exhibition of finesse was part of our agreement i suppose  i say began lawford  to creep out in my absence like a thief and to return like a mountebank that was part of our compact  i say he stubbornly began again did you wire for alice  will you please answer my question am i to be a mere catspaw in your intrigues in this miserable masquerade before the servants to set the whole place ringing with the name of a doctor that doesnt exist and a bedridden patient that slips out of the house with his bedroom key in his pocket are you aware that ada has been hammering at your door every halfhour of your absence are you aware of that how much she continued in a low bitter voice how much should i offer for her discretion  who was that with alice inquired the same toneless voice  i refuse to be ignored i refuse to be made a child of will you please answer me  lawford turned look here sheila he began heavily what about alice if you wired well its useless to say anything more but if you didnt i ask you just this one thing dont tell her  oh i perfectly appreciate a fathers natural anxiety  her husband drew up his shoulders as if to receive a blow yes yes he said but you wont  the sound of a young laughing voice came faintly up from below how did jimmie fortescue know she was coming home today  will you not inquire of jimmie fortescue for yourself  oh what is the use of sneering began the dull voice again i am horribly tired sheila and try how you will you cant convince me that you believe for a moment that i am not myself that you are as hard as you pretend an acquaintance even a friend might be deceived but husband and wifeoh no it isnt only a mans face thats himselfor even his hands he looked at them straightened them slowly out and buried them in his pockets all i care about now is alice is she or is she not going to be told i am simply asking you to give her just a chance  simply asking me to give alice a chance now isnt that really just a little  lawford slowly shook his head you know in your heart it isnt sheila you understand me quite well although you persistently pretend not to i cant argue now i cant speak up for myself i am just about as far down as i can go its only alice  i see a lucid interval suggested his wife in a low trembling voice  yes yes if you like said her husband patiently a lucid interval dont please look at my face like that sheila thinkthink that its just lupus just some horrible disfigurement  not much light was in the large room and there was something so extraordinarily characteristic of her husband in those stooping shoulders in the head hung a little forward and in the preternaturally solemn voice that sheila had to bend a little over the bed to catch a glimpse of the sallow and keener face again she sighed and even on her own strained ear her sigh sounded almost like one of relief  its useless i know to ask you anything while you are in this mood continued lawford dully i know that of old  the white ringed hands clenched of old  i didnt mean anything dont listen to what i say its onlyits just alice knowing that was all i mean at once  dont for a moment suppose i am not perfectly aware that it is only alice you think of you were particularly anxious about my feelings werent you you broke the news to me with the tenderest solicitude i am glad ourour daughter shares my husbands love  look here said lawford densely you know that i love you as much as ever but with thisas i am what would be the good of my saying so mrs lawford took a deep breath  and a voice called softly at the door mother are you there is father awake may i come in  in a flash the memory returned to her twentyfour hours ago she was asking that very question of this unspeakable figure that sat hunchedup before her  one moment dear she called and added in a very low voice come here  lawford looked up what he said  perhaps perhaps she whispered it isnt quite so bad  for mercys sake sheila he said dont torture me tell the poor child to go away  she paused are you there alice would you mind father says waiting a little he is so very tired  too tired to oh very well mother  mrs lawford opened the door and called after her is jimmie gone  oh yes hours  where did you meet  i couldnt get a carriage at the station he carried my dressingbag i begged him not to the others coming on you know what jimmie is how very very lucky i did come home i dont know what made me just an impulse they did laugh at me so father deardo speak to me how are you now  lawford opened his mouth gulped and shook his head  ssh dear whispered sheila i think he has fallen asleep i will be down in a minute mrs lawford was about to close the door when ada appeared  if you please maam she said i have been waiting as you told me to let dr ferguson out but its nearly seven now and the tables not laid yet  i really should have thought ada sheila began then caught back the angry words and turned and looked over her shoulder into the room do you think you will need anything more dr ferguson she asked in a sepulchral voice  again lawfords lips moved again he shook his head  one moment ada she said closing the door some more medicinewhat medicine quick she mustnt suspect  what medicine repeated lawford stolidly  oh vexing vexing dont you see we must send her out dont you see what was it you sent to critchetts for last night tell him thats gone we want more of that  lawford stared heavily oh yes yes he said thickly more of that  sheila with a shrug of extreme distaste and vexation hastily opened the door dr ferguson wants a further supply of the drug which mr critchett made up for mr lawford yesterday evening you had better go at once ada and please make as much haste as you possibly can  i say i say began lawford but it was too late the door was shut  how i detest this wretched falsehood and subterfuge what could have induced you  yes said her husband what i think ill be getting to bed again sheila i forgot i had been ill and now i do really feel very tired but i should like to feelin spite of this hideousi should like to feel we are friends sheila  sheila almost imperceptibly shuddered crossed the room and faced the still almost lifeless mask i spoke she said in a low cold difficult voicei spoke in a temper this morning you must try to understand what a shock it has been to me now i own it frankly i know you arearthur but god only knows how it frightens me andandhorrifies me she shut her eyes beneath her veil they waited on in silence a while  poor boy she said at last lightly touching the loose sleeve be brave it will all come right soon meanwhile for alices sake if not for mine dont give way toto caprices and all that keep quietly here arthur andand forgive my impatience  he put out his hand as if to touch her forgive you he said humbly pushing it stubbornly back into his pocket again oh sheila the forgiveness is all on your side you know i have nothing to forgive a long silence fell between them  then tonight at last began sheila wearily drawing back we say nothing to alice except that you are too tiredjust nervous prostrationto see her what we should do without this influenza i cannot conceive mr bethany will probably look in on his way home and then we can talk it overwe can talk it over again so long as you are like this yourself in mind why iwhat is it now she broke off querulously  if you please maam mr critchett says he doesnt know dr ferguson his names not in the directory and there must be something wrong with the message and hes sorry but he must have it in writing because there was more even in the first packet than he ought by rights to send what shall i do if you please  still looking at her husband sheila listened quietly to the end and then as if in inarticulate disdain she deliberately shrugged her shoulders and went out to play her part unaided    chapter seven  her husband turned wearily once more and drawing up a chair sat down in front of the cold grate he realised that sheila thought him as much of a fool now as she had for the moment thought him an impostor or something worse the night before that was at least something gained he realised too in a vague way that the exuberance of mind that had practically invented dr ferguson and outraged miss sinnet had quite suddenly flickered out it was astonishing he thought with gaze fixed innocently on the black coals that he should ever have done such things he detested that kind of rot that jaunty theatrical pose so many men prided their jackdaw brains on  and he sat quite still like a cat at a cranny listening as it were for the faintest remotest stir that might hint at any return of thisactivity it was the first really sane moment he had had since the change whatever it was that had happened at widderstone was now distinctly weakening in effect why now perhaps he stole a thievish look over his shoulder at the glass and cautiously drew finger and thumb down that beaked nose then he really quietly smiled a smile he felt this abominable facial caricature was quite unused to the superior lawford smile of guileless contempt for the fanatical the fantastic and the bizarre he wouldnt have sat with his feet on the fender before a burntout fire  and the animosity of that he uttered only just under his breath surprised even himself it actually did seem as if there were a chance if only he kept cool and collected if the whole mind of a man was bent on being one thing surely no power on earth certainly not on earth could for long compel him to look another any more followed the resplendent thought than vice versa  that in fact was the trick that had been in fitful fashion played him since yesterday obviously and apart altogether from his promise to sheila the best possible thing he could do would be to walk quietly over to widderstone tomorrow and like a child that has lost a penny just make the attempt to reverse the process look at the graves read the inscriptions on the weatherbeaten stones compose himself once more to sleep on the little seat  magic witchcraft possession and all thatwell mr bethany might prefer to take it on the authority of the bible if it was his duty but it was at least mainly old testament stuff like polygamy joshua and the unclean beasts the unclean beasts it was simply as simon had said mainly an affair of the nerves like indian jugglery he had heard of dozens of such cases or similar cases and it was hardly likely that cases even remotely like his own would be much bragged about or advertised all those mysterious disappearances too which one reads about so repeatedly what of them even now he felt and glanced swiftly behind him at the fancy it would be better to think as softly as possible not to hope too openly certainly not to triumph in the least degree just in case ofwelllisteners  he would wrap up too and he wouldnt tell sheila of the project till he had come safely back what an excellent joke it would be to confess meekly to his escapade and to be scolded and then suddenly to reveal himself he sat back and gazed with an almost malignant animosity at the face in the portrait comely and plump  an inarticulate unfathomable depression rolled back on him like a mist out of the sea he hastily undressed put watch and doorkey and critchetts powder under his pillow paused vacantly ruminated and then replaced the powder in his waistcoat pocket said his prayers and got shivering to bed he did not feel hurt at sheilas leaving him like this so long as she really believed in him and nowalice was home he listened trying not to shiver for her voice and sometimes heard he fancied the clear note it was this beastly influenza that made him feel so cold and lifeless but all would soon come rightthat is if only that face luminous against the floating darkness within would not appear the instant he closed his eyes  but legions of dreams are influenzas allies he fell into a chill doze heard voices innumerable and one above the rest shouting them down until there fell a lull and another as it were from afar said quite clearly and distinctly but surely my dear you have heard the story of the poor old charwoman who talked greek in her delirium a little school french need not alarm us and lawford opened his eyes again on mr bethany standing at his bed  tt tt there ive been and waked him and yet they say men make such excellent nurses in time of war but you see lawford what did i tell you wasnt i now an infallible prophet your wife has been giving me a most glowing account quite your old self she tells me except for just thisthis touch of facial paralysis and i think do you know the kind old creature stooped over the bed but still lawford noticed bitterly still without his spectaclesyes i really think there

linimentsa whole chemists shop oh we are getting on swimmingly  flamelight was flickering in the candled dusk lawford turned his head and saw sheilas coiled beautiful hair in the firelight  you havent

vicarage chimney i wouldnt have believed it of you my dear fellow he beamed but looked none the less very lean and fagged and depressed  how did the wedding go off lawford managed to think of inquiring  oh a1 said mr bethany ive just been describing it to alicethe bride her bridegroom mother aunts cake presents finery blushes tears and everything that was hers weve been in fits havent we mrs lawford and alice says im a worth in a clerical collardidnt she and that its only art that has kept me out of an apron now look here quiet quiet quiet no excitement no pranks what is there to

relieved i am to find you so muchso much better feed him up my other dear body and mind and soul and spirit and there goes the bell i must have a biscuit ive swallowed nothing but a cupid in plaster of paris since breakfast goodnight we shall miss you bothboth  but when sheila returned her husband was sunk again into a quiet sleep from which not even the many questions she fretted to put to him seemed weighty enough to warrant his disturbance  so when lawford again opened his eyes he found himself lying wide awake clear and refreshed and eager to get up but upon the air lay the still hush of early morning he tried in vain to catch back sleep again a distant shred of dream still floated in his mind like a cloud at evening he rarely dreamed but certainly something immensely interesting had but a moment ago eluded him he sat up and looked at the clear red cinders and their maze of grottoes he got out of bed and peeped through the blinds to the east and opposite to him gardens and an appleorchard lay and there in strange liquid tranquillity hung the morning star and rose rifling into the dusk of night the first grey of dawn the street beneath its autumn leaves was vacant charmed deserted  hardly since childhood had lawford seen the dawn unless over his winter breakfasttable very much like a child now he stood gazing out of his bowwindowthe child whom times busy robins had long ago covered over with the leaves of numberless hours a vague exultation fumed up into his brain still on the borders of sleep he unlocked the great wardrobe and took out an old faded purple and crimson dressinggown that had belonged to his grandfather the chief glory of every christmas charade he pulled the cowllike hood over his head and strode majestically over to the lookingglass  he looked in there a moment on the strange face like a child dismayed at its own excitement and a fit of sobbing that was half uncontrollable laughter swept over him he threw off the hood and turned once more to the window consciousness had flooded back indeed what would sheila have said to see him there the unearthly beauty and stillness and mans small labours garden and wall and rooftree idle and smokeless in the light of daybreakthere seemed to be some halftold secret between them what had life done with him to leave a reality so clouded he put on his slippers and gently opening the door crept with extreme caution up the stairs at a long narrow landing window he confronted a panorama of starry nightgardens sloping orchards and beyond them fields hills orion the dogs in the clear and cloudless darkness  my god how beautiful a voice whispered and a cock crowed mistily afar he stood staring like a child into the wintry brightness of a pastrycooks then once more he crept stealthily on he stooped and listened at a closed door until he fancied that above the beating of his own heart he could hear the breathing of the sleeper within then taking firm hold of the handle with both hands he slowly noiselessly turned it and peeped in on alice  the moon was long past her faint shining here the blind was down and yet it was not pitch dark he stood with eyes fixed waiting then he edged softly forward and knelt down beside the bed he could hear her breathing now long low quiet unhasteningthe miracle of life he could just dimly discern the darkness of her hair against the pillow some longsealed spring of tenderness seemed to rise in his heart with a grief and an ache he had never known before here at least he could find a little peace a brief pause however futile and stupid all his hopes of the night had been he leant his head on his hands on the counterpane and refused to think he felt a quick tremor a startled movement and knew that eyes wide open with fear were striving to pierce the gloom between them  there there dearest he said in a low whisper its only me only me he stroked the narrow hand and gazed into the shadowiness her fingers lay quiet and passive in his with that strange sense of immateriality that sleep brings to the body  you you she answered with a deep sigh oh dearest how you frightened me what is wrong why have you come are you worse dearest dearest  he kissed her hand no alice not worse i couldnt sleep that was all  oh and i came so utterly miserable to bed because you would not see me and mother would tell me only so very little i didnt even know you had been ill she pressed his hand between her own but this you know is very very naughtyyou will catch cold you bad thing what would mother say  i think we mustnt tell her dear i couldnt help it i felt much i wanted to see you i have been rather miserable  why she said stroking his hand from wrist to fingertips with one soft finger you mustnt be miserable you and me have never done such a thing before have we was it that wretched old flu  it was too dark in the little fragrant room even to see her face so close to his own and yet he feared dr simon she went on softly said it was but isnt your voice a little hoarse and it sounds so melancholy in the dark and ohshe squeezed his wristyou have grown so thin you do frighten me whatever should i do if you were really ill and it was so odd dear when first i woke i seemed to be still straining my eyes in a dream at such a curious haunting facenot very nice i am glad i am glad you were here  what was the dreamface like came the muttered question  dark and sharp and rather dwelling eyes you know those long faces one sees in dreams like a hawk like a conjurors  like a conjurorsit was the first unguarded and ungarbled criticism perhaps dear if you find my voice different and my hand shrunk up you will find my face changed toolike a conjurors what then  she laughed gaily and tenderly you silly silly i should love you more than ever your hands are icy cold i cant warm them nohow  lawford held tight his daughters hand you do love me alice you would not turn against me whatever happened ah you shall see you shall see a sudden burning hope sprang up in him surely when all was well again these last few hours would not have been spent in vain like the shadow of death they had been against whose darkness the green familiar earth seems beautiful as the plains of paradise had he but realized before how much he loved herwhat years of life had been wasted in leaving it all unsaid he came back from his reverie to find his hand wet with her tears he stroked her hair and touched gently her eyelids without speaking  you will let me come in tomorrow she pleaded you wont keep me out  ah but dear you must remember your mother she gets so anxious and every word the doctor says is law how would you like me to come again like this perhapslike santa claus  you know how i love having you she said and stopped butbut he leaned closer yes yes come she said clutching his hand and hiding her eyes it is only my dreamthat horrible dwelling face in the dream it frightened me so  lawford rose very slowly from his knees he could feel in the dark his brows drawn down there came a low sullen beating on his ear he saw his face as it were in dim outline against the dark rage and rebellion surged up in him even his love could be turned to bitterness well two could play at any game alice sprang up in bed and caught his sleeve dearest dearest you must not be angry with me now  he flung himself down beside the bed anger resentment died away you are all i have left he said  he stole back as he had come in the clear dawn to his bedroom  it was not five yet he put a few more coals on his fire and blew out the nightlight and lay down but it was impossible to rest to remain inactive he would go down and search for that first volume of quain hallucination influenza insanitywhy sheila must have purposely mislaid it a rather formidable figure he looked descending the stairs in the grey dusk of daybreak the breakfastroom was at the back of the house he tilted the blind and a faint light flowed in from the changing colours of the sky he opened the glass door of the little bookcase to the right of the window and ran eye and finger over the few rows of books but as he stood there with his back to the room just as the shadow of a birds wing floats across the moonlight of a pool he became suddenly conscious that something somebody had passed across the doorway and in passing had looked in on him  he stood motionless listening but no sound broke the morning slumbrousness except the faraway warbling of a thrush in the first light so sudden and transitory had been the experience that it seemed now to be illusory yet it had so caught him up it had with so furtive and sinister a quietness broken in on his solitude that for a moment he dared not move a cold indefinite sensation stole over him that he was being watched that some dim evil presence was behind him biding its time patient and stealthy with eyes fixed unmovingly on him where he stood but watch and wait as silently as he might only the day broadened at the window and at last a narrow ray of sunlight stole trembling up into the dusky bowl of the sky  at any rate quain was found with all the ills of life from a to i and lawford turned back to his bondage with the book under his arm    chapter eight  the sabbath pale with september sunshine and monotonous with chiming bells had passed languidly away dr simon had come and gone optimistic and urbane yet with a faint inward dissatisfaction over a patient behind whose taciturnity a hint of mockery and subterfuge seemed to lurk even mrs lawford had appeared to share her husbands reticence but dr simon had happened on other cases in his experience where tact was required rather than skill and time than medicine  the voices and footsteps even the froufrou of worshippers going to church the voices and footsteps of worshippers returning from church had floated up to the patients open window sunlight had drawn across his room in one pale beam and vanished a few callers had called hothouse flowers waxen and pale had been left with messages of sympathy even dr critchett had respectfully and discreetly made inquiries on his way home from chapel  lawford had spent most of his time in pacing to and fro in his soft slippers the very monotony had eased his mind now and again he had lain motionless with his face to the ceiling he had dozed and had awakened cold and torpid with dream he had hardly been aware of the process but every hour had done something it seemed towards clarifying his point of view a consciousness had begun to stir in him that was neither that of the old easy lawford whom he had never been fully aware of before nor of this strange ghostly intelligence that haunted the hawklike restless face and plucked so insistently at his distracted nerves he had begun in a vague fashion to be aware of them both could in a fashion discriminate between them almost as if there really were two spirits in stubborn conflict within him it would of course wear him down in time there could be only one end to such a strugglethe end  all day he had longed for freedom on and on with craving for the open sky for solitude for green silence beyond these maddening walls this heedful silken coming and going these sunday voices this reiterant yelp of a single peevish bellwould they never cease and above all betwixt dread and an almost physical greed he hungered for night he sat down with elbows on knees and head on his hands thinking of night its secrecy its immeasurable solitude  his eyelids twitched the fire before him had for an instant gone black out he seemed to see slowgesturing branches grass stooping beneath a grey and windswept sky he started up and the remembrance of the morning returned to himthe glassy light the changing rays the beaming gilt upon the useless books now at last at the windows afternoon had begun to wane and when sheila brought up his tea as if chance had heard his cry she entered in hat and stole she put down the tray and paused at the glass looking across it out of the window  alice says you are to eat every one of those delicious sandwiches and especially the tiny omelette you have scarcely touched anything today arthur i am a poor one to preach i am afraid but you know what that will meana worse breakdown still you really must try to think ofof us all  are you going to church he asked in a low voice  not of course if you would prefer not but dr simon advised me most particularly to go out at least once a day we must remember this is not the beginning of your illness longcontinued anxiety i suppose does tell on one in time anyhow he said that i looked worried and rundown i am worried let us both try for each others sakes or even if only for alices toto do all we can i must not harass you but is there anydo you see the slightest change of any kind  you always look pretty sheila tonight you look prettier that is the only change i think  mrs lawfords attitude intensified in its stillness now speaking quite frankly what is it in you suggests these remarks at such a time thats what baffles me it seems so childish so needlessly blind  i am very sorry sheila to be so childish but im not say what you like blind you are pretty id repeat it if i was burning at the stake  sheila lowered her eyes softly on to the richtoned picture in the glass supposing she said watching her lips move supposingof course i know you are getting better and all thatbut supposing you dont change back as mr bethany thinks what will you do honestly arthur when i think over it calmly the whole tragedy comes back on me with such a force it sweeps me off my feet i am for the moment scarcely my own mistress what would you do  i think sheila replied a low infinitely weary voice i think i should marry again it was the same wavering faintly ironical voice that had slightly discomposed dr simon that same morning  marry again exclaimed incredulously the full lips in the lookingglass who  you dear  sheila turned softly round conscious in a most humiliating manner that she had ever so little flushed  her husband was pouring out his tea unaware apparently of her change of position she watched him curiously in spite of all her reason of her absolute certainty she wondered even again for a moment if this really could be arthur and for the first time she realised the power and mastery of that eager and far too hungry face her mind seemed to pause fluttering in air like a bird in the wind she hastened rather unsteadily to the door  will you want anything more do you think for an hour she asked  her husband looked up over his little table is alice going with you  oh yes poor child she looks so pale and miserable we are going to mrs sherwins and then on to church you will lock your door  yes i will lock my door  and i do hope arthurnothing rash  a change that seemed almost the effect of actual shadow came over his face i wish you could stay with me he said slowly i dont think you have any idea whatwhat i go through  it was as if a child had asked on the verge of terror for a candle in the dark but an hours terror is better than a lifetime of timidity sheila sighed  i think she said i too might say that but there giving way will do nothing for either of us i shall be gone only for an hour or two at the most and i told mr bethany i should have to come out before the sermon its only mr craik  but why mrs sherwin shed worm a secret out of ones grave  its useless to discuss that arthur you have always consistently disliked my friends its scarcely likely that you would find any improvement in them now  oh well he began but the door was already closed  sheila he called in a burst of anger  well arthur  you have taken my latchkey  sheila came hastily in again your latchkey  i am going out  going outyou will not be so mad so criminal and after your promise  he stood up it is useless to argue if i do not go out i shall certainly go mad as for criminalwhy thats a womans word who on earth is to know me  it is of no consequence then that the servants are already gossiping about this impossible dr ferguson that you are certain to be seen either going or returning that alice is bound to discover that you are well enough to go out and yet not even enough to say goodnight to your own daughteroh its monstrous its a frantic a heartless thing to do her voice vaguely suggested tears  lawford eyed her coldly and stubbornlythinking of the empty room he would leave awaiting his return its lamp burning its fireflames shining it was almost a physical discomfort this longing unspeakable for the twilight the green secrecy and the silence of the graves keep them out of the way he said in a low voice it will be dark when i come in his hardened face lit up its useless to attempt to dissuade me  why must you always be hurting me why do you seem to delight in trying to estrange me husband and wife faced each other across the clearlit room he did not answer  for the last time she said in a quiet hard voice i ask you not to go  he shrugged his shoulders ask me not to come back he said thats nearer your hope he turned his face to the fire without moving he heard her go out return pause and go out again and when he deliberately wheeled round in his chair the little key lay conspicuous there on the counterpane    chapter nine  the last light of sunset lay in the west and a sullen wrack of cloud was mounting into the windless sky when lawford entered the country graveyard again by its dark weatherworn lychgate the old stone church with its square tower stood amid trees its eastern window faintly aglow with crimson and purple he could hear a steady rather nasal voice through its open lattices but the stooping stones and the cypresses were out of sight of its porch he would not be seen down there he paused a moment however his hat was drawn down over his eyes he was shivering far over the harvest fields showed a growing pallor in the solitary seat beneath the cypresses he stood hesitating gazing steadily and yet half vacantly at the motionless figure and in a while a face was lifted in his direction and undisconcerted eyes calmly surveyed him  i am afraid called lawford rather nervouslyi hope i am not intruding  not at all not at all said the stranger i have no privileges here at least as yet  lawford again hesitated then slowly advanced its astonishingly quiet and beautiful he said  the stranger turned his head to glance over the fields yes it is very he replied there was the faintest accent a little drawl of unfriendliness in the remark  you often sit here lawford persisted  the stranger raised his eyebrows oh yes often he smiled it is my own modest fashion of attending divine service the congregation is rapt  my visits said lawford have been very fewin fact so far as i know i have only once been here before  i envy you the novelty there was again the same faint unmistakable antagonism in voice and attitude and yet so deep was the relief in talking to a fellow creature who hadnt the least suspicion of anything unusual in his appearance that lawford was extremely disinclined to turn back he made another effortfor conversation with strangers had always been a difficulty to himand advanced towards the seat you mustnt please let me intrude upon you he said but really i am very interested in this queer old place perhaps you would tell me something of its history he sat down his companion moved slowly to the other side of the broken gravestone  to tell you the truth he replied picking his way as it were from word to word its history as people call it does not interest me in the least after all its not when a thing is but what it is that much matters what this ishe glanced with head bent across the shadowy stones is pretty evident of course age has its charms  and is this very old  oh yes its old right enough as things go but even age perhaps is mainly an affair of the imagination theres a tombstone near that little old hawthorn and there are two others side by side under the wall still even legibly late seventeenth century thats pretty good weathering he smiled faintly of course the church itself is centuries older drenched with age but shes still sleepwalking while these old tombstones dream glowworms and crickets are not such bad bedfellows  what interested me most i think said lawford haltingly was this he pointed with his stick to the grave at his feet  ah yes sabathiers said the stranger i know his peculiar history almost by heart  lawford found himself staring with unusual concentration into the rather long and pale face not i suppose he resumed faintlynot i suppose beyond whats there  his companion leant his hand on the old stooping tombstone well you know theres a good deal therehe stooped overif you read between the lines even if you dont  a suicide said lawford under his breath  yes a suicide thats why our christian countrymen have buried him outside of the fold dead or alive they try to keep the wolf out  is this then unconsecrated ground said lawford  havent you noticed drawled the other how green the grass grows down here and how very sharp are poor old sabathiers thorns besides he was a stranger and theykept him out  but surely said lawford was it so entirely a matter of choicethe laws of the church if he did kill himself he did  the stranger turned with a little shrug i dont suppose its a matter of much consequence to him i fancied i was his only friend may i venture to ask why you are interested in the poor old thing  lawfords mind was as calm and shallow as a millpond oh a rather unusual thing happened to me here he said you say you often come  often said the stranger rather curtly  has anythingeveroccurred  occurred he raised his eyebrows i wish it had i come here simply as i have said because its quiet because i prefer the company of those who never answer me back and who do not so much as condescend to pay me the least attention he smiled and turned his face towards the quiet fields  lawford after a long pause lifted his eyes do you think he said softly it is possible one ever could  one ever could  answer back  there was a low rotting wall of stone encompassing sabathiers grave on this the stranger sat down he glanced up rather curiously at his companion seldom the time and the place and the revenant altogether the thought has occurred to others he ventured to add  of course of course said lawford eagerly but it is an absolutely new one to me i dont mean that i have never had such an idea just in ones own superficial way buthe paused and glanced swiftly into the fastthickening twilighti wonder are they do you think really all quite dead  call and see taunted the stranger softly  ah yes i know said lawford but i believe in the resurrection of the body that is what we say and supposing when a man diessupposing it was most frightfully against ones will that one hated the awful inaction that death brings shutting a poor devil up like a child kicking against the door in a dark cupboard one might surely one mightjust quietly you know try to get out wouldnt you he added  and surely he found himself beginning gently to argue again surely what about say him he nodded towards the old and broken grave that lay between them  what sabathier the other echoed laying his hand upon the stone  and a sheer enormous abyss of silence seemed to follow the unanswerable question  he was a stranger it says so good god said lawford how he must have wanted to get home he killed himself poor wretch think of the fret and fever he must have been injust before imagine it  but it might you know suggested the other with a smilemight have been sheer indifference  nicholas sabathier stranger to this parishno no said lawford his heart beating as if it would choke him i dont fancy it was indifference  it was almost too dark now to distinguish the strangers features but there seemed a faint suggestion of irony in his voice and how do you suppose your angry naughty child would set about it its narrow quarters how would he begin  lawford sat quite still you sayi hope i am not detaining youyou say you have come here sat here often on this very seat have you ever hadhave you ever fallen asleep here  why do you ask inquired the other curiously  i was only wondering said lawford he was cold and shivering he felt instinctively it was madness to sit on here in the thin gliding mist that had gathered in swathes above the grass milkpale in the rising moon the stranger turned away from him  for in that sleep of death what dreams may come must give us pause he said slowly with a little satirical catch on the last word what did you dream  lawford glanced helplessly about him the moon cast lean grey beams of light between the cypresses but to his wide and wandering eyes it seemed that a radiance other than hers haunted these mounds and leaning stones have you ever noticed it he said putting out his hand towards his unknown companion this stone is cracked from head to foot but therehe rose stiff and chilledi am afraid i have bored you with my company you came here for solitude and i have been trying to convince you that we are surrounded with witnesses you will forgive my intrusion there was a kind of oldfashioned courtesy in his manner that he himself was dimly aware of he held out his hand  i hope you will think nothing of the kind said the other earnestly how could it be in any sense an intrusion its the old story of bluebeard and i confess i too should very much like a peep into his cupboard who wouldnt but there its merely a matter of time i suppose he paused and together they slowly ascended the path already glimmering with a heavy dew at the porch they paused once more and now it was the stranger that held out his hand  perhaps he said you will give me the pleasure of some day continuing our talk as for our friend below it so happens that i have managed to pick up a little more of his history than the sexton seems to have heard ofif you would care some time or other to share it i live only at the foot of the hill not half a mile distant perhaps you could spare the time now  lawford took out his watch you are really very kind he said but perhapswell whatever that history may be i think you would agree that mine is evenbut there ive talked too much about myself already perhaps tomorrow  why tomorrow then said his companion its a flat wooden house on the lefthand side come at any time of the evening he paused again and smiledthe third house after the rectory which is marked up on the gate my name is herbertherbert herbert to be precise  lawford took out his pocketbook and a card mine he said handing it gravely to his companion is lawfordat least it was really the first time that either had seen the others face at close quarters and clearlit and on lawfords a moon almost at the full shone dazzlingly he saw an expressiondismay incredulity overwhelming astonishmentstart suddenly into the dark rather indifferent eyes  what is it he cried hastily stooping close  why said the other laughing and turning away i think the moon must have bewitched me too    chapter ten  lawford listened awhile before opening his door he heard voices in the diningroom a light shone faintly between the blinds of his bedroom he very gently let himself in and unheard unseen mounted the stairs he sat down in front of the fire tired out and bitterly cold in spite of his long walk home but his mind was wearier even than his body he tried in vain to catch up the thread of his thoughts he only knew for certain that so far as his first hope and motives had gone his errand had proved entirely futile how could i possibly fall asleep with that fellow talking there he had said to himself angrily yet knew in his heart that their talk had driven every other idea out of his mind he had not yet even glanced into the glass his every thought was vainly wandering round and round the one curious hint that had drifted in but which he had not yet been able to put into words  supposing though that he had really fallen into a deep sleep with none to watch or spywhat then however ridiculous that idea it was not more ridiculous more incredible than the actual fact if he had remained there he might it was just possible that he would by now have actually awakened just his own familiar everyday self again and the thought of thatthough he hardly realised its full importactually did send him on tiptoe for a glance that more or less effectually set the question at rest and there looked out at him it seemed the same dark sallow face that had so much appalled him only two nights agoexpressionless cadaverous with shadowy hollows beneath the glittering eyes and even as he watched it its lips of their own volition drew together and questioned himwhose  he was not to be given much leisure however for fantastic reveries like this as he leaned his head on his hands gladly conscious that he could not possibly bear this incessant strain for long sheila opened the door he started up  i wish you would knock he said angrily you talk of quiet you tell me to rest and think and here you come creeping and spying on me as if i was a child in a nursery i refuse to be watched and guarded and peeped on like this he knew that his hands were trembling that he could not keep his eyes fixed that his voice was nearly inarticulate  sheila drew in her lips i have merely come to tell you arthur that mr bethany has brought mr danton in to supper he agrees with me it really would be advisable to take such a very old and prudent and practical friend into our confidence you do nothing i ask of you i simply cannot bear the burden of this incessant anxiety look now what your night walk has done for you you look positively at deaths door  whatwhat an instinct you have for the right word said lawford softly and danton of all people in the world it was surely rather a curious a thoughtless choice has he had supper  why do you ask  he wont believe toobloated  i think said sheila indignantly it is hardly fair to speak of a very old and a very true friend of mine in suchwell vulgar terms as that besides arthur as for believingwithout in the least desiring to hurt your feelingsi must candidly warn you some people wont  come along said lawford with a faint gust of laughter lets see  they went quickly downstairs sheila with less dignity perhaps than she had been surprised into since she had left a slimmer girlhood behind she swept into the gaze of the two gentlemen standing together on the hearthrug and so was caught as it were between a rain of conflicting glances for her husband had followed instantly and stood now behind her stooping a little and with something between contempt and defiance confronting an old fat friend whom that one brief challenging instant had congealed into a condition of passive and immovable hostility  mr danton composed his chin in his collar and deliberately turned himself towards his companion his small eyes wandered and instantaneously met and rested on those of mrs lawford  arthur thought he would prefer to come down and see you himself  you take such formidable risks lawford said mr bethany in a dry difficult voice  am i really to believe danton began huskily i am sure bethany you willmy dear mrs lawford said he stirring vaguely glancing restlessly  it was not my wish vicar to come at all said a voice from the doorway to tell you the truth i am too tired to care a jot either way andhe lifted a long armi must positively refuse to produce the least the remotest proof that i am not so far as i am personally aware even the man in the moon danton at heart was always an incorrigible sceptic arent you t d you pride your dear old brawn on it in secret  i really began danton in a rich still voice  oh but you know you are drawled on the slightly hesitating longdrawn syllables its your parochial metier firm unctuous subtle scepticism and to that end your body flourishes you were born fat you became fat and fat my dear danton has been deliberately thrust on youin layers lampreys youll perish of surfeit some day of sheer dantonism and fat postmortem danton oh what a bastings there  mr bethany with a convulsive effort woke he turned swiftly on mrs lawford why why could you not have seen he cried  its no good vicar shes all sheer laodicean blow hot blow cold north south east westto have a weathercock for a wife is to marry the wind theres nothing to be got from poor sheila but  lawford the little mans voice was as sharp as the crack of a whip i forbid it do you hear me i forbid it some selfcommand my dear good fellow remember remember its only the will the will that keeps us breathing  lawford peered as if out of a gathering dusk that thickened and flickered with shadows before his eyes whats he mean then he muttered huskily coming here with his black still carcasepeeping peepingwhats he mean i say there was a moments silence then with lifted brows and wide eyes that to every one of his three witnesses left an indelible memory of clear and wolfish light within their glassy pupils he turned heavily and climbed back to his solitude  i suppose began danton with an obvious effort to disentangle himself from the humiliation of the moment i suppose he waswandering  bless me yes said mr bethany cordiallyfever we all know what that means  yes said danton taking refuge in mrs lawfords white and intent gaze  just think think dantonthe awful incessant strain of such an ordeal think for an instant what such a thing means  danton inserted a plump white finger between collar and chin oh yes butehneedlessly abusive i never said i disbelieved him  do you said mrs lawfords voice  he poised himself as if it were on the monolithic stability of his legs eh he said  mr bethany sat down at the table i rather feared some such temporary breakdown as this danton i think i foresaw it and now just while we are all three alone here together in friendly conclave wouldnt it be as well dont you think to confront ourselves with the difficulties i knowwe all know that that poor halfdemented creature is arthur lawford this morning he was as sane as lucid as i hope i am now an awful calamity has suddenly fallen upon himthis change i own frankly at the first sheer shock it staggered me as i think for the moment it has staggered you but when i had seen the poor fellow face to face heard him talk and watched him there upstairs in the silence stir and awake and come up again to his trouble out of his sleep i had no more doubt in my own mind and heart that he was he than i have in my mind that iam i we do in some mysterious way youll own at once grow so accustomed so inured if you like to each others faces masks though they be that we hardly realise we see them when we are speaking together and yet the slightest the most infinitesimal change is instantly apparent  oh yes vicar but you see  mr bethany raised a small lean hand one moment please i have heard lawfords own account conscious or unconscious he has been through some terrific strain some such awful conflict with the unseen powers that wethank godhave only read about and never perhaps until death is upon us shall witness for ourselves what more likely more inevitable than that such a thing should leave its scar its cloud its masking shadowcall it what you will a smile can turn a face we dread into a face wed die for some experience which would be nothing but a hideous cruelty and outrage to ask too closely aboutone perhaps which he could even if he would poor fellow give no account ofhas put him temporarily at the worlds mercy they made him a nine days wonder a byword and that my dear danton is just where we come in we know the man himself and it is to be our privilege to act as a bufferstate to be intermediaries between him and the rest of this deadly craving sheepish worldfor the time being oh yes just for the time being other and keener and more knowledgeable minds than mine or yours will some day bring him back to us again we dont attempt to explain we cant we simply believe  but danton merely continued to stare as if into the quiet of an aquarium  my dear good danton persisted mr bethany with cherubic patience how old are you  i dont see quite smiled danton with recovered ease and rapidly mobilising forces excuse the confidence mrs lawford im fortythree  good said mr bethany and im seventyone and this child herehe pointed an accusing finger at sheilais youth perpetual so he briskly brightened say between us were six score all told are wecan we deliberately with this mere pinch of years at our command out of the wheeling millions that have gonecan we say this is impossible to any single phenomenon can we  no we cant of course said danton formidably not finally thats all very well buthe paused and nodded nodding his round head upward as if towards the inaudible overhead i suppose he cant hear  mr bethany rose cheerfully all right danton i am afraid you are exactly what the poor fellow in his delirium solemnly asseverated and jesting apart it is in delirium that we tell our sheer plain unadulterated truth youre a nicely covered sceptic personally i refuse to discuss the matter mere dull stubborn prejudice bigotry if you like i will only remark just thisthat mrs lawford and i in our inmost hearts know you my dear danton forgive the freedom merely incredulously grope faith versus reasonthat prehistoric armageddon some day and a day not far distant either lawford will come back to us thisthis shutter will be taken down as abruptly as by some inconceivably drowsy heedlessness of common nature it has been put up hell win through and of his own sheer will and courage but now because i ask it and this poor child here entreats it you will say nothing to a living soul about the matter say till friday what stepbystep creatures we are to be sure i say friday because it will be exactly a week then and whats a weekto nature scarcely the unfolding of a rose but still friday be it then if nothing has occurred we will we shall have to call a friendly gathering we shall be compelled to have a friendly consultation  im not i hope a brute bethany said danton apologetically but honestly speaking for myself simply as a man of the world its a big risk to be taking onwhat shall we call iton mere intuition personally and even in a court of lawthough heaven forbid it ever reaches that stagepersonally i could swear that the fellow that stood abusing me there in that revolting fashion was not lawford it would be easier even to believe in him if there were not thatthat glaze that shocking simulation of the man himself the very man but then i am a sceptic i own it and pon my word mrs lawford theres plenty of room for sceptics in a world like this  very well said mr bethany crisply thats settled then with your permission my dear he added turning untarnishably clear childlike eyes on sheila i will take all riskseven to the foot of the gibbet accessory danton after the fact and so direct and cloudless was his gaze that sheila tried in vain to evade it and to catch a glimpse of dantons small agatelike eyes now completely under mastery and awaiting confidently the meeting with her own  of course she said i am entirely in your hands dear mr bethany    chapter eleven  lawford slept far into the cloudy monday morning to wake steeped in sleep lethargic and fretfully haunted by inconclusive remembrances of the night before when sheila with obvious and capacious composure brought him his breakfast tray he watched her face for some time without speaking  sheila he began as she was about to leave the room again  she paused smiling  did anything happen last night would you mind telling me sheila who was it was here  her lids the least bit narrowed certainly arthur mr danton was here  then it was not a dream  oh no said sheila  what did i say what did he say it was hopeless anyhow  i dont quite understand what you mean by hopeless arthur and must i answer the other questions  lawford drew his hand over his face like a tired child he didntbelieve  no dear said sheila softly  and you sheila came the subdued voice  sheila crossed slowly to the window well quite honestly arthur i was not very much surprised whatever we are agreed about on the whole you were scarcely yourself last night  lawford shut his eyes and reopened them full on his wifes calm scrutiny who had in that moment turned in the light of the one drawn blind to face him again  who is always  no said sheila butit was at least unfortunate we cant i suppose rely on dr bethany alone  lawford crouched over his food will he blab  blab mr danton is a gentleman arthur  lawford rolled his eyes as if in temporary vertigo yes he said and sheila once more prepared to make a reposeful exit  i dont think i can see simon this morning  oh who then  i mean i would prefer to be left alone  believe me i had no intention to intrude and this time the door really closed  he is in a quiet soothing sleep said sheila a few minutes later  nothing could be better said dr simon and lawford to his inexpressible relief heard the fevered throbbing of the doctors car reverse and turned over and shut his eyes dulled and exhausted in the still unfriendliness of the vacant room his spirits had sunk he thought to their lowest ebb he scarcely heeded the fragments of dreamsclear green landscapes amazing gleams of peace the sudden broken voices the rustling and calling shadowiness of subconsciousnessin this quiet sunlight of reality the clouds had broken or had been withdrawn like a veil from the october skies one thought alone was his refuge one face alone haunted him with its peace one remembrance soothed himalice through all his scattered and purposeless arguments he strove to remember her voice the lovingkindness of her eyes her untroubled confidence  in the afternoon he got up and dressed himself he could not bring himself to stand before the glass and deliberately shave he even smiled at the thought of playing the barber to that lean chin he dressed by the fireplace  i couldnt rest he told sheila when she presently came in on one of her quiet cautious heedful visits and one tires of reading even quain in bed  have you found anything she inquired politely  oh yes said lawford wearily i have discovered that infinitely worse things are infinitely commoner but that theres nothing quite so picturesque  tell me said sheila with refreshing naivete how does it feel does it even in the slightest degree affect your mind  he turned his back and looked up at his broad gilt portrait for inspiration practically not at all he said hollowly of course ones nervesthat fellow dantonwhen ones overtired you havehis voice in spite of every effort faintly quaveredyou havent noticed anything my mind  me oh dear no i never was the least bit observant you know that arthur but apart from that and i hope you will not think me unsympatheticbut dont you think we must sooner or later be thinking of whats to be done at present though i fully agree with mr bethany as to the wisdom of hushing this unhappy business up as long as possible at least from the gossiping outside world still we are only standing still and your malady dear i suppose isnt you will help me arthur you will try and think poor alice  what about alice  she mopes dear rather she cannot of course quite understand why she must not see her father and yet his not being or for the matter of that even if he was at deaths door  at deaths door murmured lawford under his breath who was it was saying that have you ever sheila in a dream or just as ones thoughts go sometimes seen that doorits ruinous stone lintel carved into lichenous stone headsstonily silent in the last thin sunlight hanging in peace unlatched heated hunted in agonyin that cold greenclad shadowed porch is haven and sanctuarybut beyondo god beyond  sheila stood listening with startled eyes and was all that in quain she inquired rather flutteringly  lawford turned a sidelong head and looked steadily at his wife  she shook herself with a slight shiver very well then she said and paused in the silence  her husband yawned and smiled and almost as if lit with that thin last sunshine seemed the smile that passed for an instant across the reverie of his shadowy face he drew a hand wearily over his eyes what has he been saying now he inquired like a fretful child  sheila stood very quiet and still as if in fear of scaring some rare wild timid creature by the least stir who she merely breathed  lawford paused on the hearthrug with his comb in his hand its just the last rags of that beastly influenza he said and began vigorously combing his hair and yet simple and frank though the action was it moved sheila perhaps more than any other of the congested occurrences of the last few days her forehead grew suddenly cold the palms of her hands began to ache she had to hasten out of the room to avoid revealing the sheer physical repulsion she had experienced  but lawford quite unmindful of the shock continued in a kind of heedless reverie to watch as he combed the still visionary thoughts that passed in tranced stillness before his eyes he longed beyond measure for freedom that until yesterday he had not even dreamed existed outside the covers of some old impossible romancethe magic of the darkening sky the invisible flocking presences of the dead the shock of imaginations that had no words of quixotic emotions which the stranger had stirred in that low mocking furtive talk beside the broken stones of the huguenot was the change quite so monstrous so meaningless how often indeed he remembered curiously had he seemed to be standing outside these fastshut gates of thought that now had been freely opened to him  he drew ajar the door and leant his ear to listen from far away came a rich longcontinued chuckle of laughter followed by the clatter of a falling plate and then still more uncontrollable laughter there was a faint smell of toast on the air lawford ventured out on to the landing and into a little room that had once in years gone by been alices nursery he stood far back from the strip of open window that showed beneath the green blind craning forward to see into the gardenthe trees their knotted trunks and then as he stole nearer a flowerbed late roses geraniums calceolarias the lawn andyes three wicker chairs a footstool a workbasket a little table on the smooth grass in the honeycoloured sunshine and sheila sitting there in the autumnal sunlight her hands resting on the arms of her chair her head bent evidently deeply engrossed in her thoughts he crept an inch or two forward and stooped there was a hat on the grassalices big garden hatand beside it lay flitters nose on paws long ears sagging he had forgotten flitters had flitters forgotten him would he bark at the strange distasteful scent of adr ferguson the coast was clear then he turned even softlier yet to confront rapt still and hovering betwixt astonishment and dread the blue calm eyes of his daughter looking in at the door it seemed to lawford as if they had both been suddenly swept by some unseen power into a still unearthly silence  we thought he began at last we thought just to beckon mrs lawford from the window hehe is asleep  alice nodded her whole face was in a moment flooded with red it ebbed and left her pale i will go down and tell mother you want to see her it was very silly of me i did not quite recognise at firsti suppose thinking of my father the words faltered and the eyes were lifted to his face again with a desolate incredulous appeal lawford turned away heartsick and trembling  certainly certainly by no means he began listening vaguely to the glib patter that seemed to come from another mouth your father my dear young lady i venture to think is now really on the road to recovery dr simon makes excellent progress but of coursetwo heads we know are so much better than one when theres the leastthe least difficulty the great thing is quiet rest isolation no possibility of a shock else his voice fell away his eloquence failed  for alice stood gazing stirlessly on and on into this infinitely strange infinitely familiar shadowy phantasmal face oh yes she replied i quite understand of course but if i might just peep even it wouldi should be so much much happier do let me just see him dr ferguson if only his head on the pillow i wouldnt even breathe couldnt it possibly helpeven a faithcure she leant forward impulsively her voice trembling anal her eyes still shining beneath their faint melancholy smile  i fear my dearit cannot be he longs to see you but with his mind you know in this state it might  but mother never told me broke in the girl desperately there was anything wrong with his mind oh but that was quite unfair you dont mean you dont meanthat  lawford scanned swiftly the little square beloved and memoried room that fate had suddenly converted for him into a cage of unspeakable pain and longing oh no believe me no not his brain not that not even wandering really but always thinking always longing on and on for you dear only quite quite master of himself but  you talk she broke in again angrily only in pretence you are treating me like a child and so does mother and so it has been ever since i came home why if mother can and you can why may not i why if he can walk and talk in the night  but whowho can walk and talk in the night inquired a low stealthy voice out of the quietness behind her  alice turned swiftly her mother was standing at a little distance with all the calm and moveless concentration of a waxwork figure looking up at her from the staircase  i wasi was talking to dr ferguson mother  but as i came up the stairs i understood you to be inquiring something of dr ferguson if you were saying he can walk and talk in the night you surely were not referring to your father child that could not possibly be in his state dr ferguson i know will bear me out in that at least and besides i really must insist on following out medical directions to the letter dr ferguson i know will fully concur do pray dr ferguson continued sheila raising her voice even now scarcely above a rapid murmurdo pray assure my daughter that she must have patience that however much even he himself may desire it it is impossible that she should see her father yet and now my dear child come down i want to have a moments talk with dr ferguson i feared from his beckoning at the window that something was amiss  alice turned dismayed and looked steadily almost with hostility at the stranger so curiously transfixed and isolated in her small old playroom and in this scornful yet pleading confrontation her eye fell suddenly on the pin in his scarfthe claw and the pearl she had known all her life from that her gaze flitted like some wild demented things over face hair hands clothes attitude expression and her heart stood still in an awful inarticulate dread of the unknown she turned slowly towards her mother groped forward a few steps turned once more stretching out her hands towards the vague still figure whose eyes had called so piteously to her out of their depths and fell fainting in the doorway lawford stood motionless vacantly watching sheila who knelt chafing the cold hands she has fainted he said oh sheila tell meonly fainted  sheila made no answer did not even raise her eyes  some day sheila he began in a dull voice and broke off and without another word without even another glance at the still face and blue twitching lids he passed her rapidly by and in another instant sheila heard the housedoor shut she got up quickly and after a glance into the vacant bedroom turned the key then she hastened upstairs for sal volatile and eau de cologne  it was yet clear daylight when lawford appeared beneath the portico of his house with a glance of circumspection that almost seemed to suggest a fear of pursuit he descended the steps only to be made aware in so doing that ada was with a kind of furtive eagerness pointing out the mysterious dr ferguson to a steadily gazing cook one or two wellknown and many a wellremembered face he encountered in the thin stream of city men treading blackly along the pavement it was a still high evening and something very like a forlorn compassion rose in his mind at sight of their grave rather pretentious rather dull respectable faces  he found himself walking with an affectation of effrontery and smiling with a faint contempt on all alike as if to keep himself from slinking and the wolf out of his eyes he felt restless and watchful and suspicious as if he had suddenly come down in the world his then was a disguise as effectual as a shabby coat and a glazing eye his heart sickened was it even worth while living on a crust of social respectability so thin and so exquisitely treacherous he challenged no one one or two actual acquaintances raised and lowered a faintly inquiring eyebrow in his direction one even recalled in his confusion a smile of recognition just a moment too late there was it seemed a peculiar aura in lawfords presence a shadow of a something in his demeanour that proved him alien  none the less green widderstone kept calling him much as a bell in the imagination tolls on and on the echo of reality if the worst should come to the worst whythere is pasture in the solitary byways for the beast that strays he quickened his pace along lonelier streets and soon strode freely through the little flagged and cobbled village of shops past the same small jutting window whose clock had told him the hour on that first dark hurried night all was pale and faint with dying colours now and decay was in the leaf and the last swallows filled the gold air with their clashing stillness no one heeded him here he looked from side to side exulting in the strangeness shops were left behind the last milestone passed and in a little while he was descending the hill beneath the elm boughs which he remembered had stood like a turreted wall against the sunset when first he had wandered down into the churchyard  at the foot of the hill he passed by the green and white rectory and there was the parson a short fat pursy man with wrists protruding from his jacket sleeves as he stood on tiptoe tying up a rambling roseshoot on his trim cedared lawn the next house barely showed its old red chimneytops above its bowers the next was empty with windows vacantly gazing its paths peopled with great bearded weeds that stood mutely watching and guarding the seldomopened gate then came more lofty grandmotherly elms a dense hedge of every leaf that pricks and then lawford found himself standing at the small canopied gate of the queer old wooden house that the stranger of his talk had in part described  it stood square and high and dark in a small amphitheatre of verdure roses here and there sprang from the grass and a narrow boxedged path led to a small door in a low greenmantled wing with its one square window above the porch and while with vacant mind lawford stood waiting as one stands forebodingly upon the eve of a new experience he heard as if at a distance the sound of falling water he still paused on the country roadside scrutinising this strange still wooden presence but at last with an effort he pushed open the gate followed the winding path and pulled the old iron hanging bell there came presently a quiet tread and herbert himself opened the door which led into a little square woodpanelled hall hung with queer old prints and obscure portraits in dark frames  ah yes come in mr lawford he drawled i was beginning to be afraid you were not coming  lawford laid hat and walkingstick on an oak bench and followed his churchyard companion up a slightly inclined corridor and a staircase into a high room covered far up the yellowish walls with old books on shelves and in cases between which hung in little black frames mezzo tints etchings and antiquated maps a large table stood a few paces from the deep alcove of the window which was surrounded by a low faded green seat and was screened from the sunshine by wooden shutters and here the tranquil surge of falling water shook incessantly on the air for the three lower casements stood open to the fading sunset on a smaller table were spread cups old earthenware dishes of fruit and a big bowl of damask roses  please sit down i shant be a moment i am not sure that my sister is in but if so i will tell her we are ready for tea left to himself in this quiet strange old room lawford forgot for a while everything else he was for the moment so taken up with his surroundings  what seized on his fancy and strangely affected his mind was this incessant changing roar of falling water it must be the widder he said to himself flowing close to the walls but not until he had had the boldness to lean head and shoulders out of the nearest window did he fully realize how close indeed the widder was it came sweeping dark and deep and begreened and full with the early autumnal rains actually against the lower walls of the house itself and in the middle suddenly swerved in a black smooth arch and tumbled headlong into a great pool nodding with tall slender waterweeds and charged in its bubbled blackness here and there with the last crimson of the setting sun to the left of the house where the waters floated free again stood vast still trees above the clustering rushes and in glimpses between their spreading boughs lay the farstretching countryside now dimmed with the first mists of approaching evening so absorbed he became as he stood leaning over the wooden sill above the falling water that eye and ear became enslaved by the roar and stillness and in the faint atmosphere of age that seemed like a veil to hang about the odd old house and these prodigious branches he fell into a kind of waking dream  when at last he did draw back into the room it was perceptibly darker and a thin keen shaft of recollection struck across his mindthe recollection of what he was and of how he came to be there his reasons for coming and of that dark indefinable presence which like a raven had begun to build its dwelling in his mind he sat on his eyes restlessly wandering his face leaning on his hands and in a while the door opened and herbert returned carrying an old crimson and green teapot and a dish of hot cakes  theyre all out he said sister sallie and boy but these were in the oven so we wont wait i hope you havent been very much bored  lawford dropped his hands from his face and smiled i have been looking at the water he said  my sisters favorite occupation she sits for hours and hours with not even a book for an apology staring down into the black old roaring pot it has a sort of hypnotic effect after a time and youd be surprised how quickly one gets used to the noise to me its even less distracting than sheer silence you dont know after all what on earth sheer silence meanseven at widderstone but one can just realize a waternymph they chatter but thank heaven its not articulate he handed lawford a cup with a certain niceness and selfconsciousness lifting his eyebrows slightly as he turned  lawford found himself listening out of a peculiar stillness of mind to the voice of this suave and rather inscrutable acquaintance the curious thing is do you know he began rather nervously that though i must have passed your gate at least twice in the last few months i have never noticed it before never even caught the sound of the water  no thats the best of it nobody ever does we are just buried alive we have lived here for years and scarcely know a soulnot even our own perhaps why on earth should one acquaintances after all are little else than a bad habit  but then what about me said lawford  but thats just it said herbert i said acquaintances thats just exactly what im going to provewhat very old friends we are youve no idea it really is rather queer he took up his cup and sauntered over to the window  lawford eyed him vacantly for a moment and following rather his own curious thoughts than seeking any light on this somewhat vague explanation again broke the silence its odd i suppose but this house affects me much in the same way as widderstone does im not particularly fancifulat least i used not to be but sitting here i seem i hope it isnt a very frantic remark it seems as though if only my ears would let me i should hearwell voices its just what you said about the silence i suppose its the age of the place it is very old  pretty old i suppose its wormeaten and rateaten and tindery enough in all conscience and the damp doesnt exactly foster it its a queer old shanty there are two or three accounts of it in some old local stuff i have and of course theres a ghost  a ghost echoed lawford looking up    chapter twelve  whats in a name laughed herbert but it really is a queer showup of human oddity a fellow comes in here searching thats all his back was turned as he stood staring absently out sipping his tea between his sentences he comes inoh its a positive fact for ive seen him myself just sitting back in my chair here you know watching him as one would a tramp in ones orchard he cast a candid glance over his shoulder first he looks round like a prying servant then he comes cautiously ona kind of grizzled fawncoloured face middlesize with big hands and then just like some quiet groping nocturnal creature he begins his precious searchshelves drawers that are not here cupboards gone years ago questing and nosing no end and quite methodically too until he reaches the window then he stops looks back narrows his foxy lids listensquite perceptibly you know a kind of gingerish blur then he seems to open this corner bookcase here as if it were a door and goes out along what i suppose might at some time have been an outside gallery or balcony unless as i rather fancy the house extended once beyond these windows anyhow out he goes quite deliberately treading the air as lightly as botticellis angels until however far you lean out of the window you cant follow him any further and thenand this is the bit that takes ones fancywhen you have contentedly noddled down again to whatever you may have been doing when the wretch appeared or are sitting in a cold sweat with bolting eyes awaiting developments just according to your school of thought or of nerves the creature comes backcomes back and with what looks uncommonly like a lighted candle in his hand that really is a thrill i assure you  but youve seen thisyouve really seen this yourself  oh yes twice replied herbert cheerfully and my sister quite by haphazard once saw him from the garden she was shelling peas one evening for sallie and she distinctly saw him shamble out of the window here and go shuffling along midair across the roaring washpot down below turn sharp round the high corner of the house sheer against the stars in a kind of frightened hurry and then after five minutes concentrated watching over the shucks she saw him come shuffling back againthe same distraction the same nebulous snuff colour and a candle trailing its smoke behind him as he whisked in home  and then  ah then said herbert lagging along the bookshelves and scanning the bookbacks with eyes partially closed he turned with lifted teapot and refilled his visitors cup then wherever you arei mean he added cutting up a little cake into six neat slices wherever the chance inmate of the room happens to be he comes straight for you at a quite alarming velocity and fades vanishes melts or as it were silts inside  lawford listened in a curious hush that had suddenly fallen over his mind fades inside siltsim awfully stupid but what on earth do you mean the room had slowly emptied itself of daylight its own darkness it seemed had met that of the narrowing night and herbert deliberately lit a cigarette before replying his clear pale face with its smooth outline and thin mouth and rather long dark eyes turned with a kind of serene goodhumour towards his questioner  why he said i mean frankly just that besides its grisels own phrase and an old nurse we used to have said much the same he comes or it comes towards you first just walking then with a kind of gradually accelerated slide or glide and sweeps straight into you he tapped his chest me whoever it may be is here in a kind of panic i suppose to hide or perhaps simply to get back again  get back where  be resumed as it were via you you see i suppose he is compelled to regain his circle or purgatory or styx whatever you like to call it via consciousness no one present then no revenant or spook or astral body or hallucination whats in a name and of course even an hallucination is mindstuff and on its own as it were what i mean is that the poor devil must have some kind of human personality to get back through in order to make his exit from our sphere of consciousness into his and naturally of course to make his entrance too if like a tenuous smoke he can get in the probability is that he gets out in precisely the same fashion for really if you werent consciously expecting the customary impact you actually jerk forward in the act of resistance unresisted you would not notice his going i am afraid i must be horribly boring you with all these tangled theories all i mean is that if you were really absorbed in what you happened to be doing at the time the thing might come and go with your mind for entrance and exit as it were without your being conscious of it at all there was a longish pause in which herbert slowly inhaled and softly breathed out his smoke  and whatwhat is the poor wretch searching for and whatwhy what becomes of him when he does go  ah there you have me one merely surmises just as ones temperament or convictions lean grisel says its some poor derelict soul in search of peacethat the poor beggar wants finally to die in fact and cant sallie smells crime after all what is every man he talked on a horde of ghostslike a chinese nest of boxesoaks that were acorns that were oaks death lies behind us not in frontin our ancestors back and back until  until lawford managed to remark  ah that settles me again dont they call it an amoeba but really i am abjectly ignorant of all that kind of stuff we are all we are and all in a sense we care to dream we are and for that matter anything outlandish bizarre is a godsend in this rather stodgy life it is after all just what the old boy saidits only the impossible thats credible whatever credible may mean  it seemed to lawford as if the last remark had wafted him bodily into the presence of his kind blinking intensely anxious old friend mr bethany and what leagues asunder the two men were who had happened on much the same words to express their convictions  he drew his hand gropingly over his face half rose and again seated himself whatever it may be he said the whole thing reminds me you knowit is in a way so curiously like my ownmy own case  herbert sat on a little drawn up in his chair quietly smoking the crash of the falling water after seeming to increase in volume with the fading of evening had again died down in the darkness to a low multitudinous tumult as of countless inarticulate echoing voices  bizarre you said god knows i am but herbert still remained obdurately silent you remember perhaps lawford faintly began again our talk the other night  oh rather replied the cordial voice out of the dusk  i suppose you thought i was insane  insane there was a genuinely amused astonishment in the echo you were lucidity itself besideswell honestly if i may venture i dont put very much truck in what one calls ones sanity except of course as a bond of respectability and a means of livelihood  but did you realise in the least from what i said how i really stand that i went down into that old shadowy hollow one man and came backwellthis  i gathered vaguely something like that i thought at first it was merely an affectationthat what you said was an affectation i meanuntilwell to be frank it was the this that so immensely interested me especially he added almost with a touch of gaiety especially the last glimpse but if its really not a forbidden question what precisely was the other what precise manner of man i mean came down into widderstone  it is my face that is changed mr herbert if youll try to understand memy face what you see now is not what i really am not what i was oh it is all quite different i know perfectly well how absurd it must sound and you wont press me further but thats the truth thats what they have done for me  it seemed to lawford as if a remote tiny shout of laughter had been suddenly caught back in the silence that had followed this confession he peered in vain in the direction of his companion even his cigarette revealed no sign of him i know i know he went gropingly on i felt it would sound to you like nothing but frantic incredible nonsense you cant see it you cant feel it you cant hear these hooting voices its no use at all blinking the fact i am simply on the verge if not over it of insanity  as to that mr lawford came the still voice out of the darkness the very fact of your being able to say so seems to me all but proof positive that youre not insanity is on another plane isnt it in which one cant compare ones states as for what you say being credible take our precious noodle of a spook here ninetynine hundredths of this amiable world of ours would have guffawed the poor creature into imperceptibility ages ago to such poor credulous creatures as my sister and i he is no more and no less a fact a personality an amusing reality thanwell this teacup here we are amazing mysteries both of us in any case and all round us are scores of books dealing just with life pure candid and unexpurgated and theres not a single one among them but reads like a taradiddle yet grope between the lines of any autobiography its pretty clear what one has gota feeble timid creeping attempt to describe the indescribable as for what you say your case is the bizarrethat kind very seldom gets into print at all in all our makebelieve all our pretence how honestly could it but there this is immaterial the real question is may i can i help what i gather is this you just trundled down into widderstone all among the dead men andbut one moment ill light up  a light flickered up in the dark shading it in his hand from the night air straying through the open window herbert lit the two candles that stood upon the little chimneypiece behind lawfords head then sauntering over to the window again almost as if with an affectation of nonchalance he drew one of the shutters and sat down nothing much struck me he went on leaning back on his hands i mean on sunday evening until you said goodbye it was then that i caught in the moon a distinct glimpse of your face  this said lawford with a sudden horrible sinking of the heart  herbert nodded the fact is i have a print of it he said  a print of it  a miserable little dingy engraving  of this herbert nodded with eyes fixed where  thats the nuisance i searched high and low for it the instant i got home for the moment it has been mislaid but it must be somewhere in the house and it will turn up all in good time its the frontispiece of one of a queer old hotchpotch of pamphlets sewn up together by some amateur enthusiast in a marbled paper coverconfessions travels trials and so on all eighteenth century and all in french  and mine said lawford gazing stonily across the candlelight  herbert from a head slightly stooping gazed back in an almost birdlike fashion across the room at his visitor  sabathiers he said  sabathiers  a really curious resemblance of course i am speaking only from memory and perhaps its not quite so vivid in this light but still astonishingly clear  lawford sat drawn up staring at his companions face in an intense and helpless silence his mouth opened but no words came  of course began herbert again i dont say theres anything in itexcept thethe mere coincidence he paused and glanced out of the open casement beside him but theres just one obvious question do you happen to know of any strain of french blood in your family  lawford shut his eyes even memory seemed to be forsaking him at last no he said after a long pause theres a little dutch i think on my mothers side but no french  no sabathier then said herbert smiling and then theres another questionthis change is it really as complete as you suppose has itplease just warn me off if i am in the least intrudinghas it been noticed  lawford hesitated oh yes he said slowly it has been noticedmy wife a few friends  do you mind this infernal clatter said herbert laying his fingers on the open casement  no no and you think  my dear fellow i dont think anything its all the craziest conjecture stranger things even than this have happened there are dozens herein print what are we human beings after all clay in the hands of the potter our bodies are merely an inheritance packed tight and corded up we have practically no control over their main functions we cant even replace a little fingernail and look at the faces of uswhat atrocious mockeries most of them are of any kind of image but we know our bodies changeage sickness thought passion fatality it proves they are amazingly plastic and merely even as a theory it is not in the least untenable that by force of some violent convulsive effort from outside ones body might change it answers with odd voluntariness to friend or foe smile or snarl as for what we call the laws of nature they are pure assumptions today and may be nothing better than scrapiron tomorrow good heavens lawford consider mans abysmal impudence he smoked on in silence for a moment you say you fell asleep down there  lawford nodded herbert tapped his cigarette on the sill just following up our ludicrous conjecture you know he remarked musingly it wasnt such a bad opportunity for the poor chap  but surely said lawford speaking as it were out of a dream of candlelight and reverberating sound and clearest darkness towards this strange deliberate phantom with the unruffled clearcut featuressurely then in that case he is here now and yet on my word of honour though every friend i ever had in the world should deny it i am the same memory stretches back clear and sound to my childhood i can see myself with extraordinary lucidity how i think my motives and all that and in spite of these voices that i seem to hear and this peculiar kind of longing to break away as it were just to press onit is ii myself that am speaking to you now out of thisthis mask  herbert glanced reflectively at his companion you mustnt let me tire you he said but even on our theory it would not necessarily follow that you yourself would be much affected its true this fellow sabathier really was something of a personality he had a rather unusual itch for life for trying on and on to squeeze something out of experience that isnt there and he seemed never to weary of a magnificent attempt to find in his fellowcreatures especially in the women he met what evenif they have itthey cannot give the little book i wanted to show you is partly autobiographical and really does manage to set the fellow on his feet even there he does absolutely take ones imagination i shall never forget the thrill of picking him up in the charing cross road you see i had known the queer old tombstone for years hes enormously vividquite beyond my feebleness to describe with a kind of french verve and rapture unluckily we cant get nearer than two years to his death i shouldnt mind guessing some last devastating dream swept over him held him the breath of an instant too long beneath the wave and he caved in we know he killed himself and perhaps lived to regret it ever after  after all what is this precious dying we talk so much about herbert continued after a while his eyes restlessly wandering from shelf to shelf you remember our talk in the churchyard we all know that the body fades quick enough when its occupant is gone supposing even in the sleep of the living it lies very feebly guarded and supposing in that state some infernally potent thing outside it wandering disembodied just happens on itlike some hungry sexton beetle on the carcase of a mouse supposingi know its the most outrageous theorisingbut supposing all these years of sun and dark sabathiers emanation or whatever you like to call it horribly restless by some fatality longing on and on just for life or even for the face the voice of some impossible she whom he couldnt get in this muddled world simply loathing all else supposing he has been lingering in ambush down beside those poor old dusty bones that had poured out for him such marrowy hospitalityoh i know it the dead do and then by a chance one quiet autumn evening a veritable godsend of a little miss muffet comes wandering down under the shade of his immortal cypresses half asleep fagged out depressed in mind and body perhaps imagine yourself in his place and he in yours herbert stood up in his eagerness his sleek hair shining the one clinching chance of a century wouldnt you have made a fight for it wouldnt you have risked the raid i can just conceive itthe amazing struggle in that darkness within a darkness like some dazed alien bee bursting through the sentinels of a hive one mad impetuous clutch at victory then the appalling stirring on the other side the groping back to a house dismantled rearranged not mind you disorganised or disintegrated he broke off with a smile as if of apology for his long fantastic harangue  lawford sat listening his eyes fixed on herberts colourless face there was not a sound else it seemed than that slightly drawling scrupulous voice poking its way amid a maze of enticing baffling thoughts herbert turned away with a shrug its tempting stuff he said choosing another cigarette but anyhow the poor beggar failed  failed  why surely if he had succeeded i should not now be talking to a mere imperfect simulacrum to the outward illusion of a passing likeness to the man but to sabathier himself his eyes moved slowly round and dwelt for a moment with a dark quiet scrutiny on his visitor  you say a passing likeness do you mean that  herbert smiled indulgently if one can mean what is purely a speculation i am only trying to look at the thing dispassionately you see we are so much the slaves of mere repetition here is lifeyours and minea kind of plenum in vacuo it is only when we begin to play the eavesdropper when something goes askew when one of the sentries on the frontier of the unexpected shouts a hoarse qui viveit is only then we begin to question to prick our aldermen and pinch the calves of our kings why who is there can answer to anybodys but his own satisfaction just that one fundamental questionare we the prisoners the slaves the inheritors the creatures or the creators of our bodies fallen angels or horrific dust as for identity or likeness or personality we have only our neighbours nod for them and just a fading memory no the old fairy tales knew better and witchcrafts witchcraft to the end of the chapter honestly and just of course on that one theory lawford i cant help thinking that sabathiers raid only just so far succeeded as to leave his impression in the wax it doesnt of course follow that it will necessarily end there it mightit may be even now just gradually fading away it may you know need driving outwith whips and scorpions it might perhaps work in  lawford sat cold and still its no good no good he said i dont understand i cant follow you i was always stupid always bigoted and cocksure these things have never seemed anything but old womens tales to me and now i must pay for it and this nicholas sabathier you say he was a blackguard  well said herbert with a faint smile that depends on your definition of the word he wasnt a flunkey a fool or a prig if thats what you mean he wasnt perhaps on mrs grundys visiting list he wasnt exactly gregarious and yet in a sense that kind of temperament is so rare that sappho nelson and shelley shared it to the stodgy suety world of course its little else than sheer moonshine midsummer madness naturally in its own charming and stodgy way the world kept flickering cold water in his direction naturally it hissed i shall find the book you shall have the book oh yes  theres only one more question said lawford in a dull slow voice stooping and covering his face with his hands i know its impossible for you to realisebut to me time seems like that water there to be heaping up about me i wait just as one waits when the conductor of an orchestra lifts his hand and in a moment the whole surge of brass and wood cymbal and drum will crash outand sweep me under i cant tell you herbert how it all is with just these groping stirrings of that mole in my minds dark you say it may be this face working in god knows i find it easy to speak to youthis cold clear sense you know the others feel too much or are afraid orlet me thinkyes i was going to ask you a question but no one can answer it he peered darkly with white face suddenly revealed between his hands what remains now where do i come in what is there left for me to do  and at that moment there sounded even above the monotonous roar of the water beyond the windowthere fell the sound of a light footfall approaching along the corridor  listen said herbert heres my sister coming well ask her     chapter thirteen  the door opened lawford rose and into the further rays of the candlelight entered a rather slim figure in a light summer gown  just home said herbert  weve been for a walk  my sister always forgets everything said herbert turning to lawford even teatime this is mr lawford grisel weve been arguing no end and we want you to give a decision its just this supposing if by some impossible trick you had come in now not the charming familiar sister you are but shorter fatter fair and roundfaced quite different physically you knowwhat would you do  what nonsense you talk herbert  yes but supposing a complete transmogrificationby some unimaginable ingression or enchantment by nibbling a bunch of roses or whatever you like to call it  only physically  well yes actually but potentially whythats another matter  the dark eyes passed slowly from her brothers face and rested gravely on their visitors  is he making fun of me  lawford almost imperceptibly shook his head  but what a question and ive had no tea she drew her gloves slowly through her hand the thing of course isnt possible i know but shouldnt i go mad dont you think  lawford gazed quietly back into the clear grave deliberate eyes suppose suppose just for the sake of argumentnot he suggested  she turned her head and reflected glancing from one to the other of the pure steady candleflames  and what was your answer she said looking over her shoulder at her brother  my dear child you know what my answers are like  and yours  lawford took a deep breath gazing mutely forlornly into the lovely untroubled peace of her eyes and without the least warning tears swept up into his own with an immense effort he turned and choking back every sound beating hack every thought groped his way towards the square black darkness of the open door  i must think i must think he managed to whisper lifting his hand and steadying himself he caught over his shoulder the glimpse of a curiously distorted vision a lifted candle and a still face gazing after him with infinitely grieved eyes then found himself groping and stumbling down the steep uneven staircase into the darkness of the queer old wooden and hushed and lonely house the night air cold on his face calmed his mind he turned and held out his hand  youll come again herbert was saying with a hint of anxiety even of apology in his voice  lawford nodded with eyes fixed blankly on the candle and turning once more made his way slowly down the narrow greenbordered path upon which the stars rained a scattered light so feeble it seemed but as a haze that blurred the darkness he pushed open the little white wicket and turned his face towards the soundless leafcrowned hill he had advanced hardly a score of steps in the thick dust when almost as if its very silence had struck upon his ear he remembered the black broken grave with its sightless heads that lay beyond the leaves and fear vast and menacing fear such as only children know broke like a sea of darkness on his heart he stopped deadcold helpless trembling and in the silence he heard a faint cry behind him and light footsteps pursuing him he turned again in the thick close gloom beneath the enormous elmboughs the grey eyes shone clearly visible in the face upturned to him my brother she began breathlesslythe little french book it was i whowho mislaid it  the set stricken face listened unmoved  you are ill come back i am afraid you are very ill  its not that not that lawford muttered dont leave me i am alone dont question me he said strangely looking down into her face clutching her hand only understand that i cant i cant go on he swept a lean arm towards the unseen churchyard i am afraid  the cold hand clasped his closer hush dont speak come back come back i am with you a friend you see come back  lawford clutched her hand as a blind man in sudden peril might clutch the hand of a child he saw nothing clearly spoke almost without understanding his words  oh but its must he said i must go on you seewhy everything depends on struggling through the future but if you only knewthere again his arm swept out and the lean terrified face turned shuddering from the dark  i do know believe me believe me i can guess see i am coming with you we will go together as if as if i did not know what it is to be afraid oh believe me no one is near we go on and see it gradually gradually lightens how thankful i am i came  she had turned and they were steadily ascending as if pushing their way battling on through some obstacle of the mind rather than of the senses beneath the starpowdered callous vault of night and it seemed to lawford as if as they pressed on together some obscure detestable presence as slowly as doggedly had drawn worsted aside he could see again the peaceful outspread branches of the trees the lychgate standing in clearcut silhouette against the liquid dusk of the sky a strange calm stole over his mind the very meaning and memory of his fear faded out and vanished as the passedaway clouds of a storm that leave a purer serener sky  they stopped and stood together on the brow of the little hill and lawford still trembling from head to foot looked back across the hushed and lightless countryside its all gone now he said wearily and now theres nothing left you see i cannot even ask your forgivenessand a stranger  please dont say thatunlessunlessa pilgrim too i think surely you must own we did have the best of it that time yesand i dont care who may be listeningbut we did win through  what can i say how shall i explain how shall i make you understand  the clear grey eyes showed not the faintest perturbation but i do i do indeed in part i do understand ever so faintly  and now i will come back with you  they paused in the darkness face to face the silence of the sky arched in its vastness above the little hill the only witness of their triumph  she turned unquestioningly and laughing softly almost as children do the stalking shadows of a twilight wood behind themthey trod in silence back to the house they said goodbye at the gate and lawford started once more for home he walked slowly conscious of an almost intolerable weariness as if his strength had suddenly been wrested away from him and at some distance beyond the top of the hill he sat down on the bank beside a nettled ditch and with his book pressed down upon the wayside grass struck a match and holding it low in the scented windless air turned slowly the cockled leaf  few of them were alike except for the dinginess of the print and the sinister smudge of the portraits all were sewn roughly together into a mouldstained marbled cover he lit a second match and as he did so glanced as if inquiringly over his shoulder and a score or so of pages before the end he came at last upon the name he was seeking and turned the page  it was a likeness even more striking in its crudeness of ink and line and paper than the most finished of portraits could have been it repelled and yet it fascinated him he had not for a moment doubted herberts calm conviction and yet as he stooped in the grass closely scrutinising the blurred obscure features he felt the faintest surprise not so much at the significant resemblance but at his own composure his own steady unflinching confrontation with this sinister and intangible adversary the match burned down to his fingers it hissed faintly in the grass  he stuffed the book into his pocket and stared into the pale dial of his watch it was a few minutes after eleven midnight then would just see him in he rose stiffly and yawned in sheer exhaustion then hesitating he turned his head and looked back towards the hollow but a vague foreboding held him back a sour and vacuous incredulity swept over him what was the use of all this struggling and vexation what gain in living on once dead his sluggish spirit at least would find its rest dust to dust it would indeed be for him what else in sober earnest had he been all his daily stolid life but half dead scarce conscious without a living thought or desire in head or heart  and while he was still gloomily debating within himself he had turned towards home and soon was walking in a kind of reverie even his extreme tiredness in part forgotten and only a faraway dogged recollection in his mind that in spite of shame in spite of all his miserable weakness the words had been uttered once for all and in all sincerity we did win through  yet a desolate and odd air of strangeness seemed to drape his unlighted house as he stood looking up in a kind of furtive communion with its windows it affected him with that discomforting air of extreme and meaningless novelty that things very familiar sometimes take upon themselves in this leaden tiredness no impression could be trustworthy his lids shut of themselves as he softly mounted the steps it seemed a needlessly wide door that soundlessly admitted him but however hard he pressed the key his bedroom door remained stubbornly shut until he found that it was already unlocked and he had only to turn the handle a nightlight burned in a little basin on the washstand the room was hung as it were with the stillness of night and half lying on the bed in her dressinggown her head leaning on the rail at the foot was alice just as sleep had overtaken her  lawford returned to the door and listened it seemed he heard a voice talking downstairs and yet not talking for it ran on and on in an incessant slightly argumentative monotony that had neither break nor interruption he closed the door and stooping laid his hand softly on alices narrow still childish hand that lay halffolded on her knee her eyes opened instantly and gazed widely into his face a slow vacant smile of sleep came and went and her fingers tightened gently over his as again her lids drooped down over the drowsy blue eyes  at last at last dear she said i have been waiting such a time but we mustnt talk much mother is waiting up reading  faintly through the closeshut door came the sound of that distant expressionless voice monotonously rising and falling  why didnt you tell me dear alice still sleepily whispered would i have asked a single question how could i oh if you had only trusted me  but the changethe change alice you must have seen that you spoke to me you did think i was only a stranger and even when you knew it was only fear on your face dearest and aversion and you turned to your mother first dont think alice that i amgod only knowsim not complaining but truth is best whatever it is i do feel that you mustnt be afraid of hurting me my dear  her very hands seemed to quicken in his as now with sleep quite gone the fret of memory returned and she must reassure both herself and him but you see dear mother had told me that youbesides i did know you at once really quite inside you know deep down i know i was perplexed i didnt understand but that was all why even when you came up in the dark and we talkedif you only knew how miserable i had beenthough i knew even then there was something different still i was not a bit afraid was i and shouldnt i have been afraid horribly afraid if you had not been you she repressed a little shudder and clasped his hand more closely dont let us say anything more about it she implored him we are just together again you and i that is all that matters but her words were like brave soldiers who have fought their way through an ambuscade but have left all confidence behind them  lawford listened and that was enough just nowthat she still in spite of doubt believed in him and thought and cared for him he was too tired to have refused the least kindness he made no answer but leant his head on the cool slender fingers in gratitude and peace and just as he was he almost instantly fell asleep he woke in the darkness to find himself alone he groped his way heavily to the door and turned the handle but now it was really locked energy failed him i supposesheila he muttered    chapter fourteen  sheila calm alert reserved was sitting at the open window when he awoke again his breakfast tray stood on a little table beside the bed he raised himself on his elbow and looked at his wife the morning light shone full on her features as she turned quickly at sound of his stirring  you have slept late she said in a low mellow voice  have i sheila i suppose i was tired out it is very kind of you to have got everything ready like this  i am afraid arthur i was thinking rather of the maids i like to inconvenience them as little as possible in their usual routine i mean how are you feeling do you think this morning  ii havent seen the glass sheila  she paused to place a little pencil tick at the foot of the page of her butchers book and did youdid you try  did i try try what  i understood she said turning slowly in her chair you gave me to understand that you went out with the specific intention of trying to regain but there forgive me arthur i think i must be getting a little bit hardened to the position so far at least as any hope is in my mind of rather amateurish experiments being of much help i may seem unsympathetic in saying frankly what i feel but amateurish or no you are curiously erratic why if you really were the dr ferguson whose part you play so admirably you could scarcely spend a more active life  all you mean sheila i suppose is that i have failed  failed did not enter my mind i thought looking at you just now in your clothes on the bed one might for the moment be deceived into thinking there was a slightquite the slightest improvement there was not quite thatshe hovered for the right wordthat tenseness whether or not whether you desired any such change or didnt i should have supposed in any case it would have been better to act as far as possible like any ordinary person you were certainly in an extraordinarily sound sleep i was almost alarmed until i remembered that it was a little after two when i looked up from reading aloud to keep myself awake and discovered that you had only just come home i had no fire you know how easily late hours bring on my headaches a little thought might possibly have suggested that i should be anxious to hear but no it seems i cannot profit by experience arthur and even now you have not answered surely a very natural question you do not recollect perhaps exactly what did happen last night did you go in the direction even of widderstone  yes sheila i went to widderstone  it was of course absurd to suppose that sitting on a seat beside the brokendown grave of a suicide would have the slightest effect on onesones physical condition though possibly it might affect ones brain it would mine i am at least certain of that it was your own prescription however and it merely occurred to me to inquire whether the actual experience has not brought you round to my own opinion  yes i think it has lawford answered calmly but i dont quite see what suicide has got to do with it unlessyou know widderstone then sheila  i drove there last saturday afternoon  for prayer or praise although lawford had not actually raised his head he became conscious rather of the wonderfully adjusted mass of hair than of the pained dignity in the face that was now closely regarding him  i went came the rigidly controlled retort simply to test an inconceivable story  and returned  convinced arthur of its inconceivability but if you would kindly inform me what precise formula you followed at widderstone last night i would tell you why i think the explanation or rather your first account of the matter is not an explanation of the facts  lawford shot a rather doglike glance over his toast danton he said  candidly arthur mr danton doubts the whole story your very conductwell it would serve no useful purpose to go into that candidly on the other hand mr danton did make some extremely helpful suggestionsbasing them of course on the truth of your account he has seen a good deal of life and certainly very mysterious things do occur to quite innocent and wellmeaning people without the faintest shadow of warning and as mr bethany himself said evil birds do come home to roost and often out of a clear sky as it were but there every fresh solution that occurs to me only makes the thing more preposterous more i was going to say disreputablei mean of course to the outside world and we have our duties to perform to them too i suppose why what can we say what plausible account of ourselves have we we shall never be able to look anybody in the face again i can onlyi am compelled to believe that god has been pleased to make this precise visitation upon usan eye for an eye i suppose somewhere and to that conviction i shall hold until actual circumstances convince me that its false what however and this is all that i have to say now what i cannot understand are your amazing indiscretions  do you understand your own sheila  my indiscretions arthur  well said lawford wasnt it indiscreet dont you think to risk divine retribution by marrying me shouldnt you have inquired wasnt it indiscreet to allow me to remain here inin my visitation wasnt it indiscreet to risk the moral stigma this unhappy face of mine must cast on its surroundings i am not sure whether such a change as this constitutes cruelty oh what is the use of fretting and babbling on like this  am i to understand then that you refuse positively to discuss this horrible business any more you are doing your best to drive me away arthur you must see that will you be very disappointed if i refuse to go  lawford rose from the bed listen just this once he said seating himself on the corner of the dressingtable imagine all thiswhatever you like to call itobliterated take this he nodded towards the glass entirely for itself on its own merits as it were let the dead past bury its dead which now precisely really do you preferhim he jerked his head in the direction of the dispassionate youthful picture on the wall him or me  he was so close to her now that he could see the faintest tremor on the face that had suddenly become grey and still in the thin clear sunshine  i own it i own it he went on slowly the change is more than skindeep now one cant go through what i have gone through these last few terrifying days sheila unchanged they have played the devil with my body now begins the tampering with my mind not even danton knows how it will end but shall i tell you why you wont why you cant answer me that one questionhim or me shall i tell you  sheila slowly raised her eyes  it is because my dear you dont care the ghost of a straw for either that onehe was worn out long ago and we never knew it i know it now time and the sheer goingon of day by day without either of us guessing at it wore that down till it had no more meaning for you or me than any other faded remembrance in this interminable footling with truth that we call life and this onethe whole abject meaning of it lies simply in the fact that it has pierced down and shown us up i had no courage i couldnt see how feeble a hold i had on lifejust ones friends opinions it was all at second hand what i want to know now isleave me out dont think or care or regard my livingon one shadow of an iotaall i ask is what am i to do for you he turned away and stood staring down at the cinders in the fireless grate  i answer that mad wicked outburst with one plain question said a low trembling voice did you or did you not go to widderstone yesterday  i did go  you sat there just as you said you sat before and with all your heart and soul strove to regainyourself  lawford lifted a still colourless face into the sunlight no he said i spent the evening at the house of a friend  then i say it is infamous you cast all this on me you have brought me into contempt and poisoned alices whole life you dream and idle on just as you used to do without the least care or thought or consideration for others and go out in this conditiongo out absolutely unashamedto spend the evening at a friends peculiar friends they must be why really arthur you must be mad  lawford paused like a flock of sheep streaming helterskelter before the onset of a wolf were the thoughts that a moment before had seemed so orderly and sober  not madpossessed he said softly  and i add this cried sheila as it were out of a tragic mask somewhere in the past whether of your own life or of the lives of those who brought you into the worldthe world which you pretend so conveniently to despisesomewhere is hidden some miserable secret god visits all sins on you has fallen at last the payment that i believe you cant run away any more than a child can run away from the cupboard it has been locked into for a punishment whos going to hear you now you have deliberately refused to make a friend of me fight it out alone then  lawford heard the door close and the dying away of the sound that had been the unceasing accompaniment of all these later yearsthe rustling of his wifes skirts her crisp authoritative footstep and he turned towards the flooding sunlight that streamed in on the upturned surface of the lookingglass no clear decisive thought came into his mind only a vague recognition that so far as sheila was concerned this was the end no regret no remorse visited him he was just alone again that was allalone as in reality he had always been alone without having the sense or power to see or to acknowledge it all he had said had been the mere flotsam of the moment and now it stood stark and irrevocable between himself and the past  he sat down dazed and stupid again and again a struggling recollection tried to obtrude itself again and again he beat it back and rather for something to distract his attention than for any real interest or enlightenment he might find in its pages he took out the grimy dogseared book that herbert had given him and turned slowly over the leaves till he came to sabathier once more snatches of remembrance of their long talk returned to him but just as that dark waterhaunted house had seemed to banish remembrance and the reality of the room in which he now sat and of the old familiar life so now the house the faces of yesterday seemed in their turn unreal almost spectral and the thick print on the smudgy page no more significant than a story one reads and throws away  but a moments comparison in the glass of the two faces side by side suddenly sharpened his attentionthe resemblance was so oddly arresting and yet and yet so curiously inconclusive there was then something of the stolid old saxon left he thought or had it been regained which was it not merely the complexity of the question but a halfconscious distaste of attempting to face it set him reading very slowly and laboriously for his french was little more than fragmentary recollection the first few pages of the life of this buried sabathier but with a disinclination almost amounting to aversion he made very slow progress many of the words were meaningless to him and every other moment he found himself listening with intense concentration for the least hint of what sheila was doing of what was going on in the house beneath him he had not very long to wait he was sitting with his head leaning on his hand the book unheeded beneath the other on the table when the door opened again behind him and sheila entered she stood for a moment calm and dignified looking down on him through her veil  please understand arthur that i am not taking this step in pique or even in anger it would serve no purpose to go on like thisthis incessant heedlessness and recrimination there have been mistakes misconceptions perhaps on both sides to me naturally yours are most conspicuous that need not however blind me to my own  she paused in vain for an answer  think the whole thing over candidly and quietly she began again in a quiet rapid voice have you really shown the slightest regard i wont say for me or even for alice but for just the obvious difficulties andand proprieties of our position i have given up as far as i can brooding on and on over the same horrible impossible thoughts i withdraw unreservedly what i said just now about punishment whatever the evidence it is not even a wifes place to judge like that you will forgive me that  lawford did not turn his head of course he said looking rather vacantly out of the window it was only in the heat of the moment sheila though who knows it may be true  well she took hold of the great brass knob at the foot of the bed with one gloved handwell i feel it is my duty to withdraw it apart from it i see only too clearly that even though all that has happened in these last few days was in reality nothing but a horrible nightmare i see that even then what you have said about our married life together can never be recalled you have told me quite deliberately that for years past your life has been nothing but a pretencea sham you implied that mine had been too honestly i was not aware of it arthur but supposing all that has happened to you had been merely what might happen at any moment to anybody some actual defacement you will forgive me suggesting such a horrible thingwhy if what you say is true even in that case my sympathy would have been only a continual fret and annoyance to you and thisthis change i own is infinitely harder to bear it would be an outrage on common sense and on all that we hold seemly andand sacred in life even in some trumpery story you do you must see all that arthur  oh yes said lawford narrowing his eyes to pierce through the sunlight i see all that  then we need not go over it all again whatever others may say or think i shall still at least so long as nothing occurs to the contrary keep firmly to my present convictions mr bethany has assured me repeatedly that he has nono misgivings that he understands and even if i still doubted which i dont arthur though it would be rather trying to have to accept ones husband at secondhand as it were i should have to be satisfied i dare say even such an unheardof thing as what we are discussing now or something equally ghastly does occur occasionally in foreign countries perhaps i have not studied such things enough to say we were all very much restricted in our reading as children and i honestly think not unwisely it is enough for the present to repeat that i do believe and that whatever may happenand i know absolutely nothing about the procedure in such casesbut whatever may happen i shall still be loyal i shall always have your interests at heart her words faltered and she turned her head away you did love me once arthur i cant forget that the contralto voice trembled ever so little and the gloved hand smoothed gently the brass knob beneath  if said lawford resting his face on his hands and curiously watching the while his moving reflection in the lookingglass before himif i said i still loved you what then  but you have already denied it arthur  yes but if i said that that too was said only in haste that brooding over the trouble thisthis metamorphosis was bringing on us all had driven me almost beyond endurance supposing that i withdrew all that and instead said now that i do still love you just as i he turned a little and turned back again like this  sheila paused could any woman answer such a question she almost sighed at last  yes but lawford pressed on in a voice almost naive and stubborn as a childs if i tried toto make you i did once sheila  i cant i cant conceive such a position surely that alone is almost as frantic as it is heartless is it is it even right  well i have not actually asked it i own he added moodily almost under his breath it would bedangerous but there sheila this poor old mask of mine is wearing out i am somehow convinced of that what will be left god only knows you were saying he rose abruptly please please sit down he said i did not notice you were standing  i shall not keep you a moment she answered hurriedly i will sit here the truth is arthur she began again almost solemnly apart from all sentiment andand good intentions my presence here only harasses you and keeps you back i am not so bound up in myself that i cannot realise that the consequence is that after calmlyand i hope consideratelythinking the whole thing over i have come to the conclusion that it would arouse very little comment the least possible perhaps in the circumstances if i just went away for a few days you are not in any sense ill in fact i have never known you soso robust so energetic you will be alone mr bethany perhaps you could go out and come in just as you pleased possibly sheila smiled frankly beneath her veil even this dr ferguson you have invented will be a help its only the servants that remain to be considered  i should prefer to be quite alone  then do not worry about them i can easily explain and if you would not mind letting her in mrs gull can come in every other day or so just to keep things in order shes entirely trustworthy and discreet or perhaps if you would prefer  mrs gull will do nicely sheila its very good of you to have given me so much thought a long and rather arduous pause followed  oh one other thing arthur you sent out to mr critchettdo you rememberthe night you first came home i think too after the first awful shock when we were sitting in our bedroom you actually referred toto violent measures you will promise me i may perhaps at least ask that you will promise me on your word of honour for alices sake if not for mine to do nothing rash  yes yes said lawford sinking lower even than he had supposed possible into the thin and lightless chill of ennuinothing rash  sheila rose with a sigh only in part suppressed i have not seen mr bethany again i think however it would be better to let harry know i mean dear of your derangement after all he is one of the familyat least of mine he will not interfere he would perhaps quite naturally be hurt if we did not take him into our confidence otherwise there is no pressing cause for haste at least for another week or so after that i suppose something will have to be done then theres mr wedderburn wouldnt it be as well to let him know that at least for the present you are quite unable to think of returning to town that too in time will have to be arranged i suppose if nothing happens meanwhile i mean if things dont come right and i do hope arthur you will not set your mind too closely on what may only prove false hopes this is all intensely painful to me of course to us both  again lawford even though he did not turn to confront it became conscious of the black veil turned towards him tentatively speculatively impenetrably  yes he said ill write to wedderburn hes had his ups and downs too  i always rather fancied so said sheila reflectively he looks rather aa restless man oh and then again she broke off quickly theres the question of money i supposeit is only a conjecturei suppose it would be better to do nothing in that direction just for the present ada has now gone to the bank fifty pounds arthur it is out of my own private accountdo you think that will be enough just of course for your present needs  as a bribe hushmoney or a thankoffering sheila murmured her husband wearily  i dont follow you replied the discreet voice from beneath the veil  he did actually turn this time and glance steadily over his shoulder how long are you going for and where  i proposed to go to my cousins bettie lovats that is of course if you have no objection its near it will be a longdeferred visit and she need know very little and of course if for the least thing in the world you should want me there i am within call as it were and you will write we are acting for the best arthur  so long as it is your best sheila  sheila pondered you think you mean theyll all say i ought to have stayed candidly i cant see it in that light surely every experience of life proves that in intimate domestic matters and especially in those between husband and wife only the parties concerned have any means of judging what is best for them it has been our experience at any rate though i must in fairness confess that outwardly at least i havent had much of that kind of thing to complain of sheila paused again for a reply  what kind of thing  domestic experience dear  the house was quiet there was not a sound stirring in the still sunny road of orchards and discreet and drowsy villas a long silence followed immensely active and alert on the one side almost morbidly lethargic so far as the stooping figure in front of the lookingglass was concerned at last the last haunting question came in a kind of croak as if only by a supreme effort could it be compelled to produce itself for consideration  and alice sheila  alice dear of course goes with me  you realise he stirred uneasily you realise it may be final  my dear arthur cried sheila it is surely apart from mere delicacy a parental obligation to screen the poor child from the shock could she be at such a time in any better keeping than her mothers at present she only vaguely guesses to know definitely that her father infinitely worse than death hadhadoh is it possible to realise anything in this awful cloud it would kill her outright  lawford made no stir the quietest of raps came at the door the money from the bank maam said a faint voice  sheila carefully opened the door a few inches she laid the blue envelope on the dressingtable at her husbands elbow you had better perhaps count it she said in a low voiceforty in notes the rest in gold and narrowed her eyes beneath her veil upon her husbands very peculiar method of forgetting his responsibilities  french she said with a nod how very quaint  lawfords eyes fell and rested gravely on the dingy page of herberts meanlooking bundle of print a queer feeling of cold crept over him yes he said vaguely french and hopelessly failed to fill in the silence that seemed like some rather sleek nocturnal creature quietly waiting to be fed  sheila swept softly towards the door well arthur i think that is all the servants will have gone by this evening i have ordered a carriage for halfpast twelve perhaps you would first write down anything that occurs to you to be necessary perhaps too it would be better if dr simon were told that we shall not need him any more that you are thinking of a complete change of scene a voyage he is obviously useless besides mr bethany i think is going to discuss a specialist with you i have written him a little note just briefly explaining shall i write to dr simon too  you remember everything said lawford and it seemed to him it was a remark he had heard ages and ages ago its only this money sheila will you please take that away  take it away  i think sheila if i do take a voyage i should almost prefer to work my passage as for a mere change of scene thats quite uncostly  it is only your face arthur said sheila solemnly that suggest these wicked stabs some day you will perhaps repent of every one  it is possible sheila we none of us stand still you know one rips open a lid sometimes and the wax face rots before ones eyes take back your blue envelope and thank you for thinking of me its always the woman of the house that has the head  i wish said sheila almost pathetically and yet with a faint quaver of resignation i wish it could be said that the man of the house sometimes has the heart think it over arthur  sheila with her husbands luncheon tray brought also her farewells lawford surveyed not without a faint shy stirring of incredulity the superbly restrained presence he stood before her drylipped inarticulate a schoolboy caught redhanded in the shabbiest of offences  it is your wish then that i go arthur she said pleadingly  he handed her her money without a word  very well arthur if you wont take it she said i should scarcely have thought this the occasion for mere pride  the tenth she continued as she squeezed the envelope into her purse with only the least hardening of voice although i daresay you have not troubled to remember itthe tenth will be the eighteenth anniversary of our weddingday it makes parting however advisable and though only for the few days we should think nothing of in happier circumstances a little harder to bear but there all will come right you will see things in a different light perhaps words may wound but time will heal but even as she now looked closely into his colourless sunken face some distant memory seemed to well up irresistiblythe memory of eyes just as ingenuous and as unassuming that even in claiming her love had expressed only their stolid unworthiness  did you know it have you seen it she said stooping forward a little i believe in spite of all he gazed on solemnly almost owlishly out of his fading mask  wait till mr bethany tells you you will believe it perhaps from him he saw the greygloved hand a little reluctantly lifted towards him  goodbye sheila he said and turned mechanically back to the window  she hesitated listening to a small faraway voice that kept urging her with an almost froglike pertinacity to do to say something and yet as stubbornly would not say what and she was gone    chapter fifteen  raying and gleaming in the sunlight the hired landau drove up to the gate lawford peeping between the blinds looked down on the coachman with reins hanging loosely from his red squatthumbed hand seated in his tight livery and indescribable hat on the faded cushions one thing only was in his mind and it was almost with an audible cry that he turned towards the figure that edged white and trembling into the chill room to fling herself into his arms dont look at me he begged her only remember dearest i would rather have died down there and been never seen again than have given you pain runrun your mothers calling write to me think of me goodbye  he threw himself on the bed and lay there till eveningtill the door had shut gently behind the last rat to leave the sinking ship all the clearness the calmness were gone again round and round in dizzy sickening flare and clatter his thoughts whirled contempt fear loathing blasphemy laughter longing there was no end death was no end there was no meaning no refuge no hope no possible peace to give up was to go to perdition to go forward was to go mad and even madnesshe sat up with trembling lips in the twilightmadness itself was only a state only a state you might be bereaved and the pain and hopelessness of that would pass you might be cast out betrayed deserted and still be you still find solitude lovely and in a brave face a friend but madnessit surged in on him with all the clearness and emptiness of a dream and he sat quite still his hand clutching the bedclothes his head askew waiting for the sound of footsteps for the presences and the voices that have their thinwalled dwelling beneath the shallow crust of consciousness  inky blackness drifted up in wisps in smoke before his eyes he was powerless to move to cry out there was no room to turn no air to breathe and yet there was a low continuous nevervarying stir as of an enormous wheel whirling in the gloom countless infinitesimal faces arched like glimmering pebbles the huge dimcoloured vault above his head he heard a voice above the monstrous rustling of the wheel clamouring calling him back he was hastening headlong muttering to himself his own flat meaningless name like a child repeating as he runs his errand and then as if in a charmed cold pool he awoke and opened his eyes again on the gathering darkness of the great bedroom and heard a quick importunate longcontinued knocking on the door below as of some one who had already knocked in vain  cramped and heavylimbed he felt his way across the room and lit a candle he stood listening awhile his eyes fixed on the door that hung a little open all in the room seemed acutely fantastically still the flame burned dim misled in the sluggish air he stole slowly to the door looked out and again listened again the knocking broke out more impetuously and yet with a certain restraint and caution shielding the flame of his candle in the shell of his left hand lawford moved slowly with chin uplifted to the stairs he bent forward a little and stood motionless and drawn up the pupils of his eyes slowly contracting and expanding as he gazed down into the carpeted vacant gloom past the dim louring presence that had fallen back before him  his mouth opened whos there at last he called  thank god thank god he heard mr bethany mutter i mustnt call lawford came a hurried whisper as if the old gentleman were pressing his lips to speak through the letterbox come down and open the door theres a good fellow ive been knocking no end of a time  yes i am coming said lawford he shut his mouth and held his breath and stair by stair he descended driving steadily before him the crouching gloating menacing shape darkly lifted up before him against the darkness contending the way with him  are you ill are you hurt has anything happened lawford came the anxious old voice again striving in vain to be restrained  no no muttered lawford i am coming coming slowly he paused to breathe his hands trembling his hair lank with sweat and still with eyes wide open he descended against the phantom lurking in the darknessan adversary that if he should but for one moment close his lids he felt would master sanity and imagination with its evil so long as you dont get in he heard himself muttering so long as you dont get in my friend  whats that youre saying came up the muffled querulous voice i cant for the life of me hear my boy  nothing nothing came softly the answer from the foot of the stairs i was only speaking to myself  deliberately with candle held rigidly on a level with his eyes lawford pushed forward a pace or two into the airless empty drawingroom and grasped the handle of the door he gazed in awhile a black oblique shadow flung across his face his eyes fixed like an animals then drew the door steadily towards him and suddenly some power that had held him tense seemed to fail he thrust out his head and his face quivering with fear and loathing spat defiance as if in a passion of triumph into the gloom  still muttering he shut the door and turned the key in another moment his light was gleaming out on the grey perturbed face and black narrow shoulders of his visitor  you gave me quite a fright said the old man almost angrily have you hurt your foot or something  it was very dark said lawford down the stairs  what said mr bethany still more angrily blinking out of his unspectacled eyes has she cut off the gas then  you got the note said lawford unmoved  yes yes i got the note gone  oh yes all gone it was my choice i preferred it so  mr bethany sat down on one of the hard old wooden chairs that stood on either side of the lofty hall and breathing rather thickly rested his hands on his knees whats happened he inquired looking up into the candle i forgot my glasses old fool that i am and cant my dear fellow see you very plainly but your voice  i think said lawford i think its beginning to come back  what the whole thing oh no my dear dear man be frank with me not the whole thing  yes said lawford the whole thingvery very gradually imperceptibly i think even sheila noticed but i rather feel it than see it that is all im cornering him  him  lawford jerked his candle as if towards some definite goal in time he said  the two faces with the candle between them seemed as it were to gain light each from the other  well well said mr bethany every man for himself lawford its the only way but whats going to be done we must be cautious must think ofof the others  oh that said lawford shes going to squeeze me out  youvesquabbled oh but my dear honest old honest old idiot there are scores of families here in this parish within a stones throw that squabble wrangle all but politely tear each others eyes out every day of their earthly lives its perfectly natural where should we poor old busybodies be else peace on earth we bring and its mainly between husband and wife  yes said lawford but you see this was not our earthly life it was between us  listen listen to the dear mystic exclaimed the old creature scoffingly what depths were touching heres the first serious break of his lifetime and hes gone stark staring transcendental ah well he paused and glanced quickly about him with his curious birdlike poise of head but youre not alone here he inquired suddenly not absolutely alone  yes said lawford but theres plenty to think aboutand read i havent thought or read for years  no nor i after thirty my dear boy one merely annotates and the books called life bless me his solemn old voice is grinding epigrams out of even this poor old parochial barrelorgan you dont suppose you cannot be supposing you are the only serious person in the world whats more its only skin deep  lawford smiled skin deep but think quietly over it youll see im done  come here said mr bethany wheres the whiskey wheres the cigars you shall smoke and drink and ill watch if it werent for a pitiful old stomach id join you come on he led the way into the diningroom  he looked sparer more wizened and sinewy than ever as he stooped to open the sideboard where on earth do they keep everything he was muttering to himself  lawford put the candlestick down on the table theres only one thing he said watching his visitors rummaging what precisely do you think they will do with me  look here lawford snapped mr bethany ive come round here hooting through your letterbox to tally sense not sentiment why has your wife deserted you without a servant without a singleits perfectly monstrous  on my word of honour i prefer it so i couldnt have gone on alone i all but forget thisthis lupus every turn of her little finger reminded me of it we are all of us alone whether we know it or not you said so yourself and its better to realize it stark and unconfused besides you have no idea whatwhat odd things there may be there is something on the other side ill win through to that  mr bethany had been listening attentively he scrambled up from his knees with a halfempty syphon of sodawater see here lawford he said if you really want to know whats your most insidious and most dangerous symptom just now it is spiritual pride youve won what you think a domestic victory and you can scarcely bear the splendour oh you may shrug pray what is this other side which the superior doublefaced creatures going to win through to now he rapped it out almost bitterly almost contemptuously  lawford hardly heard the question before his eyes had suddenly arisen the peace the friendly unquestioning stillness the thunderous lullaby old as the grave its only a fancy it seemed i could begin again  well look here said mr bethany his whole face suddenly lined and grey with age you cant its the one solitary thing ive got to say as ive said it to myself morn noon and night these scores of years you cant begin again its all a delusion and a snare you say were alone so we are the worlds a dream a stage a mirage a rack call it what you willbut you dont change youre no illusion theres no crying off for you no ravelling out no clean leaves youve got thisthis trouble this afflictionmy dear dear fellow what shall i say to tell you how i grieve and groan for you oh yes and actually laughed i confess it a vile hysterical laughter to think of it youve got this almost intolerable burden to bear its come like a thief in the night but bear it you must and alone they say deaths a going to bed i doubt it but anyhow lifes a long undressing we came in puling and naked and every stitch must come off before we get out again we must stand on our feet in all our rabelaisian nakedness and watch the world fade well then and not another word of sense shall you worm out of my wornout old brains after todayall i say is dont give in why if you stood here now freed from this devilish disguise the old fat sluggish fellow that sat and yawned his head off under my eyes in his pew the sunday before last if i know anything about human nature id say it to your face and a fig for your vanity and resignationyour last state would be worse than the first there  he bunched up a big white handkerchief and mopped it over his head thats done he said and we wont go back what i want to know now is what are you going to do where are you sleeping what are you going to think about ill stayyes yes thats what it must be i must stay and i detest strange beds ill stay you shant be alone do you hear me lawfordyou shant be alone  lawford gazed gravely there is just one little thing i want to ask you before you go ive wormed out an extraordinary old french book andjust as you sayto pass the time ive been having a shot at translating it but im frightfully rusty its old french would you mind having a look  mr bethany blinked and listened he tried for the twentieth time to judge his friends eyes to gain as best he could some sustained and unobserved glance at this baffling face where is your precious french book he said irritably  its upstairs  fire away then lawford rose and glanced about the room what no light there either snapped mr bethany take this i dont mind the dark therell be plenty of that for me soon  lawford hesitated at the door looking rather strangely back no he said there are matches upstairs he shut the door after him the darkness seemed cold and still as water he went slowly up with eyes fixed wide on the floating luminous gloom and out of memory seemed to gather as faintly as in the darkness which they had exorcised for him the strange pitiful eyes of the night before and as he mounted a chill terrible physical peace seemed to steal over him  mr bethany was sitting as he had left him looking steadily on the floor when lawford returned he flattened out the book on the table with a sniff of impatience and dragging the candle nearer and stooping his nose close to the fusty print he began to read  was this in the house he inquired presently  no said lawford it was lent to me by a friendherbert  hm dont know him anyhow precious poor stuff this is this sabathier whoever he is seems to be a kind of claptrap eighteenthcentury adventurer who thought the world would be better off apparently for a long account of all his sentimental amours rousseau with a touch of don quixote in his composition and an echo of that prince of bogies poe what in the name of wonder induced you to fix on this for your holiday reading  sabathiers alive isnt he  i never said he wasnt hes a good deal too much alive for my old wits with his mamselle this and madame the other interesting enough perhaps for the professional literary nose with a taste for patchouli  yet i suppose even that is not a very rare character mr bethany peered up from the dingy book at his ingenuous questioner i should say decidedly that the fellow was a very rare character so long as by rare you dont mean good its one of the dullest stupidities of the present day my dear fellow to dote on a man simply because hes different from the rest of us once a man strays out of the common herd hes more likely to meet wolves in the thickets than angels from what i can gather in just these few pages this sabathier appears to have been an amorous adventurous emotional frenchman who went to the dogs as easily and as rapidly as his own nature and his period allowed and i should say lawford that he made precious bad reading for a poor old troubled hermit like yourself at the present moment  theres a portrait of him a few pages back  mr bethany with some little impatience turned back to the engraving nicholas de sabathiers he muttered de indeed he poked in at the foxy print with narrowed eyes i dont deny its a striking even perhaps a rather taking face i dont deny it he gazed on with an even more acute concentration and looked up sharply look here lawford what in the name of wonderwhat trick are you playing on me now  trick said lawford and the world fell with the tiniest plash in the silence like a vivid little float upon the surface of a shadowy pool  the old face flushed what conceivable bearing i say has this dead and gone old roue on us now  you dont think then you see any resemblanceany resemblance at all  resemblance repeated mr bethany in a flat voice and without raising his face again to meet lawfords direct scrutiny resemblance to whom  to me to me as i am  but even my dear fellow forgive my dull old brains even if there was just the faintest superficial suggestion ofof that what then  why said lawford hes buried in widderstone  buried in widderstone the keen childlike blue eyes looked almost stealthily up across the book the old man sat without speaking so still that it might even be supposed he himself was listening for a quiet distant footfall  he is buried in the grave beside which i fell asleep said lawford all green and still and broken he added faintly you remember he went on in a repressed voiceyou remember you asked me if there was anybody else in sight any eavesdropper you dont thinkhim  mr bethany pushed the book a few inches away from him who did you saywho was it you said put the thing into your head a queer friend surely he paused helplessly and how pray do you know he began again more firmly even if there is a sabathier buried at widderstone how do you know it is this sabathier its not i think he added boldly a very uncommon name with two bs at any rate whereabouts is the grave  quite down at the bottom under the trees and the little seat i told you of is there too where i fell asleep you see he explained the graves almost isolated i suppose because he killed himself  mr bethany clasped his knuckled fingers on the tablecloth its no good he concluded after a long pause the fellows got up into my head i cant think him out we must thrash it out quietly in the morning with the blessed sun at the window not this farthing dip to me the whole idea is as revolting as it is incredible why above a centuryno no and on the other hand how easily ones fancy builds a few straws and theres a nest and squawking fledglings all complete is that whyis that why that good practical wife of yours and all your faithful household have absconded does ithe threw up his head as if towards the house above themdoes it reek with him  lawford shook his head she hasnt seen him notnot apart i havent told her  mr bethany tossed the huggermugger of pamphlets across the table then for simple sanitys sake dont hide it burn it put the thing completely out of your mind a friend who where is this wonderful friend  not very far from widderstone he livespractically alone  and all that stumbling and muttering on the stairs he leant forward almost threateningly there isnt anybody here lawford  oh no said lawford we are practically alone with this you know he pointed to the book and smiled frankly however faintly  again mr bethany sank into a fixed yet uneasy reverie and again shook himself and raised his eyes  well then he said in a voice all but morose in its fretfullness what i suggest is that first you keep quiet here and next that you write and get your wife back you say you are better i think you said she herself noticed a slight improvement isnt it just exactly as i foresaw and yet shes gone but thats not our business get her back and dont for a single instant waste a thought on the other not for a single instant i implore you lawford and in a week the whole thing will be no more than a dreary preposterous dream you dont answer me he cried impulsively  but can one so easily forget a dream like this  you dont speak out lawford you mean she wont  it must at least seem to have been in part of my own seeking or contriving or at any rateshe said itof my own hereditary or unconscious deserving  she said that mr bethany sat back i see i see he said im nothing but a fumbling old meddler and there was i not ten minutes ago preaching for all i was worth on a text i knew nothing about god bless me lawford how long we take alearning ill say no more but what an illusion to think thisthishe laid a long lean hand at arms length flat upon the table towards his friendto think this is our old jogtrot arthur lawford from henceforth i throw you over you old wolf in sheeps wool i wash my hands of you and now where am i going to sleep  he covered up his age and weariness for an instant with a small crooked hand  lawford took a deep breath youre going old friend to sleep at home and iim going to give you my arm to the vicarage gate here i am immeasurably relieved fitter than ive been since i was a dolt of a schoolboy on my word of honour i cant say why but i am i dont care that vicar honestlypuffed up with spiritual pride if a man cant sleep with pride for a bedfellow well hed better try elsewhere its no good im as stubborn as a mule thats at least a relic of the old adam i care no more he raised his voice firmly and gravelyi dont care a jot for solitude not a jot for all the ghosts of all the catacombs  mr bethany listened grimly pursed up his lips not a jot for all the ghosts of all the catechisms he muttered nor the devil himself i suppose he turned once more to glance sharply in the direction of the face he could so dimlyand of set purposediscern and without a word trotted off into the hall lawford followed with the candle  pon my word you havent had a mouthful of supper let me forage just a quarter of an hour eh  not me said mr bethany if you wont have me home i go i refuse to encourage this miserable grasswidowering what would they say what would the busybodies say ghouls and graves and shocking mysteriesselina sister anne come on  he shuffled on his hat and caught firm hold of his knobbed umbrella better not leave a candle he said  lawford blew out the candle  what what called the old man suddenly but no voice had spoken  a thin trickle of light from the lamp in the street stuck up through the fanlight as with a smile that could be described neither as mischievous saturnine nor vindictive and was yet faintly suggestive of all three lawford quietly opened the drawingroom door and put down the candlestick on the floor within  what on earth my good man are you fumbling after now came the almost fretful question from under the echoing porch  coming coming said lawford and slammed the door behind them     chapter sixteen  the first faint streaks of dawn were silvering across the stars when lawford again let himself into his deserted house he stumbled down to the pantry and cut himself a crust of bread and cheese and ate it sitting on the table watching the leafy eastern sky through the painted bars of the area window he munched on hungry and tired his night walk had cooled head and heart having obstinately refused mr bethanys invitation to sleep at the vicarage he had sat down on an old low wall and watched until his light had shone out at his bedroom window then he had simply wandered on past rustling glimmering gardens under the great timbers of yellowing elms hardly thinking hardly aware of himself except as in a faraway vision of a sluggish insignificant creature struggling across the tossedup crust of an old incomprehensible world  the secret of his content in that long leisurely ramble had been that repeatedly by a scarcely realised effort it had not lain in the direction of widderstone and now as he sat hungrily devouring his breakfast on the table in the kitchen with the daybreak comforting his eyes he thought with a positive mockery of that poor old nightthing he had given inch by inch into the safe keeping of his pink and white drawingroom don quixote poe rousseauthey were familiar but not very significant labels to a mind that had found very poor entertainment in reading but they were at least representative enough to set him wondering which of their influences it was that had inflated with such a gaseous heroism the lawford of the night before he thought of sheila with a not unkindly smile and of the rest i wonder what theyll do had been a question almost as much in his mind during these last few hours as had what am i to do in the first bout of his visitation  but the they was not very precisely visualised he saw sheila and harry and dainty paleblue bettie lovat and cautious old wedderburn and danton and craik and cheery gossipy dr sutherland and the verger mr dutton and critchett and the gardener and ada and the whole vague populous host that keep one as definitely in ones place in the worlds economy as a firmset pin the camphored moth what his place was to be only time could show meanwhile there was in this loneliness at least a respite  solitudehe bathed his weary bones in it he laved his eyelids in it as in a woodland brook after the heat of noon he sat on in calmest reverie till his hunger was satisfied then scattering out his last crumbs to the birds from the barred window he climbed upstairs again past his usual bedroom past his detested guest room up into the narrow sweetness of alices and flinging himself on her bed fell into a long and dreamless sleep  by ten next morning lawford had bathed and dressed and at halfpast ten he got up from sheilas fat little french dictionary and his memoirs to answer mrs gulls summons on the area bell the little woman stood with arms folded over an empty and capacious bag with an air of sustained melancholy on her friendly face she wished him a very nervous good morning and dived down into the kitchen the hours dragged slowly by in a silence broken only by an occasional ring at the bell about three she emerged from the house and climbed the area steps with her bag hooked over her arm he watched the little black figure out of sight watched a man in a white canvas hat ascend the steps to push a blueprinted circular through the letterbox it had begun to rain a little he returned to the breakfastroom and with the window wide open to the rustling coolness of the leaves edged his way very slowly across from line to line of the obscure french print  sabathier none the less and in spite of his unintelligible literariness did begin to take shape and consistency the man himself breathing and thinking began to live for lawford even in those few halfarticulate pages though not in quite so formidable a fashion as mr bethany had summed him up but as the west began to lighten with the declining sun the same old disquietude the same old friendless and foreboding ennui stole over lawfords solitude once more he shut his books placed a candlestick and two boxes of matches on the hall table lit a bead of gas and went out into the rainysweet streets again  at a mean little barbers with a pole above his lettered door he went in to be shaved and a few steps further on he sat down at the crumblittered counter of a little bakers shop to have some tea it pleased him almost to childishness to find how easily he could listen and even talk to the oiled and crimpy little barber and to the pretty consumptivelooking printdressed bakers wife whatever his face might now be conniving at the arthur lawford of last week could never have hobnobbed so affably with his social inferiors  for no reason in the world unless to spend a moment or two longer in the friendly bakers shop he bought sixpennyworth of cakes he watched them as they were deposited one by one in the bag and even asked for one sort to be exchanged for another flushing a little at the pretty compliment he had ventured on  he climbed out of the shop and paused on the wooden doorstep do you happen to know mr herbert herberts he said  the bakers wife glanced up at him with clear reflective eyes mr herbertsthat must be some little way off sir i dont know any such name and i know most just round about like  well yes it is said lawford rather foolishly i hardly know why i asked its past the churchyard at widderstone  oh yes sir she encouraged him  a big woodenlooking house  really sir wooden  lawford looked into her face but could find nothing more to say so he smiled again rather absently and ascended into the street  he sat down outside the churchyard gate on the very bank where he had in the sourness of the nettles first opened sabathiers memoirs the world lay still beneath the pale sky presently the little fat rector walked up the hill his wrists still showing beneath his sleeves lawford meditatively watched him pass by a small boy with a switch a tiny nose and a swinging gallipot his cheeks lit with the sunset followed soon after lawford beckoned him with his finger and held out the bag of tarts he watched him half incredulous of his prize and with many a cautious look over his shoulder pass out of sight for a long while he sat alone only the evening birds singing out of the greenness and silence of the churchyard what a haunting inescapable riddle life was  colour suddenly faded out of the light streaming between the branches and depression always lying in ambush of the novelty of his freedom began like mist to rise above his restless thoughts it was all so devilish emptythis raft of the world floating under evenings shadow how many sermons had he listened to enriched with the simile of the ocean of life here they were come home to roost he had fallen asleep ineffectual sailor that he was and a thief out of the cloudy deep had stolen oar and sail and compass leaving him adrift amid the riding of the waves  are they worth do you think quite a penny suddenly inquired a quiet voice in the silence he looked up into the almost colourless face into the grey eyes beneath their clear narrow brows  i was thinking he said what a curious thing life is and wondering  the first half is well worth the pennyits originality i cant afford twopence so you must give me what you were wondering  lawford gazed rather blankly across the twilight fields i was wondering he said with an oddly naive candour how long it took one to sink  they say you know grisel replied solemnly drowned sailors float midway suffering their sea change purgatory but what a splendid pennyworth all pure philosophy  philosophy said lawford i am a perfect fool has your brother told you about me  she glanced at him quickly we had a talk  then you do know he stopped dead and turned to her you really realise it looking at me now  i realise she said gravely that you look even a little more pale and haggard than when i saw you first the other night we both my brother and i you know thought for certain youd come yesterday in fact i went into the widderstone in the evening to look for you knowing your nocturnal habits she glanced again at him with a kind of shy anxiety  whywhy is your brother sowhy does he let me bore him so horribly  does he hes tremendously interested but then hes pretty easily interested when hes interested at all if he can possibly twist anything into the slightest show of a mystery he will but of course you wont you cant take all he says seriously the tiniest pinch of salt you know hes an absolute fanatic at talking in the air besides it doesnt really matter much  in the air  i mean if once a theory gets into his headthe more farfetched so long as its original the betterit flowers out into a positive miracle of incredibilities and of course you can rout out evidence for anything under the sun from his dingy old folios why did he lend you that particular book  didnt he tell you that then  he said it was sabathier she seemed to think intensely for the merest fraction of a moment and turned honestly though i think he immensely exaggerated the likeness as for  he touched her arm and they stopped again face to face tell me what difference exactly you see he said i am quite myself again now honestly please tell me just the very worst you think  i think to begin with she began with exaggerated candour his is rather a detestable face  and mine he said gravely  whyvery troubled oh yesbut his was like some bird of prey yourswhat mad stuff to talk like thisnot the least symptom that i can see ofwhy the prey you know  they had come to the wicket in the dark thorny hedge would it be very dreadful to walk on a littlejust to finish  very she said turning as gravely at his side  what i wanted to say was began lawford and forgetting altogether the thread by which he hoped to lead up to what he really wanted to say broke off lamely i should have thought you would have absolutely despised a coward  it would be rather absurd to despise what one so horribly well understands besides we werent cowardswe werent cowards a bit my childhood was one long reiterated terrornights and nights of it but i never had the pluck to tell any one no one so much as dreamt of the company i had ah and you didnt see either that my heart was absolutely in my mouth that i was shrivelled up with fear even at sight of the fear on your face in the dark theres absolutely nothing so catching so you see i do know a little what nerves are and dream too sometimes though i dont choose charnelhouses if i can get a comfortable bed a coward may i really say that to ask my help was one of the bravest things in a man i ever heard of bulletsthat kind of courageno real woman cares twopence for bullets an old aunt of mine stared a man right out of the house with the thing in her face anyhow whether i may or not i do say it so now we are quits  will you began lawford and stopped what i wanted to say was he jerked on it is sheer horrible hypocrisy to be talking to you like thisthough you will never have the faintest idea of what it has meant and done for me i mean and yet and yet i do feel when just for the least moment i forget what i am and that isnt very often when i forget what i have become and what i must go back toi feel that i havent any business to be talking with you at all quits and here i am an outcast from decent society ah you dont know  she bent her head and laughed under her breath you do really stumble on such delicious compliments and yet do you know i think my brother would be immensely pleased to think you were an outcast from decent society if only he could be thought one too he has been trying half his life to wither decent society with neglect and disdainbut it doesnt take the least notice the deaf adder you know besides besides what is all this meek talk i detest meek talkgods or men surely in the first and last resort all we are is ourselves something has happened you are jangled shaken but to us believe me you are simply one of fewer friendsand i think after struggling up widderstone lane hand in hand with you in the dark i have a right to say friends than i could count on one hand what are we all if we only realized it we talk of dignity and propriety and we are like so many children playing with knucklebones in a giants scullery come along he will some suppertime for us each in turnand how many even will so much as look up from their play to wave us goodbye thats what i meanthe plot of silence we are all in if only i had my brothers lucidity how much better i would have said all this it is only believe me that i want ever so much to help you if i mayeven at risk too she added rather shakily of having that helpwelli know its little good  the lane had narrowed they had climbed the arch of a narrow stone bridge that spanned the smooth dark widder a few late starlings were winging far above them darkness was coming on apace they stood for awhile looking down into the black flowing water with here and there the mild silver of a star dim leagues below i am afraid said grisel looking quietly up you have led me into talking most pitiless nonsense how many hours i wonder did i lie awake in the dark last night thinking of you honestly i shall never never forget that walk it haunted me on and on  thinking of me do you really mean that then it was not all imagination it wasnt just the drowning man clutching at a straw  the grey eyes questioned him you see he explained in a whisper as if afraid of being overheard itit came back again andi dont mind a bit how much you laugh at me i had been asleep and had had a most awful dream one of those dreams that seem to hint that some day that will be our real world that some day we may awake where dreaming then will be of this and i wokecame backand there was a tremendous knocking going on downstairs i knew there was no one else in the house  no one else in the house and you like this  yes said lawford stolidly they were all out as it happened and of course he went on quickly there was nothing for me to do but simply to go down and open the door and yet do you know at first i simply couldnt move i lit a candle and thenthen somehow i got to know that waiting for me was justbut there he broke off halfashamed i mustnt bother you with all this morbid stuff will your brother be in now do you think  my brother will be in and of course expecting you but as for bother believe mewell did i quite deserve it she stooped towards him you lit a candleand then  they turned and retraced their way slowly up the hill  it came again  it  thatthat presence that shadow i dont mean of course its a real shadow it comes doesnt it fromfrom within as if from out of some unheardof hiding place where it has been lurking for ages and ages before ones childhood at least so it seems to me now and yet although it does come from within there it is too in front of you before your eyes feeding even on your fear just watching waiting forwhat nonsense all this must seem to you  yes yes and then  then and you must remember the poor old boy had been knocking all this timemy old friendmr bethany i meanknocking and calling through the letterbox thinking i was in extremis or something thenhow shall i describe itwell you came your eyes your face as clear as when you know the night before last we went up the hill together and then  and then  and then weyou and i you knowsimply drove him downstairs and i could hear myself grunting as if it was really a physical effort we drove him step by step downstairs and he laughed outright and boyishly continued his adventure what do you think i did then without the ghost of a smile too at the idiocy of the thing i locked the poor beggar in the drawingroom i saw him there as plainly as i ever saw anything in my life and the furniture glimmering though it was pitch dark i cant describe it it all seemed so desperately real absolutely vital then it all seems so meaningless and impossible now and yet although i am utterly played out and done for and however absurd it may sound i wouldnt have lost it i wouldnt go back for any bribe there is i feel just as if a great bundle had been rolled off my back of course the queerest the most detestable part of the whole business is that itthe thing on the stairswas thishe lifted a grave and haggard face towards her againor rather that he pointed with his stick towards the starry churchyard sabathier he said  again they had paused together before the white gate and this time lawford pushed it open and followed his companion up the narrow path  she stayed a moment her hand on the bell was it my brother who actually put that horrible idea into your mindabout sabathier  oh no not really put it into my head said lawford hollowly he only found it there lit it up  she laid her hand lightly on his arm whether he did or not she said with an earnestness that was almost an entreaty of course you must agree that we every one of us have some such experiencethat kind of visitor once at least in a lifetime ah but began lawford turning forlornly away you didnt see you cant have realizedthe change  she pulled the bell almost as if in some inward triumph but dont you think she suggested that that like the other might be as it were partly imagination too if now you thought back  but a little old woman had opened the door and the sentence for the moment was left unfinished    chapter seventeen  there was no one in the room and no light when they entered for a moment grisel stood by the open window looking out then she turned impulsively my brother of course will ask you too she said we had made up our minds to do so if you came again but i want you to promise me now that you wont dream of going back tonight that surely would be temptingwell not providence i couldnt rest if i thought you might be alone like that again her voice died away into the calling of the waters a light moved across the dingy old rows of books and as his sister turned to go out herbert appeared in the doorway carrying a greenshaded lamp with an old leather quarto under his arm  ah here you are he said i guessed you had probably met he drew up burdened before his visitor but his clear black glance instead of wandering off at his first greeting had intensified and it was almost with an air of absorption that he turned away he dumped his book on to a chair and it turned over with scattered leaves on to the floor he put the lamp down and stooped after it so that his next words came up muffled and as if the remark had been forced out of him you dont feel worse i hope he got up and faced his visitor for the answer and for the moment lawford stood considering his symptoms  no he said almost gaily i feel enormously better but herberts long oval questioning eyes beneath the sleek black hair were still fixed on his face i am afraid my dear fellow he said with something more than his usual curiously indifferent courtesy the struggle has frightfully pulled you to pieces  the question is answered lawford with a kind of tired yet whimsical melancholy in his voice though i am not sure that the answer very much matterswhats going to put me together again its the old story of humpty dumpty herbert besides one thing you said has stuck out in a quite curious way in my memory i wonder if you will remember  what was that said herbert with unfeigned curiosity  why you said even though sabathier had failed though i was still my own old stodgy self that you thought the facethe face you know might work in somehow sometimes i think it has it does really rather haunt me in that casewell what then lawford had himself listened to this involved explanation much as one watches the accomplishment of a difficult trick marvelling more at its completion at all than at the difficulty involved in the doing of it  work in repeated herbert like a rather blase child confronted with a new mechanical toy did i really say that well honestly it wasnt bad its what one would expect on that hypothesis you see we are only different as it were in our differences once the foots over the threshold its nine points of the law but i dont remember saying it he shamefacedly and naively confessed it i say such an awful lot of things and im always changing my mind its a standing joke against me with my sister she says the recording angel will have two sides to my account mondays wednesdays and fridays and tuesdays thursdays and saturdaysdiametrically opposite convictions and both kinds wrong on sundays i am all things to all men as for sabathier by the way i do want particularly to have another go at him ive been thinking him over and im afraid in some ways he wont quite wash and that reminds me did you read the poor chap  i just grubbed through a page or two but most of my french was left at school what i did do though was to show the book to an old friend of oursmy wifes and minejust to skima mr bethany hes an old clergymanour vicar in fact  herbert had sat down and with eyes slightly narrowed was listening with peculiar attention he smiled a little magnanimously his verdict i should think must have been a perfect joy  he said said lawford in his rather low monotonous voice he said it was precious poor stuff that it reminded him of patchouli and that sabathierthe print i meanlooked like a foxy old roue they were i think his exact words we were alone together last night  you dont mean that he simply didnt see the faintest resemblance  lawford nodded but then he added simply whenever he comes to see me now he leaves his spectacles at home  and at that as if at some preconcerted signal they both went off into a simple shout of laughter unanimous and sustained  but this first wild bout of laughter over the first real bursting of the dam perhaps for years lawford found himself at a lower ebb than ever  you see he said presently and while still his companions face was smiling around the remembrance of his laughter like ripples after the splash of a stone bethany has been absolutely my sheetanchor right through and i wasit wasyou cant possibly realise what a ghastly change it really was i dont think any one ever will  herbert opened his hand and looked reflectively into its palm before allowing himself to reply i wonder you know i have been wondering a good deal simply taking the other point of view for a moment was it i dont mean ghastly exactly like say smallpox gpi elephantiasis but was it quite so complete so radical as in the first sheer gust of astonishment you fancied  lawford thought on a little further you know how one sees oneself in a passionwhy how a child looksthe whole face darkened and drawn and possessed that was the change thats how it seems to come back to me and something somebody dodging behind the eyes yes more that than even any excessive change of feature except of course that i also seemedshall i ever forget that first cold stifling stare into the lookingglass i certainly was much darker even my hair but ive told you all this before he added wearily and the scores and scores of times ive thought it i used to sit up there in the big spare bedroom my wife put me up in simply gloating my flesh seemed nothing more than an hallucination there i was haunting my body an old grinning tenement and all that i thought i wanted and couldnt do without all i valued and prided myself onstacked up in the drizzling street below why herbert our bodies are only glass or cloud they melt dont they like wax in the sun once were out but those first few days dont make very pleasant thinking friday night was the first when i sat there like a twitching waxwork soberly debating between bedlam here and bedlam hereafter i even sometimes wonder whether its very repetition has not dulled the memory or distorted it my wife he added ingenuously seems to think there are signs of a slight improvementa going back i mean but im not sure whether she meant it  herbert surveyed his visitor critically you say dark he said but surely lawford your hair now is nearly grey wellflecked at least  although the remark carried nothing comparatively of a shock with it yet it seemed to lawford as if an electric current had passed over his scalp coldly stirring every hair upon his head but somehow or other it was easier to sit quietly on to express no surprise to let them do or say what they liked well he retorted with an odd crooked smile you must remember i am a good deal older than i was last saturday i grew grey in the grave herbert  but its like this you know said herbert rising excitedly and at the next moment on reflection composedly reseating himself how many of your people actually saw it how many owned to its being as bad as complete as you made out i dont want for a moment to cut right across what you said last nightour talkbut there are two million sides to every question and as often as not the less conspicuous have sounderwellroots thats all  i think really do you know i would rather not go over the detestable thing again not many my wife though and a man i know called danton whowhos prejudiced after all i have myself to think about too and right through right throughthere wasnt the least doubt of thatthey all in their hearts knew it was me they knew i was behind i could feel that absolutely always its not just eyes and ears we use theres us ourselves to consider though god alone knows what that means but the password was there as you might say and they all knew i knew it allexcepthe looked up as if in bewildermentexcept just one a poor old lady a very old friend of my mothers whom ii sabathiered  whomyousabathiered repeated herbert carefully with infinite relish looking sidelong at his visitor and it is just precisely that  but at that moment his sister appeared in the doorway to say that supper was ready and it was not until herbert was actually engaged in carving a cold chicken that he followed up his advantage mr lawford grisel he said has just enriched our jaded language with a new verbto sabathier and if i may venture to define it in the presence of the distinguished neologist himself it means to deal with histrionically or rather thats what it will mean a couple of hundred years hence for the moment it means to act under the influence of subliminalization to perplex or bemuse or estrange with otherness do tell us lawford more about the little old lady he passed with her plate a little meaningful glance at his sister and repeated do  but ive been plaguing your sister enough already youll wish lawford began and turned his tiredout eyes towards those others awaiting them so frankly they seemed in their perfect friendliness a rest from all his troubles you see he went on what i kept on thinking and thinking of was to get a quite unbiased and unprejudiced view she had known me for years though we had not actually met more than once or twice since my mothers death and there she was sitting with me at the other end of just such another little seat ashe turnedto herbert as ours at widderstone it was on bewley common i can see it all now it was sunset and i simply turned and asked her in a kind of a whining affected manner if she remembered me and when after a long time she came round to owning that to all intents and purposes she did noti professed to have made a mistake in recognising her i think he added glancing up from one to the other of his two strange friends i think it was the meanest trick i can remember  hm said herbert solemnly i wish i had as sensitive a conscience but as your old friend didnt recognise you whos the worse as for her not doing so just think of the difference a few years makes to a man and any severe shock life wears so infernally badly who for that matter does not change even in character and yet who professes to see it mind i dont say in essence but then how many of the human ghosts one meets does one know in essence one doesnt want to it would be positively cataclysmic and thats what brings me around to feel lawford if i may venture to say so that you may have brooded a little too keenly onon your own case tell any one you feel ill he will commiserate with you to positive nausea tell any priest your soul is in danger will he wait for proof its misereres and penances world without end tell any woman you love her will she can she should she gainsay you there you are the cats out of the bag you see my sister and i sat up half the night talking the thing over i said id take the plunge i said id risk appearing the crassest contradictoriest wretch that ever drew breath i dont deny that what i hinted at the other night must seem in part directly contrary to what im going to say now  he wheeled his black eyes as if for inspiration and helped himself to salad its this he said isnt it possible isnt it even probable that being ill and overstrung moping a little over things more or less out of the common ruck and sitting there in a kind of tranceisnt it possible that you may have very largely imagined the change hypnotised yourself into believing it much worsemore profound radical acuteand simply absolutely hypnotizing others into thinking so too christendom is just beginning to rediscover that there is such a thing as faith that it is just possible that say megrims or melancholia may be removed at least as easily as mountains the converse of course is obvious on the face of it a man fails because he thinks himself a failure its the men that run away that lose the battle suppose then lawfordhe leaned forward keen and suavesuppose you have been and sabathiered yourself  lawford had grown accustomed during the last few days to finding himself gazing out like a child into reality as if from the windows of a dream he had in a sense followed this long loosely stitched preliminary argument he had at least in part realised that he sat there between two clear friendly minds acting in the friendliest and most obvious collusion but he was incapable of fixing his attention very closely on any single fragment of herberts apology or of rousing himself into being much more than a dispassionate and not very interested spectator of the little melodrama that fate it appeared had at the last moment decided rather capriciously to twist into a farce he turned with a smile to the face so keenly fixed and enthusiastic with the question it had so laboriously led up to but surely i dont quite see  herbert lifted his glass as if to his visitors acumen and set it down again without tasting it why my dear fellow he said triumphantly even a dream must have a peg yours was this unforgettable old suicide candidly now how much of sabathier was actually yours in spite of all that that fantastical fellow herbert said last night dead men dont tell tales the last place in the world to look for a ghost is where his traitorous bones lie crumbling good heavens think what irrefutable masses of evidence there would be at our fingertips if every tombstone hid its ghost no the fellow just arrested you with his creepy epitaph an epitaph mind you that is in a literary sense distinctly fertilizing it catches ones fancy in its own crude way as pages and pages of infinitely more complicated stuff take possession of germinate and sprout in ones imagination in another way we are all psychical parasites why given his epitaph given the surroundings i wager any sensitive consciousness could have guessed at his face and guessing as it were would have feigned it what do you think grisel  i think dear you are talking absolute nonsense what do they call itdarkening counsel its the hair of the dog mr lawford  well then you see said herbert over a hasty mouthful and turning again to his victimthen you see when you were just in the pink of condition to credit any idle tale you heard then i came in what with the least impetus can one not see by moonlight the howl of a dog turns the midnight into a brocken the branch of a tree stoops out at you like a beelzebub crusted with gadflies id mind you sipped of the deadly old huguenot too id listened to your innocent prattle about the child kicking his toes out on deaths cupboard door what more likely thing in the world then than that with that moon in that packed air i should have swallowed the bait whole and seen sabathier in every crevice of your skin i dont say there wasnt any resemblance it was for the moment extraordinary it was even when you were here the other night distinctly arresting but now poor old grisel im nearly done all i want to say is this that if we had the foxy old roue here now and grisel played paris between the three of us shed hand over the apple not to you but to me  i dont quite see where poor paris comes in suggested grisel meekly  no nor do i said herbert all that i mean sagacious child is that mr lawford no more resembles the poor wretch now than i resemble the apollo belvedere if you had only heard my sister scolding me railing at me for putting such ideas into your jangled head they dont affect me one iota i have i suppose what is usually called imagination which merely means that i can sup with the devil spoon for spoon and could sleep in bluebeards linencloset without turning a hair you if i am not very much mistaken are not much troubled with that very unprofitable quality and so i suppose when a crooked and bizarre fancy does edge into your mind it roots there  and that said not without some little confusion and covert glance of inquiry at his sister herbert made all the haste he could to catch up the course that his companions had already finished  if only lawford thought this insufferable weariness would lift awhile he could enjoy the quiet absurd heedless talk and this very friendly topsyturvy effort to ease his mind and soothe his nerves he might even take an interest again in his case  you see he said turning to grisel i dont think it really very much matters how it all came about i never could believe it would last it may perhapssome of it at least may be fancy but then what isnt what is trustworthy and now your brother tells me my hairs turning grey i suppose i have been living too slowly too sluggishly and they thought it was high time to stir me up  he saw with extraordinary vividness the low panelled room the still listening face the white muslin shoulders and dark hair and the eyes that seemed to recall some faroff desolate longing for home and childhood it was all a dream that was the end of the matter even now perhaps his tired old stupid body was lying hunched up drenched with dew upon the little old seat under the mistwreathed branches soon it would bestir itself and wake up and go off homehome to sheila to the old deadly round that once had seemed so natural and inevitable to the old dull lawfordeyes and brain and heart  they returned up the dark shallow staircase to herberts bookroom and he talked on to very quiet and passive listeners in his own fantastic endless fashion and ever and again lawford would find himself intercepting fleeting and anxious glances at his face glances almost of remorse and pity and thought he detected beneath this irresponsible contradictory babble an unceasing effort to clear the sky to lure away too pressing memories to put his doubts and fears completely to rest  herbert even went so far as to plead guilty when grisel gave him the cue of having a little heightened and overcoloured his story of the restless phantasmal old creature that haunted their queer wooden hauntable old house and when they rose laughing and yawning to take up their candles it was after all after a rather animated discussion with many a hairraising ghost story brought in for proof between brother and sister as to exactly how many times that snuffcoloured spectre had made his appearance and with less unanimity still as to the precise manner in which he was in the habit of making his precipitant exit  you do at any rate acknowledge grisel that the old creature does appear and that you saw him yourself step out into space when you were sitting down there under the willow shelling peas ive seen him twice for certain once rather hazily sallie saw him so plainly she asked his business thats five i resign  acknowledge said grisel of course i do id acknowledge anything in the world to save argument why i dont know what i should do without him if only now mr lawford would give him a fair chance to show himself reading quietly here about ten minutes to one or shelling peas even if he prefers it if only hed stay long enough for that wouldnt it be the very thing for them both  of course said herbert cordially the very thing  lawford looked up at neither of them he shook his head  but he needed little persuasion to stay at least one night the prospect of that long solitary walk of that tired stupid stooping figure dragging itself along the interminable country roads seemed a sheer impossibility it is notit isnt i swear itthe other that beeps me back he had solemnly assured the friend that half smiled her relief at his acceptance butif you only knew how empty its all got now all reason gone even to go on at all  but doesnt it follow of course its empty and now life is going to begin again i assure you it is i do indeed only only have couragejust the will to win on  he said goodnight shutto the latched door of his long low room ceilinged with rafters close under the steep roof its brown walls hung with quiet dark pondering and beautiful faces looking gravely across at him and with his candle in his hand he sat down on the bedside all speculation was gone the noisy clock of his brain had run down again he turned towards the old oval lookingglass on the dressingtable without the faintest stirring of interest suspense or anxiety what did it matter what a man looked likea now familiar but enfeebled and deprecating voice seemed to say he knew that a change had come even sheila had noticed it and since then what had he not gone through what now was here seemed of little moment so far at least as this world was concerned  at last with an effort he rose crossed the uneven floor and looked in unmovedly on what was his own poor face come back to him changed indeed almost beyond belief from the sleek selfsatisfied genial yet languid arthur lawford of the past years and still haunted with some faint trace of the set and icy sharpness and challenge and affront of the dark adventurer but thathow immeasurably dimmed and blunted and faded he had expected to find it so would it the thought vanished across his mind would it have been as unmistakably there had he come hotfoot fearing expecting to find the other butwas he disappointed  he hardly knew how long he stood there leaning on his hands surveying almost listlessly in the candlelight that lined bedraggled grey hopeless countenance those darksocketed smouldering eyes whose pupils even now were so dilated that a casual glance would have failed to detect the least hint of any iris it must have been something pretty bad you were you know or something pretty bad you did they seemed to be trying to say to him to drag us down to this  he knelt down by force of habit to say his prayers but no words came well between earthly friends a betrayal such as this would have caused a livelong estrangement and hostility the god the old lawford used to pray to would forgive him he thought wearily if just for the present he was a little too sore at heart to play the hypocrite but if while kneeling he said nothing he saw a good many things in such tranquillity and clearness as the mere eyes of the body can share but rarely with their sisters of the imagination and now it was alice who looked mournfully out of the dark at him and now the little old charwoman mrs gull with her bag hooked over her arm climbed painfully up the area steps and now it was the lean vexed face of a friend nursing some restless and anxious grievance against himmr bethany and then and ever again it was the face of one who seemed pure dream and fantasy and yet he listened intently and fancied even now he could hear the voices of brother and sister talking quietly and circumspectly together in the room beneath    chapter eighteen  a quiet knocking aroused him in the long tranquil bedroom and herberts head was poked into the room theres a bath behind that door over there he whispered or if you like im off for a bathe in the widder its a luscious day shall i wait all right and the head was withdrawn dont put much on came the voice at the panel well be home again in twenty minutes  the green and brightness of the morning must have been prepared for overnight by spiders and the dew everywhere the gleaming nets were hung and everywhere there rose a tiny splendour from the waterdrops so clear and pure and changeable it seemed with their fire and colour they shook a tiny crystal music in the air herbert led the way along a clayey downward path beneath hazels tossing softly together their twigs of nuts until they came out into a rounded hollow that mounded with thyme sloped gently down to the green banks of the widder the water poured like clearest glass beneath a rain of misty sunbeams  my sister always says that this is the very dell boccaccio had in his minds eye when he wrote the decameron there really is something almost classic in those pines and id sometimes swear with my eyes just out of the water ive seen dryads half in hiding peeping between those beeches good lord lawford what a world we wretched moderns have made and missed  the water was violently cold it seemed to lawford as it swept up over his body and as he plunged his nightdistorted eyes beneath its blazing surface that it was charged with some strange powerful enchantment to wash away in its icy clearness even the memory of the dull and tarnished days behind him if one could but tie up anyhow that stained bundle of inconsequent memories called life and fling it into a cupboard remoter even than bluebeards and lock the door and drop the quicklyrusting key into these living waters  he dressed himself with window thrown open to the blackbirds and thrushes and the occasional shrill solitary whistling of a robin but like the soursweet fragrance of the brier its wandering desolate burst of music had power to wake memory and carried him instantly back to that first aimless descent into the evening gloom of widderstone from which it was in vain to hope ever to climb again surely never a more ghoulish face looked out on its man before than that which confronted him as with borrowed razor he stood shaving those sunken chaps that angular chin  and even now beneath the lantern of broad daylight just as within that other face had lurked the undeniable ghost and presence of himself so beneath the sunken features seemed to float tenuous as smoke scarcely less elusive than a dream between eye and object the sinister darkness of the face that in those two bouts with fear he had by some strange miracle managed to repel  work in the chance phrase came back it had worked in in sober earnest and so far as the living of the next few weeks went surely it might prove an ally without which he simply could not conceive himself as struggling on at all  but as dexterous minds as even restless sabathiers had him just now in safe and kindly keeping all the quiet october morning herbert kept him talking and stooping over his extraordinary collection of books  the point is he explained to lawford standing amid a positive archipelago of precious finds with his foot hoisted onto a chair and a patchedup seastained folio on his knee i honestly detest the mere give and take of what we are fools enough to call life i dont deny lifes there he swept his hand towards the open windowin that frantic tophet we call london but theres no focus no point of vantage even a scribbler only gets it piecemeal and through a dulled medium we learn to read before we know how to see we swallow our tastes convictions and emotions whole so that ninetenths of the worlds nectar is merely honeydew he smiled pleasantly into the fixed vacancy of his visitors face thats why ive just gone on he continued amiably collecting this particular kind of stuffwhat you might call riffraff theres not a book here lawford that hasnt at least a glimmer of the real thing in itjust life seen through a living eye and felt as for literature and style and all that gallimaufry dont fear for them if your author has the ghost of a hint of genius in his making  but surely said lawford trying for the twentieth time to pretend to himself that these endless books carried the faintest savour of the delight to him which they must he rather forlornly supposed shower upon herbert surely genius is a very rare thing  rare the world simply swarms with it but before you can bottle it up in a book its got to be articulate just for a single instant imagine yourself falstaff and if there werent hundreds of falstaffs in every generation to be examples of his ungodly life hed be as dead as a doornail tomorrowimagine yourself falstaff and being so sitting down to write henry iv or the merry wives its simply preposterous you wouldnt be such a fool as to waste the time a mere elizabethan scribbler comes along with a gift of expression and an observant eye lifts the bloated old tippler clean out of life and swims down the ages as the greatest genius the world has ever seen whereas surely though you mustnt let me bore you with all this piffle its falstaff is the genius and w s merely a talented reporter  lear macbeth mercutiothey live on their own as it were the newspapers are full of them if we were only the shakespeares to see it have you ever been in a police court have you ever watched tradesmen behind their counters my soul the secrets walking in the streets you jostle them at every corner theres a polonius in every firstclass railway carriage and as many juliets as there are boardingschools what the devil are you my dear chap but genius itself with all the world brand new upon your shoulders and whod have thought it of you ten days ago  its simply and solely because were all poor wretches dumbdumb as butts of malmsez dumb as drummerless drums here am i ass that i am trickling out thisthis whey that no more expresses me than tupper does sappho but thats what i want to mean how inexhaustibly rich everything is if you only stick to life here it is packed away behind these rotting covers just the real thing no respectable stodge no mere parasitic stuff not more than a dozen poets scores of outcasts and vagabondsand the real thing in vagabonds is pretty rare in print i can tell you were all every one of us sodden with facts drugged with the secondhand and barnacled with respectability untiluntil the touch comes goodness knows where from but theres no mistaking it oh no  but what said lawford uneasily what on earth do you mean by the touch  i mean when you cease to be a puppet only and sit up in the gallery too when you squeeze through to the other side when you suffer a kind of conversion of the mind become aware of your senses when you get a living inkling when you become articulate to yourself when you see  i am awfully stupid lawford murmured but even now i dont really follow you a bit but when as you say you do become articulate to yourself what happens then  why then said herbert with a shrug almost of despair then begins the weary tramp back one by one drop off the truisms and the grundyisms and the pedantries and all the stillborn claptrap of the marketplace sloughs off then one can seriously begin to think about saving ones soul  saving ones soul groaned lawford why i am not even sure of my own body yet he walked slowly over to the window and with every thought in his head as quiet as doves on a sunny wall stared out into the garden of green things growing leaves fading and falling water i tell you what he said turning irresolutely i wonder if you could possibly find time to write me out a translation of sabathier my french is much too hazy to let me really get at the chap hes gone now but i really should like to know what kind of stuff exactly he has left behind  oh sabathier said herbert laughing what do you think of that grisel he asked turning to his sister who at that moment had looked in at the door heres mr lawford asking me to make a translation of sabathier lunch lawford  lawford sighed and not until he had slowly descended half the narrow uneven stairs that led down to the diningroom did he fully realise the guile of a sister that could induce a hopeless bookworm to waste a whole morning over the stupidest of companions simply to keep his tiredout mind from rankling and give his sabathier a chance to go to roost  i think do you know he managed to blurt out at last i think i ought to be getting home again the house is emptyand  you shall go this evening said herbert if you really must insist on it but honestly lawford we both think that after what the last few days must have been it is merely common sense to take a rest how can you possibly rest with a dozen empty rooms echoing every thought you think theres nothing more to worry about you agree to that send your people a note saying that you are here safe and sound give them a chance of lighting a fire and driving in the fatted calf stay on with us just the week out  lawford turned from one to the other of the two friendly faces but what was dimly in his mind refused to express itself i think you know i he began falteringly  but its just this thinking thats the deucethis preposterous habit of having continually to make up ones mind off with his head grisel my sisters going to take you for a picnic we go every other fine afternoon and you can argue it out with her  once alone again with grisel however lawford found talking unnecessary silences seemed to fall between them as quietly and restfully as evening flows into night they walked on slowly through the fading woods and when they had reached the top of the hill that sloped down to the dark and foamless widder they sat down in the honeyscented sunshine on a knoll of heather and bracken and grisel lighted the little spiritkettle she had brought with her and busied herself very methodically over making tea  that done she clasped her hands round her knees and sat now gossiping now silent in the pale autumnal beauty there was a bird wistfully twittering in the branches overhead and ever and again a withered leaf would slip circling down from the motionless beech boughs arched in their stillness above their heads beneath the thin blue sky  men you know she began again suddenly starting out of reverie really are absurdly blind and just a little bit absurdly kindly stupid how many times have i been at the point of laughing out at my brothers delicious naive subtleties but you do you will understand mr lawford that he was that we are both doing our bestto make amends   i understandi do indeeda tenth part of all your kindness  yes but thats just itthat horrible word kindness if ever there were two utterly selfabsorbed people without a trace with an absolute horror of kindness it is just my brother and i its most of it false and most of it useless we all surely must take what comes in this topsyturvy world i believe in saying outthat the more one thinks about life the worse it becomes there are only two kinds of happiness in this worlda wooden posts and prometheuss and who ever heard of any one having the impudence to be kind to prometheus as for a miserable medium like me not quite a post and leagues and leagues from even envying a prometheus shes better for the powder without the jam but thats all nothing what i cant help thinkingand its not a bit giving my brother away because we both think itthat it was partly our thoughtlessness that added at least something toto the rest it was perfectly absurd he saw you were ill he sawhe must have seen even in that first sunday talkthat your nerves were all askew and who doesnt know what nerves means nowadays and yet he deliberately chattered he loves itjust at large you know like me i told him before i came out that i intended if i could to say all this and now its said youll please forgive me for going back to it  please dont talk about forgiveness but when you say he chattered you mean about sabathier of course and that you know i dont care a fig for now we can settle all that between ourselveshim and me i mean and now tell me candidly againis there any prey in my face now  she looked up fleetingly into his eyes leant back her head and laughed prey there never was a glimpse  and change their eyes met again in an infinitely brief infinitely bewildering argument  really really scarcely perceptible she assured him except of course how horribly horribly ill you look and that only seems to prove to me you must be hiding something else no illusion on earth couldcould have done that to your face  you think i know he persisted that i must be persuaded and cosseted and humoured yes you do its my poor old sanity thats really in both your minds perhaps i amnot absolutely sound anyhow ive been watching it in your looks at each other all the time and i can never never say never tell you what you have done for me but you see after all we did win through i keep on telling myself that so that now its purely from the most selfish and practical motives that i want you to be perfectly frank with me i have to go back you know and some of them one or two of my friends i mean are not all on my side think of me as i was when you came into the room three centuries ago and you turned and looked frowning at me in the candlelight remember that and look at me now what is the difference does it shock you does it make the whole world seem a trick a sham does it simply sour your life to think such a thing possible oh the hours ive spent gloating on widderstones miserable mask of skin and bone as i was saying to your brother only last night and never knew until they shuffled me that the old self too was nothing better than a stifling suffocating mask  but dont you see she argued softly turning her face away a little you were a stranger then though i certainly didnt mean to frown and then a little while after we were well just human beings shoulder to shoulder and if friendship does not mean that i dont know what it does mean and now you arewell just you the you you know of three centuries ago and if you mean to ask me whether at any precise moment i have been conscious that this you i am now speaking to was not the you of last night or of that dark climb up the hill why it is simply frantic to think it could ever be necessary to say over and over again no but if you mean have you changed else all i could answer is dont we all change as we grow to know one another what were just features what just dingily represented one as it were is forgotten or rather gets remembered of course the first glimpse is the landscape under lightning as it were but afterwards isnt it surely like the alphabet to a child what was first a queer angular scrawl becomes a and is always ever after a undistinguished halfforgotten yet standing at last for goodness knows what real wonderful thingsor for just the dry bones of soulless words is that it she stole a sidelong glance into his brooding face leaning her head on her hand  yes yes came the rather dissatisfied reply i do agree perfectly but then you seei told you i was going to talk of nothing but myselfwhat did at first happen to me was something much worse and i suppose something quite different from that  and yet didnt you tell us that of all your friends not one really denied in their hearts yourwhat they would call i supposeyour identity except that poor little offended old lady and even she if my intuition is worth a penny piece even she when you go soon and talk to her will own that she did know you and that it was not because you were a stranger that she was offended but because you so ungenerously pretended to be one that was a little mad now if you like  oh yes said lawford i am going to ask her forgiveness i dont know what i didnt vow to take her for a peaceoffering if the chance should ever comeand the courageto make my peace with her but now that the chance has come and i think the courage it is the desire thats gone i dont seem to care either way i feel as if i had got past making my peace with any one  but this time no answer helped him out  after all he went plodding on there is more than just the mere day to day to consider and one doesnt realise that ones face actually is ones fortune without a shock and that that gone one is as your brother said just like a bee come back to the wrong hive it undermines he smiled rather bitterly ones views rather and it certainly shifts ones friends if it hadnt been just for my oldhe stopped dead and again pushed slowly onif it hadnt been for our old friend mr bethany i doubt if we should now have had a soul on our side i once read somewhere that wolves always chase the old and weak and maimed out of the pack and after all what do we do where do we keep the homeless and the insane and yet you know he added ruminatingly it is not as if mine was ever a particularly lovely or lovable face while as for the poor wretch behind it well i really cannot see what meaning or life even he had before  before  lawford met bravely the clear whimsical eyes before i was sabathiered  grisel laughed outright  you think he retorted almost bitterly you think i am talking like a child  yes she sighed cheerfully i was quite envying you  well there i am said lawford inconsequently and now well now i suppose the whole things to begin again i cant help beginning to wonder what the meaning of it all is why ones duty should always seem so very stupid a thing and then too what can there be on earth that even a buried sabathier could desire he glanced up in a really animated perplexity at the still dark face turned in the evening light towards the darkening valley and perplexity deepened into a disquieted frownlike that of a child who is roused suddenly from a daydream by the halfforgotten question of a stranger he turned his eyes almost furtively away as if afraid of disturbing her and for awhile they sat in silence at last he turned again almost shyly i hope some day you will let me bring my daughter to see you  yes yes said grisel eagerly we should both love it of course isnt it curiousi simply knew you had a daughter sheer intuition  i say some day said lawford i know though that that some day will never come  wait just wait replied the quiet confident voice that will come too one thing at a time mr lawford youve won your old self back again youll win your old love of life back again in a little while never fear oh dont i know that awful lands end after illness and that longing too that gnawing longing too for ultima thule so its a bargain between us that you bring your daughter soon she busied herself over the tea things and of course she added as if it were an afterthought looking across at him in the pale green sunlight as she knelt you simply wont think of going back tonight solitude i really do think solitude just now would be absolute madness youll write today and go perhaps tomorrow  lawford looked across in his mind at his square ungainly house fullfronting the afternoon sun he tried to repress a shudder i think do you know i ought to go today  well why not why not just to reassure yourself that alls well and come back here to sleep if youd really promise that id drive you in id love it theres the jolliest little governesscart we sometimes hire for our picnics way i youve no idea how much easier in our minds my brother and i would be if you would and then tomorrow or at any rate the next day you shall be surrendered whole and in your right mind there thats a bargain too now we must hurry    chapter nineteen  herbert himself went down to order the governess cart and packed them in with a rug and in the dusk grisel set lawford down at the corner of his road and drove on to an old booksellers with a commission from her brother promising to return for him in an hour dust and a few straws lay at rest as if in some abstruse arrangement on the stones of the porch just as the last faint whirling gust of sunset had left them shut lids of sightless indifference seemed to greet the wanderer from the curtained windows  he opened the door and went in for a moment he stood in the vacant hall then he peeped first into the blinddrawn diningroom faintly dingily sweet like an empty winebottle he went softly on a few paces and just opening the door looked in on the faintly glittering twilight of the drawingroom but the congealed stump of candle that he had set in the corner as a final rancorous challenge to the beaten shade was gone he slowly and deliberately ascended the stairs conscious of a peculiar sense of ownership of what in even so brief an absence had taken on so queer a look of strangeness it was almost as if he might be some lone heir come in the rather mournful dusk to view what melancholy fate had unexpectedly bestowed on him  work inwhat on earth else could this chill sense of strangeness mean would he ever free his memory from that one haphazard haunting hint and as he stood in the doorway of the big calm room which seemed even now to be stirring with the restless shadow of these last few faraway days now pacing sullenly to and fro now sitting hunchedup to think and now lying impotent in a vain hopeless endeavour only for the breath of a moment to forgethe awoke out of reverie to find himself smiling at the thought that a changed face was practically at the mercy of an incredulous world whereas a changed heart was no ones deadly dull affair but its owners the merest breath of pity even stole over him for the sabathier who after all had dared and had needed perhaps nothing like so arrogant and merciless a coup de grace to realise that he had so ignominiously failed  but there thats done he exclaimed out loud not without a tinge of regret that theories however brilliant and bizarre could never now be anything elsethat now indeed that the symptoms had gone the malady for all who had not been actually admitted into the shocked circle was become nothing more than an inanely tall story stuffing not even savoury enough for a goose how wide exactly he wondered would sheilas discreet shocked circle prove he stood once more before the lookingglass hearing again grisels words in the still green shadow of the beechtree except of course horribly horribly ill what a fool what a coward she thinks i am  there was still nearly an hour to be spent in this great barn of faded interests he lit a candle and descended into the kitchen a mouse went scampering to its hole as he pushed open the door the memory of that ravenous morning meal nauseated him it was sour and very still here he stood erect the air smelt faint of earth in the breakfastroom the bookcase still swung open late evening mantled the garden and in sheer ennui again he sat down to the table and turned for a last not unfriendly hobanob with his poor old friend sabathier he would take the thing back herbert of course was going to translate it for him now if the patient old frenchman had stormed herbert insteadthat surely would have been something like a coup those frenzied books the absurd talk of the man herbert was perfectly righthe could have entertained fifty old huguenots without turning a hair im such an awful stodge  he turned the woolly leaves over very slowly he frowned impatiently and from the end backwards turned them over again then he laid the book softly down on the table and sat back he stared with narrowed lids into the flame of his quiet friendly candle every trace every shred of portrait and memoir were gone once more deliberately punctiliously he examined page by page the blurred and unfamiliar frenchthe sooty heads the long lean noses the baggy eyes passing like figures in a peepshow one by one under his handto the last fragmentary and dexterously mended leaf yes sabathier was gone quite the old slow lawford smile crept over his face at the discovery it was a smile a little sheepish too as he thought of sheilas quiet vigilance  and the next instant he had looked up sharply with a sudden peculiar shrug and a kind of cry like the first thin cry of an awakened child in his mind without a moments hesitation he climbed swiftly upstairs again to the big sepulchral bedroom he pressed with his fingernail the tiny spring in the lookingglass the empty drawer flew open there were fingermarks still in the dust  yet strangely enough beneath all the clashing thoughts that came flocking into his mind as he stood with the empty drawer in his hand was a wounding yet still a little amused pity for his old friend mr bethany so far as he himself was concerned the discoverywell he would have plenty of time to consider everything that could possibly now concern himself anyhow it could only simplify matters  he remembered waking to that old wave of sickening horror on the first unhappy morning he remembered the keen yet owlish old face blinking its deathless friendliness at him and the steady pressure of the cold skinny hand as for sheila she had never done anything by halves certainly not when it came to throwing over a friend no longer necessary to ones social satisfaction but she would edge out cleverly magnanimously triumphantly enough no doubt when the day of reckoning should come the day when her nets wide spread her bait prepared he must stand up before her outraged circle and positively prove himself her lawful husband perhaps even to the very imprint of his thumb  poor old thing he said again and this time his pity was shared almost equally between both witnesses to mr bethanys ingenuous little document the loss of which had fallen so softly and pathetically that he felt only ashamed of having discovered it so soon  he shut back the telltale drawer and after trying to collect his thoughts in case anything should have been forgotten he turned with a deep trembling sigh to descend the stairs but on the landing he drew back at the sound of voices and then a footstep soon came the sound of a key in the lock he blew out his candle and leant listening over the balusters  whos there he called quietly  me sir came the feeble reply out of the darkness  what is it ada what have you come for  only sir to see that all was safe and you were in sir  yes he said alls safe and i am in what if i had been out it was like dropping tiny pebbles into a deep wellso long after came the answering feeble splash  then i was to go back sir and a moment after the discreet voice floated up with the faintest tinge of effrontery out of the hush is that dr ferguson too sir  no ada and please tell your mistress from me that dr ferguson is unlikely to call again a keen but rather forlorn smile passed over his face hes dining with friends no doubt at holloway but of course if she should want to see him he will see her tomorrow at any hour at mrs lovats andada  yes sir  say that im a little better your mistress will be relieved to hear that im a little better still not quite myself say but i think a little better  yes sir and im sure im very glad to hear it came fainter still  what voice was that i heard just now  miss alices sir but she came quite against my wishes and i hope you wont repeat it sir she promised if she came that mistress shouldnt know i was only afraid she might disturb you oror dr ferguson and did you say sir that i was to tell mistress that he might be coming back  ah that i dont know so perhaps it would be as well not to mention him at all is miss alice there  i said i would tell her if you were alone but i hope youll understand that it was only because she begged so mistress has gone to st peters bazaar and thats how it was  i quite understand beckon to her  there came a hasty step in the hall and a hurried murmur of explanation lawford heard her call as she ran up the stairs and the next moment he had alices hand in his and they were groping together through the gloaming back into the solitude of the empty room again  dont be alarmed dear he heard himself imploring just hold tight to that clear common sense and above all you wont tell it must be our secret a dead dead secret from every one even your mother for just a little while just a mere two days or soin case imim better dear  he fumbled with the little box of matches dropped one broke another but at last the candleflame dipped brightened and with the door shut and the last pale blueness of dusk at the window lawford turned and looked at his daughter she stood with eyes wide open like the eyes of a child walking in its sleep then twisted her fingers more tightly within his oh dearest how ill how ill you look she whispered but there never mindnever mind it was all a miserable dream then it wont it cant come back i dont think i could bear its coming back and mother told me such curious things as if i were a child and understood nothing and even after i knew that you were youi mean before i sat up here in the dark to see youshe said that you were gone and would never come back that a terrible thing had happeneda disgrace which we must never speak of and that all the other was only a pretence to keep people from talking but i did not believe then and how could i believe afterwards  there never mind now dear what she said it was all meant for the best perhaps but here i am and not nearly so ill as i look alice and theres nothing more to trouble ourselves about not even if it should be necessary for me to go away for a time and this is our secret mind ours only just a dead secret between you and me  they sat for awhile without speaking or stirring and faintly along the hushed road lawford heard in the silence a leisurely indolent beat of little hoofs approaching and the sound of wheels a sudden wave of feeling swept over him he took alices quiet loving face in his hands and kissed her passionately do not so much as think of me yet or doubt or question only love me dearest and soonand soon  well just begin again just begin again wont we all three of us together just as we used to be i didnt mean to have said all those horrid things about mother she was only dreadfully anxious and meant everything for the best youll let me tell her soon  the haggard face turned slowly listening i hear i understand but i cant think very clearly now alice i cant dear my miserable old tangled nerves i just stumble along as best i can youll understand better when you get to be a poor old thing like me we must do the best we can and of course youll see dillie how awfully important it is not to raise false hopes you understand i mustnt risk the least thing in the world must i and now goodbye only for a few hours now and not a word not a word to a single living soul  he extinguished the candle again and led the way to the top of the stairs are you there ada  yes sir answered the quiet imperturbable voice from under the black straw brim alice went slowly down but at the foot of the stairs looking out into the cold blue lamplit street she paused as if at a sudden recollection and ran hastily up again  there was nothing more dear she said leaning back to peer up  nothing more what  she stood panting a little in the darkness listening to some cautious yet uneasy thought that seemed to haunt her mind i thoughtit seemed there was something we had not said something i could not understand but there it is nothing you know what a fanciful old silly i am you do love me quite as much as ever  more sweetheart more  goodnight again then and god bless you dear  the outer door closed softly the footsteps died away lawford still hesitated he took hold of the stairs above his head as he stood on the landing and leaned his head upon his hands striving calmly to disentangle the perplexity of his thoughts his pulses were beating in his ear with a low muffled roar he looked down between the blinds to where against the blue of the road beneath the straggling yellow beams of the lamp stood the little cart and drooping shaggy pony and grisel sitting quietly there awaiting him he shut his eyes as if in hope by some convulsive effort of mind to break through this subtle glasslike atmosphere of dream that had stolen over consciousness and blotted out the significance almost the meaning of the past he turned abruptly empty as the empty rooms around him unanswering were mind and heart life was a tale told by an idiotsignifying nothing  he paused at the head of the staircase and even then the doubt confronted him would he ever come back who knows he thought and again stood pondering arguing denying at last he seemed to have come to a decision he made his way downstairs opened and left ajar a long narrow window in a passage to the garden beyond the kitchen he turned on his heel as he reached the gate and waved his hand as if in a kind of forlorn mockery towards the darkly glittering windows the drowsy pony awoke at touch of the whip  grisel lifted the rug and squeezed a little closer into the corner she had drawn a veil over her face so that to lawford her eyes seemed to be dreaming in a little darkness of their own as he laid his hand on the side of the cart its a most curious thing he said but peeping down at you just now when the sound of the wheels came a memory came clearly back to me of years and years agoof my mother she used to come to fetch me at school in a little cart like this and a little pony just like this with a thick dusty coat and once i remember i was simply sick of everything a failure and fagged out and all that and was looking out in the twilight i fancy even it was autumn too it was a little side staircase window i was horribly homesick and she came quite unexpectedly i shall never forget itthe misery and then her coming he lifted his eyes cowed with the incessant struggle and watched her face for some time in silence ought i to stay  i see no ought she said no one is there  only a miserable broken voice out of a broken cagecalled conscience  dont you think perhaps that even that has a good many disguisesconvention cowardice weakness ennui they all take their turn at hooting in its feathers you must you really must have rest you dont know you dont see i do just a little snap some one last exquisite thread gives way and then it is all over you see i have even to try to frighten you for i cant tell you how you distress me  why do i distress youmy face my story you mean  no i mean you your trouble that horrible empty house andoh dear me yes your courage too  listen said lawford stooping forward he could scarcely see the pale veiled face through this mist that had risen up over his eyes i have no courage apart from you no courage and no hope ask me to comea stranger with no history no mockery no miserable rant of a grave and darkness and fear behind me are we not all hauntedevery one that forgotten and the fool i was and the vacillating and the pretenceoh how it all sweeps clear before me without a will without a hope or glimpse or whisper of courage be just the memory of my mother the face the friend ive never seen the voice that every dream leaves echoing ask me to come  she sat unstirring and then as if by some uncontrollable impulse stooped a little closer to him and laid her gloved hand on his  i hear you know i hear too she whispered but we mustnt listen come now its growing late  the little village echoed back from its stone walls the clatter of the ponys hoofs night had darkened to its deepest when their lamp shone white on the wicket in the hedge they had scarcely spoken lawford had simply watched pass by almost without a thought the arching trees the darkening fields had watched rise up in a mist of primrose light the harvest moon to shine in saffron on the faces and shoulders of the few wayfarers they met or who passed them by the still grave face beneath the shadow of its veil had never turned though the moon poured all her flood of brilliance upon the dark profile and once when as if in sudden alarm he had lifted his head and looked at her a sudden doubt had assailed him so instantly that he had half put out his hand to touch her and had as quickly withdrawn it lest her beauty and stillness should be even as the moments fancy had suggested only a fargone memory returned in dream  herbert hailed them from the darkness of an open window he came down and they talked a little in the cold air of the garden he lit a cigarette and climbed languidly into the cart and drove the drowsy little pony off into the moonlight    chapter twenty  it was a quiet supper the three friends sat down to herbert sat narrowing his eyes over his thoughts which when the fancy took him he scattered out upon the others silence lawford apparently had not yet shaken himself free from the sorcery of the moonlight his eyes shone dark and full like those of a child who has trespassed beyond its hour for bed and sits marvelling at reality in a waking dream  long after they had bidden each other goodnight long after herbert had trodden on tiptoe with his candle past his closed door lawford sat leaning on his arms at the open window staring out across the motionless moonlit trees that seemed to stand like draped and dreaming pilgrims come to the peace of their nirvana at last beside the crashing music of the waters and he himself the self that never sleeps beneath the tides and waves of consciousness was listening too almost as unmovedly and unheedingly to the thoughts that clashed in conflict through his brain  why in a strange transitory life was one the slave of these small cares what if even in that dark pit beneath which seemed to whisper lethe to the tumultuous swirling waterswhat if there too were merely a beginning again and to seek a slumbering refuge there merely a blind and reiterated plunge into the heat and tumult of another day who was that poor dark homeless ghoul sabathier who was this helen of an impossible dream her face with its strange smile her eyes with their still pity and rapt courage had taken hope away heres not your rest cried one insistent voice she is the mystery that haunts day and night past all the changing of the restless hours chance has given you back eyes to see a heart that can be broken chance and the stirrings of a longgone life have torn down the veil age spins so thick and fast pride and ambition what dull fools men are effort and duty what dull fools men are he listened on and on to these phantom pleadings and to the rather coarse old lawford conscience grunting them mercilessly down too weary even to try to rest  rooks at dawn came sweeping beneath the turquoise of the sky he saw their sharpbeaked heads turn this way that way as they floated on outspread wings across the misty world except for the hoarse roar of the water under the huge thinleafed trees not a sound was stirring one thing he seemed to hear himself mutter as he turned with a shiver from the morning air it wont be for long you can at least poor devil wait the last act out if in this foolish hustling mob of the world hired anywhere and anywhen for the one poor dubious wage of a pennyif it was only his own small dull part to carry a mock spear and shout huzza with the restthere was nothing for it he grunted obstinately to himself shout he would with the loudest  he threw himself on to the bed with eyes so wearied with want of sleep it seemed they had lost their livelong skill in finding it not the echo of triumph nor even a sigh of relief stirred the torpor of his mind he knew vaguely that what had been the misery and madness of the last few days was gone but the thought had no power to move him now sheilas good sense and mr bethanys stubborn loyalty were alike old stories that had lost their savour and meaning gone too was the need for that portentous family gathering that had sat so often in his fancy during these last few days around his diningroom table discussing with futile decorum the problem of how to hush him up to muffle him down half dreaming half awake he saw the familiar door slowly open and like the timely hero in a melodrama his own figure appear before the stricken and astonished company his eyes opened halffearfully and glanced up in the morning twilight their perplexity gave place to a quiet almost vacant smile the lids slowly closed again and at last the lean hands twitched awhile in sleep  next morning he spent rummaging among the old books dipping listlessly here and there as the tasteless fancy took him while herbert sat writing with serene face and lifted eyebrows at his open window but the unfamiliar long ss the close type and the spelling of the musty old books wearied eye and mind what he read too however farfetched or lively or sententious or gross seemed either to be of the same texture as what had become his everyday experience and so baffled him with its nearness or else was only the meaningless ramblings of an idle pen and this he thought to himself looking covertly up at the spruce clearcut profile at the window this is what herbert had called life  am i interrupting you herbert are you very busy he asked at last taking refuge on a chair in a far corner of the room  bless me no not a bitnot a bit said herbert amiably laying down his pen im afraid the old leatherjackets have been boring you its a habit this beastly reading this gorge and glint and fever all at secondhandpurely a bad habit like morphia like laudanum but once in you know theres no recovery anyhow im neckdeep and to struggle would be simply to drown  i was only going to say how sorry i am for having left sabathier at home  my dear fellow began herbert reassuringly  it was only because i wanted so very much to have your translation i get muddled up with other things groping through the dictionary  herbert surveyed him critically what exactly is your interest now lawford you dont mean that my old theory has left any sting now  no sting oh no i was only curious but you yourself still think it really dont you  herbert turned for a moment to the open window  i was simply trying then to find something to fit the facts as you experienced them but now that the facts have goneand they have havent theyexit of course my theory  i see was the cryptic answer and yet herbert lawford solemnly began again it has changed me even in my way of thinking when i shut my eyes nowi only discovered it by chancei see immediately faces quite strange to me or places sometimes thronged with people and once an old well with some one sitting in the shadow i cant tell you how clearly and yet it is all altogether different from a dream even when i sit with my eyes open i am conscious as it were of a kind of faint colourless mirage in the old daysi mean before widderstone what i saw was only what id seen already nothing came uncalled for unexplained this makes the old life seem so blank i did not know what extraordinarily real things i was doing without and whether for that reason or another i cant quite make out what in fact i did want then and was always fretting and striving for i can see no wisdom or purpose in anything now but to get to ones journeys end as quickly and bravely as one can and even then even if we do call life a journey and death the inn we shall reach at last in the evening when its over that too i feel will be only as brief a stoppingplace as any other inn would be our experience here is so scanty and shallownothing more than the moment of the continual present surely that must go on even if one does call it eternity and so we shall all have to begin again probably sabathier himself but there what on earth are we herbert when all is said who is it hashas done all this for uswhat kind of self and to what possible end is it that the clockwork has been wound up and must still jolt on a while with jarring wheels will it never run down do you think  herbert smiled faintly but made no answer  you see continued lawford in the same quiet dispassionate undertone i wouldnt mind if it was only myself but there are so many of us so many selves i mean and they all seem to have a voice in the matter what is the reality to this infernal dream  the reality is lawford that you are fretting your life out over this rotten illusion be guided by me just this once well go all three of us a good tenmile walk today and thoroughly tire you out and tonight you shall sleep herea really sound refreshing sleep then tomorrow whole and hale back you shall go honestly its only professional strong men should ask questions babes like you and me must keep to slops  so though lawford made no answer it was agreed before noon the three of them had set out on their walk across the fields and after rambling on just as caprice took them past reddening blackberry bushes and copses of hazel and flaming beech they sat down to spread out their meal on the slope of a hill overlooking quiet ploughed fields and grazing cattle herbert stretched himself with his back to the earth and his placid face to the pale vacant sky while lawford even more dispirited after his walk wandered up to the crest of the hill  at the foot of the hill upon the other side lay a farm and its outbuildings and a pool of water beneath a group of elms it was vacant in the sunlight and the water vividly green with a scum of weed and about half a mile beyond stood a cluster of cottages and an old towered church he gazed idly down listening vaguely to the wailing of a curlew flitting anxiously to and fro above the broken solitude of its green hill and it seemed as if a thin and dark cloud began to be quietly withdrawn from over his eyes hill and wailing cry and barn and water faded out and he was staring as if in an endless stillness at an open window against which the sun was beating in a bristling torrent of gold while out of the garden beyond came the voice of some evening bird singing with such an unspeakable ecstasy of grief it seemed it must be perched upon the confines of another world the light gathered to a radiance almost intolerable driving back with its raining beams some memory forlorn remorseless remote his body stood dark and senseless rocking in the air on the hillside as if bereft of its spirit then his hands were drawn over his eyes he turned unsteadily and made his way as if through a thick drizzling haze slowly back  what is thatthere he said almost menacingly standing with bloodshot eyes looking down upon herbert  thatwhat said herbert glancing up startled from his book why whats wrong lawford  that said lawford sullenly yet with a faintly mournful cadence in his voice those fields and that old empty farmthat village over there why did you bring me here  grisel had not stirred the village  ssh she said catching her brothers sleeve thats detcham yes detcham  lawford turned wide vacant eyes on her he shook his head and shuddered no no not detcham i know it i know it but it has gone out of my mind not detcham ive been there before dont look at me horrible horrible it takes me backi cant think i stood there trying trying its all in a blur dont ask mea dream  grisel leaned forward and touched his hand dont think dont even try why should you we cant we mustnt go back  lawford still gazing fixedly turned again a darkened face towards the steep of the hill i think you know he said stooping and whispering he would knowthe window and the sun and the singing and oh of course it was too late you understandtoo late and once you cant go back oh no you wont leave me you see if you go it would only be all i could not be quite so alone but detchamdetcham perhaps you will not trust metell me that was not the name he shuddered violently and turned doglike beseeching eyes tomorrowyes tomorrow he said i will promise anything if you will not leave me now once but again the thread running so faintly through that inextricable maze of memory eluded him so long as you wont leave me now he implored her  she was vainly trying to win back her composure and could not answer him at once  in the evening after supper grisel sat her guest down in front of a big wood fire in the old bookroom where staring into the playing flames he could fall at peace into the almost motionless reverie which he seemed merely to harass and weary himself by trying to disperse she opened the little piano at the far end of the room and played on and on as fancy ledchopin and beethoven a fugue from bach and lovely forlorn old english airs till the music seemed not only a voice persuading pondering and lamenting but gathered about itself the hollow surge of the water and the darkness wistful and clear as the thoughts of a solitary child ever and again a log burnt through its strength and falling amid sparks stirred like a restless animal the stillness or herbert in his corner lifted his head to glance towards his visitor and to turn another page at last the music too fell silent and lawford stood up with his candle in his hand and eyed with a strange fixity brother and sister his glance wandered slowly round the quiet flamelit room  you wont he said stooping towards them as if in extreme confidence you wont much notice they come and go i try not toto speak its the only way through it is not that i dont know theyre only dreams but if once thethe others thought there had been any tamperinghe tapped his forehead meaninglyhere if once they thought that it would you know be quite over then how could i prove he turned cautiously towards the door and with laborious significance nodded his head at them  herbert bent down and held out his long hands to the fire tampering my dear chap thats what the lump said to the leaven  yes yes said lawford putting out his hand but you know what i mean herbert anything i tried to do then would be quite quite hopeless that would be poisoning the wells  they watched him out of the room and listened till quite distinctly in the still nightshaded house they heard his door gently close then as if by consent they turned and looked long and questioningly into each others faces  then you are not afraid herbert said quietly  grisel gazed steadily on and almost imperceptibly shook her head  you mean he questioned her but still he had again to read her answer in her eyes  oh very well grisel he said quietly you know best and returned once more to his writing  for an hour or two lawford slept heavily so heavily that when a little after midnight he awoke with his face towards the uncurtained window though for many minutes he lay brightly confronting all orion that from blazing helm to flaming dog at heel filled high the glimmering square he could not lift or stir his cold and leaden limbs he rose at last and threw off the burden of his bedclothes and rested awhile as if freed from the heaviness of an unrememberable nightmare but so clear was his mind and so extraordinarily refreshed he seemed in body that sleep for many hours would not return again and he spent almost all the remainder of the lagging darkness pacing softly to and fro one face only before his eyes the one sure thing the one thing unattainable in a world of phantoms  herbert waited on in vain for his guest next morning and after wandering up and down the mossy lawn at the back of the house went off cheerfully at last alone for his dip when he returned lawford was in his place at the breakfasttable he sat on moody and constrained until even herberts haphazard talk trickled low  i fancy my sister is nursing a headache he said at last but shell be down soon and im afraid from the looks of you lawford your night was not particularly restful he felt his way very heedfully perhaps we walked you a little too far yesterday we are so used to tramping that lawford kept thoughtful eyes fixed on the deprecating face  i see what it is herbertyou are humouring me again i have been wracking my brains in vain to remember what exactly did happen yesterday i feel as if it was all sunk oceans deep in sleep i get so farand then im done it wont give up a hint but you really mustnt think im an invalid oror in my second childhood the truth is he added its only my first come back again but now that ive got so far now that im really better i he broke off rather vacantly as if afraid of his own confidence i must be getting on he summed up with an effort and thats the solemn fact i keep on forgetting imim a ratepayer  herbert sat round in his chair you see lawford the very term is little else than doubledutch to me as a matter of fact grisel sends all my hushmoney to the horrible people that do the cleaning up as it were i cant catch their drift government to me is merely the spectacle of the clever or the specious managing the dull it deals merely with the physical and just the fringe of consciousness i am not joking i think i follow you all i mean is that the obligationsmainly tepid i take itthat are luring you back to the fold would be the very ones that would scare me quickest off the imagination the appeal faded were dead  lawford opened his mouth temporarily tepid he at last all but coughed out  oh yes of course said herbert intelligently only temporarily its this beastly gregariousness thats the devil the very thought of it undoes mewith an absolute shock of sheepishness i suddenly realise my human nakedness that here we are little better than naked animals bleating behind our illusory wattles on the slopes ofof infinity and nakedness after all is a wholesome thing to realize only when one thinks too much of ones clothes i peer sometimes feebly enough out of my wool and it seems to me that all these busybodies all these factdevourers all this newsreading rabble are nothing brighter than very dullwitted children trying to play an imaginative game much too deep for their poor reasons i dont mean that your wanting to go home is anything gregarious but i do think their insisting on your coming back at once might be and i know you wont visit this stuff on me as anything more than just my scum as grisel calls the fine flower of my maiden meditations all that i really want to say is that we should both be more than delighted if youd stay just as long as it will not be a bore for you to stay stay till youre heartily tired of us go back now if you must tell them how much better you are bolt off to a nerve specialist hell say complete restchange of scene and all that they all do instinct via intellect and why not take your rest here we are such miserably dull company to one another it would be a greater pleasure to have you with us than i can say i mean it from the very bottom of my heart do  lawford listened i wish he began and stopped dead again anyhow ill go back i am afraid herbert ive been playing truant it was all very well whileto tell you the truth i cant think quite straight yet but it wont last for ever besideswell anyhow ill go back  right you are said herbert pretending to be cheerful you cant expect you really cant everything to come right straight away just have patience and now lets go out and sit in the sun theyve mixed september up with may  and about half an hour afterwards he glanced up from his book to find his visitor fast asleep in his garden chair  grisel had taken her brothers place with a little pile of needlework beside her on the grass when lawford again opened his eyes under the rosy shade of a parasol he watched her for a while without speaking  how long have i been asleep he said at last  she started and looked up from her needle  that depends on how long you have been awake she said smiling my brother tells me she went on beginning to stitch that you have made up your mind to leave us today perhaps we are only flattering ourselves it has been a rest but if it hasis that do you think quite wise  he leant forward and hid his face in his hands its becauseits because its the only must i can see  but even mustswell we have to be sure even of musts havent we are you she glanced up and for an instant their eyes met and the falling water seemed to be sounding out of a distance so remote it might be but the echo of a dream she stooped once more over her work  supposing he said very slowly and almost as if speaking to himself supposing sabathierand you know hes merely like a friend now one mustnt be seen talking tosupposing he came back what then  oh but sabathiers gone he never really came it was only a fancya mood it was only youanother you  who was that yesterday then  she glanced at him swiftly and knew the question was but a venture  yesterday  oh very well he said fretfully you too but if he did if he did come really back prey and all  what is the riddle she said taking a deep breath and facing him brightly  would my must still be his the face he raised to her as he leaned forward under the direct light of the sun was so colourless cadaverous and haggard the thought crossed her mind that it did indeed seem little more than a shadowy mask that but one hour of darkness might dispel  you said you know we did win through why then should we be even thinking of defeat now  we  oh no you she cried triumphantly  you do not answer my question  nor you mine it was a glorious victory is there the ghost of a reason why you should cast your mind back is there now  only said lawford looking patiently up into her face only because i love you and listened in the silence to the words as one may watch a bird that has escaped for ever and irrevocably out of its cage steadily flying on and on till lost to sight  for an instant the grey eyes faltered but that surely she began in a low voice still steadily sewing that was our compact last nightthat you should let me help that you should trust me just as you trusted the mother years ago who came in the little cart with the shaggy dusty pony to the homesick boy watching at the window perhaps she added her fingers trembling in this odd shuffle of souls and faces i am that mother and most frightfully anxious you should not give in why even because of the tiredness even because the cause seems vain you must still fight onwouldnt she have said it surely there are prizes a daughter a career no end and even they gonestill the self undimmed undaunted that took its drubbing like a man  i know you know im all but crazed you see this wretched mind all littered and broken down look at me like that then forget even you have befriended me and pretendedwhy must i blunder on and on like this oh grisel my friend my friend if only you loved me  tears clouded her eyes she turned vaguely as if for a hidingplace we cant talk here how mad the day is listen listen i doi do love youmother and woman and friendfrom the very moment you came its all so clear so clear that and your miserable must my friend come we will go away by ourselves a little and talk that way ill meet you by the gate    chapter twentyone  she came out into the sunlight and they went through the little gate together she walked quickly without speaking over the bridge past a little cottage whose hollyhocks leaned fading above its low flint wall skirting a field of stubble she struck into a wood by a path that ran steeply up the hillside and by and by they came to a glen where the woodmen of a score of years ago had felled the trees leaving a green hollow of saplings in the midst of their towering neighbours  there she said holding out her hand to him now we are alone just six hours or soand then the sun will be there she pointed to the treetops to the west and then you will have to go for good for goodyou your way and i mine what a tanglea tangle is this life of ours could i have dreamt we should ever be talking like this you and i friends of an hour what will you think of me does it matter dont speak say nothingpoor face poor hands if only there were something to look toto pray to she bent over his hand and pressed it to her breast what worlds weve seen together you and i and thenanother parting  they wandered on a little way and came back and listened to the first few birds that flew up into the higher branches noonday being past to sing  they talked and were silent and talked again with out question or sadness or regret or reproach she mocking even at themselves mocking at this changewhy and yet without it would you ever even have dreamed once a poor fool of a frenchman went to his restless grave for mefor me need we understand were we told to pry who made us human must be human too why must we take such care and make such a fretthis soul i know it i know it it is all we haveto save they say poor creatures no never to spend and so they darent for a solitary instant lift it on the finger from its cage well we have and now soon back it must go back it must go and try its best to whistle the day out and yet do you know perhaps the very freedom does a little shake itsits monotony its true you see they have lived a long time these worldly wisefolk they were wise before they were swaddled  there and you are hungry she asked him laughing in his eyes of course of course you arescarcely a mouthful since that first still wonderful supper and you havent slept a wink except like a tiredout child after its first party on that old garden chair i sat and watched and yes almost hoped youd never wake in casein case come along see down there i cant go home just yet theres a little old innwell go and sit down thereas if we were really trying to be romantic i know the woman quite well we can talk therejust the day out  they sat at a little table in the garden of the cherry trees its thick green apple branches burdened with ripened fruit and grisel tried to persuade him to eat and drink for tomorrow we die she said her hands trembling her face as it were veiled with a faint mysterious light  there are dozens and dozens of old stories you know she said leaning on her elbows dozens and dozens meaning only us you must you must eat look just an apple weve got to say goodbye and faintness will double the difficulty she lightly touched his hand as if to compel him to smile with her there ill peel it and this is eden and soon it will be the cool of the evening and then oh yes the voice will come what nonsense i am talking never mind  they sat on in the quiet sunshine and a spider slid softly through the air and with busy claws set to its nets and those small ghosts the robins went whistling restlessly among the heavy boughs  a child presently came out of the porch of the inn into the garden and stood with its battered doll in its arms softly watching them awhile but when grisel smiled and tried to coax her over she burst out laughing and ran in again  lawford stooped forward on his chair with a groan you see he said the whole world mocks me you say this evening need it be must it be this evening if you only knew how far they have driven me if you only knew what we should only detest each other for saying and for listening to the whole things dulled and staled who wants a changeling who wants a painted bird who does not loathe the convertedand im converted to sabathiers god should we be sitting here talking like this if it were not so i cant i cant go back  she rose and stood with her hand pressed over her mouth watching him  wont you understand he continued i am an outcasta felon caught redhanded come in the flesh to a hideous and righteous judgment i hear myself saying all these things and yet grisel i do i do love you with all the dull best i ever had not now then i dont ask new even i can i would begin again god knows my face has changed enough even as it is think of me as that poor wandering ghost of yours how easily i could hide awayin your memory and just wait wait for you in time even this wild futile madness too would fade away then i could come back may i try  i cant answer you i cant reason only still i do know talk put off forget as i may must is must right and wrong who knows what they mean except that ones to be done and ones to be forsworn orforgive my friend the truest thing i ever saidor else we lose the savour of both oh then and i know too youd weary of me i know you monsieur nicholas better than you can ever know yourself though you have risen from your grave you follow a dream no voice or face or flesh and blood and not to do what the one old raven within you cries you must would be in time to hate the very sound of my footsteps you shall go back poor turncoat and face the clearness the utterly more difficult bald and heartless clearness as together we faced the dark life is a little while and though i have no words to tell what always are and must be foolish reasons because they are not reasons at all but ghosts of memory i know in my heart that to face the worst is your only hope of peace should i have staked so much on your finding that and now throw up the game dont let us talk any more ill walk half the way perhaps perhaps i will walk all the way i think my brother guessesat least my madness ive talked and talked him nearly past his patience and then when you are quite safely oh yes quite safely and soundly gone then i shall go away for a little so that we cant even hear each other speak except in dreams lifewell i always thought it was much too plain a tale to have as dull an ending and with us the powers beyond have played a newer trick thats all another hour and we will go till then theres just the solitary walk home and only the dull old haunted house that hoards as many ghosts as we ourselves to watch our coming  evening began to shine between the trees they seemed to stand aflame with a melancholy rapture in their uplifted boughs above their fading coats the fields of the garnered harvest shone with a golden stillness awhir with shimmering flocks of starlings and the old birds that had sung in the spring sang now amid the same leaves grown older too to give them harbourage  herbert was sitting in his room when they returned nursing his teacup on his knee while he pretended to be reading with elbow propped on the table  heres nicholas sabathier my dear come to say goodbye awhile said grisel she stood for a moment in her white gown her face turned towards the clear green twilight of the open window i have promised to walk part of the way with him but i think first we must have some tea no he flatly refuses to be driven we are going to walk  the two friends were left alone face to face with a rather difficult silence only the least degree of nervousness apparent so far as herbert was concerned in that odd aloof sustained air of impersonality that had so baffled his companion in their first queer talk together  your sister said just now herbert blurted lawford at last heres nicholas sabathier come to say goodbye well iwhat i want you to understand is that it is sabathier the worst he ever was but also that it is goodbye  herbert slowly turned i dont quite see why goodbye lawford andfrankly there is nothing to explain we have chosen to live such a very outoftheway life he went on as if following up a train of thought the truth is if one wants to live at allones own life i meantheres no time for many friends and just steadfastly regarding your neighbours tail as you follow it down into the nowhereits that that seems to me the deadliest form of hypnotism one must simply go ones own way doing ones best to free ones mind of cantand i dare say clearing some excellent stuff out with the rubbish one consequence is that i dont think however foolhardy it may be to say so i dont think i care a groat for any opinion as human as my own good or bad my sisters a million times a better woman than i am a man what possibly could there be then for me to say he turned with a nervous smile why should it be goodbye  lawford glanced involuntarily towards the door that stood in shadow duskily ajar well he said we have talked and we think it must be that until at least he smiled faintly i can come as quietly as your old ghost you told me of and in that case it may not be so very long to wait  their eyes met fleetingly across the still listening room the more i think of it lawford pushed slowly on the less i understand the frantic purposelessness of all that has happened to me until i went down as you said a godsend of a little miss muffet and the inconceivable farce came off i was fairly happy fairly contented to dance my little wooden dance and wait till the showman should put me down into his box again and nowwell here i am the whole thing has gone by and scarcely left a trace of its visit here i am for all my friends to swear to and yet herbert if youll forgive me troubling you with this stuff about myself not a single belief or thought or desire remains unchanged you will remember all that i hope its not of course the ghost of an apology only the mere facts  herbert rose and paced slowly across to the window the longer i live lawford the more i curse this futile gift of speech here am i wanting to tell you to say out frankly what if mind could appeal direct to mind would be merely as the wind passing through the leaves of a tree with just oneone multitudinous rustle but which if i tried to put into wordswell daybreak would find us still groping on he turned a peculiar wry smile on his face its a dumb world but there we are and some day youll come again  well said lawford as if with an almost hopeless effort to turn thought into such primitive speech thats where we stand then he got up suddenly like a man awakened in the midst of unforeseen danger where is your sister he cried looking into the shadow and as if in actual answer to his entreaty they heard the clinking of the cups on the little old green lacquer tray she was at that moment carrying into the room she sat down on the window seat and put the tray down beside her it will be before dark even now she said glancing out at the faintly burning skies  they had trudged on together with almost as deep a sense of physical exhaustion as peasants have who have been labouring in the fields since daybreak and a little beyond the village before the last long road began that led in presently to the housed and scrupulous suburb she stopped with a sob beside an old scarred milestone by the wayside thisis as far as i can go she said she stooped and laid her hand on the cold mossgrown surface of the stone even now its wet with dew she rose again and looked strangely into his face yes yes here it is she said oh and worse worse than any fear but nothing now can trouble you again of that were both at least past that  grisel he said forgive me but i canti cant go on  dont think dont think she said taking his hands and lifting them to her bosom its only how the day goes and it has all my one dear happened scores and scores of times beforemother and child and friendand lovers that are all these too like us we mustnt cry out perhaps it was all before even we could speakthis sorrow came take all the hope and all the future and then may come our chance  whats life to me now you said the desire would come back that i should shake myself free i could if you would help me i dont know what you are or what your meaning is only that i love you care for nothing wish for nothing but to see you and think of you a flat dull voice keeps saying that i have no right to be telling you all this you will know best i know i am nothing i ask nothing if we love one another what is there else to say  nothing nothing to say except only goodbye what could you tell me that i have not told myself over and over again reasons gone thinkings gone now i am only sure she smiled shadowily what peace did he find who couldnt perhaps like you face the last goodbye  they stood in utter solitude awhile in the evening gloom the air was as still and cold as some grey unfathomable untraversed sea above them uncountable clouds drifted slowly across space  why do they all keep whispering together he said in a low voice with cowering face oh if you knew grisel how they have hemmed me in how they have come pressing in through the narrow gate i left ajar only to mock and mislead its all dark and unintelligible  he touched her hand peering out of the shadows that seemed to him to be gathering between their faces he drew her closer and touched her lips with his fingers her beauty seemed to his distorted senses to fill earth and sky this then was the presence the grave and lovely overshadowing dream whose surrender made life a torment and death the near fold of an immortal starry veil she broke from him with a faint cry and he found himself running and running just as he had run that other night with death instead of life for inspiration towards his earthly home    chapter twentytwo  he was utterly wearied but he walked on for a long while with a dogged unglancing pertinacity and without looking behind him then he rested under the dewsodden hedgeside and buried his face in his hands once indeed he did turn and grind his way back with hard uplifted face for many minutes but at the meeting with an old woman who in the late dusk passed him unheeded on the road he stopped again and after standing awhile looking down upon the dust trying to gather up the tangled threads of his thoughts he once more set off homewards  it was clear starry and quite dark when he reached the house the lamp at the roadside obscurely lit its breadth and height lamplight within too was showing yellow between the venetian blinds a cold gasjet gleamed out of the basement window he seemed bereft now of all desire or emotion simply the passive witness of things external in a calm which though he scarcely realised its cause was an exquisite solace and relief his senses were intensely sharpened with sleeplessness the faintest sound belled clear and keen on his ear the thinnest beam of light besprinkled his eyes with curious brilliance  as quietly as some nocturnal creature he ascended the steps to the porch and leaning between stone pilaster and wall listened intently for any rumour of those within  he heard a clear rather languid and delicate voice quietly speak on until it broke into a little peal of laughter followed when it fell silent by sheilasrapid rich and low the first speaker seemed to be standing probably then his evening visitors had only just come in or were preparing to depart he inserted his latchkey and gently pushed at the cumbersome door it was locked against him with not the faintest thought of resentment or surprise he turned back stooped over the balustrade and looked down into the kitchen nothing there was visible but a narrow strip of the white table on which lay a black cotton glove and beyond the glint of a copper pan what made all these mute and inanimate things so coldly hostile  an extreme almost nauseous distaste filled him at the thought of knocking for admission of confronting ada possibly even sheila in the cold echoing gloom of the detestable porch of meeting the first wild almost metallic flash of recognition he swept softly down again and paused at the open gate once before the voices of the night had called him they would not summon him forever in vain he raised his eyes again towards the window who were these visitors met together to drum the alien out he narrowed his lids and smiled up at the vacuous unfriendly house then wheeling on a sudden impulse he groped his way down the gravel path that led into the garden as he had left it the long white window was ajar  with extreme caution he pushed it noiselessly up and climbed in and stood listening again in the black passage on the other side when he had fully recovered his breath and the knocking of his heart was stilled he trod on softly till turning the corner he came in sight of the kitchen door it was now narrowly open just enough perhaps to admit a cat and as he softly approached looking steadily in he could see ada sitting at the empty table beneath the single whistling chandelier in her black dress and black straw hat she was reading apparently but her back was turned to him and he could not distinguish her arm beyond the elbow then almost in an instant he discovered as drawn up and unstirring he gazed on that she was not reading but had covertly and instantaneously raised her eyes from the print on the table beneath and was transfixedly listening too he turned his eyes away and waited when again he peered in she had apparently bent once more over her magazine and he stole on  one by one with a thin remote exultation in his progress he mounted the kitchen stairs and with each deliberate and groping step the voices above him became more clearly audible at last in the darkness of the hall but faintly stirred by the gleam of lamplight from the chink of the diningroom door he stood on the threshold of the drawingroom door and could hear with varying distinctness what those friendly voices were so absorbedly discussing his ear seemed as exquisite as some contrivance of science registering passively the least sound the faintest syllable and like it in no sense meddling with the thought that speech conveyed he simply stood listening fixed and motionless like some uncouth statue in the leafy hollow of a garden stony unspeculating  oh but you either refuse to believe bettie or you wont understand that its far worse than that sheila seemed to be upbraiding or at least reasoning with the last speaker ask mr dantonhe actually saw him  saw him repeated a thick still voice he stood there in that very doorway mrs lovat and positively railed at me he stood there and streamed out all the names he could lay his tongue to i wasntunfriendly to the poor beggar when bethany let me into it i thought it was simplyi did indeed mrs lawforda monstrous exaggeration flatly i didnt believe it shall i say that but when i stood face to face with him i could have taken my oath that that was no more poor old arthur lawford thanwell i wont repeat what particular word occurred to me but there the corpulent shrug was almost audible we all know what old bethany is a sterling old chap mind you so far as mere character is concerned the right man in the right place but as gullible and as softhearted as a tomtit ive said all this before i know mrs lawford and been properly snubbed for my pains but if i had been bethany id have sifted the whole story at the beginning the moment he put his foot into the house look at that tichborne fellowwent for months and months just picking up one day what he floored old hawkinswasnt itwith the next but of course he added gloomily now thats all too late hes moaned himself into a tolerably tight corner id just like to see though a british jury comparing this claimant with his photograph pon my word i would where would he be then do you think  but my dear mr danton went on the clear languid voice lawford had heard break so lightheartedly into laughter you dont mean to tell me that a woman doesnt know her own husband when she sees himor for the matter of that when she doesnt see him if tom came home from a ramble as handsome as apollo tomorrow id recognise him at the very first blushliterally hed go nuzzling off to get his slippers or complain that the lamps had been smoking or hunt the house down for last weeks paper oh besides toms tomand theres an end of it  thats precisely what i think mrs lovat one is saturated with ones personality as it were  you see thats just it thats just exactly every womans husband all over he is saturated with his personality bravo mr craik  good lord said danton softly i dont deny it  but that broke in sheila crisplythats just precisely what i asked you all to come in for its because i know now apart altogether from the mere evidence thatthat he is arthur mind i dont say i ever really doubted i was only so utterly shocked i suppose i positively put posers to him but his memory was perfect in spite of the shock which would have killed aa more sensitive nature she had risen it seemed and was moving with all her splendid impressiveness of silk and presence across the general line of vision but the hall was dark and still her eyes were dimmed with light lawford could survey her there unmoved  are you there ada she called discreetly  yes maam answered the faint voice from below  you have not heard anythingno knock  no maam no knock  the door is open if you should call  yes maam  the girls scared out of her wits said sheila returning to her audience ive told you all that miserable ferguson storya piece of calm callous presence of mind i should never have dreamed my husband capable of and the curious thing isat least it is no longer curious in the light of the ghastly facts i am only waiting for mr bethany to tell youfrom the very first she instinctively detested the very mention of his name  i believe you know said mr craik with some decision that servants must have the same wonderful instinct as dogs and children they are natural intuitive judges of character  yes said sheila gravely and its only through that that i got to hear of thethe mysterious friend in the little ponycarriage adas magnificently loyali will say that  i dont want to suggest anything mrs lawford began mr craik rather hurriedly but wouldnt it perhaps be wiser not to wait for mr bethany it is not at all unusual for him to be kept a considerable time in the vestry after service and today is the feast of st michaels and all angels you know mightnt your husband beercoming back dont you think  craiks right mrs lawford its not a bit of good waiting bethany would stick there till midnight if any old womans spiritual state could keep her going so long here we all are and at any moment we may be interrupted mind you i promise nothingonly that there shall be no scene but here i am and if he does come knocking and ringing and lunging out in the disgusting manner hewell all i ask is permission to speak for you pon my soul to think what you must have gone through it isnt the place for ladies just nowhonestly it aint  besides supposing the romantic lady of the ponycarriage has friends are you a pugilist mr craik  i hope i could give some little account of myself mrs lovat but you need have no anxiety about that  there mr danton so as there is not the least cause for anxiety even if poor arthur should return to his earthly home may we share your dreadful story at once sheila and then perhaps hear mr bethanys exposition of it when he does arrive we are amply guarded  honestly you know you are a bit of a sceptic mrs lovat pleaded danton playfully ive seen him  and seeing is disbelieving i suppose now then sheila  i dont think theres the least chance of arthur returning tonight said sheila solemnly i am perfectly well aware its best to be as cheerful as one canand as resolved but i think bettie when even you know the whole horrible secret you wont think mr danton waswas horrified for nothing the ghastly the awful truth is that my husbandthere is no other word for itispossessed  possessed sheila what in the name of all the creeps is that  well i dare say mr craik will explain it much better than i can by a devil dear the voice was perfectly poised and restrained and mr craik did not see fit for the moment to embellish the definition  lawford with an almost wooden immobility listened on  but the devil or a devil isnt there a distinction inquired mrs lovat  its in the bible bettie over and over again it was quite a common thing in the middle ages i think im right in saying that am i not mr craik mr craik must have solemnly nodded or abundantly looked his unwilling affirmation and what has been continued sheila temperately i suppose may be again  when the fellow began raving at me the other night began danton huskily as if out of an unfathomable pit of reflection among other things he said that i havent any wish to remember was that i was a sceptic and bethany said ditto to it i dont mind being called a sceptic why i said myself mrs lovat was a sceptic just now but when it comes to devils mrs lawfordi may be convinced about the other but devils well ive been in the city nearly twentyfive years and its my impression human nature can raise all the devils we shall ever need and another thing he added as if inspired and with an immensely intelligent blink is it just precisely that word in the revised versioneh craik  ill certainly look it up danton but i take it that mrs lawford is not so much insisting on the word as on thethe manifestation and im bound to confess that the society for psychical research which has among its members quite eminent and entirely trustworthy men of sciencei am bound to admit they have some very curious stories to tell the old idea was you know that there are seventytwo princely devils and as many as seven millionercommoners it may very well sound quaint to our ears mrs lovat but there it is but whether that has any bearing onon what you were saying danton i cant say perhaps mrs lawford will throw a little more light on the subject when she tells us on what precise facts herher distressing theory is based  lawford had soundlessly stolen a pace or two nearer and by stooping forward a little he could each in turn scrutinise the little intent company sitting over his story around the lamp at the further end of the table squatting like little children with their twigs and pins fishing for wonders on the brink of the unknown  yes mrs lovat was saying i quite agree mr craik seventytwo princes and no princesses oh these masculine prejudices but do throw a little more modern light on the subject sheila  i mean this said sheila firmly when i went in for the last time to say goodbyeand of course it was at his own wish that i did leave him and precisely why he wished it is now unhappily only too apparenti had brought him some money from the bankfifty pounds i think yes fifty pounds and quite by the merest chance i glanced down in passing at a book he had apparently been reading a book which he seemed very anxious to conceal with his hand arthur is not a great reader though i believe he studied a little before we were married andwell i detest anything like subterfuge and i said it out without thinking why youre reading french arthur he turned deathly white but made no answer  and cant you even confide to us the title sheila sighed mrs lovat reproachfully  wait a minute said sheila you shall make as much fun of the thing as you like bettie when ive finished i dont know why but that peculiar stealthy look haunted me why french i kept asking myself why french arthur hasnt opened a french book for years he doesnt even approve of the entente his argument was that we ought to be friends with the germans because they are more hostile never mind when ada came back the next evening and said he was out i came the following morningby myselfand knocked no one answered and i let myself in his bed had not been slept in there were candles and matches all over the houseone even burnt nearly to the stick on the floor in the corner of the drawingroom i suppose it was foolish but i was alone and just that somehow horrified me it seemed to point to such a peculiar state of mind i hesitated what was the use of looking further yet something seemed to say to meand it was surely providentialgo downstairs and there in the breakfastroom the first thing i saw on the table was this booka dingy ragged bleared patchedup oh a horrible a loathsome little book and i have read bits too here and there and beside it was my own little school dictionary my own childs she looked up sharply what was that did anybody call  nobody i heard said danton staring stonily round  it may have been the passing of the wind suggested mr craik after a pause  peep between the blinds mr craik it may be poor mr bethany confronting pneumonia in the porch  theres no one there mrs lovat said the curate returning softly from his errand please continue youryour narrative mrs lawford  we are panting for the devil my dear  well i sat down and very much against my inclination turned over the pages it was full of the most revolting confessions and trials so far as i could see in fact i think the book was merely an amateur collection ofof horrors and the faces the portraits well then can you imagine my feelings when towards the end of the book about thirty pages from the end i came upon thisgloating up at me from the table in my house before my very eyes  she cast a rapid glance over her shoulder and gathering up her silk skirt drew out from the pocket beneath the few crumpled pages and passed them without a word to danton lawford kept him plainly in view as lowering his great face he slowly stooped and holding the loose leaves with both fat hands between his knees stared into the portrait then he truculently lifted his cropped head  what did i say he said what did i say what did i tell old bethany in this very room what dye think of that mrs lovat for a portrait of arthur lawford what dye make of that craikeh devileh  mrs lovat glanced with arched eyebrows and with her fingertips handed the sheets on to her neighbour who gazed with a settled and mournful frown and returned them to sheila  she took the pages folded them and replaced them carefully in her pocket she swept her hands over her skirts and turned to danton  you agree she inquired softly its like  like its the livin livid image the livin image he repeated stretching out his arm as he stood there that very night  what will you say then said sheila quietly what will you say if i tell you that that man nicholas de sabathier has been in his grave for over a hundred years  dantons little eyes seemed if anything to draw back even further into his head id say mrs lawford if youll excuse the word that it might be a damn horrible coincidenceid go farther an almost incredible coincidence but if you want the sober truth id say it was nothing more than a crafty clever abominable piece of trickery thats what id say oh you dont know mrs lovat when a scamps a scamp hell stop at nothing i could tell you some tales  ah but thats not all said sheila eyeing them steadfastly one by one we all of us know that my husbands story was that he had gone down to widderstoneinto the churchyard for his convalescent ramble that storys true we all know that he said he had had a fit a heart attack and that a kind ofof stupor had come over him i believe on my honour thats true too but no one knows but he himself and mr bethany and i that it was a wretched broken grave quite at the bottom of the hill that he chose for his resting place norand i cant get the scene out of my headnor that the name on that one solitary tombstone down there waswasthis  danton rolled his eyes i dont begin to follow he said stubbornly  you dont mean said mr craik who had not removed his gaze from sheilas face i am not to take it that you mean mrs lawford thethe other  yes said sheila hisshe patted her skirtssabathiers  you mean said mrs lovat crisply that the man in the grave is the man in the book and that the man in the book isis poor arthurs changed face  sheila nodded  danton rose cumbrously from his chair looking beadily down on his three friends  oh but you know it isntit isnt right he began lord i can see him now glassyyes thats the very word i saidglassy it wont do mrs lawford on my solemn honour it wont do i dont deny it call it what you like yes devils if you like but what i say as a practical man is that its just rankthats what it is bethanys had too much rope the times gone by for sentiment and all that foolery mercys all very well but after all its justice that clinches the bargain theres only one way we must catch him we must lay the poor wretch by the heels before its too late no publicity god bless me no wed have all the rags in london on us theyd pillory us nine days on end wed never live it down no we must just hush it upa home or something an asylum for my part he turned like a huge toad his chin low in his collarand id say the same if it was my own brother and after all he is your husband mrs lawfordid sooner he was in his grave it takes two to play at that game thats what i say to lay himself open i cant stand ithonestly i cant stand it and yet he jerked his chin over the peak of his collar towards the ladies and yet you say hes being fetched comes creeping home and is fetched at dark by aa lady in a ponycarriage god bless me its rank what he broke out violently again what was he doing there in a cemetery after dark do you think that beastly frenchman would have played such a trick on craik here would he have tried his little game on me deviltry be it if you prefer the word and all deference to you mrs lawford but i know thisa couple of hundred years ago they would have burnt a man at the stake for less than a tenth of this ask craik here i dont know how and i dont know when his mother ive always heard say was a little eccentric but the truth is hes managed by some unholy legerdemain to get the thing at his fingers ends thats what it is think of that unspeakable book left open on the table look at his ferguson game its our solemn duty to keep him for good and all out of mischief it reflects all round theres no getting out of it were all in it and tar sticks and then theres poor little alice to consider andand you yourself mrs lawford i wouldnt give the fellowfriend though he was in a wayit isnt safe to give him five minutes freedom weve simply got to save you from yourself mrs lawford thats what it isand from oldfashioned sentiment and i only wish bethany was here now to dispute it  he stirred himself down as it were into his clothes and stood in the middle of the hearthrug gently oscillating with his hands behind his back but at some faint rumour out of the silent house his posture suddenly stiffened and he lifted a little with heavy steady lids his head  what is the matter danton said mr craik in a small voice why are you listening  i wasnt listening said danton stoutly i was thinking  at the same moment at the creak of a footstep on the kitchen stairs lawford also had drawn soundlessly back into the darkness of the empty drawingroom  while mr danton is thinking sheila mrs lovat was softly interposing do please listen a moment to me do you mean really that that frenchmanthe one youve pocketedis the poor creature in the grave  yes mrs lawford said mr craik putting out his face a little are we to take it that you mean that  its the same date dear the same name even to the spelling what possibly else can i think  and that the poor creature in the grave actually climbed up out of the darkness andwell what  i know no more than you do now bettie but the two facesyou must remember you havent seen my husband since you must remember you havent heard the peculiarthe most peculiar things hearthur himselfhas said to me things such as a wife and not in jest bettie i assure you  and mr bethany interpolated mr craik modestly feeling his way  pah bethany craik hed back old nick himself if he came with a good tale weve got to act weve got to settle his hash before he does any mischief  well began mrs lovat smiling a little remorsefully beneath the arch of her raised eyebrows i sincerely hope youll all forgive me but i really am heart and soul with old nick as mr danton seems on intimate terms enough to call him dead he is really immensely alluring and alive i think awfullyjust awfully pitiful andand pathetic but if i know anything of arthur he wont be beaten by a frenchman as for just the portrait i think do you know i almost prefer dark menshe glanced up at the face immediately in front of the clockat least she added softly when they are not looking very vindictive i suppose people are fairly often possessed mr craik how many deadly sins are there  as a matter of fact mrs lovat there are seven but i think in this case mrs lawford intends to suggest not so much thatthat her husband is in that condition habitual sin you knowgrave enough of course i ownbut that he is actually being compelled even to the extent of a more or less complete change of physiognomy to follow the biddings of some atrocious spiritual influence it is no breach of confidence to say that i have myself been present at a deathbed where the struggle against what i may call the end was perfectly awful to witness i dont profess to follow all the ramifications of the affair but though possibly mr danton may seem a little harsh such harshness if i may venture to intercede is not necessarily vindictive andand personal security is a consideration  if you only knew the awful fear the awful uncertainty i have been in bettie oh it is worse infinitely worse than you can possibly imagine i have myself heard the voice speak out of hima high hard nasal voice ive seen what mr danton calls the glassiness come into his face and an expression so wild and so appallingly depraved as it were that i have had to hurry downstairs to hide myself from the thought im willing to sacrifice everything for my own husband and for alice but can it be expected of me to go on harbouring lawford listened on in vain for a moment poor sheila it seemed had all but broken down  look here mrs lawford began danton huskily you really mustnt give way you really mustnt its awful unspeakably awful i admit but here we are friends in the midst of friends and theres absolutely nothingwhats that eh who is it oh the maid  ada stood in the doorway looking in all ive come to ask maam she said in a low voice is am i to stay downstairs any longer and are you aware theres somebody in the house  whats that whats that youre saying broke out the husky voice again control yourself speak gently whats that  begging your pardon sir im perfectly under control and all i say is that i cant stay any longer alone downstairs there theres somebody in the house  a concentrated hush seemed to have fallen on the little assembly  somebodybut who said sheila out of the silence you come up here ada with these idle fancies whos in the house there has been no knockno footstep  no knock no footstep maam that ive heard its dr ferguson maam he was here that first night and hes been here ever since he was here when i came on tuesday and he was here last night and hes here now i cant be deceived by my own feelings its not right its not outspoken to keep me in the dark like this and if you have no objection i would like to go home  lawford in his utter weariness had nearly closed the door and now sat bent up on a chair wondering vaguely when this poor play was coming to an end longing with an intensity almost beyond endurance for the keen night air the open sky but still his ears drank in every tiniest sound or stir he heard dantons lowered voice muttering his arguments he heard ada quietly sniffing in the darkness of the hall and this was his world this was his lifes panorama creaking on at every jolt this was the must grisel had sent him back tothese poor fools packed together in a panic at an old stale tale well they would all come out presently and cluster and the crested cackling fellow would lead them safely away out of the haunted farmyard  he started out of his reverie at dantons voice close at hand  look here my good girl we havent the least intention of keeping you in the dark if you want to leave your mistress like this in the midst of her anxieties she says you can go and welcome but its not a bit of good in the world coming up with these cockandbull stories the truth is your masters mad thats the sober truth of ithopelessly insane you understand and weve got to find him but nothings to be said dye see its got to be done without fuss or scandal but if theres any witness wanted or anything of that kind why here you are and he dropped his voice to an almost inaudible hoot and well worth your while you did see him eh step into the trap and all that  ada stood silent a moment i dont know sir she began quietly by what right you speak to me about what you call my cockandbull stories if the master is mad all i can say to anybody is im very sorry to hear it i came to my mistress sir if you please and i prefer to take my orders from one who has a right to give them did i understand you to say maam that you wouldnt want me any more this evening  sheila had swept solemnly to the door mr danton meant all that he said quite kindly ada i can perfectly understand your feelingsperfectly and im very much obliged to you for all your kindness to me in very trying circumstances we are all agreedwe are forced to the terrible conclusion whichwhich mr danton has justexpressed and i know i can rely on your discretion dont stay on a moment if you really are afraid but when you say some one ada do you meansome one like you or me or do you meanthe other  ive been sitting in the kitchen maam unable to move im watched everywhere the other evening i went into the drawingroomi was alone in the houseand i cant describe it it wasnt dark and yet it was all still and black like the ruins after a fire i dont mean i saw it only that it was like a scene and then the watchingi am quite aware to some it may sound all fancy but im not superstitious never was i only meanthat i cant sit alone here i darent else im quite myself so if so be you dont want me any more if i cant be of any further use to you or toto mr lawford id prefer to go home  very well ada thank you you can go out this way  the door was unchained and unbolted and goodnight said and sheila swept back in sombre pomp to her absorbed friends  shes quite a good creature at heart she explained frankly as if to disclaim any finesse and almost quixotically loyal but what really did she mean do you think she is so obstinate that maddening some one how they do repeat themselves it cant be my husband not dr ferguson i mean you dont supposeoh surely not some one else again the dark silence of the house seemed to drift in on the little company  mr craik cleared his throat i failed to catch quite all that the maid said he murmured apologetically but i certainly did gather it was to some kind ofof emanation she was referring and the ruin you know im not a mystic and yet do you know that somehow seemed to me almost offensively suggestive ofof demonic influence you dont suppose mrs lawfordand of course i wouldnt for a moment venture on such a conjecture unsupportedbut even if this restless spirit let us call it did succeed in making a footing it might possibly be rather in the nature of a lodging than a permanent residence moreover we are i think bound to remember that probably in all spheres of existence like attracts like even the gadarene episode seems to suggest a possible multiplication he peered largely you dont suppose mrs lawford  i think mr craik doesnt quite relish having to break the news sheila dear explained mrs lovat soothingly that perhaps sabathiers out which really is quite a heavenly suggestion for in that case your husband would be in wouldnt he just our old stolid arthur again you know and next mr craik is suggesting and it certainly does seem rather fascinating that poor adas got mixed up with the frenchmans friends or perhaps even with one of the seventytwo princes royal i know women cant or mustnt reason mr danton but you do i hope just catch the drift  danton started i wasnt really listening to the girl he explained nonchalantly shrugging his black shoulders and pursing up his eyes personally mrs lovat id pack the baggage off tonight box and all but its not my business  you mustnt be depressedmust he mr craik after all my dear man the business as you call it is not exactly entailed but really sheila i think it must be getting very late mr bethany wont come now and the dear old thing ought certainly to have his say before we go any further oughtnt he mr danton so whats the use of worriting poor adas ghost any longer and as for poor arthuri havent the faintest desire in the world to hear the little cart drive up simply in case it should be to leave your unfortunate husband behind it sheila what it must be to be alone all night in this house with a dead and buried frenchmans facewell i shudder dear  and yet mrs lovat said mr craik with some little show of returning bravado as we make our bed you know  but in this case you see she replied reflectively if all accounts are true mr craik its manifestly the wicked frenchman who has made the bed and sheila who refu but look mr danton is fretting to get home  if youll all go to the door said danton seizing a fleeting opportunity to raise his eyebrows more expressively even than if he had again shrugged his shoulders at sheila ill put out the light  the night air flowed into the dark house as danton hastily groped his way out of the diningroom  theres only one thing said sheila slowly when i last saw my husband you know he was i think the least bit better he was always stubbornly convinced it would all come right in time thats why i think hes been spending hishis evenings away from home but supposing it did  for my part said mrs lovat breathing the faint wind that was rising out of the west id sigh id rub my eyes id thank god for such an exciting dream and id turn comfortably over and go to sleep again im all for arthurabsolutelyback against the wall  for my part said danton looming in the dusk friend or no friend id cut theid cut him dead but dont fret mrs lawford devil or no devil hes gone for good  and for my part began mr craik but the door at that moment slammed  voices however broke out almost immediately in the porch and after a hurried consultation lawford in his stagnant retreat heard the door softly reopen and the striking of a match and mr craik followed closely by dantons great body stole circumspectly across his dim chink and the first adventurer went stumbling down the kitchen staircase  i suppose muttered lawford turning his head in the darkness they have come back to put out the kitchen gas  danton began a busy tuneless whistle between his teeth  coming craik he called thickly after a long pause  apparently no answer had been returned to his inquiry he waited a little longer with legs apart and eyeballs enveloped in brooding darkness ill just go and tell the ladies youre coming he suddenly bawled down the hollow do you hear craik theyre alone you know and with that he resolutely wheeled and rapidly made his way down the steps into the garden some few moments afterwards mr craik shook himself free of the basement hastened at a spirited trot to rejoin his companions and in his absence of mind omitted to shut the front door    chapter twentythree  lawford sat on in the darkness and now one sentence and now another of their talk would repeat itself in his memory in much the same way as one listlessly turns over an antiquated diary to read here and there a flattened and almost meaningless sentiment sometimes a footstep passed echoing along the path under the trees then his thoughts would leave him and he would listen and listen till it had died quite out it was all so very far away and they toothese talkersso very far away as remote and yet as clear as the characters in a play when they have made their final bow and have left the curtained stage and one is standing uncompanioned and nearly the last of the spectators and the lights that have summoned back reality again are being extinguished it was only by painful effort of mind that he kept recalling himself to himselfwhy he was here what it all meant that this was indeed actuality  yet after all this by now was his customary loneliness there was little else he desired for the present than the hospitality of the dark he glanced around him in the clear black stirless air here and there it seemed a humped or spindled form held against all comers its passive place here and there a tiny faintness of light played night after night these chairs and tables kept their blank vigil why he thought pleased as an overtired child with the fancy in a sense they were always alone shut up in a kind of senselessnessjust like us all but whatwhat he had suddenly risen from his chair to ask himselfwhat on earth are they alone with no precise answer had been forthcoming to that question but as in turning in the doorway he looked out into the night flashing here and there in dark spaces of the sky above the withering apple leavesthe long dark wall and quiet untrodden roadwith the tumultuous beating of the starsone thing at least he was conscious of having learned in these last few days he knew what kind of a place he was alone in  it seemed to weave a spell over him to call up a nostalgia he had lost all remembrance of since childhood and that queer homesickness at any rate was all sabathiers doing he thought smiling in his rather careworn fashion sabathier it was this mystery bereft now of all fear and this beauty together that made life the endless changing and yet changeless thing it was and yet mystery and loveliness alike were only really appreciable with ones legs as it were dangling down over into the grave  just with ones lantern lit on the edge of the whispering unknown and a reiterated going back out of the solitude into the light and warmth to the voices and glancing of eyes to say goodbyethat after all was this life on earth for those who watched as well as acted what if ones earthly home were emptystill the restless fretted traveller must tarry for the horrible worst of it is my friend he said as if to some silent companion listening behind him the worst of it is your way was just simply solely suicide what was it herbert had called it yes a culdesacblack lofty immensely still and old and picturesque but none the less merely a contemptible culdesac no abiding place scarcely even sufficing with its flagstones for a groan from the fugitive and deluded refugee there was no peace for the wicked the question of course then came inwas there any peace anywhere for anybody  he smiled at a sudden odd remembrance of a quiet sardonic old aunt whom he used to stay with as a child children should be seen and not heard she would say peering at him over his favourite pudding  his eyes rested vacantly on the darkling street he fell again into reverie gigantically brooded over by shapes only imagination dimly conceived of the remote alleys of his mind astir with a shadowy and ceaseless traffic which it wasnt at least this lifes business to hearken after or regard and as he stood there in a mysteriously thronging peaceful solitude such as he had never known before faintly out of the silence broke the sound of approaching hoofs his heart seemed to gather itself close a momentary blindness veiled his eyes so wildly had his blood surged up into cheek and brain he remained caught up with head slightly inclined listening as with an interminable tardiness measureless anguished hope died down into nothing in his mind  cold and heavy his heart began to beat again as if to catch up those laggard moments he turned with an infinite revulsion of feeling to look out on the lamps of the old fly that had drawn up at his gate  he watched incuriously a little old lady rather arduously alight pause and look up at his darkened windows and after a momentary hesitation and a word over her shoulder to the cabman stoop and fumble at the iron latch he watched her with a kind of wondering aversion still scarcely tinged with curiosity she had succeeded in lifting the latch and in pushing her way through and was even now steadily advancing towards him along the tiled path and a minute after he recognised with the strangest reactions the quiet old figure that had shared a sunset with him ages and ages agohis mothers old schoolfellow miss sinnet  he was already ransacking the still faintlyperfumed diningroom for matches and had just succeeded in relighting the stillwarm lamp when he heard her quiet step in the porch even felt her peering in in the gloom with all her years trickling customariness behind her a little dubious of knocking on a wideopen door  but the lamp lit lawford went out again and welcomed his visitor i am alone he was explaining gravely my wifes away and the whole house topsyturvy how very very kind of you  the old lady was breathing a little heavily after her ascent of the steep steps and seemed not to have noticed his outstretched hand none the less she followed him in and when she was well advanced into the lighted room she sighed deeply raised her veil over the front of her bonnet and leisurely took out her spectacles  i suppose she was explaining in a little quiet voice you are mr arthur lawford but as i did not catch sight of a light in any of the windows i began to fear that the cabman might have set me down at the wrong house  she raised her head and first through and then over her spectacles she deliberately and steadfastly regarded him  yes she said to herself and turned not as it seemed entirely with satisfaction to look for a chair he wheeled the most comfortable up to the table  i have been visiting my old friend miss tuckerrev w tuckers daughtershe i knew could give me your address and sure enough she did your road dye see was on my way home and i determined in spite of the hour just to inquire you must understand mr lawford there was something that i rather particularly wanted to say to you but thereyoure looking sadly sadly ill and she glanced round a little inquisitively i think my story had better wait for a more convenient occasion  not at all miss sinnet please not lawford assured her really i have been ill but im now practically quite myself again my wife and daughter have gone away for a few days and i follow tomorrow so if youll forgive such a very poor welcome it may be mymy only chance do please let me hear  the old lady leant back in her chair placed her hands on its arms and softly panted while out of the rather broad serenity of her face she sat blinking up at her companion as if after a long talk instead of at the beginning of one no she repeated reflectively i dont like your looks at all yet here we are enjoying beautiful autumn weather mr lawford why not make use of it  oh yes said lawford i do i have been making tremendous use of it  her eyelid flickered at his candid glance and does your business permit of much walking  well ive been malingering these last few days idling at home but i am usually more or less my own man miss sinnet i walk a little  hm but not much in my direction mr lawford she quizzed him  all horrible indolence miss sinnet but i oftenoften think of you and especially just lately  well now she wriggled round her head to get a better view of him rather stiffly seated on his chair thats very peculiar because i too have been thinking lately a great deal of you and yeti fancy i shall succeed in mystifying you presentlynot precisely of you but of somebody else  you do mystify mesomebody else he replied gallantly and that is the story i suppose  thats the story repeated miss sinnet with some little triumph now let me see it was on saturday lastyes saturday evening a wonderful sunset bewley heath  oh yes my daughters favourite walk  and your daughters age now  shes nearly sixteen alice you know  ah yes alice to be sure it is a beautiful walk and if fine i generally take mine there too its near theres shade its very little frequented and i can wander and muse undisturbed and that i think is pretty well all that an old woman like me is fit for mr lawford nearly sixteen is it possible dear dear me but let me get on on my way home from the heath you may be aware before one reaches the road again theres a somewhat steep ascent i havent the strength i had and whether im fatigued or not i have always made it a rule to rest awhile on a most convenient little seat at the summit admire the viewwhat i can see of itand then make my way quietly quietly home on saturday however and it most rarely occursonce i remember when a very civil nursemaid was sitting with two charmingly behaved little children in the sunshine and i heard they were my old friend major loders sons childrenon saturday as i was saying my own particular little haunt was already occupied she glanced back at him from out of her thoughts as it were by a gentleman i say gentleman though i must confess that his conductperhaps too a little something even in his appearance somewhat belied the term anyhow gentleman let us call him  lawford all attention nodded and encouragingly smiled  im not one of those tiresome suspicious people mr lawford who distrust strangers i have never been molested and i have enjoyed many and many a most interesting and sometimes instructive talk with an individual whom ive never seen in my life before and this side of the grave perhaps am never likely to see again she lifted her head with pursed lips and gravely yet still flickeringly regarded him once more well i made some trifling remarkthe weather the view whatnot she explained with a little jerk of her shoulderand to my extreme astonishment he turned and addressed me by namemiss sinnet unmistakablysinnet now perhaps and very rightly you wont considered that a very peculiar thing to do but you will recollect mr lawford that i had been sitting there a considerable time surely now if you had recognised my face you would have addressed me at once  was he do you think miss sinnet a little uncertain perhaps  never mind never mind let me get on with my story first the next thing my gentleman does is more mysterious still his whole manner was a little peculiar perhapsa certain restlessness what in fact one might be almost tempted to call a certain furtiveness of behaviour never mind what he does next is to ask me a riddle perhaps you wont think that was peculiar either  what was the riddle smiled lawford  why to be sure to guess his name simply guided so i surmised by some very faint resemblance in his face to his mother who was he assured me an old schoolfellow of mine at brighton i thought and thought i confess the adventure was beginning to be a little perplexing but of course very very few of my old schoolfellows remain distinctly in my memory now and i fear that grows more treacherous the longer i live their faces as girls are clear enough but later in life most of them drifted out of sightmany alas are dead and well at last i narrowed my man down to one and who now do you suppose that was  lawford sustained an expression of abysmal mystification do tell mewho  your own poor dear mother mr lawford  he said so  no no said the old lady with some vexation closing her eyes i said so he asked me to guess and i guessed mary lawford now do you see  yes yes but was he like her miss sinnet that was really very very extraordinary did you see any likeness in his face  miss sinnet very deliberately took her spectacles out of their case again now see here sir this is being practical isnt it im just going to take a leisurely glance at yours but you mustnt let me forget the time you must look after the time for me  its about a quarter to ten said lawford having glanced first at the stopped clock on the chimneypiece and then at his watch he then sat quite still and endeavoured to sit at ease while the old lady lifted her bonneted head and ever so gravely and benignly surveyed him  hm she said at last theres no mistaking you its marys chin and marys browwith just a little something perhaps of her dreamy eye but you havent all her looks mr lawford by any manner of means she was a very beautiful girl and so vivacious so fancifulit was i suppose the foreign strain showing itself even marriage did not quite succeed in spoiling her  the foreign strain lawford glanced with a kind of fleeting fixity at the quiet old figure the foreign strain  your mothers maiden name my dear mr lawford surely memory does not deceive me in that was van der gucht that i believe is a foreign name  ah yes said lawford his rising thoughts sinking quietly to rest again van der gucht of course ihow stupid of me  as a matter of fact your mother was very proud of her dutch blood but there she flung out little finlike sleeves if you dont let me keep to my story i shall go back as uneasy as i came and you didnt she added even more fretfully you didnt tell me the time  lawford stared at his watch again for some few moments without replying its a few minutes to ten he said at last  dear me and im keeping the cabman i mast hurry on well now i put it to you you shall be my father confessorthough i detest the idea in real lifewas i wrong was i justified in professing to the poor fellow that i detected a likeness when there was extremely little likeness there  what none at all cried lawford not the faintest trace  my dear good mr lawford she expostulated patting her lap theres very little more than a trace of my dear beautiful mary in you her own son how could there behow could you expect it in him a complete stranger no it was nothing but my own foolish kindliness it might have been marys son for all that i could recollect i havent for years please remember had the pleasure of receiving a visit from you i am firmly of opinionthat i was justified my motive was entirely benevolent and thento my positive amazementwell i wont say hard things of the absent but he suddenly turns round on me with a thank you miss bennett bennett hark ye perhaps you wont agree that i had any justification in being vexed andand affronted at that  i think miss sinnet said lawford solemnly that you were perfectly justified oh perfectly i wonder even you had the patience to give the real arthur lawford a chance to ask your forgiveness foror the stranger  well candidly said miss sinnett severely i was very much scandalised and i shouldnt be here now telling you my story if it hadnt been for your mother  my mother  the old lady rather grimly enjoyed his confusion yes mr lawford your mother i dont know whysomething in his manner something in his faceso dejected so unhappy soif it is not uncharitablnesse to say itso wild it has haunted me i havent been able to put the matter out of my mind i have lain awake in my bed thinking of him why did he speak to me i keep asking myself why did he play me so very aimless a trick how had he learned my name why was he sitting there so solitary and so dejected and worse even than that what has become of him a little more patience a little more charity perhapswhat might i not have done for him the whole thing has harassed and distressed me more than i can say would you believe it i have actually twice and on one occasion three times in a day made my way to the seathoping to see him there and i am not so young as i was and then as i say to crown all i had a most remarkable dream about your mother but thats my own affair elderly people like me are usedwell perhaps i wont say usedwere not surprised or disturbed by visits from those who have gone before we live in a sense among the tombs though i would not have you fancy its in any way a morbid or unhappy life to lead we dont talk about itcertainly not to young people let them enjoy their eden while they can though theres plenty of apples i fear on the tree yet mr lawford  she leant forward and whispered it with a big simple smilewe dont even discuss it much among ourselves but as one gets nearer and nearer to the wicketgate theres other company around one than youll find inin the directory and that is why i have just come on here tonight very probably my errand may seem to have no meaning for you you look ill but you dont appear to be in any great trouble or adversity as i feared in mywell thereas i feared you might be i must say though it seems a terribly empty house and no lights too  she slowly with a little trembling nodding of her bonnet turned her head and glanced quietly fixedly and unflinchingly out of the halfopen door but thats not my affair and again she looked at him for a little while  then she stooped forward and touched him kindly and trustingly on the knee trouble or no trouble she said its never too late to remind a man of his mother and im sure mr lawford im very glad to hear you are struggling up out of your illness again we must keep a brave heart forty or seventy whichever we may be while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them though they have not come to me even yet and i trust from the bottom of my heart not to you  she looked at him without a trace of emotion or constraint in her large quiet face and their eyes met for a moment in that brief fixed baffling fashion that seems to prove that mankind is after all but a dumb masked creature saddled with the vain illusion of speech  and now that ive eased my conscience said the old lady pulling down her veil i must beg pardon for intruding at such an hour of the evening and may i have your arm down those dreadful steps really mr lawford judging from the houses they erect for us the builders must have a very peculiar notion of mankind is the fly still there i expressly told the man to wait and what i am going to do if  hes there lawford reassured her craning his neck in their slow progress to catch a peep into the quiet road and like a flock of birds scared by a chance comer at their feeding in some deserted field a whirring cloud of memories swept softly up in his mindmemories whose import he made no effort to discover none the less the leisurely descent became in their company something of a real experience even in such a brimming week  i hope some day you will really tell me your dream he said pushing the old ladys silk skirts in after her as she slowly climbed into the carriage  ah my dear lawford when you are my age she called back to him groping her way into the rather musty gloom youll dream such dreams for yourself lifes not whats just the fashion and there are queerer things to be seen and heard just quietly in ones solitude than this busy life gives us time to discover but as for my mystifying bewley acquaintancei confess i cannot make head or tail of him  was he said lawford rather vaguely looking up into the dim white face that with its plumes filled nearly the whole carriage window was his face very unpleasing  she raised a gloved hand it has haunted me haunted me mr lawford itsits conflict poor fellow i hope i do hope he faced his trouble out but i shall never see him again  he squeezed the trembling kindly old hand i bet miss sinnet he said earnestly even your having thought kindly of the poor beggar eased his mindwhoever he may have been i assure you assure you of that  ay but i did more than think replied the old lady with a chuckle that might have seemed even a little derisive if it had not been so profoundly magnanimous  he watched the old black fly roll slowly off and still smiling at miss sinnets inscrutable finesse went back into the house and now my friend he said addressing peacefully the thronging darkness the times nearly up for me to go too  he had made up his mind or rather it seemed as if in the unregarded silences of this last long talk his mind had made up itself only among impossibilities had he the shadow of a choice in this old haunted house amid this shallow turmoil no practicable clue could show itself of a way out he would go away for a while  he left the door ajar behind him for the moments still left and stood for a while thinking then lamp in hand he descended into the breakfastroom for pen ink and paper he sat for some time in that underground calm nibbling his pen like a harassed and selfconscious schoolboy at last he began  my dear sheilai must tell you to begin with that the change has now all passed away i amas near as man can becompletely myself again and next that i overheard all that was said tonight in the diningroom  im sorry for listening but its no good going over all that now here i am and as you said for alices sake we must make the best of it i am going away for a while to get if i can a chance to quiet down i suppose every one comes sooner or later to a time in life when there is nothing else to be done but just shut ones eyes and blunder on and thats all i can do nowblunder on  he paused and suddenly at the echo of the words in his mind a revulsion of feelingshame and hatred of himself surged up and he tore his letter into tiny pieces once more he began my dear sheila dropped his pen sat on for a long time cold and inert harbouring almost unendurably a pitiful hopeless longing he would write to grisel another day  he leant back in his chair his fingers pressed against his eyelids and clearer than those which myriadhued reality can ever present pictures of the imagination swam up before his eyes it seemed indeed that even now some ghost some revenant of himself was sitting there in the old green churchyard roofed only with a thousand thousand stars the breath of darkness stirred softly on his cheek some little scampering shape slipped by a bird on high cried weirdly solemnly over the globe he shuddered faintly and looked out again into the small lamplit room  here too was quite as inexplicable a coming and going a fly was walking on the table beneath his eyes with the uneasy gait of one that has outlived his hour and most of his companions mice were scampering and shrieking in the empty kitchen and all about him in the viewless air the phantoms of another life passed by unmindful of his motionless body he fell into a lethargy of the senses and only gradually became aware after a while of the strange longdrawn sigh of rain at the window he rose and opened it the night air flowed in chilled with its waters and faintly fragrant of the dust it soothed away all thought for a while he turned back to his chair he would wait until the rain had lulled before starting  a little before midnight the door was softly and with extreme care pushed open and mr bethanys old face with an intense and sharpened scrutiny looked in on the lamplit room and as if still intent on the least sound within the empty walls around him he came near and stooping across the table stared through his spectacles at the sidelong face of his friend so still with hands so lightly laid on the arms of his chair that the old man had need to watch closely to detect in his heavy slumber the slow measured rise and fall of his breast  he turned wearily away muttering a little between an immeasurable relief and a now almost intolerable medley of vexations what was this monstrous web of craiks what had the creature been nodding and ducketing aboutthose whisperings that tattling and what in the end when you were old and sour and outstrategied what was the end to be of this urgent dream called life he sat quietly down and drew his hands over his face pushed his lean knotted fingers up under his spectacles then sat blinkingand softly slowly deciphered the solitary my dear sheila on lawfords notepaper hm he muttered and looked up again at the dark still eyelids that in the strange torpor of sleep might yet be dimly conveying to the dreaming brain behind them some hint of his presence i wish to goodness you wonderful old creature he muttered wagging his head i wish to goodness youd wake up  for some time he sat on listening to the still soft downpour on the fading leaves they dont come to me he said softly again with a tiny smile on his old face its that old medieval craik with a face like a last years rookery and again he sat with head a little sidelong listening now to the infinitesimal sounds of life without now to the thoughts within and ever and again he gazed steadfastly on lawford  at last it seemed in the haunted quietness other thoughts came to him a cloud as it were of youth drew over the wrinkled skin composed the birdlike keenness his head nodded once like lawford in the darkness at widderstone he glanced up sharply across the lamplight at his phantasmagorical shadowy companion heard the steady surge of multitudinous raindrops like the roar of times winged chariot hurrying near then he too with spectacles awry bobbed on in his chair a weary old sentinel on the outskirts of his friends denuded battlefield
