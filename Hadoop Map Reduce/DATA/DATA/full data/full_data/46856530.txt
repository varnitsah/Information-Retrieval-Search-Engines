46856530	illustration     the variable man  by philip k dick  illustrated by ebel      he fixed thingsclocks refrigerators vidsenders and     destinies but he had no business in the future where the     calculators could not handle him he was earths only     hopeand its sure failure   security commissioner reinhart rapidly climbed the front steps and entered the council building council guards stepped quickly aside and he entered the familiar place of great whirring machines his thin face rapt eyes alight with emotion reinhart gazed intently up at the central srb computer studying its reading  straight gain for the last quarter observed kaplan the lab organizer he grinned proudly as if personally responsible not bad commissioner  were catching up to them reinhart retorted but too damn slowly we must finally go overand soon  kaplan was in a talkative mood we design new offensive weapons they counter with improved defenses and nothing is actually made continual improvement but neither we nor centaurus can stop designing long enough to stabilize for production  it will end reinhart stated coldly as soon as terra turns out a weapon for which centaurus can build no defense  every weapon has a defense design and discord immediate obsolescence nothing lasts long enough to  what we count on is the lag reinhart broke in annoyed his hard gray eyes bored into the lab organizer and kaplan slunk back the time lag between our offensive design and their counter development the lag varies he waved impatiently toward the massed banks of srb machines as you well know  at this moment 930 am may 7 2136 the statistical ratio on the srb machines stood at 2117 on the centauran side of the ledger all facts considered the odds favored a successful repulsion by proxima centaurus of a terran military attack the ratio was based on the total information known to the srb machines on a gestalt of the vast flow of data that poured in endlessly from all sectors of the sol and centaurus systems  2117 on the centauran side but a month ago it had been 2418 in the enemys favor things were improving slowly but steadily centaurus older and less virile than terra was unable to match terras rate of technocratic advance terra was pulling ahead  if we went to war now reinhart said thoughtfully we would lose were not far enough along to risk an overt attack a harsh ruthless glow twisted across his handsome features distorting them into a stern mask but the odds are moving in our favor our offensive designs are gradually gaining on their defenses  lets hope the war comes soon kaplan agreed were all on edge this damn waiting  the war would come soon reinhart knew it intuitively the air was full of tension the elan he left the srb rooms and hurried down the corridor to his own elaborately guarded office in the security wing it wouldnt be long he could practically feel the hot breath of destiny on his neckfor him a pleasant feeling his thin lips set in a humorless smile showing an even line of white teeth against his tanned skin it made him feel good all right hed been working at it a long time  first contact a hundred years earlier had ignited instant conflict between proxima centauran outposts and exploring terran raiders flash fights sudden eruptions of fire and energy beams  and then the long dreary years of inaction between enemies where contact required years of travel even at nearly the speed of light the two systems were evenly matched screen against screen warship against power station the centauran empire surrounded terra an iron ring that couldnt be broken rusty and corroded as it was radical new weapons had to be conceived if terra was to break out  through the windows of his office reinhart could see endless buildings and streets terrans hurrying back and forth bright specks that were commute ships little eggs that carried businessmen and whitecollar workers around the huge transport tubes that shot masses of workmen to factories and labor camps from their housing units all these people waiting to break out waiting for the day  reinhart snapped on his vidscreen the confidential channel give me military designs he ordered sharply                                       he sat tense his wiry body taut as the vidscreen warmed into life abruptly he was facing the hulking image of peter sherikov director of the vast network of labs under the ural mountains  sherikovs great bearded features hardened as he recognized reinhart his bushy black eyebrows pulled up in a sullen line what do you want you know im busy we have too much work to do as it is without being bothered bypoliticians  im dropping over your way reinhart answered lazily he adjusted the cuff of his immaculate gray cloak i want a full description of your work and whatever progress youve made  youll find a regular departmental report plate filed in the usual way around your office someplace if youll refer to that youll know exactly what we  im not interested in that i want to see what youre doing and i expect you to be prepared to describe your work fully ill be there shortly half an hour                                       reinhart cut the circuit sherikovs heavy features dwindled and faded reinhart relaxed letting his breath out too bad he had to work with sherikov he had never liked the man the big polish scientist was an individualist refusing to integrate himself with society independent atomistic in outlook he held concepts of the individual as an end diametrically contrary to the accepted organic state weltansicht  but sherikov was the leading research scientist in charge of the military designs department and on designs the whole future of terra depended victory over centaurusor more waiting bottled up in the sol system surrounded by a rotting hostile empire now sinking into ruin and decay yet still strong  reinhart got quickly to his feet and left the office he hurried down the hall and out of the council building  a few minutes later he was heading across the midmorning sky in his highspeed cruiser toward the asiatic landmass the vast ural mountain range toward the military designs labs  sherikov met him at the entrance look here reinhart dont think youre going to order me around im not going to  take it easy reinhart fell into step beside the bigger man they passed through the check and into the auxiliary labs no immediate coercion will be exerted over you or your staff youre free to continue your work as you see fitfor the present lets get this straight my concern is to integrate your work with our total social needs as long as your work is sufficiently productive  reinhart stopped in his tracks  pretty isnt he sherikov said ironically  what the hell is it  icarus we call him remember the greek myth the legend of icarus icarus flew this icarus is going to fly one of these days sherikov shrugged you can examine him if you want i suppose this is what you came here to see  reinhart advanced slowly this is the weapon youve been working on  how does he look  rising up in the center of the chamber was a squat metal cylinder a great ugly cone of dark gray technicians circled around it wiring up the exposed relay banks reinhart caught a glimpse of endless tubes and filaments a maze of wires and terminals and parts crisscrossing each other layer on layer  what is it reinhart perched on the edge of a workbench leaning his big shoulders against the wall an idea of jamison hedgethe same man who developed our instantaneous interstellar vidcasts forty years ago he was trying to find a method of faster than light travel when he was killed destroyed along with most of his work after that ftl research was abandoned it looked as if there were no future in it  wasnt it shown that nothing could travel faster than light  the interstellar vidcasts do no hedge developed a valid ftl drive he managed to propel an object at fifty times the speed of light but as the object gained speed its length began to diminish and its mass increased this was in line with familiar twentiethcentury concepts of massenergy transformation we conjectured that as hedges object gained velocity it would continue to lose length and gain mass until its length became nil and its mass infinite nobody can imagine such an object  go on  but what actually occurred is this hedges object continued to lose length and gain mass until it reached the theoretical limit of velocity the speed of light at that point the object still gaining speed simply ceased to exist having no length it ceased to occupy space it disappeared however the object had not been destroyed it continued on its way gaining momentum each moment moving in an arc across the galaxy away from the sol system hedges object entered some other realm of being beyond our powers of conception the next phase of hedges experiment consisted in a search for some way to slow the ftl object down back to a subftl speed hence back into our universe this counterprinciple was eventually worked out  with what result  the death of hedge and destruction of most of his equipment his experimental object in reentering the spacetime universe came into being in space already occupied by matter possessing an incredible mass just below infinity level hedges object exploded in a titanic cataclysm it was obvious that no space travel was possible with such a drive virtually all space contains some matter to reenter space would bring automatic destruction hedge had found his ftl drive and his counterprinciple but no one before this has been able to put them to any use  reinhart walked over toward the great metal cylinder sherikov jumped down and followed him i dont get it reinhart said you said the principle is no good for space travel  thats right  whats this for then if the ship explodes as soon as it returns to our universe  this is not a ship sherikov grinned slyly icarus is the first practical application of hedges principles icarus is a bomb  so this is our weapon reinhart said a bomb an immense bomb  a bomb moving at a velocity greater than light a bomb which will not exist in our universe the centaurans wont be able to detect or stop it how could they as soon as it passes the speed of light it will cease to existbeyond all detection  but  icarus will be launched outside the lab on the surface he will align himself with proxima centaurus gaining speed rapidly by the time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl100 icarus will be brought back to this universe within centaurus itself the explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its planetsincluding their central hubplanet armun there is no way they can halt icarus once he has been launched no defense is possible nothing can stop him it is a real fact  when will he be ready  sherikovs eyes flickered soon  exactly how soon  the big pole hesitated as a matter of fact theres only one thing holding us back  sherikov led reinhart around to the other side of the lab he pushed a lab guard out of the way  see this he tapped a round globe open at one end the size of a grapefruit this is holding us up  what is it  the central control turret this thing brings icarus back to subftl flight at the correct moment it must be absolutely accurate icarus will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond if the turret does not function exactly icarus will pass out the other side and shoot beyond the centauran system  how near completed is this turret  sherikov hedged uncertainly spreading out his big hands who can say it must be wired with infinitely minute equipmentmicroscope grapples and wires invisible to the naked eye  can you name any completion date  sherikov reached into his coat and brought out a manila folder ive drawn up the data for the srb machines giving a date of completion you can go ahead and feed it i entered ten days as the maximum period the machines can work from that  reinhart accepted the folder cautiously youre sure about the date im not convinced i can trust you sherikov  sherikovs features darkened youll have to take a chance commissioner i dont trust you any more than you trust me i know how much youd like an excuse to get me out of here and one of your puppets in  reinhart studied the huge scientist thoughtfully sherikov was going to be a hard nut to crack designs was responsible to security not the council sherikov was losing groundbut he was still a potential danger stubborn individualistic refusing to subordinate his welfare to the general good  all right reinhart put the folder slowly away in his coat ill feed it but you better be able to come through there cant be any slipups too much hangs on the next few days  if the odds change in our favor are you going to give the mobilization order  yes reinhart stated ill give the order the moment i see the odds change                                       standing in front of the machines reinhart waited nervously for the results it was two oclock in the afternoon the day was warm a pleasant may afternoon outside the building the daily life of the planet went on as usual  as usual not exactly the feeling was in the air an expanding excitement growing every day terra had waited a long time the attack on proxima centaurus had to comeand the sooner the better the ancient centauran empire hemmed in terra bottled the human race up in its one system a vast suffocating net draped across the heavens cutting terra off from the bright diamonds beyond and it had to end  the srb machines whirred the visible combination disappearing for a time no ratio showed reinhart tensed his body rigid he waited  the new ratio appeared  reinhart gasped 76 toward terra  within five minutes the emergency mobilization alert had been flashed to all government departments the council and president duffe had been called to immediate session everything was happening fast  but there was no doubt 76 in terras favor reinhart hurried frantically to get his papers in order in time for the council session  at historesearch the message plate was quickly pulled from the confidential slot and rushed across the central lab to the chief official  look at this fredman dropped the plate on his superiors desk look at it  harper picked up the plate scanning it rapidly sounds like the real thing i didnt think wed live to see it  fredman left the room hurrying down the hall he entered the time bubble office wheres the bubble he demanded looking around  one of the technicians looked slowly up back about two hundred years were coming up with interesting data on the war of 1914 according to material the bubble has already brought up  cut it were through with routine work get the bubble back to the present from now on all equipment has to be free for military work  butthe bubble is regulated automatically  you can bring it back manually  its risky the technician hedged if the emergency requires it i suppose we could take a chance and cut the automatic  the emergency requires everything fredman said feelingly  but the odds might change back margaret duffe president of the council said nervously any minute they can revert  this is our chance reinhart snapped his temper rising what the hells the matter with you weve waited years for this  the council buzzed with excitement margaret duffe hesitated uncertainly her blue eyes clouded with worry i realize the opportunity is here at least statistically but the new odds have just appeared how do we know theyll last they stand on the basis of a single weapon  youre wrong you dont grasp the situation reinhart held himself in check with great effort sherikovs weapon tipped the ratio in our favor but the odds have been moving in our direction for months it was only a question of time the new balance was inevitable sooner or later its not just sherikov hes only one factor in this its all nine planets of the sol systemnot a single man  one of the councilmen stood up the president must be aware the entire planet is eager to end this waiting all our activities for the past eighty years have been directed toward  reinhart moved close to the slender president of the council if you dont approve the war there probably will be mass rioting public reaction will be strong damn strong and you know it  margaret duffe shot him a cold glance you sent out the emergency order to force my hand you were fully aware of what you were doing you knew once the order was out thered be no stopping things  a murmur rushed through the council gaining volume we have to approve the war were committed its too late to turn back  shouts angry voices insistent waves of sound lapped around margaret duffe im as much for the war as anybody she said sharply im only urging moderation an intersystem war is a big thing were going to war because a machine says we have a statistical chance of winning  theres no use starting the war unless we can win it reinhart said the srb machines tell us whether we can win  they tell us our chance of winning they dont guarantee anything  what more can we ask beside a good chance of winning  margaret duffe clamped her jaw together tightly all right i hear all the clamor i wont stand in the way of council approval the vote can go ahead her cold alert eyes appraised reinhart especially since the emergency order has already been sent out to all government departments  good reinhart stepped away with relief then its settled we can finally go ahead with full mobilization  mobilization proceeded rapidly the next fortyeight hours were alive with activity  reinhart attended a policylevel military briefing in the council rooms conducted by fleet commander carleton  you can see our strategy carleton said he traced a diagram on the blackboard with a wave of his hand sherikov states itll take eight more days to complete the ftl bomb during that time the fleet we have near the centauran system will take up positions as the bomb goes off the fleet will begin operations against the remaining centauran ships many will no doubt survive the blast but with armun gone we should be able to handle them  reinhart took commander carletons place i can report on the economic situation every factory on terra is converted to arms production with armun out of the way we should be able to promote mass insurrection among the centauran colonies an intersystem empire is hard to maintain even with ships that approach light speed local warlords should pop up all over the place we want to have weapons available for them and ships starting now to reach them in time eventually we hope to provide a unifying principle around which the colonies can all collect our interest is more economic than political they can have any kind of government they want as long as they act as supply areas for us as our eight system planets act now  carleton resumed his report once the centauran fleet has been scattered we can begin the crucial stage of the war the landing of men and supplies from the ships we have waiting in all key areas throughout the centauran system in this stage  reinhart moved away it was hard to believe only two days had passed since the mobilization order had been sent out the whole system was alive functioning with feverish activity countless problems were being solvedbut much remained  he entered the lift and ascended to the srb room curious to see if there had been any change in the machines reading he found it the same so far so good did the centaurans know about icarus no doubt but there wasnt anything they could do about it at least not in eight days  kaplan came over to reinhart sorting a new batch of data that had come in the lab organizer searched through his data an amusing item came in it might interest you he handed a message plate to reinhart  it was from historesearch                              may 9 2136      this is to report that in bringing the research time bubble up     to the present the manual return was used for the first time     therefore a clean break was not made and a quantity of     material from the past was brought forward this material     included an individual from the early twentieth century who     escaped from the lab immediately he has not yet been taken     into protective custody historesearch regrets this incident     but attributes it to the emergency                                                          e fredman  reinhart handed the plate back to kaplan interesting a man from the pasthauled into the middle of the biggest war the universe has seen  strange things happen i wonder what the machines will think  hard to say probably nothing reinhart left the room and hurried along the corridor to his own office  as soon as he was inside he called sherikov on the vidscreen using the confidential line  the poles heavy features appeared good day commissioner hows the war effort  fine hows the turret wiring proceeding  a faint frown flickered across sherikovs face as a matter of fact commissioner  whats the matter reinhart said sharply  sherikov floundered you know how these things are ive taken my crew off it and tried robot workers they have greater dexterity but they cant make decisions this calls for more than mere dexterity this calls for he searched for the word for an artist  reinharts face hardened listen sherikov you have eight days left to complete the bomb the data given to the srb machines contained that information the 76 ratio is based on that estimate if you dont come through  sherikov twisted in embarrassment dont get excited commissioner well complete it  i hope so call me as soon as its done reinhart snapped off the connection if sherikov let them down hed have him taken out and shot the whole war depended on the ftl bomb  the vidscreen glowed again reinhart snapped it on kaplans face formed on it the lab organizers face was pale and frozen commissioner you better come up to the srb office somethings happened  what is it  ill show you  alarmed reinhart hurried out of his office and down the corridor he found kaplan standing in front of the srb machines whats the story reinhart demanded he glanced down at the reading it was unchanged  kaplan held up a message plate nervously a moment ago i fed this into the machines after i saw the results i quickly removed it its that item i showed you from historesearch about the man from the past  what happened when you fed it  kaplan swallowed unhappily ill show you ill do it again exactly as before he fed the plate into a moving intake belt watch the visible figures kaplan muttered  reinhart watched tense and rigid for a moment nothing happened 76 continued to show then  the figures disappeared the machines faltered new figures showed briefly 424 for centaurus reinhart gasped suddenly sick with apprehension but the figures vanished new figures appeared 1638 for centaurus then 4886 7915 in terras favor then nothing the machines whirred but nothing happened  nothing at all no figures only a blank  whats it mean reinhart muttered dazed  its fantastic we didnt think this could  whats happened  the machines arent able to handle the item no reading can come its data they cant integrate they cant use it for prediction material and it throws off all their other figures  why  itsits a variable kaplan was shaking whitelipped and pale something from which no inference can be made the man from the past the machines cant deal with him the variable man     ii   thomas cole was sharpening a knife with his whetstone when the tornado hit  the knife belonged to the lady in the big green house every time cole came by with his fixit cart the lady had something to be sharpened once in awhile she gave him a cup of coffee hot black coffee from an old bent pot he liked that fine he enjoyed good coffee  the day was drizzly and overcast business had been bad an automobile had scared his two horses on bad days less people were outside and he had to get down from the cart and go to ring doorbells  but the man in the yellow house had given him a dollar for fixing his electric refrigerator nobody else had been able to fix it not even the factory man the dollar would go a long way a dollar was a lot  he knew it was a tornado even before it hit him everything was silent he was bent over his whetstone the reins between his knees absorbed in his work  he had done a good job on the knife he was almost finished he spat on the blade and was holding it up to seeand then the tornado came  all at once it was there completely around him nothing but grayness he and the cart and horses seemed to be in a calm spot in the center of the tornado they were moving in a great silence gray mist everywhere  and while he was wondering what to do and how to get the ladys knife back to her all at once there was a bump and the tornado tipped him over sprawled out on the ground the horses screamed in fear struggling to pick themselves up cole got quickly to his feet  where was he  the grayness was gone white walls stuck up on all sides a deep light gleamed down not daylight but something like it the team was pulling the cart on its side dragging it along tools and equipment falling out cole righted the cart leaping up onto the seat  and for the first time saw the people  men with astonished white faces in some sort of uniforms shouts noise and confusion and a feeling of danger  cole headed the team toward the door hoofs thundered steel against steel as they pounded through the doorway scattering the astonished men in all directions he was out in a wide hall a building like a hospital  the hall divided more men were coming spilling from all sides  shouting and milling in excitement like white ants something cut past him a beam of dark violet it seared off a corner of the cart leaving the wood smoking  cole felt fear he kicked at the terrified horses they reached a big door crashing wildly against it the door gaveand they were outside bright sunlight blinking down on them for a sickening second the cart tilted almost turning over then the horses gained speed racing across an open field toward a distant line of green cole holding tightly to the reins  behind him the little whitefaced men had come out and were standing in a group gesturing frantically he could hear their faint shrill shouts  but he had got away he was safe he slowed the horses down and began to breathe again  the woods were artificial some kind of park but the park was wild and overgrown a dense jungle of twisted plants everything growing in confusion  the park was empty no one was there by the position of the sun he could tell it was either early morning or late afternoon the smell of the flowers and grass the dampness of the leaves indicated morning it had been late afternoon when the tornado had picked him up and the sky had been overcast and cloudy  cole considered clearly he had been carried a long way the hospital the men with white faces the odd lighting the accented words he had caughteverything indicated he was no longer in nebraskamaybe not even in the united states  some of his tools had fallen out and gotten lost along the way cole collected everything that remained sorting them running his fingers over each tool with affection some of the little chisels and wood gouges were gone the bit box had opened and most of the smaller bits had been lost he gathered up those that remained and replaced them tenderly in the box he took a keyhole saw down and with an oil rag wiped it carefully and replaced it  above the cart the sun rose slowly in the sky cole peered up his horny hand over his eyes a big man stoopshouldered his chin gray and stubbled his clothes wrinkled and dirty but his eyes were clear a pale blue and his hands were finely made  he could not stay in the park they had seen him ride that way they would be looking for him  far above something shot rapidly across the sky a tiny black dot moving with incredible haste a second dot followed the two dots were gone almost before he saw them they were utterly silent  cole frowned perturbed the dots made him uneasy he would have to keep movingand looking for food his stomach was already beginning to rumble and groan  work there was plenty he could do gardening sharpening grinding repair work on machines and clocks fixing all kinds of household things even painting and odd jobs and carpentry and chores  he could do anything anything people wanted done for a meal and pocket money  thomas cole urged the team into life moving forward he sat hunched over in the seat watching intently as the fixit cart rolled slowly across the tangled grass through the jungle of trees and flowers                                       reinhart hurried racing his cruiser at top speed followed by a second ship a military escort the ground sped by below him a blur of gray and green  the remains of new york lay spread out a twisted blunted ruin overgrown with weeds and grass the great atomic wars of the twentieth century had turned virtually the whole seaboard area into an endless waste of slag  slag and weeds below him and then the sudden tangle that had been central park  historesearch came into sight reinhart swooped down bringing his cruiser to rest at the small supply field behind the main buildings  harper the chief official of the department came quickly over as soon as reinharts ship landed  frankly we dont understand why you consider this matter important harper said uneasily  reinhart shot him a cold glance ill be the judge of whats important are you the one who gave the order to bring the bubble back manually  fredman gave the actual order in line with your directive to have all facilities ready for  reinhart headed toward the entrance of the research building where is fredman  inside  i want to see him lets go  fredman met them inside he greeted reinhart calmly showing no emotion sorry to cause you trouble commissioner we were trying to get the station in order for the war we wanted the bubble back as quickly as possible he eyed reinhart curiously no doubt the man and his cart will soon be picked up by your police  i want to know everything that happened in exact detail  fredman shifted uncomfortably theres not much to tell i gave the order to have the automatic setting canceled and the bubble brought back manually at the moment the signal reached it the bubble was passing through the spring of 1913 as it broke loose it tore off a piece of ground on which this person and his cart were located the person naturally was brought up to the present inside the bubble  didnt any of your instruments tell you the bubble was loaded  we were too excited to take any readings half an hour after the manual control was thrown the bubble materialized in the observation room it was deenergized before anyone noticed what was inside we tried to stop him but he drove the cart out into the hall bowling us out of the way the horses were in a panic  what kind of cart was it  there was some kind of sign on it painted in black letters on both sides no one saw what it was  go ahead what happened then  somebody fired a slemray after him but it missed the horses carried him out of the building and onto the grounds by the time we reached the exit the cart was half way to the park  reinhart reflected if hes still in the park we should have him shortly but we must be careful he was already starting back toward his ship leaving fredman behind harper fell in beside him  reinhart halted by his ship he beckoned some government guards over put the executive staff of this department under arrest ill have them tried on a treason count later on he smiled ironically as harpers face blanched sickly pale theres a war going on youll be lucky if you get off alive  reinhart entered his ship and left the surface rising rapidly into the sky a second ship followed after him a military escort reinhart flew high above the sea of gray slag the unrecovered waste area he passed over a sudden square of green set in the ocean of gray reinhart gazed back at it until it was gone  central park he could see police ships racing through the sky ships and transports loaded with troops heading toward the square of green on the ground some heavy guns and surface cars rumbled along lines of black approaching the park from all sides  they would have the man soon but meanwhile the srb machines were blank and on the srb machines readings the whole war depended  about noon the cart reached the edge of the park cole rested for a moment allowing the horses time to crop at the thick grass the silent expanse of slag amazed him what had happened nothing stirred no buildings no sign of life grass and weeds poked up occasionally through it breaking the flat surface here and there but even so the sight gave him an uneasy chill  cole drove the cart slowly out onto the slag studying the sky above him there was nothing to hide him now that he was out of the park the slag was bare and uniform like the ocean if he were spotted  a horde of tiny black dots raced across the sky coming rapidly closer presently they veered to the right and disappeared more planes wingless metal planes he watched them go driving slowly on  half an hour later something appeared ahead cole slowed the cart down peering to see the slag came to an end he had reached its limits ground appeared dark soil and grass weeds grew everywhere ahead of him beyond the end of the slag was a line of buildings houses of some sort or sheds  houses probably but not like any he had ever seen  the houses were uniform all exactly the same like little green shells rows of them several hundred there was a little lawn in front of each lawn a path a front porch bushes in a meager row around each house but the houses were all alike and very small  little green shells in precise even rows he urged the cart cautiously forward toward the houses  no one seemed to be around he entered a street between two rows of houses the hoofs of his two horses sounding loudly in the silence he was in some kind of town but there were no dogs or children everything was neat and silent like a model an exhibit it made him uncomfortable  a young man walking along the pavement gaped at him in wonder an oddlydressed youth in a togalike cloak that hung down to his knees a single piece of fabric and sandals  or what looked like sandals both the cloak and the sandals were of some strange halfluminous material it glowed faintly in the sunlight metallic rather than cloth  a woman was watering flowers at the edge of a lawn she straightened up as his team of horses came near her eyes widened in astonishmentand then fear her mouth fell open in a soundless o and her sprinkling can slipped from her fingers and rolled silently onto the lawn  cole blushed and turned his head quickly away the woman was scarcely dressed he flicked the reins and urged the horses to hurry  behind him the woman still stood he stole a brief hasty look backand then shouted hoarsely to his team ears scarlet he had seen right she wore only a pair of translucent shorts nothing else a mere fragment of the same halfluminous material that glowed and sparkled the rest of her small body was utterly naked  he slowed the team down she had been pretty brown hair and eyes deep red lips quite a good figure slender waist downy legs bare and supple full breasts he clamped the thought furiously off he had to get to work business  cole halted the fixit cart and leaped down onto the pavement he selected a house at random and approached it cautiously the house was attractive it had a certain simple beauty but it looked frailand exactly like the others  he stepped up on the porch there was no bell he searched for it running his hand uneasily over the surface of the door all at once there was a click a sharp snap on a level with his eyes cole glanced up startled a lens was vanishing as the door section slid over it he had been photographed  while he was wondering what it meant the door swung suddenly open a man filled up the entrance a big man in a tan uniform blocking the way ominously  what do you want the man demanded  im looking for work cole murmured any kind of work i can do anything fix any kind of thing i repair broken objects things that need mending his voice trailed off uncertainly anything at all  apply to the placement department of the federal activities control board the man said crisply you know all occupational therapy is handled through them he eyed cole curiously why have you got on those ancient clothes  ancient why i  the man gazed past him at the fixit cart and the two dozing horses whats that what are those two animals horses the man rubbed his jaw studying cole intently thats strange he said  strange cole murmured uneasily why  there havent been any horses for over a century all the horses were wiped out during the fifth atomic war thats why its strange  cole tensed suddenly alert there was something in the mans eyes a hardness a piercing look cole moved back off the porch onto the path he had to be careful something was wrong  ill be going he murmured  there havent been any horses for over a hundred years the man came toward cole who are you why are you dressed up like that where did you get that vehicle and pair of horses  ill be going cole repeated moving away  the man whipped something from his belt a thin metal tube he stuck it toward cole  it was a rolledup paper a thin sheet of metal in the form of a tube words some kind of script he could not make any of them out the mans picture rows of numbers figures  im director winslow the man said federal stockpile conservation you better talk fast or therell be a security car here in five minutes  cole movedfast he raced head down back along the path to the cart toward the street  something hit him a wall of force throwing him down on his face he sprawled in a heap numb and dazed his body ached vibrating wildly out of control waves of shock rolled over him gradually diminishing  he got shakily to his feet his head spun he was weak shattered trembling violently the man was coming down the walk after him cole pulled himself onto the cart gasping and retching the horses jumped into life cole rolled over against the seat sick with the motion of the swaying cart  he caught hold of the reins and managed to drag himself up in a sitting position the cart gained speed turning a corner houses flew past cole urged the team weakly drawing great shuddering breaths houses and streets a blur of motion as the cart flew faster and faster along  then he was leaving the town leaving the neat little houses behind he was on some sort of highway big buildings factories on both sides of the highway figures men watching in astonishment  after awhile the factories fell behind cole slowed the team down what had the man meant fifth atomic war horses destroyed it didnt make sense and they had things he knew nothing about force fields planes without wingssoundless  cole reached around in his pockets he found the identification tube the man had handed him in the excitement he had carried it off he unrolled the tube slowly and began to study it the writing was strange to him  for a long time he studied the tube then gradually he became aware of something something in the top righthand corner  a date october 6 2128  coles vision blurred everything spun and wavered around him october 2128 could it be  but he held the paper in his hand thin metal paper like foil and it had to be it said so right in the corner printed on the paper itself  cole rolled the tube up slowly numbed with shock two hundred years it didnt seem possible but things were beginning to make sense he was in the future two hundred years in the future  while he was mulling this over the swift black security ship appeared overhead diving rapidly toward the horsedrawn cart as it moved slowly along the road  reinharts vidscreen buzzed he snapped it quickly on yes  report from security  put it through reinhart waited tensely as the lines locked in place the screen relit  this is dixon western regional command the officer cleared his throat shuffling his message plates the man from the past has been reported moving away from the new york area  which side of your net  outside he evaded the net around central park by entering one of the small towns at the rim of the slag area  evaded  we assumed he would avoid the towns naturally the net failed to encompass any of the towns  reinharts jaw stiffened go on  he entered the town of petersville a few minutes before the net closed around the park we burned the park level but naturally found nothing he had already gone an hour later we received a report from a resident in petersville an official of the stockpile conservation department the man from the past had come to his door looking for work winslow the official engaged him in conversation trying to hold onto him but he escaped driving his cart off winslow called security right away but by then it was too late  report to me as soon as anything more comes in we must have himand damn soon reinhart snapped the screen off it died quickly  he sat back in his chair waiting  cole saw the shadow of the security ship he reacted at once a second after the shadow passed over him cole was out of the cart running and falling he rolled twisting and turning pulling his body as far away from the cart as possible  there was a blinding roar and flash of white light a hot wind rolled over cole picking him up and tossing him like a leaf he shut his eyes letting his body relax he bounced falling and striking the ground gravel and stones tore into his face his knees the palms of his hands  cole cried out shrieking in pain his body was on fire he was being consumed incinerated by the blinding white orb of fire the orb expanded growing in size swelling like some monstrous sun twisted and bloated the end had come there was no hope he gritted his teeth  the greedy orb faded dying down it sputtered and winked out blackening into ash the air reeked a bitter acrid smell his clothes were burning and smoking the ground under him was hot baked dry seared by the blast but he was alive at least for awhile  cole opened his eyes slowly the cart was gone a great hole gaped where it had been a shattered sore in the center of the highway an ugly cloud hung above the hole black and ominous far above the wingless plane circled watching for any signs of life  cole lay breathing shallowly slowly time passed the sun moved across the sky with agonizing slowness it was perhaps four in the afternoon cole calculated mentally in three hours it would be dark if he could stay alive until then  had the plane seen him leap from the cart  he lay without moving the late afternoon sun beat down on him he felt sick nauseated and feverish his mouth was dry  some ants ran over his outstretched hand gradually the immense black cloud was beginning to drift away dispersing into a formless blob  the cart was gone the thought lashed against him pounding at his brain mixing with his labored pulsebeat gone destroyed nothing but ashes and debris remained the realization dazed him  finally the plane finished its circling winging its way toward the horizon at last it vanished the sky was clear  cole got unsteadily to his feet he wiped his face shakily his body ached and trembled he spat a couple times trying to clear his mouth the plane would probably send in a report people would be coming to look for him where could he go  to his right a line of hills rose up a distant green mass maybe he could reach them he began to walk slowly he had to be very careful they were looking for himand they had weapons incredible weapons  he would be lucky to still be alive when the sun set his team and fixit cart were goneand all his tools cole reached into his pockets searching through them hopefully he brought out some small screwdrivers a little pair of cutting pliers some wire some solder the whetstone and finally the ladys knife  only a few small tools remained he had lost everything else but without the cart he was safer harder to spot they would have more trouble finding him on foot  cole hurried along crossing the level fields toward the distant range of hills  the call came through to reinhart almost at once dixons features formed on the vidscreen i have a further report commissioner dixon scanned the plate good news the man from the past was sighted moving away from petersville along highway 13 at about ten miles an hour on his horsedrawn cart our ship bombed him immediately  diddid you get him  the pilot reports no sign of life after the blast  reinharts pulse almost stopped he sank back in his chair then hes dead  actually we wont know for certain until we can examine the debris a surface car is speeding toward the spot we should have the complete report in a short time well notify you as soon as the information comes in  reinhart reached out and cut the screen it faded into darkness had they got the man from the past or had he escaped again werent they ever going to get him couldnt he be captured and meanwhile the srb machines were silent showing nothing at all  reinhart sat brooding waiting impatiently for the report of the surface car to come in                                       it was evening  come on steven shouted running frantically after his brother come on back  catch me earl ran and ran down the side of the hill over behind a military storage depot along a neotex fence jumping finally down into mrs norris back yard  steven hurried after his brother sobbing for breath shouting and gasping as he ran come back you come back with that  whats he got sally tate demanded stepping out suddenly to block stevens way  illustration  steven halted his chest rising and falling hes got my intersystem vidsender his small face twisted with rage and misery he better give it back  earl came circling around from the right in the warm gloom of evening he was almost invisible here i am he announced what you going to do  steven glared at him hotly his eyes made out the square box in earls hands you give that back oror ill tell dad  earl laughed make me  dadll make you  you better give it to him sally said  catch me earl started off steven pushed sally out of the way lashing wildly at his brother he collided with him throwing him sprawling the box fell from earls hands it skidded to the pavement crashing into the side of a guidelight post  earl and steven picked themselves up slowly they gazed down at the broken box  see steven shrilled tears filling his eyes see what you did  you did it you pushed into me  you did it steven bent down and picked up the box he carried it over to the guidelight sitting down on the curb to examine it  earl came slowly over if you hadnt pushed me it wouldnt have got broken  night was descending rapidly the line of hills rising above the town were already lost in darkness a few lights had come on here and there the evening was warm a surface car slammed its doors some place off in the distance in the sky ships droned back and forth weary commuters coming home from work in the big underground factory units  thomas cole came slowly toward the three children grouped around the guidelight he moved with difficulty his body sore and bent with fatigue night had come but he was not safe yet  he was tired exhausted and hungry he had walked a long way and he had to have something to eatsoon  a few feet from the children cole stopped they were all intent and absorbed by the box on stevens knees suddenly a hush fell over the children earl looked up slowly  in the dim light the big stooped figure of thomas cole seemed extra menacing his long arms hung down loosely at his sides his face was lost in shadow his body was shapeless indistinct a big unformed statue standing silently a few feet away unmoving in the halfdarkness  who are you earl demanded his voice low  what do you want sally said the children edged away nervously get away  cole came toward them he bent down a little the beam from the guidelight crossed his features lean prominent nose beaklike faded blue eyes  steven scrambled to his feet clutching the vidsender box you get out of here  wait cole smiled crookedly at them his voice was dry and raspy what do you have there he pointed with his long slender fingers the box youre holding  the children were silent finally steven stirred its my intersystem vidsender  only it doesnt work sally said  earl broke it steven glared at his brother bitterly earl threw it down and broke it  cole smiled a little he sank down wearily on the edge of the curb sighing with relief he had been walking too long his body ached with fatigue he was hungry and tired for a long time he sat wiping perspiration from his neck and face too exhausted to speak  who are you sally demanded at last why do you have on those funny clothes where did you come from  where cole looked around at the children from a long way off a long way he shook his head slowly from side to side trying to clear it  whats your therapy earl said  my therapy  what do you do where do you work  cole took a deep breath and let it out again slowly i fix things all kinds of things any kind  earl sneered nobody fixes things when they break you throw them away  cole didnt hear him sudden need had roused him getting him suddenly to his feet you know any work i can find he demanded things i could do i can fix anything clocks typewriters refrigerators pots and pans leaks in the roof i can fix anything there is  steven held out his intersystem vidsender fix this  there was silence slowly coles eyes focussed on the box that  my sender earl broke it  cole took the box slowly he turned it over holding it up to the light he frowned concentrating on it his long slender fingers moved carefully over the surface exploring it  hell steal it earl said suddenly  no cole shook his head vaguely im reliable his sensitive fingers found the studs that held the box together he depressed the studs pushing them expertly in the box opened revealing its complex interior  he got it open sally whispered  give it back steven demanded a little frightened he held out his hand i want it back  the three children watched cole apprehensively cole fumbled in his pocket slowly he brought out his tiny screwdrivers and pliers he laid them in a row beside him he made no move to return the box  i want it back steven said feebly  cole looked up his faded blue eyes took in the sight of the three children standing before him in the gloom ill fix it for you you said you wanted it fixed  i want it back steven stood on one foot then the other torn by doubt and indecision can you really fix it can you make it work again  yes  all right fix it for me then  a sly smile flickered across coles tired face now wait a minute if i fix it will you bring me something to eat im not fixing it for nothing  something to eat  food i need hot food maybe some coffee  steven nodded yes ill get it for you  cole relaxed fine thats fine he turned his attention back to the box resting between his knees then ill fix it for you ill fix it for you good  his fingers flew working and twisting tracing down wires and relays exploring and examining finding out about the intersystem vidsender discovering how it worked  steven slipped into the house through the emergency door he made his way to the kitchen with great care walking on tiptoe he punched the kitchen controls at random his heart beating excitedly the stove began to whirr purring into life meter readings came on crossing toward the completion marks  presently the stove opened sliding out a tray of steaming dishes the mechanism clicked off dying into silence steven grabbed up the contents of the tray filling his arms he carried everything down the hall out the emergency door and into the yard the yard was dark steven felt his way carefully along  he managed to reach the guidelight without dropping anything at all  thomas cole got slowly to his feet as steven came into view here steven said he dumped the food onto the curb gasping for breath heres the food is it finished  cole held out the intersystem vidsender its finished it was pretty badly smashed  earl and sally gazed up wideeyed does it work sally asked  of course not earl stated how could it work he couldnt  turn it on sally nudged steven eagerly see if it works  steven was holding the box under the light examining the switches he clicked the main switch on the indicator light gleamed it lights up steven said  say something into it  steven spoke into the box hello hello this is operator 6z75 calling can you hear me this is operator 6z75 can you hear me  in the darkness away from the beam of the guidelight thomas cole sat crouched over the food he ate gratefully silently it was good food well cooked and seasoned he drank a container of orange juice and then a sweet drink he didnt recognize most of the food was strange to him but he didnt care he had walked a long way and he was plenty hungry and he still had a long way to go before morning he had to be deep in the hills before the sun came up instinct told him that he would be safe among the trees and tangled growthat least as safe as he could hope for  he ate rapidly intent on the food he did not look up until he was finished then he got slowly to his feet wiping his mouth with the back of his hand  the three children were standing around in a circle operating the intersystem vidsender he watched them for a few minutes none of them looked up from the small box they were intent absorbed in what they were doing  well cole said at last does it work all right  after a moment steven looked up at him there was a strange expression on his face he nodded slowly yes yes it works it works fine  cole grunted all right he turned and moved away from the light thats fine  the children watched silently until the figure of thomas cole had completely disappeared slowly they turned and looked at each other then down at the box in stevens hands they gazed at the box in growing awe awe mixed with dawning fear  steven turned and edged toward his house ive got to show it to my dad he murmured dazed hes got to know somebodys got to know     iii   eric reinhart examined the vidsender box carefully turning it around and around  then he did escape from the blast dixon admitted reluctantly he must have leaped from the cart just before the concussion  reinhart nodded he escaped he got away from youtwice he pushed the vidsender box away and leaned abruptly toward the man standing uneasily in front of his desk whats your name again  elliot richard elliot  and your sons name  steven  it was last night this happened  about eight oclock  go on  steven came into the house he acted queerly he was carrying his intersystem vidsender elliot pointed at the box on reinharts desk that he was nervous and excited i asked what was wrong for awhile he couldnt tell me he was quite upset then he showed me the vidsender elliot took a deep shaky breath i could see right away it was different you see im an electrical engineer i had opened it once before to put in a new battery i had a fairly good idea how it should look elliot hesitated commissioner it had been changed a lot of the wiring was different moved around relays connected differently some parts were missing new parts had been jury rigged out of old then i discovered the thing that made me call security the vidsenderit really worked  worked  you see it never was anything more than a toy with a range of a few city blocks so the kids could call back and forth from their rooms like a sort of portable vidscreen commissioner i tried out the vidsender pushing the call button and speaking into the microphone ii got a ship of the line a battleship operating beyond proxima centaurusover eight light years away as far out as the actual vidsenders operate then i called security right away  for a time reinhart was silent finally he tapped the box lying on the desk you got a ship of the linewith this  thats right  how big are the regular vidsenders  dixon supplied the information as big as a twentyton safe  thats what i thought reinhart waved his hand impatiently all right elliot thanks for turning the information over to us thats all  security police led elliot outside the office  reinhart and dixon looked at each other this is bad reinhart said harshly he has some ability some kind of mechanical ability genius perhaps to do a thing like this look at the period he came from dixon the early part of the twentieth century before the wars began that was a unique period there was a certain vitality a certain ability it was a period of incredible growth and discovery edison pasteur burbank the wright brothers inventions and machines people had an uncanny ability with machines a kind of intuition about machineswhich we dont have  you mean  i mean a person like this coming into our own time is bad in itself war or no war hes too different hes oriented along different lines he has abilities we lack this fixing skill of his it throws us off out of kilter and with the war  now im beginning to understand why the srb machines couldnt factor him its impossible for us to understand this kind of person winslow says he asked for work any kind of work the man said he could do anything fix anything do you understand what that means  no dixon said what does it mean  can any of us fix anything no none of us can do that were specialized each of us has his own line his own work i understand my work you understand yours the tendency in evolution is toward greater and greater specialization mans society is an ecology that forces adaptation to it continual complexity makes it impossible for any of us to know anything outside our own personal fieldi cant follow the work of the man sitting at the next desk over from me too much knowledge has piled up in each field and theres too many fields  this man is different he can fix anything do anything he doesnt work with knowledge with sciencethe classified accumulation of facts he knows nothing its not in his head a form of learning he works by intuitionhis power is in his hands not his head jackofalltrades his hands like a painter an artist in his handsand he cuts across our lives like a knifeblade  and the other problem  the other problem is that this man this variable man has escaped into the albertine mountain range now well have one hell of a time finding him hes cleverin a strange kind of way like some sort of animal hes going to be hard to catch  reinhart sent dixon out after a moment he gathered up the handful of reports on his desk and carried them up to the srb room the srb room was closed up sealed off by a ring of armed security police standing angrily before the ring of police was peter sherikov his beard waggling angrily his immense hands on his hips  whats going on sherikov demanded why cant i go in and peep at the odds  sorry reinhart cleared the police aside come inside with me ill explain the doors opened for them and they entered behind them the doors shut and the ring of police formed outside what brings you away from your lab reinhart asked  sherikov shrugged several things i wanted to see you i called you on the vidphone and they said you werent available i thought maybe something had happened whats up  ill tell you in a few minutes reinhart called kaplan over here are some new items feed them in right away i want to see if the machines can total them  certainly commissioner kaplan took the message plates and placed them on an intake belt the machines hummed into life  well know soon reinhart said half aloud  sherikov shot him a keen glance well know what let me in on it whats taking place  were in trouble for twentyfour hours the machines havent given any reading at all nothing but a blank a total blank  sherikovs features registered disbelief but that isnt possible some odds exist at all times  the odds exist but the machines arent able to calculate them  why not  because a variable factor has been introduced a factor which the machines cant handle they cant make any predictions from it  cant they reject it sherikov said slyly cant they justjust ignore it  no it exists as real data therefore it affects the balance of the material the sum total of all other available data to reject it would be to give a false reading the machines cant reject any data thats known to be true  sherikov pulled moodily at his black beard i would be interested in knowing what sort of factor the machines cant handle i thought they could take in all data pertaining to contemporary reality  they can this factor has nothing to do with contemporary reality thats the trouble historesearch in bringing its time bubble back from the past got overzealous and cut the circuit too quickly the bubble came back loadedwith a man from the twentieth century a man from the past  i see a man from two centuries ago the big pole frowned and with a radically different weltanschauung no connection with our present society not integrated along our lines at all therefore the srb machines are perplexed  reinhart grinned perplexed i suppose so in any case they cant do anything with the data about this man the variable man no statistics at all have been thrown upno predictions have been made and it knocks everything else out of phase were dependent on the constant showing of these odds the whole war effort is geared around them  the horseshoe nail remember the old poem for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of the shoe the horse was lost for want of the horse the rider was lost for want  exactly a single factor coming along like this one single individual can throw everything off it doesnt seem possible that one person could knock an entire society out of balancebut apparently it is  what are you doing about this man  the security police are organized in a mass search for him  results  he escaped into the albertine mountain range last night itll be hard to find him we must expect him to be loose for another fortyeight hours itll take that long for us to arrange the annihilation of the range area perhaps a trifle longer and meanwhile  ready commissioner kaplan interrupted the new totals  the srb machines had finished factoring the new data reinhart and sherikov hurried to take their places before the view windows  for a moment nothing happened then odds were put up locking in place  sherikov gasped 992 in favor of terra thats wonderful now we  the odds vanished new odds took their places 974 in favor of centaurus sherikov groaned in astonished dismay wait reinhart said to him i dont think theyll last  the odds vanished a rapid series of odds shot across the screen a violent stream of numbers changing almost instantly at last the machines became silent  nothing showed no odds no totals at all the view windows were blank  you see reinhart murmured the same damn thing  sherikov pondered reinhart youre too anglosaxon too impulsive be more slavic this man will be captured and destroyed within two days you said so yourself meanwhile were all working night and day on the war effort the warfleet is waiting near proxima taking up positions for the attack on the centaurans all our war plants are going full blast by the time the attack date comes well have a fullsized invasion army ready to take off for the long trip to the centauran colonies the whole terran population has been mobilized the eight supply planets are pouring in material all this is going on day and night even without odds showing long before the attack comes this man will certainly be dead and the machines will be able to show odds again  reinhart considered but it worries me a man like that out in the open loose a man who cant be predicted it goes against science weve been making statistical reports on society for two centuries we have immense files of data the machines are able to predict what each person and group will do at a given time in a given situation but this man is beyond all prediction hes a variable its contrary to science  the indeterminate particle  whats that  the particle that moves in such a way that we cant predict what position it will occupy at a given second random the random particle  exactly itsits unnatural  sherikov laughed sarcastically dont worry about it commissioner the man will be captured and things will return to their natural state youll be able to predict people again like laboratory rats in a maze by the waywhy is this room guarded  i dont want anyone to know the machines show no totals its dangerous to the war effort  margaret duffe for example  reinhart nodded reluctantly theyre too timid these parliamentarians if they discover we have no srb odds theyll want to shut down the war planning and go back to waiting  too slow for you commissioner laws debates council meetings discussions saves a lot of time if one man has all the power one man to tell people what to do think for them lead them around  reinhart eyed the big pole critically that reminds me how is icarus coming have you continued to make progress on the control turret  a scowl crossed sherikovs broad features the control turret he waved his big hand vaguely i would say its coming along all right well catch up in time  instantly reinhart became alert catch up you mean youre still behind  somewhat a little but well catch up sherikov retreated toward the door lets go down to the cafeteria and have a cup of coffee you worry too much commissioner take things more in your stride  i suppose youre right the two men walked out into the hall im on edge this variable man i cant get him out of my mind  has he done anything yet  nothing important rewired a childs toy a toy vidsender  oh sherikov showed interest what do you mean what did he do  ill show you reinhart led sherikov down the hall to his office they entered and reinhart locked the door he handed sherikov the toy and roughed in what cole had done a strange look crossed sherikovs face he found the studs on the box and depressed them the box opened the big pole sat down at the desk and began to study the interior of the box youre sure it was the man from the past who rewired this  of course on the spot the boy damaged it playing the variable man came along and the boy asked him to fix it he fixed it all right  incredible sherikovs eyes were only an inch from the wiring such tiny relays how could he  what  nothing sherikov got abruptly to his feet closing the box carefully can i take this along to my lab id like to analyze it more fully  of course but why  no special reason lets go get our coffee sherikov headed toward the door you say you expect to capture this man in a day or so  kill him not capture him weve got to eliminate him as a piece of data were assembling the attack formations right now no slipups this time were in the process of setting up a crossbombing pattern to level the entire albertine range he must be destroyed within the next fortyeight hours  sherikov nodded absently of course he murmured a preoccupied expression still remained on his broad features i understand perfectly                                       thomas cole crouched over the fire he had built warming his hands it was almost morning the sky was turning violet gray the mountain air was crisp and chill cole shivered and pulled himself closer to the fire  the heat felt good against his hands his hands he gazed down at them glowing yellowred in the firelight the nails were black and chipped warts and endless calluses on each finger and the palms but they were good hands the fingers were long and tapered he respected them although in some ways he didnt understand them  cole was deep in thought meditating over his situation he had been in the mountains two nights and a day the first night had been the worst stumbling and falling making his way uncertainly up the steep slopes through the tangled brush and undergrowth  but when the sun came up he was safe deep in the mountains between two great peaks and by the time the sun had set again he had fixed himself up a shelter and a means of making a fire now he had a neat little box trap operated by a plaited grass rope and pit a notched stake one rabbit already hung by his hind legs and the trap was waiting for another  the sky turned from violet gray to a deep cold gray a metallic color the mountains were silent and empty far off some place a bird sang its voice echoing across the vast slopes and ravines other birds began to sing off to his right something crashed through the brush an animal pushing its way along  day was coming his second day cole got to his feet and began to unfasten the rabbit time to eat and then after that he had no plans he knew instinctively that he could keep himself alive indefinitely with the tools he had retained and the genius of his hands he could kill game and skin it eventually he could build himself a permanent shelter even make clothes but of hides in winter  but he was not thinking that far ahead cole stood by the fire staring up at the sky his hands on his hips he squinted suddenly tense something was moving something in the sky drifting slowly through the grayness a black dot  he stamped out the fire quickly what was it he strained trying to see a bird  a second dot joined the first two dots then three four five a fleet of them moving rapidly across the early morning sky toward the mountains  toward him  cole hurried away from the fire he snatched up the rabbit and carried it along with him into the tangled shelter he had built he was invisible inside the shelter no one could find him but if they had seen the fire  he crouched in the shelter watching the dots grow larger they were planes all right black wingless planes coming closer each moment now he could hear them a faint dull buzz increasing until the ground shook under him  the first plane dived it dropped like a stone swelling into a great black shape cole gasped sinking down the plane roared in an arc swooping low over the ground suddenly bundles tumbled out white bundles falling and scattering like seeds  the bundles drifted rapidly to the ground they landed they were men men in uniform  now the second plane was diving it roared overhead releasing its load more bundles tumbled out filling the sky the third plane dived then the fourth the air was thick with drifting bundles of white a blanket of descending weed spores settling to earth  on the ground the soldiers were forming into groups their shouts carried to cole crouched in his shelter fear leaped through him they were landing on all sides of him he was cut off the last two planes had dropped men behind him  he got to his feet pushing out of the shelter some of the soldiers had found the fire the ashes and coals one dropped down feeling the coals with his hand he waved to the others they were circling all around shouting and gesturing one of them began to set up some kind of gun others were unrolling coils of tubing locking a collection of strange pipes and machinery in place  cole ran he rolled down a slope sliding and falling at the bottom he leaped to his feet and plunged into the brush vines and leaves tore at his face slashing and cutting him he fell again tangled in a mass of twisted shrubbery he fought desperately trying to free himself if he could reach the knife in his pocket  voices footsteps men were behind him running down the slope cole struggled frantically gasping and twisting trying to pull loose he strained breaking the vines clawing at them with his hands  a soldier dropped to his knee leveling his gun more soldiers arrived bringing up their rifles and aiming  cole cried out he closed his eyes his body suddenly limp he waited his teeth locked together sweat dripping down his neck into his shirt sagging against the mesh of vines and branches coiled around him  silence  cole opened his eyes slowly the soldiers had regrouped a huge man was striding down the slope toward them barking orders as he came  two soldiers stepped into the brush one of them grabbed cole by the shoulder  dont let go of him the huge man came over his black beard jutting out hold on  cole gasped for breath he was caught there was nothing he could do more soldiers were pouring down into the gulley surrounding him on all sides they studied him curiously murmuring together cole shook his head wearily and said nothing  the huge man with the beard stood directly in front of him his hands on his hips looking him up and down dont try to get away the man said you cant get away do you understand  cole nodded  all right good the man waved soldiers clamped metal bands around coles arms and wrists the metal dug into his flesh making him gasp with pain more clamps locked around his legs those stay there until were out of here a long way out  wherewhere are you taking me  peter sherikov studied the variable man for a moment before he answered where im taking you to my labs under the urals he glanced suddenly up at the sky we better hurry the security police will be starting their demolition attack in a few hours we want to be a long way from here when that begins                                       sherikov settled down in his comfortable reinforced chair with a sigh its good to be back he signalled to one of his guards all right you can unfasten him  the metal clamps were removed from coles arms and legs he sagged sinking down in a heap sherikov watched him silently  cole sat on the floor rubbing his wrists and legs saying nothing  what do you want sherikov demanded food are you hungry  no  medicine are you sick injured  no  sherikov wrinkled his nose a bath wouldnt hurt you any well arrange that later he lit a cigar blowing a cloud of gray smoke around him at the door of the room two lab guards stood with guns ready no one else was in the room beside sherikov and cole  thomas cole sat huddled in a heap on the floor his head sunk down against his chest he did not stir his bent body seemed more elongated and stooped than ever his hair tousled and unkempt his chin and jowls a rough stubbled gray his clothes were dirty and torn from crawling through the brush his skin was cut and scratched open sores dotted his neck and cheeks and forehead he said nothing his chest rose and fell his faded blue eyes were almost closed he looked quite old a withered driedup old man  sherikov waved one of the guards over have a doctor brought up here i want this man checked over he may need intravenous injections he may not have had anything to eat for awhile  the guard departed  i dont want anything to happen to you sherikov said before we go on ill have you checked over and deloused at the same time  cole said nothing  sherikov laughed buck up you have no reason to feel bad he leaned toward cole jabbing an immense finger at him another two hours and youd have been dead out there in the mountains you know that  cole nodded  you dont believe me look sherikov leaned over and snapped on the vidscreen mounted in the wall watch this the operation should still be going on  the screen lit up a scene gained form  this is a confidential security channel i had it tapped several years agofor my own protection what were seeing now is being piped in to eric reinhart sherikov grinned reinhart arranged what youre seeing on the screen pay close attention you were there two hours ago  cole turned toward the screen at first he could not make out what was happening the screen showed a vast foaming cloud a vortex of motion from the speaker came a low rumble a deepthroated roar after a time the screen shifted showing a slightly different view suddenly cole stiffened  he was seeing the destruction of a whole mountain range  the picture was coming from a ship flying above what had once been the albertine mountain range now there was nothing but swirling clouds of gray and columns of particles and debris a surging tide of restless material gradually sweeping off and dissipating in all directions  the albertine mountains had been disintegrated nothing remained but these vast clouds of debris below on the ground a ragged plain stretched out swept by fire and ruin gaping wounds yawned immense holes without bottom craters side by side as far as the eye could see craters and debris like the blasted pitted surface of the moon two hours ago it had been rolling peaks and gulleys brush and green bushes and trees  cole turned away  you see sherikov snapped the screen off you were down there not so long ago all that noise and smokeall for you all for you mr variable man from the past reinhart arranged that to finish you off i want you to understand that its very important that you realize that  cole said nothing  sherikov reached into a drawer of the table before him he carefully brought out a small square box and held it out to cole you wired this didnt you  cole took the box in his hands and held it for a time his tired mind failed to focus what did he have he concentrated on it the box was the childrens toy the intersystem vidsender they had called it  yes i fixed this he passed it back to sherikov i repaired that it was broken  sherikov gazed down at him intently his large eyes bright he nodded his black beard and cigar rising and falling good thats all i wanted to know he got suddenly to his feet pushing his chair back i see the doctors here hell fix you up everything you need later on ill talk to you again  unprotesting cole got to his feet allowing the doctor to take hold of his arm and help him up  after cole had been released by the medical department sherikov joined him in his private dining room a floor above the actual laboratory  the pole gulped down a hasty meal talking as he ate cole sat silently across from him not eating or speaking his old clothing had been taken away and new clothing given him he was shaved and rubbed down his sores and cuts were healed his body and hair washed he looked much healthier and younger now but he was still stooped and tired his blue eyes worn and faded he listened to sherikovs account of the world of 2136 ad without comment  you can see sherikov said finally waving a chicken leg that your appearance here has been very upsetting to our program now that you know more about us you can see why commissioner reinhart was so interested in destroying you  cole nodded  reinhart you realize believes that the failure of the srb machines is the chief danger to the war effort but that is nothing sherikov pushed his plate away noisily draining his coffee mug after all wars can be fought without statistical forecasts the srb machines only describe theyre nothing more than mechanical onlookers in themselves they dont affect the course of the war we make the war they only analyze  cole nodded  more coffee sherikov asked he pushed the plastic container toward cole have some  cole accepted another cupful thank you  you can see that our real problem is another thing entirely the machines only do figuring for us in a few minutes that eventually we could do for our own selves theyre our servants tools not some sort of gods in a temple which we go and pray to not oracles who can see into the future for us they dont see into the future they only make statistical predictionsnot prophecies theres a big difference there but reinhart doesnt understand it reinhart and his kind have made such things as the srb machines into gods but i have no gods at least not any i can see  cole nodded sipping his coffee  im telling you all these things because you must understand what were up against terra is hemmed in on all sides by the ancient centauran empire its been out there for centuries thousands of years no one knows how long its oldcrumbling and rotting corrupt and venal but it holds most of the galaxy around us and we cant break out of the sol system i told you about icarus and hedges work in ftl flight we must win the war against centaurus weve waited and worked a long time for this the moment when we can break out and get room among the stars for ourselves icarus is the deciding weapon the data on icarus tipped the srb odds in our favorfor the first time in history success in the war against centaurus will depend on icarus not on the srb machines you see  cole nodded  however there is a problem the data on icarus which i turned over to the machines specified that icarus would be completed in ten days more than half that time has already passed yet we are no closer to wiring up the control turret than we were then the turret baffles us sherikov grinned ironically even i have tried my hand at the wiring but with no success its intricateand small too many technical bugs not worked out we are building only one you understand if we had many experimental models worked out before  but this is the experimental model cole said  and built from the designs of a man dead four yearswho isnt here to correct us weve made icarus with our own hands down here in the labs and hes giving us plenty of trouble all at once sherikov got to his feet lets go down to the lab and look at him  they descended to the floor below sherikov leading the way cole stopped short at the lab door  quite a sight sherikov agreed we keep him down here at the bottom for safetys sake hes well protected come on in we have work to do  in the center of the lab icarus rose up the gray squat cylinder that someday would flash through space at a speed of thousands of times that of light toward the heart of proxima centaurus over four light years away around the cylinder groups of men in uniform were laboring feverishly to finish the remaining work  over here the turret sherikov led cole over to one side of the room its guarded centauran spies are swarming everywhere on terra they see into everything but so do we thats how we get information for the srb machines spies in both systems  the translucent globe that was the control turret reposed in the center of a metal stand an armed guard standing at each side they lowered their guns as sherikov approached  we dont want anything to happen to this sherikov said everything depends on it he put out his hand for the globe half way to it his hand stopped striking against an invisible presence in the air  sherikov laughed the wall shut it off its still on  one of the guards pressed a stud at his wrist around the globe the air shimmered and faded  now sherikovs hand closed over the globe he lifted it carefully from its mount and brought it out for cole to see this is the control turret for our enormous friend here this is what will slow him down when hes inside centaurus he slows down and reenters this universe right in the heart of the star thenno more centaurus sherikov beamed and no more armun  but cole was not listening he had taken the globe from sherikov and was turning it over and over running his hands over it his face close to its surface he peered down into its interior his face rapt and intent  you cant see the wiring not without lenses sherikov signalled for a pair of microlenses to be brought he fitted them on coles nose hooking them behind his ears now try it you can control the magnification its set for 1000x right now you can increase or decrease it  cole gasped swaying back and forth sherikov caught hold of him cole gazed down into the globe moving his head slightly focussing the glasses  it takes practice but you can do a lot with them permits you to do microscopic wiring there are tools to go along you understand sherikov paused licking his lip we cant get it done correctly only a few men can wire circuits using the microlenses and the little tools weve tried robots but there are too many decisions to be made robots cant make decisions they just react  cole said nothing he continued to gaze into the interior of the globe his lips tight his body taut and rigid it made sherikov feel strangely uneasy  you look like one of those old fortune tellers sherikov said jokingly but a cold shiver crawled up his spine better hand it back to me he held out his hand  slowly cole returned the globe after a time he removed the microlenses still deep in thought  well sherikov demanded you know what i want i want you to wire this damn thing up sherikov came close to cole his big face hard you can do it i think i could tell by the way you held itand the job you did on the childrens toy of course you could wire it up right and in five days nobody else can and if its not wired up centaurus will keep on running the galaxy and terra will have to sweat it out here in the sol system one tiny mediocre sun one dust mote out of a whole galaxy  cole did not answer  sherikov became impatient well what do you say  what happens if i dont wire this control for you i mean what happens to me  then i turn you over to reinhart reinhart will kill you instantly he thinks youre dead killed when the albertine range was annihilated if he had any idea i had saved you  i see  i brought you down here for one thing if you wire it up ill have you sent back to your own time continuum if you dont  cole considered his face dark and brooding  what do you have to lose youd already be dead if we hadnt pulled you out of those hills  can you really return me to my own time  of course  reinhart wont interfere  sherikov laughed what can he do how can he stop me i have my own men you saw them they landed all around you youll be returned  yes i saw your men  then you agree  i agree thomas cole said ill wire it for you ill complete the control turretwithin the next five days     iv   three days later joseph dixon slid a closedcircuit message plate across the desk to his boss  here you might be interested in this  reinhart picked the plate up slowly what is it you came all the way here to show me this  thats right  why didnt you vidscreen it  dixon smiled grimly youll understand when you decode it its from proxima centaurus  centaurus  our counterintelligence service they sent it direct to me here ill decode it for you save you the trouble  dixon came around behind reinharts desk he leaned over the commissioners shoulder taking hold of the plate and breaking the seal with his thumb nail  hang on dixon said this is going to hit you hard according to our agents on armun the centauran high council has called an emergency session to deal with the problem of terras impending attack centauran relay couriers have reported to the high council that the terran bomb icarus is virtually complete work on the bomb has been rushed through final stages in the underground laboratories under the ural range directed by the terran physicist peter sherikov  so i understand from sherikov himself are you surprised the centaurans know about the bomb they have spies swarming over terra thats no news  theres more dixon traced the message plate grimly with an unsteady finger the centauran relay couriers reported that peter sherikov brought an expert mechanic out of a previous time continuum to complete the wiring of the turret  reinhart staggered holding on tight to the desk he closed his eyes gasping  the variable man is still alive dixon murmured i dont know how or why theres nothing left of the albertines and how the hell did the man get half way around the world  reinhart opened his eyes slowly his face twisting sherikov he must have removed him before the attack i told sherikov the attack was forthcoming i gave him the exact hour he had to get helpfrom the variable man he couldnt meet his promise otherwise  reinhart leaped up and began to pace back and forth ive already informed the srb machines that the variable man has been destroyed the machines now show the original 76 ratio in our favor but the ratio is based on false information  then youll have to withdraw the false data and restore the original situation  no reinhart shook his head i cant do that the machines must be kept functioning we cant allow them to jam again its too dangerous if duffe should become aware that  what are you going to do then dixon picked up the message plate you cant leave the machines with false data thats treason  the data cant be withdrawn not unless equivalent data exists to take its place reinhart paced angrily back and forth damn it i was certain the man was dead this is an incredible situation he must be eliminatedat any cost  suddenly reinhart stopped pacing the turret its probably finished by this time correct  dixon nodded slowly in agreement with the variable man helping sherikov has undoubtedly completed work well ahead of schedule  reinharts gray eyes flickered then hes no longer of any useeven to sherikov we could take a chance even if there were active opposition  whats this dixon demanded what are you thinking about  how many units are ready for immediate action how large a force can we raise without notice  because of the war were mobilized on a twentyfour hour basis there are seventy air units and about two hundred surface units the balance of the security forces have been transferred to the line under military control  men  we have about five thousand men ready to go still on terra most of them in the process of being transferred to military transports i can hold it up at any time  missiles  fortunately the launching tubes have not yet been disassembled theyre still here on terra in another few days theyll be moving out for the colonial fracas  then theyre available for immediate use  yes  good reinhart locked his hands knotting his fingers harshly together in sudden decision that will do exactly unless i am completely wrong sherikov has only a halfdozen air units and no surface cars and only about two hundred men some defense shields of course  what are you planning  reinharts face was gray and hard like stone send out orders for all available security units to be unified under your immediate command have them ready to move by four oclock this afternoon were going to pay a visit reinhart stated grimly a surprise visit on peter sherikov                                       stop here reinhart ordered  the surface car slowed to a halt reinhart peered cautiously out studying the horizon ahead  on all sides a desert of scrub grass and sand stretched out nothing moved or stirred to the right the grass and sand rose up to form immense peaks a range of mountains without end disappearing finally into the distance the urals  over there reinhart said to dixon pointing see  no  look hard its difficult to spot unless you know what to look for vertical pipes some kind of vent or periscopes  dixon saw them finally i would have driven past without noticing  its well concealed the main labs are a mile down under the range itself its virtually impregnable sherikov had it built years ago to withstand any attack from the air by surface cars bombs missiles  he must feel safe down there  no doubt reinhart gazed up at the sky a few faint black dots could be seen moving lazily about in broad circles those arent ours are they i gave orders  no theyre not ours all our units are out of sight those belong to sherikov his patrol  reinhart relaxed good he reached over and flicked on the vidscreen over the board of the car this screen is shielded it cant be traced  theres no way they can spot it back to us its nondirectional  the screen glowed into life reinhart punched the combination keys and sat back to wait  after a time an image formed on the screen a heavy face bushy black beard and large eyes  peter sherikov gazed at reinhart with surprised curiosity commissioner where are you calling from what  hows the work progressing reinhart broke in coldly is icarus almost complete  sherikov beamed with expansive pride hes done commissioner two days ahead of time icarus is ready to be launched into space i tried to call your office but they told me  im not at my office reinhart leaned toward the screen open your entrance tunnel at the surface youre about to receive visitors  sherikov blinked visitors  im coming down to see you about icarus have the tunnel opened for me at once  exactly where are you commissioner  on the surface  sherikovs eyes flickered oh but  open up reinhart snapped he glanced at his wristwatch ill be at the entrance in five minutes i expect to find it ready for me  of course sherikov nodded in bewilderment im always glad to see you commissioner but i  five minutes then reinhart cut the circuit the screen died he turned quickly to dixon you stay up here as we arranged ill go down with one company of police you understand the necessity of exact timing on this  we wont slip up everythings ready all units are in their places  good reinhart pushed the door open for him you join your directional staff ill proceed toward the tunnel entrance  good luck dixon leaped out of the car onto the sandy ground a gust of dry air swirled into the car around reinhart ill see you later  reinhart slammed the door he turned to the group of police crouched in the rear of the car their guns held tightly here we go reinhart murmured hold on  the car raced across the sandy ground toward the tunnel entrance to sherikovs underground fortress  sherikov met reinhart at the bottom end of the tunnel where the tunnel opened up onto the main floor of the lab  the big pole approached his hand out beaming with pride and satisfaction its a pleasure to see you commissioner this is an historic moment  reinhart got out of the car with his group of armed security police calls for a celebration doesnt it he said  thats a good idea were two days ahead commissioner the srb machines will be interested the odds should change abruptly at the news  lets go down to the lab i want to see the control turret myself  a shadow crossed sherikovs face id rather not bother the workmen right now commissioner theyve been under a great load trying to complete the turret in time i believe theyre putting a few last finishes on it at this moment  we can view them by vidscreen im curious to see them at work it must be difficult to wire such minute relays  sherikov shook his head sorry commissioner no vidscreen on them i wont allow it this is too important our whole future depends on it  reinhart snapped a signal to his company of police put this man under arrest  sherikov blanched his mouth fell open the police moved quickly around him their gun tubes up jabbing into him he was searched rapidly efficiently his gun belt and concealed energy screen were yanked off  whats going on sherikov demanded some color returning to his face what are you doing  youre under arrest for the duration of the war youre relieved of all authority from now on one of my men will operate designs when the war is over youll be tried before the council and president duffe  sherikov shook his head dazed i dont understand whats this all about explain it to me commissioner whats happened  reinhart signalled to his police get ready were going into the lab we may have to shoot our way in the variable man should be in the area of the bomb working on the control turret  instantly sherikovs face hardened his black eyes glittered alert and hostile  reinhart laughed harshly we received a counterintelligence report from centaurus im surprised at you sherikov you know the centaurans are everywhere with their relay couriers you should have known  sherikov moved fast all at once he broke away from the police throwing his massive body against them they fell scattering sherikov randirectly at the wall the police fired wildly reinhart fumbled frantically for his gun tube pulling it up  sherikov reached the wall running head down energy beams flashing around him he struck against the walland vanished  down reinhart shouted he dropped to his hands and knees all around him his police dived for the floor reinhart cursed wildly dragging himself quickly toward the door they had to get out and right away sherikov had escaped a false wall an energy barrier set to respond to his pressure he had dashed through it to safety he  from all sides an inferno burst a flaming roar of death surging over them around them on every side the room was alive with blazing masses of destruction bouncing from wall to wall they were caught between four banks of power all of them open to full discharge a trapa death trap                                       reinhart reached the hall gasping for breath he leaped to his feet a few security police followed him behind them in the flaming room the rest of the company screamed and struggled blasted out of existence by the leaping bursts of power  reinhart assembled his remaining men already sherikovs guards were forming at one end of the corridor a snubbarreled robot gun was maneuvering into position a siren wailed guards were running on all sides hurrying to battle stations  the robot gun opened fire part of the corridor exploded bursting into fragments clouds of choking debris and particles swept around them reinhart and his police retreated moving back along the corridor  they reached a junction a second robot gun was rumbling toward them hurrying to get within range reinhart fired carefully aiming at its delicate control abruptly the gun spun convulsively it lashed against the wall smashing itself into the unyielding metal then it collapsed in a heap gears still whining and spinning  come on reinhart moved away crouching and running he glanced at his watch almost time a few more minutes a group of lab guards appeared ahead of them reinhart fired behind him his police fired past him violet shafts of energy catching the group of guards as they entered the corridor the guards spilled apart falling and twisting part of them settled into dust drifting down the corridor reinhart made his way toward the lab crouching and leaping pushing past heaps of debris and remains followed by his men come on dont stop                                       suddenly from around them the booming enlarged voice of sherikov thundered magnified by rows of wall speakers along the corridor reinhart halted glancing around  reinhart you havent got a chance youll never get back to the surface throw down your guns and give up youre surrounded on all sides youre a mile under the surface  reinhart threw himself into motion pushing into billowing clouds of particles drifting along the corridor are you sure sherikov he grunted  sherikov laughed his harsh metallic peals rolling in waves against reinharts eardrums i dont want to have to kill you commissioner youre vital to the war im sorry you found out about the variable man i admit we overlooked the centauran espionage as a factor in this but now that you know about him  suddenly sherikovs voice broke off a deep rumble had shaken the floor a lapping vibration that shuddered through the corridor  reinhart sagged with relief he peered through the clouds of debris making out the figures on his watch right on time not a second late  the first of the hydrogen missiles launched from the council buildings on the other side of the world were beginning to arrive the attack had begun  at exactly six oclock joseph dixon standing on the surface four miles from the entrance tunnel gave the sign to the waiting units  the first job was to break down sherikovs defense screens the missiles had to penetrate without interference at dixons signal a fleet of thirty security ships dived from a height of ten miles swooping above the mountains directly over the underground laboratories within five minutes the defense screens had been smashed and all the tower projectors leveled flat now the mountains were virtually unprotected  so far so good dixon murmured as he watched from his secure position the fleet of security ships roared back their work done across the face of the desert the police surface cars were crawling rapidly toward the entrance tunnel snaking from side to side  meanwhile sherikovs counterattack had begun to go into operation  guns mounted among the hills opened fire vast columns of flame burst up in the path of the advancing cars the cars hesitated and retreated as the plain was churned up by a howling vortex a thundering chaos of explosions here and there a car vanished in a cloud of particles a group of cars moving away suddenly scattered caught up by a giant wind that lashed across them and swept them up into the air  dixon gave orders to have the cannon silenced the police air arm again swept overhead a sullen roar of jets that shook the ground below the police ships divided expertly and hurtled down on the cannon protecting the hills  the cannon forgot the surface cars and lifted their snouts to meet the attack again and again the airships came rocking the mountains with titanic blasts  the guns became silent their echoing boom diminished died away reluctantly as bombs took critical toll of them  dixon watched with satisfaction as the bombing came to an end the airships rose in a thick swarm black gnats shooting up in triumph from a dead carcass they hurried back as emergency antiaircraft robot guns swung into position and saturated the sky with blazing puffs of energy  dixon checked his wristwatch the missiles were already on the way from north america only a few minutes remained  the surface cars freed by the successful bombing began to regroup for a new frontal attack again they crawled forward across the burning plain bearing down cautiously on the battered wall of mountains heading toward the twisted wrecks that had been the ring of defense guns toward the entrance tunnel  an occasional cannon fired feebly at them the cars came grimly on now in the hollows of the hills sherikovs troops were hurrying to the surface to meet the attack the first car reached the shadow of the mountains  a deafening hail of fire burst loose small robot guns appeared everywhere needle barrels emerging from behind hidden screens trees and shrubs rocks stones the police cars were caught in a withering crossfire trapped at the base of the hills  down the slopes sherikovs guards raced toward the stalled cars clouds of heat rose up and boiled across the plain as the cars fired up at the running men a robot gun dropped like a slug onto the plain and screamed toward the cars firing as it came  dixon twisted nervously only a few minutes any time now he shaded his eyes and peered up at the sky no sign of them yet he wondered about reinhart no signal had come up from below clearly reinhart had run into trouble no doubt there was desperate fighting going on in the maze of underground tunnels the intricate web of passages that honeycombed the earth below the mountains  in the air sherikovs few defense ships were taking on the police raiders outnumbered the defense ships darted rapidly wildly putting up a futile fight  sherikovs guards streamed out onto the plain crouching and running they advanced toward the stalled cars the police airships screeched down at them guns thundering  dixon held his breath when the missiles arrived  the first missile struck a section of the mountain vanished turned to smoke and foaming gasses the wave of heat slapped dixon across the face spinning him around quickly he reentered his ship and took off shooting rapidly away from the scene he glanced back a second and third missile had arrived great gaping pits yawned among the mountains vast sections missing like broken teeth now the missiles could penetrate to the underground laboratories below  on the ground the surface cars halted beyond the danger area waiting for the missile attack to finish when the eighth missile had struck the cars again moved forward no more missiles fell  dixon swung his ship around heading back toward the scene the laboratory was exposed the top sections of it had been ripped open the laboratory lay like a tin can torn apart by mighty explosions its first floors visible from the air men and cars were pouring down into it fighting with the guards swarming to the surface                                       dixon watched intently sherikovs men were bringing up heavy guns big robot artillery but the police ships were diving again sherikovs defensive patrols had been cleaned from the sky the police ships whined down arcing over the exposed laboratory small bombs fell whistling down pinpointing the artillery rising to the surface on the remaining lift stages  abruptly dixons vidscreen clicked dixon turned toward it  reinharts features formed call off the attack his uniform was torn a deep bloody gash crossed his cheek he grinned sourly at dixon pushing his tangled hair back out of his face quite a fight  sherikov  hes called off his guards weve agreed to a truce its all over no more needed reinhart gasped for breath wiping grime and sweat from his neck land your ship and come down here at once  the variable man  that comes next reinhart said grimly he adjusted his gun tube i want you down here for that part i want you to be in on the kill  reinhart turned away from the vidscreen in the corner of the room sherikov stood silently saying nothing well reinhart barked where is he where will i find him  sherikov licked his lips nervously glancing up at reinhart commissioner are you sure  the attack has been called off your labs are safe so is your life now its your turn to come through reinhart gripped his gun moving toward sherikov where is he  for a moment sherikov hesitated then slowly his huge body sagged defeated he shook his head wearily all right ill show you where he is his voice was hardly audible a dry whisper down this way come on  reinhart followed sherikov out of the room into the corridor police and guards were working rapidly clearing the debris and ruins away putting out the hydrogen fires that burned everywhere no tricks sherikov  no tricks sherikov nodded resignedly thomas cole is by himself in a wing lab off the main rooms  cole  the variable man thats his name the pole turned his massive head a little he has a name  reinhart waved his gun hurry up i dont want anything to go wrong this is the part i came for  you must remember something commissioner  what is it  sherikov stopped walking commissioner nothing must happen to the globe the control turret everything depends on it the war our whole  i know nothing will happen to the damn thing lets go  if it should get damaged  im not after the globe im interested only inin thomas cole  they came to the end of the corridor and stopped before a metal door sherikov nodded at the door in there  reinhart moved back open the door  open it yourself i dont want to have anything to do with it  reinhart shrugged he stepped up to the door holding his gun level he raised his hand passing it in front of the eye circuit nothing happened  reinhart frowned he pushed the door with his hand the door slid open reinhart was looking into a small laboratory he glimpsed a workbench tools heaps of equipment measuring devices and in the center of the bench the transparent globe the control turret  cole reinhart advanced quickly into the room he glanced around him suddenly alarmed where  the room was empty thomas cole was gone  when the first missile struck cole stopped work and sat listening  far off a distant rumble rolled through the earth shaking the floor under him on the bench tools and equipment danced up and down a pair of pliers fell crashing to the floor a box of screws tipped over spilling its minute contents out  cole listened for a time presently he lifted the transparent globe from the bench with carefully controlled hands he held the globe up running his fingers gently over the surface his faded blue eyes thoughtful then after a time he placed the globe back on the bench in its mount  the globe was finished a faint glow of pride moved through the variable man the globe was the finest job he had ever done  the deep rumblings ceased cole became instantly alert he jumped down from his stool hurrying across the room to the door for a moment he stood by the door listening intently he could hear noise on the other side shouts guards rushing past dragging heavy equipment working frantically  a rolling crash echoed down the corridor and lapped against his door the concussion spun him around again a tide of energy shook the walls and floor and sent him down on his knees  the lights flickered and winked out  cole fumbled in the dark until he found a flashlight power failure he could hear crackling flames abruptly the lights came on again an ugly yellow then faded back out cole bent down and examined the door with his flashlight a magnetic lock dependent on an externally induced electric flux he grabbed a screwdriver and pried at the door for a moment it held then it fell open  cole stepped warily out into the corridor everything was in shambles guards wandered everywhere burned and halfblinded two lay groaning under a pile of wrecked equipment fused guns reeking metal the air was heavy with the smell of burning wiring and plastic a thick cloud that choked him and made him bend double as he advanced  halt a guard gasped feebly struggling to rise cole pushed past him and down the corridor two small robot guns still functioning glided past him hurriedly toward the drumming chaos of battle he followed  at a major intersection the fight was in full swing sherikovs guards fought security police crouched behind pillars and barricades firing wildly desperately again the whole structure shuddered as a great booming blast ignited some place above bombs shells  cole threw himself down as a violet beam cut past his ear and disintegrated the wall behind him a security policeman wildeyed firing erratically one of sherikovs guards winged him and his gun skidded to the floor  a robot cannon turned toward him as he made his way past the intersection he began to run the cannon rolled along behind him aiming itself uncertainly cole hunched over as he shambled rapidly along gasping for breath in the flickering yellow light he saw a handful of security police advancing firing expertly intent on a line of defense sherikovs guards had hastily set up  the robot cannon altered its course to take them on and cole escaped around a corner  he was in the main lab the big chamber where icarus himself rose the vast squat column  icarus a solid wall of guards surrounded him grimfaced hugging guns and protection shields but the security police were leaving icarus alone nobody wanted to damage him cole evaded a lone guard tracking him and reached the far side of the lab  it took him only a few seconds to find the force field generator there was no switch for a moment that puzzled himand then he remembered the guard had controlled it from his wrist  too late to worry about that with his screwdriver he unfastened the plate over the generator and ripped out the wiring in handfuls the generator came loose and he dragged it away from the wall the screen was off thank god he managed to carry the generator into a side corridor  crouched in a heap cole bent over the generator deft fingers flying he pulled the wiring to him and laid it out on the floor tracing the circuits with feverish haste  the adaptation was easier than he had expected the screen flowed at right angles to the wiring for a distance of six feet each lead was shielded on one side the field radiated outward leaving a hollow cone in the center he ran the wiring through his belt down his trouser legs under his shirt all the way to his wrists and ankles  he was just snatching up the heavy generator when two security police appeared they raised their blasters and fired pointblank  cole clicked on the screen a vibration leaped through him that snapped his jaw and danced up his body he staggered away halfstupefied by the surging force that radiated out from him the violet rays struck the field and deflected harmlessly  he was safe  he hurried on down the corridor past a ruined gun and sprawled bodies still clutching blasters great drifting clouds of radioactive particles billowed around him he edged by one cloud nervously guards lay everywhere dying and dead partly destroyed eaten and corroded by the hot metallic salts in the air he had to get outand fast  at the end of the corridor a whole section of the fortress was in ruins towering flames leaped on all sides one of the missiles had penetrated below ground level  cole found a lift that still functioned a load of wounded guards was being raised to the surface none of them paid any attention to him flames surged around the lift licking at the wounded workmen were desperately trying to get the lift into action cole leaped onto the lift a moment later it began to rise leaving the shouts and the flames behind  the lift emerged on the surface and cole jumped off a guard spotted him and gave chase crouching cole dodged into a tangled mass of twisted metal still whitehot and smoking he ran for a distance leaping from the side of a ruined defensescreen tower onto the fused ground and down the side of a hill the ground was hot underfoot he hurried as fast as he could gasping for breath he came to a long slope and scrambled up the side  the guard who had followed was gone lost behind in the rolling clouds of ash that drifted from the ruins of sherikovs underground fortress  cole reached the top of the hill for a brief moment he halted to get his breath and figure where he was it was almost evening the sun was beginning to set in the darkening sky a few dots still twisted and rolled black specks that abruptly burst into flame and fused out again  cole stood up cautiously peering around him ruins stretched out below on all sides the furnace from which he had escaped a chaos of incandescent metal and debris gutted and wrecked beyond repair miles of tangled rubbish and halfvaporized equipment  he considered everyone was busy putting out the fires and pulling the wounded to safety it would be awhile before he was missed but as soon as they realized he was gone theyd be after him most of the laboratory had been destroyed nothing lay back that way  beyond the ruins lay the great ural peaks the endless mountains stretching out as far as the eye could see  mountains and green forests a wilderness theyd never find him there  cole started along the side of the hill walking slowly and carefully his screen generator under his arm probably in the confusion he could find enough food and equipment to last him indefinitely he could wait until early morning then circle back toward the ruins and load up with a few tools and his own innate skill he would get along fine a screwdriver hammer nails odds and ends  a great hum sounded in his ears it swelled to a deafening roar startled cole whirled around a vast shape filled the sky behind him growing each moment cole stood frozen utterly transfixed the shape thundered over him above his head as he stood stupidly rooted to the spot  then awkwardly uncertainly he began to run he stumbled and fell and rolled a short distance down the side of the hill desperately he struggled to hold onto the ground his hands dug wildly futilely into the soft soil trying to keep the generator under his arm at the same time  a flash and a blinding spark of light around him  the spark picked him up and tossed him like a dry leaf he grunted in agony as searing fire crackled about him a blazing inferno that gnawed and ate hungrily through his screen he spun dizzily and fell through the cloud of fire down into a pit of darkness a vast gulf between two hills his wiring ripped off the generator tore out of his grip and was lost behind abruptly his force field ceased  cole lay in the darkness at the bottom of the hill his whole body shrieked in agony as the unholy fire played over him he was a blazing cinder a halfconsumed ash flaming in a universe of darkness the pain made him twist and crawl like an insect trying to burrow into the ground he screamed and shrieked and struggled to escape to get away from the hideous fire to reach the curtain of darkness beyond where it was cool and silent where the flames couldnt crackle and eat at him  he reached imploringly out into the darkness groping feebly toward it trying to pull himself into it gradually the glowing orb that was his own body faded the impenetrable chaos of night descended he allowed the tide to sweep over him to extinguish the searing fire  dixon landed his ship expertly bringing it to a halt in front of an overturned defense tower he leaped out and hurried across the smoking ground  from a lift reinhart appeared surrounded by his security police he got away from us he escaped  he didnt escape dixon answered i got him myself  reinhart quivered violently what do you mean  come along with me over in this direction he and reinhart climbed the side of a demolished hill both of them panting for breath i was landing i saw a figure emerge from a lift and run toward the mountains like some sort of animal when he came out in the open i dived on him and released a phosphorus bomb  then hesdead  i dont see how anyone could have lived through a phosphorus bomb they reached the top of the hill dixon halted then pointed excitedly down into the pit beyond the hill there  they descended cautiously the ground was singed and burned clean clouds of smoke hung heavily in the air occasional fires still flickered here and there reinhart coughed and bent over to see dixon flashed on a pocket flare and set it beside the body  the body was charred half destroyed by the burning phosphorus it lay motionless one arm over its face mouth open legs sprawled grotesquely like some abandoned rag doll tossed in an incinerator and consumed almost beyond recognition  hes alive dixon muttered he felt around curiously must have had some kind of protection screen amazing that a man could  its him its really him  fits the description dixon tore away a handful of burned clothing this is the variable man whats left of him at least  reinhart sagged with relief then weve finally got him the data is accurate hes no longer a factor  dixon got out his blaster and released the safety catch thoughtfully if you want i can finish the job right now  at that moment sherikov appeared accompanied by two armed security police he strode grimly down the hillside black eyes snapping did cole he broke off good god  dixon got him with a phosphorus bomb reinhart said noncommittally he had reached the surface and was trying to get into the mountains  sherikov turned wearily away he was an amazing person during the attack he managed to force the lock on his door and escape the guards fired at him but nothing happened he had rigged up some kind of force field around him something he adapted  anyhow its over with reinhart answered did you have srb plates made up on him  sherikov reached slowly into his coat he drew out a manila envelope heres all the information i collected about him while he was with me  is it complete everything previous has been merely fragmentary  as near complete as i could make it it includes photographs and diagrams of the interior of the globe the turret wiring he did for me i havent had a chance even to look at them sherikov fingered the envelope what are you going to do with cole  have him loaded up taken back to the cityand officially put to sleep by the euthanasia ministry  legal murder sherikovs lips twisted why dont you simply do it right here and get it over with  reinhart grabbed the envelope and stuck it in his pocket ill turn this right over to the machines he motioned to dixon lets go now we can notify the fleet to prepare for the attack on centaurus he turned briefly back to sherikov when can icarus be launched  in an hour or so i suppose theyre locking the control turret in place assuming it functions correctly thats all thats needed  good ill notify duffe to send out the signal to the warfleet reinhart nodded to the police to take sherikov to the waiting security ship sherikov moved off dully his face gray and haggard coles inert body was picked up and tossed onto a freight cart the cart rumbled into the hold of the security ship and the lock slid shut after it  itll be interesting to see how the machines respond to the additional data dixon said  it should make quite an improvement in the odds reinhart agreed he patted the envelope bulging in his inside pocket were two days ahead of time                                       margaret duffe got up slowly from her desk she pushed her chair automatically back let me get all this straight you mean the bomb is finished ready to go  reinhart nodded impatiently thats what i said the technicians are checking the turret locks to make sure its properly attached the launching will take place in half an hour  thirty minutes then  then the attack can begin at once i assume the fleet is ready for action  of course its been ready for several days but i cant believe the bomb is ready so soon margaret duffe moved numbly toward the door of her office this is a great day commissioner an old era lies behind us this time tomorrow centaurus will be gone and eventually the colonies will be ours  its been a long climb reinhart murmured  one thing your charge against sherikov it seems incredible that a person of his caliber could ever  well discuss that later reinhart interrupted coldly he pulled the manila envelope from his coat i havent had an opportunity to feed the additional data to the srb machines if youll excuse me ill do that now                                       for a moment margaret duffe stood at the door the two of them faced each other silently neither speaking a faint smile on reinharts thin lips hostility in the womans blue eyes  reinhart sometimes i think perhaps youll go too far and sometimes i think youve already gone too far  ill inform you of any change in the odds showing reinhart strode past her out of the office and down the hall he headed toward the srb room an intense thalamic excitement rising up inside him  a few moments later he entered the srb room he made his way to the machines the odds 76 showed in the view windows reinhart smiled a little 76 false odds based on incorrect information now they could be removed  kaplan hurried over reinhart handed him the envelope and moved over to the window gazing down at the scene below men and cars scurried frantically everywhere officials coming and going like ants hurrying in all directions  the war was on the signal had been sent out to the warfleet that had waited so long near proxima centaurus a feeling of triumph raced through reinhart he had won he had destroyed the man from the past and broken peter sherikov the war had begun as planned terra was breaking out reinhart smiled thinly he had been completely successful  commissioner  reinhart turned slowly all right  kaplan was standing in front of the machines gazing down at the reading commissioner  sudden alarm plucked at reinhart there was something in kaplans voice he hurried quickly over what is it  kaplan looked up at him his face white his eyes wide with terror his mouth opened and closed but no sound came  what is it reinhart demanded chilled he bent toward the machines studying the reading  and sickened with horror  1001 against terra  he could not tear his gaze away from the figures he was numb shocked with disbelief 1001 what had happened what had gone wrong the turret was finished icarus was ready the fleet had been notified  there was a sudden deep buzz from outside the building shouts drifted up from below reinhart turned his head slowly toward the window his heart frozen with fear  across the evening sky a trail moved rising each moment a thin line of white something climbed gaining speed each moment on the ground all eyes were turned toward it awed faces peering up  the object gained speed faster and faster then it vanished icarus was on his way the attack had begun it was too late to stop now  and on the machines the odds read a hundred to onefor failure  at eight oclock in the evening of may 15 2136 icarus was launched toward the star centaurus a day later while all terra waited icarus entered the star traveling at thousands of times the speed of light  nothing happened icarus disappeared into the star there was no explosion the bomb failed to go off  at the same time the terran warfleet engaged the centauran outer fleet sweeping down in a concentrated attack twenty major ships were seized a good part of the centauran fleet was destroyed many of the captive systems began to revolt in the hope of throwing off the imperial bonds  two hours later the massed centauran warfleet from armun abruptly appeared and joined battle the great struggle illuminated half the centauran system ship after ship flashed briefly and then faded to ash for a whole day the two fleets fought strung out over millions of miles of space innumerable fighting men diedon both sides  at last the remains of the battered terran fleet turned and limped toward armundefeated little of the once impressive armada remained a few blackened hulks making their way uncertainly toward captivity  icarus had not functioned centaurus had not exploded the attack was a failure  the war was over  weve lost the war margaret duffe said in a small voice wondering and awed its over finished  the council members sat in their places around the conference table grayhaired elderly men none of them speaking or moving all gazed up mutely at the great stellar maps that covered two walls of the chamber  i have already empowered negotiators to arrange a truce margaret duffe murmured orders have been sent out to vicecommander jessup to give up the battle theres no hope fleet commander carleton destroyed himself and his flagship a few minutes ago the centauran high council has agreed to end the fighting their whole empire is rotten to the core ready to topple of its own weight  reinhart was slumped over at the table his head in his hands i dont understand why why didnt the bomb explode he mopped his forehead shakily all his poise was gone he was trembling and broken what went wrong  grayfaced dixon mumbled an answer the variable man must have sabotaged the turret the srb machines knew they analyzed the data they knew but it was too late  reinharts eyes were bleak with despair as he raised his head a little i knew hed destroy us were finished a century of work and planning his body knotted in a spasm of furious agony all because of sherikov                                       margaret duffe eyed reinhart coldly why because of sherikov  he kept cole alive i wanted him killed from the start suddenly reinhart jumped from his chair his hand clutched convulsively at his gun and hes still alive even if weve lost im going to have the pleasure of putting a blast beam through coles chest  sit down margaret duffe ordered  reinhart was half way to the door hes still at the euthanasia ministry waiting for the official  no hes not margaret duffe said  reinhart froze he turned slowly as if unable to believe his senses what  cole isnt at the ministry i ordered him transferred and your instructions cancelled  wherewhere is he  there was unusual hardness in margaret duffes voice as she answered with peter sherikov in the urals i had sherikovs full authority restored i then had cole transferred there put in sherikovs safe keeping i want to make sure cole recovers so we can keep our promise to himour promise to return him to his own time  reinharts mouth opened and closed all the color had drained from his face his cheek muscles twitched spasmodically at last he managed to speak youve gone insane the traitor responsible for earths greatest defeat  we have lost the war margaret duffe stated quietly but this is not a day of defeat it is a day of victory the most incredible victory terra has ever had  reinhart and dixon were dumbfounded what reinhart gasped what do you the whole room was in an uproar all the council members were on their feet reinharts words were drowned out  sherikov will explain when he gets here margaret duffes calm voice came hes the one who discovered it she looked around the chamber at the incredulous council members everyone stay in his seat you are all to remain here until sherikov arrives its vital you hear what he has to say his news transforms this whole situation                                       peter sherikov accepted the briefcase of papers from his armed technician thanks he pushed his chair back and glanced thoughtfully around the council chamber is everybody ready to hear what i have to say  were ready margaret duffe answered the council members sat alertly around the table at the far end reinhart and dixon watched uneasily as the big pole removed papers from his briefcase and carefully examined them  to begin i recall to you the original work behind the ftl bomb jamison hedge was the first human to propel an object at a speed greater than light as you know that object diminished in length and gained in mass as it moved toward light speed when it reached that speed it vanished it ceased to exist in our terms having no length it could not occupy space it rose to a different order of existence  when hedge tried to bring the object back an explosion occurred hedge was killed and all his equipment was destroyed the force of the blast was beyond calculation hedge had placed his observation ship many millions of miles away it was not far enough however originally he had hoped his drive might be used for space travel but after his death the principle was abandoned  that isuntil icarus i saw the possibilities of a bomb an incredibly powerful bomb to destroy centaurus and all the empires forces the reappearance of icarus would mean the annihilation of their system as hedge had shown the object would reenter space already occupied by matter and the cataclysm would be beyond belief  but icarus never came back reinhart cried cole altered the wiring so the bomb kept on going its probably still going  wrong sherikov boomed the bomb did reappear but it didnt explode  reinhart reacted violently you mean  the bomb came back dropping below the ftl speed as soon as it entered the star proxima but it did not explode there was no cataclysm it reappeared and was absorbed by the sun turned into gas at once  why didnt it explode dixon demanded  because thomas cole solved hedges problem he found a way to bring the ftl object back into this universe without collision without an explosion the variable man found what hedge was after  the whole council was on its feet a growing murmur filled the chamber a rising pandemonium breaking out on all sides  i dont believe it reinhart gasped it isnt possible if cole solved hedges problem that would mean he broke off staggered  faster than light drive can now be used for space travel sherikov continued waving the noise down as hedge intended my men have studied the photographs of the control turret they dont know how or why yet but we have complete records of the turret we can duplicate the wiring as soon as the laboratories have been repaired  comprehension was gradually beginning to settle over the room then itll be possible to build ftl ships margaret duffe murmured dazed and if we can do that  when i showed him the control turret cole understood its purpose not my purpose but the original purpose hedge had been working toward cole realized icarus was actually an incomplete spaceship not a bomb at all he saw what hedge had seen an ftl space drive he set out to make icarus work  we can go beyond centaurus dixon muttered his lips twisted then the war was trivial we can leave the empire completely behind we can go beyond the galaxy  the whole universe is open to us sherikov agreed instead of taking over an antiquated empire we have the entire cosmos to map and explore gods total creation  margaret duffe got to her feet and moved slowly toward the great stellar maps that towered above them at the far end of the chamber she stood for a long time gazing up at the myriad suns the legions of systems awed by what she saw  do you suppose he realized all this she asked suddenly what we can see here on these maps  thomas cole is a strange person sherikov said half to himself apparently he has a kind of intuition about machines the way things are supposed to work an intuition more in his hands than in his head a kind of genius such as a painter or a pianist has not a scientist he has no verbal knowledge about things no semantic references he deals with the things themselves directly  i doubt very much if thomas cole understood what would come about he looked into the globe the control turret he saw unfinished wiring and relays he saw a job half done an incomplete machine  something to be fixed margaret duffe put in  something to be fixed like an artist he saw his work ahead of him he was interested in only one thing turning out the best job he could with the skill he possessed for us that skill has opened up a whole universe endless galaxies and systems to explore worlds without end unlimited untouched worlds  reinhart got unsteadily to his feet we better get to work start organizing construction teams exploration crews well have to reconvert from war production to ship designing begin the manufacture of mining and scientific instruments for survey work  thats right margaret duffe said she looked reflectively up at him but youre not going to have anything to do with it  reinhart saw the expression on her face his hand flew to his gun and he backed quickly toward the door dixon leaped up and joined him get back reinhart shouted  margaret duffe signalled and a phalanx of government troops closed in around the two men grimfaced efficient soldiers with magnetic grapples ready  reinharts blaster waveredtoward the council members sitting shocked in their seats and toward margaret duffe straight at her blue eyes reinharts features were distorted with insane fear get back dont anybody come near me or shell be the first to get it  peter sherikov slid from the table and with one great stride swept his immense bulk in front of reinhart his huge blackfurred fist rose in a smashing arc reinhart sailed against the wall struck with ringing force and then slid slowly to the floor  the government troops threw their grapples quickly around him and jerked him to his feet his body was frozen rigid blood dripped from his mouth he spat bits of tooth his eyes glazed over dixon stood dazed mouth open uncomprehending as the grapples closed around his arms and legs  reinharts gun skidded to the floor as he was yanked toward the door one of the elderly council members picked the gun up and examined it curiously he laid it carefully on the table fully loaded he murmured ready to fire  reinharts battered face was dark with hate i should have killed all of you all of you an ugly sneer twisted across his shredded lips if i could get my hands loose  you wont margaret duffe said you might as well not even bother to think about it she signalled to the troops and they pulled reinhart and dixon roughly out of the room two dazed figures snarling and resentful  for a moment the room was silent then the council members shuffled nervously in their seats beginning to breathe again  sherikov came over and put his big paw on margaret duffes shoulder are you all right margaret  she smiled faintly im fine thanks  sherikov touched her soft hair briefly then he broke away and began to pack up his briefcase busily i have to go ill get in touch with you later  where are you going she asked hesitantly cant you stay and  i have to get back to the urals sherikov grinned at her over his bushy black beard as he headed out of the room some very important business to attend to                                       thomas cole was sitting up in bed when sherikov came to the door most of his awkward hunchedover body was sealed in a thin envelope of transparent airproof plastic two robot attendants whirred ceaselessly at his side their leads contacting his pulse bloodpressure respiration body temperature  cole turned a little as the huge pole tossed down his briefcase and seated himself on the window ledge  how are you feeling sherikov asked him  better  you see weve quite advanced therapy your burns should be healed in a few months  how is the war coming  the war is over  coles lips moved icarus  icarus went as expected as you expected sherikov leaned toward the bed cole i promised you something i mean to keep my promiseas soon as youre well enough  to return me to my own time  thats right its a relatively simple matter now that reinhart has been removed from power youll be back home again back in your own time your own world we can supply you with some discs of platinum or something of the kind to finance your business youll need a new fixit truck tools and clothes a few thousand dollars ought to do it  cole was silent  ive already contacted historesearch sherikov continued the time bubble is ready as soon as you are were somewhat beholden to you as you probably realize youve made it possible for us to actualize our greatest dream the whole planet is seething with excitement were changing our economy over from war to  they dont resent what happened the dud must have made an awful lot of people feel downright bad  at first but they got over itas soon as they understood what was ahead too bad you wont be here to see it cole a whole world breaking loose bursting out into the universe they want me to have an ftl ship ready by the end of the week thousands of applications are already on file men and women wanting to get in on the initial flight  cole smiled a little there wont be any band there no parade or welcoming committee waiting for them  maybe not maybe the first ship will wind up on some dead world nothing but sand and dried salt but everybody wants to go its almost like a holiday people running around and shouting and throwing things in the streets  afraid i must get back to the labs lots of reconstruction work being started sherikov dug into his bulging briefcase by the way one little thing while youre recovering here you might like to look at these he tossed a handful of schematics on the bed  cole picked them up slowly whats this  just a little thing i designed sherikov arose and lumbered toward the door were realigning our political structure to eliminate any recurrence of the reinhart affair this will block any more oneman power grabs he jabbed a thick finger at the schematics itll turn power over to all of us not to just a limited number one person could dominatethe way reinhart dominated the council  this gimmick makes it possible for citizens to raise and decide issues directly they wont have to wait for the council to verbalize a measure any citizen can transmit his will with one of these make his needs register on a central control that automatically responds when a large enough segment of the population wants a certain thing done these little gadgets set up an active field that touches all the others an issue wont have to go through a formal council the citizens can express their will long before any bunch of grayhaired old men could get around to it                                       sherikov broke off frowning  of course he continued slowly theres one little detail  whats that  i havent been able to get a model to function a few bugs such intricate work never was in my line he paused at the door well i hope ill see you again before you go maybe if you feel well enough later on we could get together for one last talk maybe have dinner together sometime eh  but thomas cole wasnt listening he was bent over the schematics an intense frown on his weathered face his long fingers moved restlessly over the schematics tracing wiring and terminals his lips moved as he calculated  sherikov waited a moment then he stepped out into the hall and softly closed the door after him  he whistled merrily as he strode off down the corridor
