published as an introduction to the new edition of wordsworths complete poetical works 1888   the poet whose works are contained in the present volume was born in the little town of cockermouth in cumberland on april 7 1770 he died at rydal mount in the neighbouring county of westmoreland on april 23 1850 in this long span of mortal years events of vast and enduring moment shook the world a handful of scattered and dependent colonies in the northern continent of america made themselves into one of the most powerful and beneficent of states the ancient monarchy of france and all the old ordering of which the monarchy had been the keystone was overthrown and it was not until after many a violent shock of arms after terrible slaughter of men after strange diplomatic combinations after many social convulsions after many portentous mutations of empire that europe once more settled down for a season into established order and system in england almost alone after the loss of her great possessions across the atlantic ocean the fabric of the state stood fast and firm yet here too in these eighty years an old order slowly gave place to new the restoration of peace after a war conducted with extraordinary tenacity and fortitude led to a still more wonderful display of ingenuity industry and enterprise in the more fruitful field of commerce and of manufactures wealth in spite of occasional vicissitudes increased with amazing rapidity the population of england and wales grew from being seven and a half millions in 1770 to nearly eighteen millions in 1850 political power was partially transferred from a territorial aristocracy to the middle and trading classes laws were made at once more equal and more humane during all the tumult of the great war which for so many years bathed europe in fire through all the throes and agitations in which peace brought forth the new time wordsworth for half a century 17991850 dwelt sequestered in unbroken composure and steadfastness in his chosen home amid the mountains and lakes of his native region working out his own ideal of the high office of the poet  the interpretation of life in books and the development of imagination underwent changes of its own most of the great lights of the eighteenth century were still burning though burning low when wordsworth came into the world pope indeed had been dead for six and twenty years and all the rest of the queen anne men had gone but gray only died in 1771 and goldsmith in 1774 ten years later johnsons pious and manly heart ceased to beat voltaire and rousseau those two diverse oracles of their age both died in 1778 hume had passed away two years before cowper was forty years older than wordsworth but cowpers most delightful work was not produced until 1783 crabbe who anticipated wordsworths choice of themes from rural life while treating them with a sterner realism was virtually his contemporary having been born in 1754 and dying in 1832 the two great names of his own date were scott and coleridge the first born in 1771 and the second a year afterwards then a generation later came another new and illustrious group byron was born in 1788 shelley in 1792 and keats in 1795 wordsworth was destined to see one more orb of the first purity and brilliance rise to its place in the poetic firmament tennysons earliest volume of poems was published in 1830 and in memoriam one of his two masterpieces in 1830 any one who realises for how much these famous names will always stand in the history of human genius may measure the great transition that wordsworths eighty years witnessed in some of mens deepest feelings about art and life and the speaking face of earth and heaven  here too wordsworth stood isolated and apart scott and southey were valued friends but as has been truly said he thought little of scotts poetry and less of southeys of blakes songs of innocence and experience he said there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of lord byron and walter scott coleridge was the only member of the shining company with whom he ever had any real intimacy of mind for whom he ever nourished real deference and admiration as one unrelentingly possessed by thirst of greatness love and beauty and in whose intellectual power as the noble lines in the sixth book of the prelude so gorgeously attest he took the passionate interest of a man at once master disciple and friend it is true to say as emerson says that wordsworths genius was the great exceptional fact of the literature of his period but he had no teachers nor inspirers save nature and solitude  wordsworth was the son of a solicitor and all his early circumstances were homely unpretentious and rather straitened his mother died when he was eight years old and when his father followed her five years later two of his uncles provided means for continuing at cambridge the education which had been begun in the rural grammarschool of hawkshead it was in 1787 that he went up to st johns college he took his bachelors degree at the beginning of 1791 and there his connection with the university ended  for some years after leaving cambridge wordsworth let himself drift he did not feel good enough for the church he shrank from the law fancying that he had talents for command he thought of being a soldier meanwhile he passed a short time desultorily in london towards the end of 1791 through paris he passed on to orleans and blois where he made some friends and spent most of a year he returned to paris in october 1792 france was no longer standing on the top of golden hours the september massacres filled the sky with a lurid flame wordsworth still retained his ardent faith in the revolution and was even ready though no better than a landsman on the deck of a ship struggling with a hideous storm to make common cause with the girondists but the prudence of friends at home forced him back to england before the beginning of the terrible year of 93 with his return closed that first survey of its inheritance which most serious souls are wont to make in the fervid prime of early manhood  it would be idle to attempt any commentary on the bare facts that we have just recapitulated for wordsworth himself has clothed them with their full force and meaning in the prelude this record of the growth of a poets mind told by the poet himself with all the sincerity of which he was capable is never likely to be popular of that as of so much more of his poetry we must say that as a whole it has not the musical harmonious sympathetic quality which seizes us in even the prose of such a book as rousseaus confessions macaulay thought the prelude a poorer and more tiresome excursion with the old flimsy philosophy about the effect of scenery on the mind the old crazy mystical metaphysics and the endless wilderness of twaddle still he admits that there are some fine descriptions and energetic declamations all macaulays tastes and habits of mind made him a poor judge of such a poet as wordsworth he valued spirit energy pomp stateliness of form and diction and actually thought drydens fine lines about tomorrow being falser than the former clay equal to any eight lines in lucretius but his words truly express the effect of the prelude on more vulgar minds than his own george eliot on the other hand who had the inward eye that was not among macaulays gifts found the prelude full of material for a daily liturgy and it is easy to imagine how she fondly lingered as she did over such a thought as this                        there is   one great society alone on earth   the noble living and the noble dead  there is too as may be found imbedded even in wordsworths dullest work many a line of the truest poetical quality such as that on newtons statue in the silent chapel of trinity college    the marble index of a mind for ever   voyaging through strange seas of thought alone  apart however from beautiful lines like this and from many noble passages of high reflection set to sonorous verse this remarkable poem is in its whole effect unique in impressive power as a picture of the advance of an elect and serious spirit from childhood and schooltime through the ordeal of adolescence through close contact with stirring and enormous events to that decisive stage when it has found the sources of its strength and is fully and finally prepared to put its temper to the proof  the three books that describe the poets residence in france have a special and a striking value of their own their presentation of the phases of good mens minds as the successive scenes of the revolution unfolded themselves has real historic interest more than this it is an abiding lesson to brave men how to bear themselves in hours of public stress it portrays exactly that mixture of persevering faith and hope with firm and reasoned judgment with which i like to think that turgot if he had lived would have confronted the workings of the revolutionary power great masters in many kinds have been inspired by the french revolution human genius might seem to have exhausted itself in the burning political passion of burke in the glowing melodrama of fire and tears of carlyle michelet hugo but the ninth tenth and eleventh books of the prelude by their strenuous simplicity their deep truthfulness their slowfooted and inexorable transition from ardent hope to dark imaginations sense of woes to come sorrow for human kind and pain of heart breathe the very spirit of the great catastrophe there is none of the ephemeral glow of the political exhortation none of the tiresome falsity of the dithyramb in history wordsworth might well wish that some dramatic tale endued with livelier shapes and flinging out less guarded words might set forth the lessons of his experience the material was fitting the story of these three books has something of the severity the selfcontrol the inexorable necessity of classic tragedy and like classic tragedy it has a noble end the dregs and sour sediment that reaction from exaggerated hope is so apt to stir in poor natures had no place here the french revolution made the one crisis in wordsworths mental history the one heavy assault on his continence of soul and when he emerged from it all his greatness remained to him after a long spell of depression bewilderment mortification and sore disappointment the old faith in new shapes was given back                    natures self   by all varieties of human love   assisted led me back through opening day   to those sweet counsels between head and heart   whence grew that genuine knowledge fraught with peace   which through the later sinkings of this cause   hath still upheld me and upholds me now  it was six years after his return from france before wordsworth finally settled down in the scenes with which his name and the power of his genius were to be for ever associated during this interval it was that two great sources of personal influence were opened to him he entered upon that close and beloved companionship with his sister which remained unbroken to the end of their days and he first made the acquaintance of coleridge the character of dorothy wordsworth has long taken its place in the gallery of admirable and devoted women who have inspired the work and the thoughts of great men she is a woman indeed said coleridge in mind i mean and heart for her person is such that if you expected to see a pretty woman you would think her rather ordinary if you expected to see an ordinary woman you would think her pretty to the solidity sense and strong intelligence of the wordsworth stock she added a grace a warmth a liveliness peculiarly her own her nature shines transparent in her letters in her truly admirable journal and in every report that we have of her wordsworths own feelings for her and his sense of the debt that he owed to her faithful affection and eager mind he has placed on lasting record  the intimacy with coleridge was as has been said wordsworths one strong friendship and must be counted among the highest examples of that generous relation between great writers unlike in the quality of their genius and unlike in force of character and the fortunes of life they remained bound to one another by sympathies that neither time nor harsh trial ever extinguished coleridge had left cambridge in 1794 had married had started various unsuccessful projects for combining the improvement of mankind with the earning of an income and was now settled in a small cottage at nether stowey in somersetshire with an acre and a half of land from which he hoped to raise corn and vegetables enough to support himself and his wife as well as to feed a couple of pigs on the refuse wordsworth and his sister were settled at racedown near crewkerne in dorsetshire in 1797 they moved to alfoxden in somersetshire their principal inducement to the change being coleridges society the friendship bore fruit in the production of lyrical ballads in 1798 mainly the work of wordsworth but containing no less notable a contribution from coleridge than the ancient mariner the two poets only received thirty guineas for their work and the publisher lost his money the taste of the country was not yet ripe for wordsworths poetic experiment  immediately after the publication of the lyrical ballads the two wordsworths and coleridge started from yarmouth for hamburg coleridges account in satyranes letters published in the biographia literaria of the voyage and of the conversation between the two english poets and klopstock is worth turning to the pastor told them that klopstock was the german milton a very german milton indeed they thought the wordsworths remained for four wintry months at goslar in saxony while coleridge went on to ratzeburg göttingen and other places mastering german and delving in the unwholesome quicksilver mines of metaphysic depths wordsworth made little way with the language but worked diligently at his own verse  when they came back to england wordsworth and his sister found their hearts turning with irresistible attraction to their own familiar countryside they at last made their way to grasmere the opening book of the recluse which is published for the first time in the present volume describes in fine verse the emotions and the scene the face of this delicious vale is not quite what it was when                    cottages of mountain stone   clustered like stars some few but single most   and lurking dimly in their shy retreats   or glancing at each other cheerful looks   like separated stars with clouds between  but it is foolish to let ourselves be fretted by the villa the hotel and the tourist we may well be above all this in a scene that is haunted by a great poetic shade the substantial features and elements of beauty still remain the crags and woody steeps the lake its one green island and its winding shores the multitude of little rocky hills wordsworth was not the first poet to feel its fascination gray visited the lakes in the autumn of 1769 and coming into the vale of grasmere from the northwest declared it to be one of the sweetest landscapes that art ever attempted to imitate an unsuspected paradise of peace and rusticity we cannot indeed compare the little crystal mere set like a gem in the verdant circle of the hills with the grandeur and glory of lucerne or the radiant gladness and expanse of como yet it has an inspiration of its own to delight to soothe to fortify and to refresh    what want we have we not perpetual streams   warm woods and sunny hills and fresh green fields   and mountains not less green and flocks and herds   and thickets full of songsters and the voice   of lordly birds an unexpected sound   heard now and then from morn to latest eve   admonishing the man who walks below   of solitude and silence in the sky   these have we and a thousand nooks of earth   have also these but nowhere else is found   nowhere or is it fancy can be found   the one sensation that is heretis the sense   of majesty and beauty and repose   a blended holiness of earth and sky   something that makes this individual spot   this small abidingplace of many men   a termination and a last retreat   a centre come from wheresoeer you will   a whole without dependence or defect   made for itself and happy in itself   perfect contentment unity entire  in the grasmere vale wordsworth lived for half a century first in a little cottage at the northern corner of the lake and then 1813 in a more commodious house at rydal mount at the southern end on the road to ambleside in 1802 he married mary hutchinson of penrith and this completed the circle of his felicity mary he once said was to his ear the most musical and most truly english in sound of all the names we have the name was of harmonious omen the two beautiful sonnets that he wrote on his wifes portrait long years after when morning into noon had passed noon into eve show how much her large heart and humble mind had done for the blessedness of his home  their life was almost more simple than that of the dalesmen their neighbours it is my opinion ran one of his oracular sayings to sir george beaumont that a man of letters and indeed all public men of every pursuit should be severely frugal means were found for supporting the modest home out of two or three small windfalls bequeathed by friends or relatives and by the time that children had begun to come wordsworth was raised to affluence by obtaining the post of distributor of stamps for westmoreland and part of cumberland his life was happily devoid of striking external incident its essential part lay in meditation and composition  he was surrounded by friends southey had made a home for himself and his beloved library a few miles over the hills at keswick de quincey with his clever brains and shallow character took up his abode in the cottage which wordsworth had first lived in at grasmere coleridge born the most golden genius of them all came to and fro in those fruitless unhappy wanderings which consumed a life that once promised to be so rich in blessing and in glory in later years dr arnold built a house at fox how attracted by the wordsworths and the scenery and other lesser lights came into the neighbourhood our intercourse with the wordsworths arnold wrote on the occasion of his first visit in 1832 was one of the brightest spots of all nothing could exceed their friendliness and my almost daily walks with him were things not to be forgotten once and once only we had a good fight about the reform bill during a walk up greenhead ghyll to see the unfinished sheepfold recorded in michael but i am sure that our political disagreement did not at all interfere with our enjoyment of each others society for i think that in the great principles of things we agreed very entirely it ought to be possible for that matter for magnanimous men even if they do not agree in the great principles of things to keep pleasant terms with one another for more than one afternoons walk many pilgrims came and the poet seems to have received them with cheerful equanimity emerson called upon him in 1833 and found him plain elderly whitehaired not prepossessing he led me out into his garden and showed me the gravel walk in which thousands of his lines were composed he had just returned from staffa and within three days had made three sonnets on fingals cave and was composing a fourth when he was called in to see me he said if you are interested in my verses perhaps you will like to hear these lines i gladly assented and he recollected himself for a few moments and then stood forth and repeated one after the other the three entire sonnets with great animation this recitation was so unlooked for and surprisinghe the old wordsworth standing apart and reciting to me in a gardenwalk like a schoolboy declaimingthat i at first was near to laugh but recollecting myself that i had come thus far to see a poet and he was chanting poems to me i saw that he was right and i was wrong and gladly gave myself up to hear he never was in haste to publish partly because he corrected a good deal he preferred such of his poems as touched the affections to any others for whatever is didacticwhat theories of society and so onmight perish quickly but whatever combined a truth with an affection was good today and good for ever english traits ch i  wordsworth was far too wise to encourage the pilgrims to turn into abiding sojourners in his chosen land clough has described how when he was a lad of eighteen 1837 with a mild surprise he heard the venerable poet correct the tendency to exaggerate the importance of flowers and fields lakes waterfalls and scenery people come to the lakes said wordsworth and are charmed with a particular spot and build a house and find themselves discontented forgetting that these things are only the sauce and garnish of life  in spite of a certain hardness and stiffness wordsworth must have been an admirable companion for anybody capable of true elevation of mind the unfortunate haydon says with his usual accent of enthusiasm after a saunter at hampstead never did any man so beguile the time as wordsworth his purity of heart his kindness his soundness of principle his information his knowledge and the intense and eager feelings with which he pours forth all he knows affect interest and enchant one autobiog i 298 384 the diary of crabb robinson the correspondence of charles lamb the delightful autobiography of mrs fletcher and much less delightfully the autobiography of harriet martineau all help us to realise by many a trait wordsworths daily walk and conversation of all the glimpses that we get from these and many other sources none are more pleasing than those of the intercourse between wordsworth and scott they were the two manliest and most wholesome men of genius of their time they held different theories of poetic art but their affection and esteem for one another never varied from the early days when scott and his young wife visited wordsworth in his cottage at grasmere down to that sorrowful autumn evening 1831 when wordsworth and his daughter went to abbotsford to bid farewell to the wondrous potentate then just about to start on his vain search for new life followed by the might of the whole earths good wishes  of wordsworths demeanour and physical presence de quinceys account silly coxcombical and vulgar is the worst carlyles as might be expected from his magical gift of portraiture is the best carlyle cared little for wordsworths poetry had a real respect for the antique greatness of his devotion to poverty and peasanthood recognised his strong intellectual powers and strong character but thought him rather dull badtempered unproductive and almost wearisome and found his divine reflections and unfathomabilities stinted scanty uncertain palish from these and many other disparagements one gladly passes to the picture of the poet as he was in the flesh at a breakfastparty given by henry taylor at a tavern in st jamess street in 1840 the subject of the talk was literature its laws practices and observanceshe talked well in his way with veracity easy brevity and force as a wise tradesman would of his tools and workshop and as no unwise one could his voice was good frank and sonorous though practically clear distinct and forcible rather than melodious the tone of him businesslike sedately confident no discourtesy yet no anxiety about being courteous a fine wholesome rusticity fresh as his mountain breezes sat well on the stalwart veteran and on all he said and did you would have said he was a usually taciturn man glad to unlock himself to audience sympathetic and intelligent when such offered itself his face bore marks of much not always peaceful meditation the look of it not bland or benevolent so much as close impregnable and hard a man multa tacere loquive paratus in a world where he had experienced no lack of contradictions as he strode along the eyes were not very brilliant but they had a quiet clearness there was enough of brow and well shaped rather too much of cheek horseface i have heard satirists say face of squarish shape and decidedly longish as i think the head itself was its length going horizontal he was largeboned lean but still firmknit tall and stronglooking when he stood a right good old steelgray figure with rustic simplicity and dignity about him and a vivacious strength looking through him which might have suited one of those old steelgray markgrafs graf  grausteelgray whom henry the fowler set up to ward the marches and do battle with the intrusive heathen in a stalwart and judicious manner  whoever might be his friends within an easy walk or dwelling afar the poet knew how to live his own life the three fine sonnets headed personal talk so well known so warmly accepted in our better hours so easily forgotten in hours not so good between pleasant levities and grinding preoccupations show us how little his neighbours had to do with the poets genial seasons of smooth passions smooth discourse and joyous thought  for those days wordsworth was a considerable traveller between 1820 and 1837 he made long tours abroad to switzerland to holland to belgium to italy in other years he visited wales scotland and ireland he was no mechanical tourist admiring to order and marvelling by regulation and he confessed to mrs fletcher that he fell asleep before the venus de medici at florence but the product of these wanderings is to be seen in some of his best sonnets such as the first on calais beach the famous one on westminster bridge the second of the two on bruges where the spirit of antiquity mounts to the seat of grace within the minda deeper peace than that in deserts foundand in some other fine pieces  in weightier matters than mere travel wordsworth showed himself no mere recluse he watched the great affairs then being transacted in europe with the ardent interest of his youth and his sonnets to liberty commemorating the attack by france upon the swiss the fate of venice the struggle of hofer the resistance of spain give no unworthy expression to some of the best of the many and varied motives that animated england in her long struggle with bonaparte the sonnet to toussaint louverture concludes with some of the noblest lines in the english language the strong verses on the expected death of mr fox are alive with a magnanimous public spirit that goes deeper than the accidents of political opinion in his young days he had sent fox a copy of the lyrical ballads with a long letter indicating his sense of foxs great and generous qualities pitt he admits that he could never regard with complacency i believe him however he said to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell you always went away from burke he once told haydon with your mind filled from fox with your feelings excited and from pitt with wonder at his having had the power to make the worse appear the better reason  of the poems composed under the influence of that best kind of patriotism which ennobles local attachments by associating them with the lasting elements of moral grandeur and heroism it is needless to speak they have long taken their place as something higher even than literary classics as years began to dull the old penetration of a mind which had once approached like other youths the shield of human nature from the golden side and had been eager to clear a passage for just government wordsworth lost his interest in progress waterloo may be taken for the date at which his social grasp began to fail and with it his poetic glow he opposed catholic emancipation as stubbornly as eldon and the reform bill as bitterly as croker for the practical reforms of his day even in education for which he had always spoken up wordsworth was not a force his heart clung to england as he found it this concrete attachment to the scenes about him says mr myers had always formed an important element in his character ideal politics whether in church or state had never occupied his mind which sought rather to find its informing principles embodied in the england of his own day this flowed we may suppose from burke in a passage in the seventh book of the prelude he describes in lines a little prosaic but quite true how he sat saw and heard not unthankful nor uninspired the great orator    while he forewarns denounces launches forth   against all systems built on abstract rights  the church as conceived by the spirit of laud and described by hookers voice was the great symbol of the union of high and stable institution with thought faith right living and sacred religion mother of form and fear as might be expected from such a point of view the church pieces to which wordsworth gave so much thought are with few exceptions such as the sonnet on seathwaite chapel formal hard and very thinly enriched with spiritual graces or unction they are ecclesiastical not religious in religious poetry the church of england finds her most affecting voice not in wordsworth but in the lyra innocentium and the christian year wordsworth abounds in the true devotional cast of mind but less than anywhere else does it show in his properly ecclesiastical verse  it was perhaps natural that when events no longer inspired him wordsworth should have turned with new feelings towards the classic and discovered a virtue in classic form to which his own method had hitherto made him a little blind towards the date of waterloo he read over again some of the latin writers in attempting to prepare his son for college he even at a later date set about a translation of the aeneid of virgil but the one permanent result of the classic movement in his mind is laodamia earlier in life he had translated some books of ariosto at the rate of a hundred lines a day and he even attempted fifteen of the sonnets of michael angelo but so much meaning is compressed into so little room in those pieces that he found the difficulty insurmountable he had a high opinion of the resources of the italian language the poetry of dante and of michael angelo he said proves that if there be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue  our last glimpse of wordsworth in the full and peculiar power of his genius is the ode composed on an evening of extraordinary splendour and beauty it is the one exception to the critical dictum that all his good work was done in the decade between 1798 and 1808 he lived for more than thirty years after this fine composition but he added nothing more of value to the work that he had already done the public appreciation of it was very slow the most influential among the critics were for long hostile and contemptuous never at any time did wordsworth come near to such popularity as that of scott or of byron nor was this all for many years most readers of poetry thought more even of lalla rookh than of the excursion while scott byron and moore were receiving thousands of pounds wordsworth received nothing between 1830 and 1840 the current turned in wordsworths direction and when he received the honour of a doctors degree at the oxford commemoration in 1839 the sheldonian theatre made him the hero of the day in the spring of 1843 southey died and sir robert peel pressed wordsworth to succeed him in the office of poetlaureate it is a tribute of respect said the minister justly due to the first of living poets but almost immediately the light of his common popularity was eclipsed by tennyson as it had earlier been eclipsed by scott by byron and in some degree by shelley yet his fame among those who know among competent critics with a right to judge today stands higher than it ever stood only two writers have contributed so many lines of daily popularity and application in the handbooks of familiar quotations wordsworth fills more space than anybody save shakespeare and pope he exerted commanding influence over great minds that have powerfully affected our generation i never before said george eliot in the days when her character was forming itself 1839 met with so many of my own feelings expressed just as i should like them and her reverence for wordsworth remained to the end js mill has described how important an event in his life was his first reading of wordsworth what made his poems a medicine for my state of mind was that they expressed not mere outward beauty but states of feeling and of thought coloured by feeling under the excitement of beauty i needed to be made to feel that there was real permanent happiness in tranquil contemplation wordsworth taught me this not only without turning away from but with greatly increased interest in the common feelings and common destiny of human beings autobiog 148 this effect of wordsworth on mill is the very illustration of the phrase of a later poet of our own day one of the most eminent and by his friends best beloved of all those whom wordsworth had known and on whom he poured out a generous portion of his own best spirit    time may restore us in his course   goethes sage mind and byrons force   but where will europes latter hour   again find wordsworths healing power  it is the power for which matthew arnold found this happy designation that compensates us for that absence of excitement of which the heedless complain in wordsworths verseexcitement so often meaning mental fever hysterics distorted passion or other fitful agitation of the soul  pretensions are sometimes advanced as to wordsworths historic position which involve a mistaken view of literary history thus we are gravely told by the too zealous wordsworthian that the socalled poets of the eighteenth century were simply men of letters they had various accomplishments and great general ability but their thoughts were expressed in prose or in mere metrical diction which passed current as poetry without being so yet burns belonged wholly to the eighteenth century 175996 and no versewriter is so little literary as burns so little prosaic no writer more truly poetic in melody diction thought feeling and spontaneous song it was burns who showed wordsworths own youth how verse may build a princely throne on humble truth nor can we understand how cowper is to be set down as simply a man of letters we may too if we please deny the name of poetry to collinss tender and pensive ode to evening but we can only do this on critical principles which would end in classing the author of lycidas and comus of the allegro and penseroso as a writer of various accomplishments and great general ability but at bottom simply a man of letters and by no means a poet it is to gray however that we must turn for the distinctive character of the best poetry of the eighteenth century with reluctance we will surrender the pindaric odes though not without risking the observation that some of wordsworths own criticism on gray is as narrow and as much beside the mark as jeffreys on the excursion but the ode on eton college is not to have grudged to it the noble name and true quality of poetry merely because as one of johnsons most unfortunate criticisms expresses it the ode suggests nothing to gray which every beholder does not equally think and feel to find beautiful and pathetic language set to harmonious numbers for the common impressions of meditative minds is no small part of the poets task that part has never been achieved by any poet in any tongue with more complete perfection and success than in the immortal elegy of which we may truly say that it has for nearly a century and a half given to greater multitudes of men more of the exquisite pleasure of poetry than any other single piece in all the glorious treasury of english verse it abounds as johnson says with images which find a mirror in every mind and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo these moving commonplaces of the human lot gray approached through books and studious contemplation not as wordsworth approached them by daily contact with the lives and habit of men and the forces and magical apparitions of external nature but it is a narrow view to suppose that the men of the eighteenth century did not look through the literary conventions of the day to the truths of life and nature behind them the conventions have gone or are changed and we are all glad of it wordsworth effected a wholesome deliverance when he attacked the artificial diction the personifications the allegories the antitheses the barren rhymes and monotonous metres which the reigning taste had approved but while welcoming the new freshness sincerity and direct and fertile return on nature that is a very bad reason why we should disparage poetry so genial so simple so humane and so perpetually pleasing as the best verse of the rationalistic century  what wordsworth did was to deal with themes that had been partially handled by precursors and contemporaries in a larger and more devoted spirit with wider amplitude of illustration and with the steadfastness and persistency of a religious teacher every great poet is a teacher he said i wish to be considered as a teacher or as nothing it may be doubted whether his general proposition is at all true and whether it is any more the essential business of a poet to be a teacher than it was the business of handel beethoven or mozart they attune the soul to high states of feeling the direct lesson is often as nought but of himself no view could be more sound he is a teacher or he is nothing to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and sincerely virtuousthat was his vocation to show that the mutual adaptation of the external world and the inner mind is able to shape a paradise from the simple produce of the common daythat was his high argument  simplification was as i have said elsewhere the keynote of the revolutionary time wordsworth was its purest exponent but he had one remarkable peculiarity which made him in england at least not only its purest but its greatest while leading men to pierce below the artificial and conventional to the natural man and natural life as rousseau did wordsworth still cherished the symbols the traditions and the great institutes of social order simplification of life and thought and feeling was to be accomplished without summoning up the dangerous spirit of destruction and revolt wordsworth lived with nature yet waged no angry railing war against society the chief opposing force to wordsworth in literature was byron whatever he was in his heart byron in his work was drawn by all the forces of his character genius and circumstances to the side of violent social change and hence the extraordinary popularity of byron in the continental camp of emancipation communion with nature is in wordsworths doctrine the school of duty with byron nature is the mighty consoler and the vindicator of the rebel  a curious thing which we may note in passing is that wordsworth who clung fervently to the historic foundations of society as it stands was wholly indifferent to history while byron on the contrary as the fourth canto of childe harold is enough to show had at least the sentiment of history in as great a degree as any poet that ever lived and has given to it by far the most magnificent expression no doubt it was history on its romantic rather than its philosophic or its political side  on wordsworths exact position in the hierarchy of sovereign poets a deep difference of estimate still divides even the most excellent judges nobody now dreams of placing him so low as the edinburgh reviewers did nor so high as southey placed him when he wrote to the author of philip van artevelde in 1829 that a greater poet than wordsworth there never has been nor ever will be an extravagance of this kind was only the outburst of generous friendship coleridge deliberately placed wordsworth nearest of all modern writers to shakespeare and milton yet in a kind perfectly unborrowed and his own arnold himself a poet of rare and memorable quality declares his firm belief that the poetical performance of wordsworth is after that of shakespeare and milton undoubtedly the most considerable in our language from the elizabethan age to the present time dryden pope gray cowper goldsmith burns coleridge byron shelley keatswordsworths name deserves to stand and will finally stand above them all mr myers also a poet and the author of a volume on wordsworth as much distinguished by insight as by admirable literary grace and power talks of a plato a dante a wordsworth all three in a breath as stars of equal magnitude in the great spiritual firmament to mr swinburne on the contrary all these panegyrical estimates savour of monstrous and intolerable exaggeration amid these contentions of celestial minds it will be safest to content ourselves with one or two plain observations in the humble positive degree without hurrying into high and final comparatives and superlatives  one admission is generally made at the outset whatever definition of poetry we fix upon whether that it is the language of passion or imagination formed into regular numbers or with milton that it should be simple sensuous impassioned in any case there are great tracts in wordsworth which by no definition and on no terms can be called poetry if we say with shelley that poetry is what redeems from decay the visitations of the divinity in man and is the record of the best and happiest moments of the best and happiest minds then are we bound to agree that wordsworth records too many moments that are not specially good or happy that he redeems from decay frequent visitations that are not from any particular divinity in man and treats them all as very much on a level mr arnold is undoubtedly right in his view that to be receivable as a classic wordsworth must be relieved of a great deal of the poetical baggage that now encumbers him  the faults and hindrances in wordsworths poetry are obvious to every reader for one thing the intention to instruct to improve the occasion is too deliberate and too hardly pressed we hate poetry said keats that has a palpable design upon us poetry should be great and unobtrusive charles lambs friendly remonstrance on one of wordsworths poems is applicable to more of them the instructions conveyed in it are too direct they dont slide into the mind of the reader while he is imagining no such matter  then except the sonnets and half a score of the pieces where he reaches his topmost height there are few of his poems that are not too long and it often happens even that no degree of reverence for the teacher prevents one from finding passages of almost unbearable prolixity a defence was once made by a great artist for what to the unregenerate mind seemed the merciless tardiness of movement in one of goethes romances that it was meant to impress on his readers the slow march and the tedium of events in human life the lenient reader may give wordsworth the advantage of the same ingenious explanation we may venture on a counsel which is more to the point in warning the student that not seldom in these blocks of afflicting prose suddenly we come upon some of the profoundest and most beautiful passages that the poet ever wrote in deserts of preaching we find almost within sight of one another delightful oases of purest poetry besides being prolix wordsworth is often cumbrous has often no flight is not liquid is not musical he is heavy and selfconscious with the burden of his message how much at his best he is when as in the admirable and truly wordsworthian poem of michael he spares us a sermon and leaves us the story then he is apt to wear a somewhat stiffcut garment of solemnity when not solemnity but either sternness or sadness which are so different things would seem the fitter mood in truth wordsworth hardly knows how to be stern as dante or milton was stern nor has he the note of plangent sadness which strikes the ear in men as morally inferior to him as rousseau keats shelley or coleridge nor has he the olympian air with which goethe delivered sage oracles this mere solemnity is specially oppressive in some parts of the excursionthe performance where we best see the whole poet and where the poet most absolutely identifies himself with his subject yet even in the midst of these solemn discoursings he suddenly introduces an episode in which his peculiar power is at its height there is no better instance of this than the passage in the second book of the excursion where he describes with a fidelity at once realistic and poetic the wornout almsman his patient life and sorry death and then the unimaginable vision in the skies as they brought the ancient man down through dull mists from the mountain ridge to die these hundred and seventy lines are like the landscape in which they were composed you can no more appreciate the beauty of the one by a single or a second perusal than you can the other in a scamper through the vale on the box of the coach but any lover of poetry who will submit himself with leisure and meditation to the impressions of the story the pity of it the naturalness of it the glory and the mystic splendours of the indifferent heavens will feel that here indeed is the true strength which out of the trivial raises expression for the pathetic and the sublime  apart however from excess of prolixity and of solemnity can it be really contended that in purely poetic qualityin aerial freedom and space in radiant purity of light or depth and variety of colour in penetrating and subtle sweetness of music in supple mastery of the instrument in vivid spontaneity of imagination in cleancut sureness of touchwordsworth is not surpassed by men who were below him in weight and greatness even in his own field of the simple and the pastoral has he touched so sweet and spontaneous a note as burnss daisy or the mouse when men seek immersion or absorption in the atmosphere of pure poesy without lesson or moral or anything but delight of fancy and stir of imagination they will find him less congenial to their mood than poets not worthy to loose the latchet of his shoe in the greater elements of his art in all these comparisons it is not merely wordsworths theme and motive and dominant note that are different the skill of hand is different and the musical ear and the imaginative eye  to maintain or to admit so much as this however is not to say the last word the question is whether wordsworth however unequal to shelley in lyric quality to coleridge or to keats in imaginative quality to burns in tenderness warmth and that humour which is so nearly akin to pathos to byron in vividness and energy yet possesses excellences of his own which place him in other respects above these masterspirits of his time if the question is to be answered affirmatively it is clear that only in one direction must we look the trait that really places wordsworth on an eminence above his poetic contemporaries and ranks him as the ages are likely to rank him on a line just short of the greatest of all time is his direct appeal to will and conduct there is volition and selfgovernment in every line of his poetry and his best thoughts come from his steady resistance to the ebb and flow of ordinary desires and regrets he contests the ground inch by inch with all despondent and indolent humours and often too with movements of inconsiderate and wasteful joy rh hutton that would seem to be his true distinction and superiority over men to whom more had been given of fire passion and ravishing music those who deem the end of poetry to be intoxication fever or rainbow dreams can care little for wordsworth if its end be not intoxication but on the contrary a search from the wide regions of imagination and feeling for elements of composure deep and pure and of selfgovernment in a far loftier sense than the merely prudential then wordsworth has a gift of his own in which he was approached by no poet of his time scotts sane and humane genius with much the same aims yet worked with different methods he once remonstrated with lockhart for being too apt to measure things by some reference to literature i have read books enough said scott and observed and conversed with enough of eminent and splendidly cultivated minds but i assure you i have heard higher sentiments from the lips of poor uneducated men and women when exerting the spirit of severe yet gentle heroism under difficulties and afflictions or speaking their simple thoughts as to circumstances in the lot of friends and neighbours than i ever yet met with out of the pages of the bible we shall never learn to respect our real calling and destiny unless we have taught ourselves to consider everything as moonshine compared with the education of the heart this admirable deliverance of scotts is so far as it goes eminently wordsworthian but wordsworth went higher and further striving not only to move the sympathies of the heart but to enlarge the understanding and exalt and widen the spiritual vision all with the aim of leading us towards firmer and austerer selfcontrol  certain favourers of wordsworth answer our question with a triumphant affirmative on the strength of some ethical or metaphysical or theological system which they believe themselves to find in him but is it credible that poets can permanently live by systems or is not system whether ethical theological or philosophical the heavy lead of poetry lucretius is indisputably one of the mighty poets of the world but epicureanism is not the soul of that majestic muse so with wordsworth thought is on the whole predominant over feeling in his verse but a prevailing atmosphere of deep and solemn reflection does not make a system his theology and his ethics and his socalled platonical metaphysics have as little to do with the power of his poetry over us as the imputed arianism or any other aspect of the theology of paradise lost has to do with the strength and the sublimity of milton and his claim to a high perpetual place in the hearts of men it is best to be entirely sceptical as to the existence of system and ordered philosophy in wordsworth when he tells us that one impulse from a vernal wood may teach you more of man of moral evil and of good than all the sages can such a proposition cannot be seriously taken as more than a halfplayful sally for the benefit of some too bookish friend no impulse from a vernal wood can teach us anything at all of moral evil and of good when he says that it is his faith that every flower enjoys the air it breathes and that when the budding twigs spread out their fan to catch the air he is compelled to think that there was pleasure there he expresses a charming poetic fancy and no more and it is idle to pretend to see in it the fountain of a system of philosophy in the famous ode on intimations of immortality the poet doubtless does point to a set of philosophic ideas more or less complete but the thought from which he sets out that our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting and that we are less and less able to perceive the visionary gleam less and less alive to the glory and the dream of external nature as infancy recedes further from us is with all respect for the declaration of mr ruskin to the contrary contrary to notorious fact experience and truth it is a beggarly conception no doubt to judge as if poetry should always be capable of a prose rendering but it is at least fatal to the philosophic pretension of a line or a stanza if when it is fairly reduced to prose the prose discloses that it is nonsense and there is at least one stanza of the great ode that this doom would assuredly await wordsworths claim his special gift his lasting contribution lies in the extraordinary strenuousness sincerity and insight with which he first idealises and glorifies the vast universe around us and then makes of it not a theatre on which men play their parts but an animate presence intermingling with our works pouring its companionable spirit about us and breathing grandeur upon the very humblest face of human life this twofold and conjoint performance consciously and expresslyperhaps only too consciouslyundertaken by a man of strong inborn sensibility to natural impressions and systematically carried out in a lifetime of brooding meditation and active composition is wordsworths distinguishing title to fame and gratitude in words that speak of nothing more than what we are he revealed new faces of nature he dwelt on men as they are men themselves he strove to do that which has been declared to be the true secret of force in art to make the trivial serve the expression of the sublime wordsworths distinctive work mr ruskin has justly said modern painters iii 293 was a war with pomp and pretence and a display of the majesty of simple feelings and humble hearts together with high reflective truth in his analysis of the courses of politics and ways of men without these his love of nature would have been comparatively worthless  yet let us not forget that he possessed the gift which to an artist is the very root of the matter he saw nature truly he saw her as she is and with his own eyes the critic whom i have just quoted boldly pronounces him the keenest eyed of all modern poets for what is deep and essential in nature when he describes the daisy casting the beauty of its starshaped shadow on the smooth stone or the boundless depth of the abysses of the sky or the clouds made vivid as fire by the rays of light every touch is true not the copying of a literary phrase but the result of direct observation  it is true that nature has sides to which wordsworth was not energetically alivenature red in tooth and claw he was not energetically alive to the blind and remorseless cruelties of life and the world when in early spring he heard the blended notes of the birds and saw the budding twigs and primrose tufts it grieved him amid such fair works of nature to think what man has made of man as if nature itself excluding the conscious doings of that portion of nature which is the human race and excluding also natures own share in the making of poor man did not abound in raking cruelties and horrors of her own edel sei der mensch sang goethe in a noble psalm hulfreich und gut denn das allein unterscheidet ihn von allen wesen die wir kennen let man be noble helpful and good for that alone distinguishes him from all beings that we know no feeling has nature to good and bad gives the sun his light and for the evildoer as for the best shine moon and stars that the laws which nature has fixed for our lives are mighty and eternal wordsworth comprehended as fully as goethe but not that they are laws pitiless as iron wordsworth had not rooted in him the sense of fateof the inexorable sequences of things of the terrible chain that so often binds an awful end to some slight and trivial beginning  this optimism or complacency in wordsworth will be understood if we compare his spirit and treatment with that of the illustrious french painter whose subjects and whose life were in some ways akin to his own millet like wordsworth went to the realities of humble life for his inspiration the peasant of the great french plains and the forest was to him what the cumbrian dalesman was to wordsworth but he saw the peasant differently you watch figures in the fields said millet digging and delving with spade or pick you see one of them from time to time straightening his loins and wiping his face with the back of his hand thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat of thy brow is that the gay lively labour in which some people would have you believe yet it is there that for me you must seek true humanity and great poetry they say that i deny the charm of the country i find in it far more than charms i find infinite splendours i see in it just as they do the little flowers of which christ said that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of them i see clearly enough the sun as he spreads his splendour amid the clouds none the less do i see on the plain all smoking the horses at the plough i see in some stony corner a man all worn out whose han han have been heard ever since daybreaktrying to straighten himself a moment to get breath the hardness the weariness the sadness the ugliness out of which millets consummate skill made pictures that affect us like strange music were to wordsworth not the real part of the thing they were all absorbed in the thought of nature as a whole wonderful mighty harmonious and benign  we are not called upon to place great men of his stamp as if they were collegians in a classlist it is best to take with thankfulness and admiration from each man what he has to give what wordsworth does is to assuage to reconcile to fortify he has not shakespeares richness and vast compass nor miltons sublime and unflagging strength nor dantes severe vivid ardent force of vision probably he is too deficient in clear beauty of form and in concentrated power to be classed by the ages among these great giants we cannot be sure we may leave it to the ages to decide but wordsworth at any rate by his secret of bringing the infinite into common life as he evokes it out of common life has the skill to lead us so long as we yield ourselves to his influence into inner moods of settled peace to touch the depth and not the tumult of the soul to give us quietness strength steadfastness and purpose whether to do or to endure all art or poetry that has the effect of breathing into mens hearts even if it be only for a space these moods of settled peace and strongly confirming their judgment and their will for goodwhatever limitations may be found besides however prosaic may be some or much of the detailis great art and noble poetry and the creator of it will always hold as wordsworth holds a sovereign title to the reverence and gratitude of mankind     aphorisms1  footnote 1 an address delivered before the edinburgh philosophical institution november 11 1887   since i accepted the honour of the invitation to deliver the opening address of your course i have found no small difficulty in settling down on an appropriate subject i half wrote a discourse on modern democracyhow the rule of numbers is to be reconciled with the rule of sage judgment and the passion for liberty and equality is to be reconciled with sovereign regard for law authority and order and how our hopes for the future are to be linked to wise reverence for tradition and the past but your secretary had emphatically warned me off all politics and i feared that however carefully i might be on my guard against every reference to the burning questions of the hour yet the clever eyes of political charity would be sure to spy out party innuendoes in the most innocent deliverances of purely abstract philosophy then for a day or two i lingered over a subject in a little personal incident one saturday night last summer i found myself dining with an illustrious statesman on the welsh border and on the monday following i was seated under the acacias by the shore of the lake of geneva where gibbon a hundred years ago almost to the day had according to his own famous words laid down his pen after writing the last lines of his last page and there under a serene sky with the silver orb of the moon reflected from the waters and amid the silence of nature felt his joy at the completion of an immortal task dashed by melancholy that he had taken everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion it was natural that i should meditate on the contrast that might be drawn between great literary performance and great political performance between the making of history and the writing of ita contrast containing matter enough not only for one but for a whole series of edifying and instructive discourses but there were difficulties here too and the edifying discourse remains like many another incomplete  so i am going to ask you after all to pass a tranquil hour with me in pondering a quiet chapter in the history of books there is a loud cry in these days for clues that shall guide the plain man through the vast bewildering labyrinth of printed volumes everybody calls for hints what to read and what to look out for in reading like all the rest of us i have often been asked for a list of the hundred best books and the other day a gentleman wrote to me to give him by return of post that far more difficult thinglist of the three best books in the world both the hundred and the three are a task far too high for me but perhaps you will let me try to indicate what among so much else is one of the things best worth hunting for in books and one of the quarters of the library where you may get on the scent though tranquil it will be my fault if you find the hour dull for this particular literary chapter concerns life manners society conduct human nature our aims our ideals and all besides that is most animated and most interesting in mans busy chase after happiness and wisdom  what is wisdom that sovereign word as has often been pointed out is used for two different things it may stand for knowledge learning science systematic reasoning or it may mean as coleridge has defined it common sense in an uncommon degree that is to say the unsystematic truths that come to shrewd penetrating and observant minds from their own experience of life and their daily commerce with the world and that is called the wisdom of life or the wisdom of the world or the wisdom of time and the ages the greeks had two words for these two kinds of wisdom one for the wise who scaled the heights of thought and knowledge another for those who without logical method technical phraseology or any of the parade of the schools whether academics old and new cynic peripatetic the sect epicurean or stoic severe held up the mirror to human nature and took good counsel as to the ordering of character and of life  mill in his little fragment on aphorisms has said that in the first kind of wisdom every age in which science flourishes ought to surpass the ages that have gone before in knowledge and methods of science each generation starts from the point at which its predecessor left off but in the wisdom of life in the maxims of good sense applied to public and to private conduct there is said mill a pretty nearly equal amount in all ages  if this seem doubtful to any one let him think how many of the shrewdest moralities of human nature are to be found in writings as ancient as the apocryphal book of the wisdom of solomon and of jesus the son of sirach as aesops fables as the oracular sentences that are to be found in homer and the greek dramatists and orators as all that immense host of wise and pithy saws which to the number of between four and five thousand were collected from all ancient literature by the industry of erasmus in his great folio of adages as we turn over these pages of old time we almost feel that those are right who tell us that everything has been said that the thing that has been is the thing that shall be and there is no new thing under the sun even so we are happily not bound to schopenhauers gloomy conclusion werke v 332 that the wise men of all times have always said the same and the fools that is the immense majority of all times have always done the same that is to say the opposite of what the wise have said and that is why voltaire tells us that we shall leave this world just as stupid and as bad as we found it when we came here  it is natural that this second kind of wisdom being detached and unsystematic should embody itself in the short and pregnant form of proverb sentence maxim and aphorism the essence of aphorism is the compression of a mass of thought and observation into a single saying it is the very opposite of dissertation and declamation its distinction is not so much ingenuity as good sense brought to a point it ought to be neither enigmatical nor flat neither a truism on the one hand nor a riddle on the other these wise sayings said bacon the author of some of the wisest of them are not only for ornament but for action and business having a point or edge whereby knots in business are pierced and discovered and he applauds ciceros description of such sayings as saltpitsthat you may extract salt out of them and sprinkle it where you will they are the guiding oracles which man has found out for himself in that great business of ours of learning how to be to do to do without and to depart their range extends from prudential kitchen maxims such as franklin set forth in the sayings of poor richard about thrift in time and money up to such great and high moralities of life as are the prose maxims of goethejust as bacons essays extend from precepts as to building and planting up to solemn reflections on truth death and the vicissitudes of things they cover the whole field of man as he is and life as it is not of either as they ought to be friendship ambition money studies business public duty in all their actual laws and conditions as they are and not as the ideal moralist may wish that they were  the substance of the wisdom of life must be commonplace for the best of it is the result of the common experience of the world its most universal and important propositions must in a certain sense be truisms the road has been so broadly trodden by the hosts who have travelled along it that the main rules of the journey are clear enough and we all know that the secret of breakdown and wreck is seldom so much an insufficient knowledge of the route as imperfect discipline of the will the truism however and the commonplace may be stated in a form so fresh pungent and free from triviality as to have all the force of new discovery hence the need for a caution that few maxims are to be taken without qualification they seek sharpness of impression by excluding one side of the matter and exaggerating another and most aphorisms are to be read as subject to all sorts of limits conditions and corrections  it has been said that the order of our knowledge is this that we know best first what we have divined by native instinct second what we have learned by experience of men and things third what we have learned not in books but by booksthat is by the reflections that they suggest fourth last and lowest what we have learned in books or with masters the virtue of an aphorism comes under the third of these heads it conveys a portion of a truth with such point as to set us thinking on what remains montaigne who delighted in plutarch and kept him ever on his table praises him in that besides his long discourses there are a thousand others which he has only touched and glanced upon where he only points with his finger to direct us which way we may go if we will and contents himself sometimes with only giving one brisk hit in the nicest article of the question from whence we are to grope out the rest and this is what plutarch himself is driving at when he warns young men that it is well to go for a light to another mans fire but by no means to tarry by it instead of kindling a torch of their own  grammarians draw a distinction between a maxim and an aphorism and tell us that while an aphorism only states some broad truth of general bearing a maxim besides stating the truth enjoins a rule of conduct as its consequence for instance to say that there are some men with just imagination enough to spoil their judgment is an aphorism but there is action as well as thought in such sayings as this tis a great sign of mediocrity to be always reserved in praise or in this of m aurelius when thou wishest to give thyself delight think of the excellences of those who live with thee for instance of the energy of one the modesty of another the liberal kindness of a third again according to this distinction of the word we are to give the name of aphorism to pascals saying that most of the mischief in the world would never happen if men would only be content to sit still in their parlours1 but we should give the name of maxim to the profound and admirably humane counsel of a philosopher of a very different school that if you would love mankind you should not expect too much from them  footnote 1 la bruyère also saysall mischief comes from our not being able to be alone hence play luxury dissipation wine ignorance calumny envy forgetfulness of ones self and of god  but the distinction is one without much difference we need not labour it nor pay it further attention aphorism or maxim let us remember that this wisdom of life is the true salt of literature that those books at least in prose are most nourishing which are most richly stored with it and that it is one of the main objects apart from the mere acquisition of knowledge which men ought to seek in the reading of books  a living painter has said that the longer he works the more does be realise how very little anybody except the trained artist actually perceives in the natural objects constantly before him how blind men are to impressions of colour and light and form which would be full of interest and delight if people only knew how to see them are not most of us just as blind to the thousand lights and shades in the men and women around us we live in the world as we live among fellowinmates in a hotel or fellowrevellers at a masquerade yet this to bring knowledge of ourselves and others home to our business and our bosoms is one of the most important parts of culture  some prejudice is attached in generous minds to this wisdom of the world as being egotistical poor unimaginative of the earth earthy since the great literary reaction at the end of the last century men have been apt to pitch criticism of life in the high poetic key they have felt with wordsworth    the human nature unto which i felt   that i belonged and reverenced with love   was not a punctual presence but a spirit   diffused through time and space with aid derived   of evidence from monuments erect   prostrate or leaning towards their common rest   in earth the widelyscattered wreck sublime   of vanished nations  then again there is another cause for the passing eclipse of interest in wisdom of the world extraordinary advances have been made in ordered knowledge of the various stages of the long prehistoric dawn of human civilisation the man of the flint implement and the firedrill who could only count up to five and who was content to live in a hut like a beehive has drawn interest away from the man of the market and the parlour the literary passion for primitive times and the raw material of man has thrust polished man the manufactured article into a secondary place all this is in the order of things it is fitting enough that we should pierce into the origins of human nature it is right too that the poets the ideal interpreters of life should be dearer to us than those who stop short with mere deciphering of what is real and actual the poet has his own sphere of the beautiful and the sublime but it is no less true that the enduring weight of historian moralist political orator or preacher depends on the amount of the wisdom of life that is hived in his pages they may be admirable by virtue of other qualities by learning by grasp by majesty of flight but it is his moral sentences on mankind or the state that rank the prose writer among the sages these show that he has an eye for the large truths of action for the permanent bearings of conduct and for things that are for the guidance of all generations what is it that makes plutarchs lives the pasture of great souls as they were called by one who was herself a great soul because his aim was much less to tell a story than as he says to decipher the man and his nature and in deciphering the man to strike out pregnant and fruitful thoughts on all men why was it worth while for mr jowett the other day to give us a new translation of thucydides history of the peloponnesian war and why is it worth your while at least to dip in a serious spirit into its pages partly because the gravity and concision of thucydides are of specially wholesome example in these days of overcoloured and overvoluminous narrative partly because he knows how to invest the wreck and overthrow of those small states with the pathos and dignity of mighty imperial fall but most of all for the sake of the wise sentences that are sown with apt but not unsparing hand through the progress of the story well might gray ask his friend whether thucydides description of the final destruction of the athenian host at syracuse was not the finest thing he ever read in his life and assuredly the man who can read that stern tale without admiration pity and awe may be certain that he has no taste for noble composition and no feeling for the deepest tragedy of mortal things but it is the sagacious sentences in the speeches of athenians corinthians lacedaemonians that do most of all to give to the historian his perpetuity of interest to every reader with the rudiments of a political instinct and make thucydides as modern as if he had written yesterday  tacitus belongs to a different class among the great writers of the world he had beyond almost any author of the front rank that has ever lived the art of condensing his thought and driving it home to the mind of the reader with a flash beyond almost anybody he suffered from what a famous writer of aphorisms in our time has described as the cursed ambition to put a whole book into a page a whole page into a phrase and the phrase into a word but the moral thought itself in tacitus mostly belongs less to the practical wisdom of life than to sombre poetic indignation like that of dante against the perversities of men and the blindness of fortune  horaces epistles are a mine of genial friendly humane observation then there is none of the ancient moralists to whom the modern from montaigne charron ralegh bacon downwards owe more than to seneca seneca has no spark of the kindly warmth of horace he has not the animation of plutarch he abounds too much in the artificial and extravagant paradoxes of the stoics but for all that he touches the great and eternal commonplaces of human occasionfriendship health bereavement riches poverty deathwith a hand that places him high among the wise masters of life all through the ages men tossed in the beating waves of circumstance have found more abundantly in the essays and letters of seneca than in any other secular writer words of good counsel and comfort and let this fact not pass without notice of the light that it sheds on the fact of the unity of literature and of the absurdity of setting a wide gulf between ancient or classical literature and modern as if under all dialects the partakers in graecoroman civilisation whether in athens rome paris weimar edinburgh london dublin were not the heirs of a great common stock of thought as well as of speech  i certainly do not mean anything so absurd as that the moralities whether major or minor whether affecting the foundation of conduct or the surface of manners remain fixed on the contrary one of the most interesting things in literature is to mark the shifts and changes in mens standards for instance boswell tells a curious story of the first occasion on which johnson met sir joshua reynolds two ladies of the company were regretting the death of a friend to whom they owed great obligations reynolds observed that they had at any rate the comfort of being relieved from a debt of gratitude the ladies were naturally shocked at this singular alleviation of their grief but johnson defended it in his clear and forcible manner and says boswell was much pleased with the mind the fair view of human nature that it exhibited like some of the reflections of rochefoucauld on the strength of it he went home with reynolds supped with him and was his friend for life no moralist with a reputation to lose would like to back reynoldss remark in the nineteenth century  our own generation in great britain has been singularly unfortunate in the literature of aphorism one too famous volume of proverbial philosophy had immense vogue but it is so vapid so wordy so futile as to have a place among the books that dispense with parody then rather earlier in the century a clergyman who ruined himself by gambling ran away from his debts to america and at last blew his brains out felt peculiarly qualified to lecture mankind on moral prudence he wrote a little book in 1820 called lacon or many things in few words addressed to those who think it is an awful example to anybody who is tempted to try his hand at an aphorism thus marriage is a feast where the grace is sometimes better than the dinner i had made some other extracts from this unhappy sage but you will thank me for having thrown them into the fire finally a great authoress of our time was urged by a friend to fill up a gap in our literature by composing a volume of thoughts the result was that least felicitous of performances theophrastus such one living writer of genius has given us a little sheaf of subtlypointed maxims in the ordeal of richard feverel and perhaps he will one day divulge to the world the whole contents of sir austin feverels unpublished volume the pilgrims scrip  yet the wisdom of life has its full part in our literature keen insight into peculiarities of individual motive and concentrated interest in the play of character shine not merely in shakespeare whose mighty soul as hallam says was saturated with moral observation nor in the brilliant verse of pope for those who love meditative reading on the ways and destinies of men we have burton and fuller and sir thomas browne in one age and addison johnson and the rest of the essayists in another sir thomas overburys characters written in the baconian age are found delightful by some but for my own part though i have striven to follow the critics golden rule to have preferences but no exclusions overbury has for me no savour in the great art of painting moral portraits or characterwriting the characters in clarendon or in burnets history of his own time are full of life vigour and coherency and are intensely attractive to read i cannot agree with those who put either clarendon or burnet on a level with the characters in st simon or the cardinal de retz there is a subtlety of analysis a searching penetration a breadth of moral comprehension in the frenchmen which i do not find nor in truth much desire to find in our countrymen a homelier hand does well enough for homelier men nevertheless such characters as those of falkland or chillingworth by clarendon or burnets very different lauderdale are worth a thousand battlepieces cabinet plots or parliamentary combinations of which we never can be sure that the narrator either knew or has told the whole story it is true that these characters have not the strange quality which some one imputed to the writing of tacitus that it seems to put the reader himself and the secrets of his own heart into the confessional it is in the novel that in this country the faculty of observing social man and his peculiarities has found its most popular instrument the great novel not of romance or adventure but of character and manners from the mighty fielding down at a long interval to thackeray covers the field that in france is held and successfully held against all comers by her maximwriters like la rochefoucauld and her characterwriters like la bruyère but the literature of aphorism contains one english name of magnificent and immortal lustrethe name of francis bacon bacons essays are the unique masterpiece in our literature of this oracular wisdom of life applied to the scattered occasions of mens existence the essays are known to all the world but there is another and perhaps a weightier performance of bacons which is less known or not known at all except to students here and there i mean the second chapter of the eighth book of his famous treatise de augmentis it has been translated into pithy english and is to be found in the fifth volume of the great edition of bacon by spedding and ellis  in this chapter among other things he composes comments on between thirty and forty of what he calls the aphorisms or proverbs of solomon which he truly describes as containing besides those of a theological character not a few excellent civil precepts and cautions springing from the inmost recesses of wisdom and extending to much variety of occasions i know not where else to find more of the salt of common sense in an uncommon degree than in bacons terse comments on the wise kings terse sentences and in the keen sagacious shrewd wisdom of the world lighted up by such brilliance of wit and affluence of illustration in the pages that come after them  this sort of wisdom was in the taste of the time witness raleghs instructions to his son and that curious collection of political and polemical aphorisms grounded on authority and experience which he called by the name of the cabinet council harringtons political aphorisms which came a generation later are not moral sentences they are a string of propositions in political theory breathing a noble spirit of liberty though too abstract for practical guidance through the troubles of the day but bacons admonitions have a depth and copiousness that are all his own he says that the knowledge of advancement in life though abundantly practised had not been sufficiently handled in books and so he here lays down the precepts for what he calls the architecture of fortune they constitute the description of a man who is politic for his own fortune and show how he may best shape a character that will attain the ends of fortune  first a man should accustom his mind to judge of the proportion and value of all things as they conduce to his fortune and ends  second not to undertake things beyond his strength nor to row against the stream  third not to wait for occasions always but sometimes to challenge and induce them according to that saying of demosthenes in the same manner as it is a received principle that the general should lead the army so should wise men lead affairs causing things to be done which they think good and not themselves waiting upon events  fourth not to take up anything which of necessity forestalls a great quantity of time but to have this sound ever ringing in our ears time is flyingtime that can never be retrieved  fifth not to engage onesself too peremptorily in anything but ever to have either a window open to fly out at or a secret way to retire by  sixth to follow that ancient precept not construed to any point of perfidiousness but only to caution and moderation that we are to treat our friend as if he might one day be a foe and our foe as if he should one day be friend  all these bacon called the good arts as distinguished from the evil arts that had been described years before by machiavelli in his famous book the prince and also in his discourses bacon called machiavellis sayings depraved and pernicious and a corrupt wisdom as indeed they are he was conscious that his own maxims too stood in some need of elevation and of correction for he winds up with wise warnings against being carried away by a whirlwind or tempest of ambition by the general reminder that all things are vanity and vexation of spirit and the particular reminder that being without wellbeing is a curse and the greater being the greater curse and that all virtue is most rewarded and all wickedness most punished in itself by the question whether this incessant restless and as it were sabbathless pursuit of fortune leaves time for holier duties and what advantage it is to have a face erected towards heaven with a spirit perpetually grovelling upon earth eating dust like a serpent and finally he says that it will not be amiss for men in this eager and excited chase of fortune to cool themselves a little with that conceit of charles v in his instructions to his son that fortune hath somewhat of the nature of a woman who if she be too closely wooed is commonly the further off  there is baconian humour as well as a curious shrewdness in such an admonition as that which i will here transcribe and there are many like it      it is therefore no unimportant attribute of prudence in a man to     be able to set forth to advantage before others with grace and     skill his virtues fortunes and merits which may be done     without arrogance or breeding disgust and again to cover     artificially his weaknesses defects misfortunes and disgraces     dwelling upon the former and turning them to the light sliding     from the latter or explaining them away by apt interpretations and     the like tacitus says of mucianus the wisest and most active     politician of his time that he had a certain art of setting     forth to advantage everything he said or did and it requires     indeed some art lest it become wearisome and contemptible but     yet it is true that ostentation though carried to the first     degree of vanity is rather a vice in morals than in policy for     as it is said of calumny calumniate boldly for some of it     will stick so it may be said of ostentation except it be in a     ridiculous degree of deformity boldly sound your own praises     and some of them will stick it will stick with the more ignorant     and the populace though men of wisdom may smile at it and the     reputation won with many will amply countervail the disdain of a     few and surely no small number of those who are of a solid     nature and who from the want of this ventosity cannot spread     all sail in pursuit of their own honour suffer some prejudice and     lose dignity by their moderation  nobody need go to such writings as these for moral dignity or moral energy they have no place in that nobler literature from epictetus and marcus aurelius downwards which lights up the young soul with generous aims and fires it with the love of all excellence yet the most heroic cannot do without a dose of circumspection the counsels of old polonius to laertes are less sublime than hamlets soliloquy but they have their place bacons chapters are a manual of circumspection whether we choose to give to circumspection a high or a low rank in the list of virtues bacon knew of the famous city which had three gates and on the first the horseman read inscribed be bold and on the second gate yet again be bold and evermore be bold and on the third it was written be not too bold  this cautious tone had been brought about by the circumstances of the time government was strict dissent from current opinions was dangerous there was no indifference and hardly any tolerance authority was suspicious and it was vindictive when the splendid genius of burke rose like a new sun into the sky the times were happier and nowhere in our literature does a noble prudence wear statelier robes than in the majestic compositions of burke  those who are curious to follow the literature of aphorism into germany will with the mighty exceptions of goethe and schiller find but a parched and scanty harvest the germans too often justify the unfriendly definition of an aphorism as a form of speech that wraps up something quite plain in words that turn it into something very obscure as old fuller says the writers have a hair hanging to the nib of their pen their shortness does not prevent them from being tiresome they recall the french wit to whom a friend showed a distich excellent he said but isnt it rather spun out  lichtenberg a professor of physics who was also a considerable hand at satire a hundred years ago composed a collection of sayings not without some wheat amid much chaff a later german writer of whom i will speak in a moment or two schopenhauer has some excellent remarks on selfreflection and on the difference between those who think for themselves and those who think for other people between genuine philosophers who look at things first hand for their own sake and sophists who look at words and books for the sake of making an appearance before the world and seek their happiness in what they hope to get from others he takes herder for an example of the sophist and lichtenberg for the true philosopher it is true that we hear the voice of the selfthinker and not the mere bookphilosopher if we may use for once those uncouth compounds in such sayings as these    people who never have any time are the people   who do least    the utmost that a weak head can get out of experience   is an extra readiness to find out the weaknesses   of other people    overanxiously to feel and think what one could   have done is the very worst thing one can do    he who has less than he desires should know that   he has more than he deserves    enthusiasts without capacity are the really dangerous   people  this last by the way recalls a saying of the great french reactionary de bonald which is never quite out of date follies committed by the sensible extravagances uttered by the clever crimes perpetrated by the goodthere is what makes revolutions  radowitz was a prussian soldier and statesman who died in 1853 after doing enough to convince men since that the revolution of 1848 produced no finer mind he left among other things two or three volumes of short fragmentary pieces on politics religion literature and art they are intelligent and elevated but contain hardly anything to our point tonight unless it be thisthat what is called stupidity springs not at all from mere want of understanding but from the fact that the free use of a mans understanding is hindered by some definite vice frivolity envy dissipation covetousness all these darling vices of fallen manthese are at the bottom of what we name stupidity this is true enough but it is not so much to the point as the saying of a highly judicious aphorist of my own acquaintance that excessive anger against human stupidity is itself one of the most provoking of all forms of stupidity  another author of aphorisms of the goethe period was klinger a playwriter who led a curious and varied life in camps and cities who began with a vehement enthusiasm for the sentimentalism of rousseau and ended as such men often end with a hard and stubborn cynicism he wrote thoughts on different subjects of the world and literature which are intelligent and masculine if they are not particularly pungent in expression one of them runshe who will write interestingly must be able to keep heart and reason in close and friendliest connection the heart must warm the reason and reason must in turn blow on the embers if they are to burst into flame this illustrates what an aphorism should not be contrast its clumsiness with the brevity of the famous and admirable saying of vauvenargues that great thoughts come from the heart  schopenhauer gave to one of his minor works the name of aphorismen zu lebensweisheit aphorisms for the wisdom of life and he put to it by way of motto chamforts saying happiness is no easy matter tis very hard to find it within ourselves and impossible to find it anywhere else schopenhauer was so well read in european literature he had such natural alertness of mind and his style is so pointed direct and wideawake that these detached discussions are interesting and most readable but for the most part discussions they are and not aphorisms thus in the saying that the perfect man of the world should be he who never sticks fast in indecision nor ever falls into overhaste the force of it lies in what goes before and what follows after the whole collection winding up with the chapter of counsels and maxims is in the main an unsystematic enforcement of those peculiar views of human happiness and its narrow limits which proved to be the most important part of schopenhauers system the sovereign rule in the wisdom of life he said i see in aristotles proposition eth nic vii 12 greek ho phronimos to alupon diokei ou to haedu not pleasure but freedom from pain is what the sensible man goes after the second volume of detached though systematically ordered thoughts on various circumstances is miscellaneous in its range of topics and is full of suggestion but the thoughts are mainly philosophical and literary and do not come very close to practical wisdom in truth so negative a view of happiness such pale hopes and middling expectations could not guide a man far on the path of active prudence where we naturally take for granted that the goal is really something substantial serious solid and positive1  footnote 1 burke says on the point raised above i am satisfied the ideas of pain are much more powerful than those which enter on the part of pleasure without all doubt the torments which we may be made to suffer are much greater in their effect on the body and mind than any pleasures which the most learned voluptuary could suggest nay i am in great doubt whether any man could be found who would earn a life of the most perfect satisfaction at the price of ending it in the torments which justice inflicted in a few hours on the late unfortunate regicide in france sublime and beautiful pt i sec vii the reference is of course to damien  nobody cared less than schopenhauer for the wisdom that is drawn from books or has said such hard things of mere reading in the short piece to which i have already referred p 80 he works out the difference between the scholar who has read in books and the thinkers the geniuses the lights of the world and furtherers of the human race who have read directly from the worlds own pages reading he says is only a succedaneum for ones own thinking reading is thinking with a strange head instead of ones own people who get their wisdom out of books are like those who have got their knowledge of a country from the descriptions of travellers truth that has been picked up from books only sticks to us like an artificial limb or a false tooth or a rhinoplastic nose the truth we have acquired by our own thinking is like the natural member at least as goethe puts it in his verse    was du ererbt von deinen vätern hast   erwirb es um es zu besitzen    what from thy fathers thou dost inherit be sure thou   earn it that so it may become thine own  it is only goethe and schiller and especially goethe the strong muchtoiling sage with spirit free from mists and sane and clear who combine the higher and the lower wisdom and have skill to put moral truths into forms of words that fix themselves with stings in the readers mind all goethes work whether poetry or prose his plays his novels his letters his conversations are richly bestrewn with the luminous sentences of a keeneyed steadfast patient indefatigable watcher of human life he deals gravely and sincerely with men he has none of that shallow irony by which small men who have got wrong with the world seek a shabby revenge he tells us the whole truth he is not of those secondrate sages who keep their own secrets externally complying with all the conventions of speech and demeanour while privately nourishing unbridled freedom of opinion in the inner sanctuary of the mind he handles soberly faithfully laboriously cheerfully every motive and all conduct he marks himself the friend the wellwisher and the helper i will not begin to quote from goethe for i should never end the volume of spruche or aphorisms in rhyme and prose in his collected works is accessible to everybody but some of his wisest and finest are to be found in the plays like the wellknown one in his tasso in stillness talent forms itself but character in the great current of the world  but here is a concentrated admonition from the volume that i have named that will do as well as any other for an example of his temper    wouldst fashion for thyself a seemly life   then fret not over what is past and gone   and spite of all thou mayst have lost behind   yet act as if thy life were just begun   what each day wills enough for thee to know   what each day wills the day itself will tell   do thine own task and be therewith content   what others do that shalt thou fairly judge   be sure that thou no brothermortal hate   then all besides leave to the master power  if any of you should be bitten with an unhappy passion for the composition of aphorisms let me warn such an one that the power of observing life is rare the power of drawing new lessons from it is rarer still and the power of condensing the lesson in a pointed sentence is rarest of all beware of cultivating this delicate art the effort is only too likely to add one more to that perverse class described by gibbon who strangle a thought in the hope of strengthening it and applaud their own skill when they have shown in a few absurd words the fourth part of an idea let me warmly urge anybody with so mistaken an ambition instead of painfully distilling poor platitudes of his own to translate the shrewd saws of the wise browed goethe  some have found light in the sayings of balthasar gracian a spaniard who flourished at the end of the seventeenth century whose maxims were translated into english at the very beginning of the eighteenth and who was introduced to the modern public in an excellent article by sir me grant duff a few years ago the english title is attractivethe art of prudence or a companion for a man of sense i do not myself find gracian much of a companion though some of his aphorisms give a neat turn to a commonplace thus    the pillow is a dumb sibyl to sleep upon a thing   that is to be done is better than to be wakened up by   one already done    to equal a predecessor one must have twice his   worth    what is easy ought to be entered upon as though   it were difficult and what is difficult as though it were   easy    those things are generally best remembered which   ought most to be forgot not seldom the surest remedy   of the evil consists in forgetting it  it is france that excels in the form no less than in the matter of aphorism and for the good reason that in france the arts of polished society were relatively at an early date the objects of a serious and deliberate cultivation such as was and perhaps remains unknown in the rest of europe conversation became a fine art i hate war said one it spoils conversation the leisured classes found their keenest relish in delicate irony in piquancy in contained vivacity in the study of niceties of observation and finish of phrase you have a picture of it in such a play as molières misanthropist where we see a section of the polished life of the timemen and women making and receiving compliments discoursing on affairs with easy lightness flitting backwards and forwards with a thousand petty hurries and among them one singular figure hoarse rough sombre moving with a chilling reality in the midst of frolicking shadows but the shadows were all in all to one another not a point of conduct not a subtlety of social motive escaped detection and remark  dugald stewart has pointed to the richness of the french tongue in appropriate and discriminating expressions for varieties of intellectual turn and shade how many of us who claim to a reasonable knowledge of french will undertake easily to find english equivalents for such distinctions as are expressed in the following phrasesesprit juste esprit étendu esprit fin esprit délié esprit de lumière these numerous distinctions are the evidence as stewart says of the attention paid by the cultivated classes to delicate shades of mind and feeling compare with them the colloquial use of our terribly overworked word clever society and conversation have never been among us the school of reflection the spring of literary inspiration that they have been in france the english rule has rather been like that of the ancient persians that the great thing is to learn to ride to shoot with the bow and to speak the truth there is much in it but it has been more favourable to strength than to either subtlety or finish  one of the most commonly known of all books of maxims after the proverbs of solomon are the moral reflections of la rochefoucauld the author lived at court himself practised all the virtues which he seemed to disparage and took so much trouble to make sure of the right expression that many of these short sentences were more than thirty times revised they were given to the world in the last half of the seventeenth century in a little volume which frenchmen used to know by heart which gave a new turn to the literary taste of the nation and which has been translated into every civilised tongue it paints men as they would be if selflove were the one great mainspring of human action and it makes magnanimity itself no better than selfinterest in disguise    interest he says speaks all sorts of tongues and   plays all sorts of parts even the part of the disinterested    gratitude is with most people only a strong desire   for greater benefits to come    love of justice is with most of us nothing but the   fear of suffering injustice    friendship is only a reciprocal conciliation of   interests a mutual exchange of good offices it is a   species of commerce out of which selflove always   intends to make something    we have all strength enough to endure the troubles   of other people    our repentance is not so much regret for the ill we   have done as fear of the ill that may come to us in   consequence  and everybody here knows the saying that in the adversity of our best friends we often find something that is not exactly displeasing  we cannot wonder that in spite of their piquancy of form such sentences as these have aroused in many minds an invincible repugnance for what would be so tremendous a calumny on human nature if the book were meant to be a picture of human nature as a whole i count rochefoucaulds maxims says one critic a bad book as i am reading it i feel discomfort i have a sense of suffering which i cannot define such thoughts tarnish the brightness of the soul they degrade the heart yet as a faithful presentation of human selfishness and of you and me in so far as we happen to be mainly selfish the odious mirror has its uses by showing us what manner of man we are or may become let us not forget either that not quite all is selfishness in la rochefoucauld everybody knows his saying that hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue there is a subtle truth in this toothat to be in too great a hurry to discharge an obligation is itself a kind of ingratitude nor is there any harm in the reflection that no fool is so troublesome as the clever fool nor in this that only great men have any business with great defects nor finally in the consolatory saying that we are never either so happy or so unhappy as we imagine  no more important name is associated with the literature of aphorism than that of pascal but the thoughts of pascal concern the deeper things of speculative philosophy and religion rather than the wisdom of daily life and besides though aphoristic in form they are in substance systematic i blame equally he said those who take sides for praising man those who are for blaming him and those who amuse themselves with him the only wise part is search for truthsearch with many sighs on man as he exists in society he said little and what he said does not make us hopeful he saw the darker side if everybody knew what one says of the other there would not be four friends left in the world would you have men think well of you then do not speak well of yourself and so forth if you wish to know pascals theory you may find it set out in brilliant verse in the opening lines of the second book of popes essay on man what a chimera is man said pascal what a confused chaos what a subject of contradiction a professed judge of all things and yet a feeble worm of the earth the great depository and guardian of truth and yet a mere huddle of uncertainty the glory and the scandal of the universe shakespeare was wiser and deeper when under this quintessence of dust he discerned what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and moving how express and admirable that serene and radiant faith is the secret added to matchless gifts of imagination and music why shakespeare is the greatest of men  there is a smart spurious wisdom of the world which has the bitterness not of the salutary tonic but of mortal poison and of this kind the master is chamfort who died during the french revolution and for that matter died of it and whose little volume of thoughts is often extremely witty always pointed but not seldom cynical and false if you live among men he said the heart must either break or turn to brass the public the public he cried how many fools does it take to make a public what is celebrity the advantage of being known to people who dont know you  all literatures might be ransacked in vain for a more repulsive saying than this that a man must swallow a toad every morning if he wishes to be quite sure of finding nothing still more disgusting before the day is over we cannot be surprised to hear of the lady who said that a conversation with chamfort in the morning made her melancholy until bedtime yet chamfort is the author of the not unwholesome saying that the most wasted of all days is that on which one has not laughed one of his maxims lets us into the secret of his misanthropy whoever he said is not a misanthropist at forty can never have loved mankind it is easy to know what this means of course if a man is so superfine that he will not love mankind any longer than he can believe them to be demigods and angels it is true that at forty he may have discovered that they are neither beginning by looking for men to be more perfect than they can be he ends by thinking them worse than they are and then he secretly plumes himself on his superior cleverness in having found humanity out for the deadliest of all wet blankets give me a middleaged man who has been most of a visionary in his youth  to correct all this let us recall helvétiuss saying that i have already quoted which made so deep an impression on jeremy bentham in order to love mankind we must not expect too much from them and let us remember that fénelon one of the most saintly men that ever lived and whose very countenance bore such a mark of goodness that when he was in a room men found they could not desist from looking at him wrote to a friend the year before he died i ask little from most men i try to render them much and to expect nothing in return and i get very well out of the bargain  chamfort i will leave with his sensible distinction between pride and vanity a man he says has advanced far in the study of morals who has mastered the difference between pride and vanity the first is lofty calm immovable the second is uncertain capricious unquiet the one adds to a mans stature the other only puffs him out the one is the source of a thousand virtues the other is that of nearly all vices and all perversities there is a kind of pride in which are included all the commandments of god and a kind of vanity which contains the seven mortal sins  i will say little of la bruyère by far the greatest broadest strongest of french characterwriters because his is not one of the houses of which you can judge by a brick or two taken at random for those in whom the excitements of modern literature have not burnt up the faculty of sober meditation on social man la bruyère must always be one of the foremost names macaulay somewhere calls him thin but macaulay has less ethical depth and less perception of ethical depth than any writer that ever lived with equally brilliant gifts in other ways and thin is the very last word that describes this admirable master if one seeks to measure how far removed the great classic moralists are from thinness let him turn from la bruyère to the inane subtleties and meaningless conundrums not worth answering that do duty for analysis of character in some modern american literature we feel that la bruyère though retiring studious meditative and selfcontained has complied with the essential condition of looking at life and men themselves and with his own eyes his aphoristic sayings are the least important part of him but here are one or two examples    eminent posts make great men greater and little   men less    there is in some men a certain mediocrity of mind   that helps to make them wise    the flatterer has not a sufficiently good opinion   either of himself or of others    people from the provinces and fools are always   ready to take offence and to suppose that you are   laughing at them we should never risk a pleasantry   except with wellbred people and people with brains    all confidence is dangerous unless it is complete   there are few circumstances in which it is not best   either to hide all or to tell all    when the people is in a state of agitation we do   not see how quiet is to return and when it is tranquil   we do not see how the quiet is to be disturbed    men count for almost nothing the virtues of the   heart and idolise gifts of body or intellect the man   who quite coolly and with no idea that he is offending   modesty says that he is kindhearted constant faithful   sincere fair grateful would not dare to say that   he is quick and clever that he has fine teeth and a   delicate skin  i will say nothing of rivarol a caustic wit of the revolutionary time nor of joubert a writer of sayings of this century of whom mr matthew arnold has said all that needs saying he is delicate refined acute but his thoughts were fostered in the hothouse of a coterie and have none of the salt and sapid flavour that comes to more masculine spirits from active contact with the world  i should prefer to close this survey in the sunnier moral climate of vauvenargues his own life was a pathetic failure in all the aims of outer circumstance the chances of fortune and of health persistently baulked him but from each stroke he rose up again with undimmed serenity and undaunted spirit as blow fell upon blow the sufferer hold firmly to his incessant lessonbe brave persevere in the fight struggle on do not let go think magnanimously of man and life for man is good and life is affluent and fruitful he died a hundred and forty years ago leaving a little body of maxims behind him which for tenderness equanimity cheerfulness grace sobriety and hope are not surpassed in prose literature one of the noblest qualities in our nature he said is that we are able so easily to dispense with greater perfection    magnanimity owes no account to prudence of its   motives    to do great things a man must live as though he   had never to die    the first days of spring have less grace than the   growing virtue of a young man    you must rouse in men a consciousness of their   own prudence and strength if you would raise their   character  just as tocqueville said he who despises mankind will never get the best out of either others or himself1  footnote 1 the reader who cares to know more about vauvenargues will find a chapter on him in the present writers miscellanies vol ii  the best known of vauvenargues sayings as it is the deepest and the broadest is the farreaching sentence already quoted that great thoughts come from the heart and this is the truth that shines out as we watch the voyagings of humanity from the wide grey lampless depths of time those have been greatest in thought who have been best endowed with faith hope sympathy and the spirit of effort and next to them come the great stern mournful men like tacitus dante pascal who standing as far aloof from the soft poetic dejection of some of the moods of shelley or keats as from the savage fury of swift watch with a prophets indignation the heedless waste of faculty and opportunity the triumph of paltry motive and paltry aim as if we were the flies of a summer noon which do more than any active malignity to distort the noble lines and to weaken or to frustrate the strong and healthy parts of human nature for practical purposes all these complaints of man are of as little avail as johnson found the complaint that of the globe so large a space should be occupied by the uninhabitable ocean encumbered by naked mountains lost under barren sands scorched by perpetual heat or petrified by perpetual frost and so small a space be left for the production of fruits the pasture of cattle and the accommodation of men  when we have deducted said johnson all the time that is absorbed in sleep or appropriated to the other demands of nature or the inevitable requirements of social intercourse all that is torn from us by violence of disease or imperceptibly stolen from us by languor we may realise of how small a portion of our time we are truly masters and the same consideration of the ceaseless and natural preoccupations of men in the daily struggle will reconcile the wise man to all the disappointments delays shortcomings of the world without shaking the firmness of his own faith or the intrepidity of his own purpose     maine on popular government1  footnote 1 february 1886   if the government of the many says the distinguished author of the volume before us be really inevitable one would have thought that the possibility of discovering some other and newer means of enabling it to fulfil the ends for which all governments exist would have been a question exercising all the highest powers of the strongest minds particularly in the community which through the success of its popular institutions has paved the way for modern democracy yet hardly anything worth mentioning has been produced on the subject in england or on the continent to say this by the way is strangely to ignore three or four very remarkable books that have been published within the last twenty or fiveandtwenty years that have excited immense attention and discussion and that are the work of minds that even sir henry maine would hardly call weak or inactive we are no adherents of any of mr hares proposals but there are important public men who think that his work on the election of representatives is as conspicuous a landmark in politics as the principia was in natural philosophy js mills volume on representative government which appeared in 1861 was even a more memorable contribution towards the solution of the very problem defined by sir henry maine than was the older mills article on government in 1820 to the political difficulties of the eve of the reform bill again lord greys work on parliamentary government failed in making its expected mark on legislation but it was worth mentioning because it goes on the lines of the very electoral law in belgium which sir henry maine p 109 describes as deserving our most respectful attentionan attention i suspect which it is as little likely to receive from either of our two political parties as lord greys suggestions nor should we neglect sir gc lewiss little book or mr harrisons volume on order and progress which abounds in important criticism and suggestion for the student of the abstract politics of modern societies in the united states too and in our own colonies there have been attempts not without merit to state and to deal with some of the drawbacks of popular government  nothing has been done however that makes the appearance in the field of a mind of so high an order as sir henry maines either superfluous or unwelcome it is hardly possible that he should discuss any subject within the publicists range without bringing into light some of its less superficial aspects and adding observations of originality and value to the stock of political thought to set people thinking at all on the more general and abstract truths of that great subject which is commonly left to be handled lightly unsystematically fragmentarily in obedience to the transitory necessities of the day by ministers members of parliament journalists electors and the whole host who live intellectually and politically from hand to mouth is in itself a service of all but the first order service of the very first order is not merely to propound objections but to devise working answers and this is exactly what sir henry maine abstains from doing  no one will think the moment for a serious political inquiry ill chosen we have just effected an immense recasting of our system of parliamentary representation the whole consequences of the two great acts of 1884 and 1885 are assuredly not to be finally gauged by anything that has happened during the recent election yet even this single election has brought about a crisis of vast importance in one part of the united kingdom by forcing the question of an irish constitution to the front it is pretty clear also that the infusion of a large popular element into the elective house has made more difficult the maintenance of its old relations with the hereditary house even if there were no others these two questions alone and especially the first of them will make the severest demands on the best minds in the country we shall be very fortunate if the crisis produces statesmen as sagacious as those american publicists of whom sir henry maine rightly entertains so exalted an opinion  whether or not we are on the threshold of great legislative changes it is in any case certain that the work of government will be carried on under new parliamentary and social conditions in meeting this prospect we have the aid neither of strong and systematic political schools nor powerful and coherent political parties no one can pretend for instance that there is any body of theoretic opinion so compact and so well thought out as benthamism was in its own day and generation again in practice there are ominous signs that parliament is likely to break up into groups and the substitution of groups for parties is certain if continental experience is to count for anything to create new obstacles in the way of firm and stable government weak government throws power to something which usurps the name of public opinion and public opinion as expressed by the ventriloquists of the newspapers is at once more capricious and more vociferous than it ever was this was abundantly shown during the last five years by a variety of unfortunate public adventures then does the excitement of democracy weaken the stability of national temperament by setting up what in physics would be called a highly increased molecular activity does it disturb not merely conservative respect for institutions but respect for coherence and continuity of opinion and sentiment in the character of the individual himself is there a fluidity of character in modern democratic societies which contrasts not altogether favourably with the strong solid types of old are englishmen becoming less like romans and more like disputatious greeks these and many other considerations of the same kind are enough to secure a ready welcome for any thinker who can light up the obscurities of the time  with profound respect for sir henry maines attainments and every desire to profit by illumination wherever it may be discerned we cannot clearly see how the present volume either makes the problems more intelligible or points the way to feasible solutions though he tries in perfect good faith to be the dispassionate student he often comes very close to the polemics of the hour the truth is that scientific lawyers have seldom been very favourable to popular government and when the scientific lawyer is doubled with the indian bureaucrat we are pretty sure beforehand that in such a tribunal it will go hard with democracy that the author extremely dislikes and suspects the new order he does not hide either from himself or us intellectual contempt for the idolatries of the forum and the marketplace has infected him with a touch of that chagrin which came to men like tacitus from disbelief in the moral government of a degenerate world though he strives like tacitus to take up his parable nec amore et sine odio the disgust is ill concealed there are passages where we almost hear the drone of a dowager in the faubourg saintgermain it was said of tocqueville that he was an aristocrat who accepted his defeat sir henry maine in politics is a bureaucrat who cannot bear to think that democracy will win he is dangerously near the frame of mind of scipio emilianus after the movement of the gracchi and the opening of the roman revolution scipio came to the conclusion that with whichever party he took sides or whatever measures a disinterested and capable statesman might devise he would only aggravate the evil sir henry maine would seem to be nearly as despondent hence his book is fuller of apprehension than of guidance more plausible in alarm than wise or useful in direction it is exclusively critical and negative there is indeed an admirable account of the constitution of the united states but on the one great question on which the constitution of the united states might have been expected to shed lightthe modification of the house of lordssir henry maine explicitly admits p 186 that it is very difficult to obtain from the younger institution the senate any lessons which can be of use in the reconstruction of the older at every turn the end of the discussion lands us in a philosophical culdesac and nothing is so depressing as a culdesac the tone is that of the political valetudinarian watching with uneasy eye the ways of rude health unreflecting optimism about popular government is sickening but calculated pessimism is not much better  something no doubt may often be gained by the mere crossexamination of catchwords and the exposure of platitudes popular government is no more free from catchwords and platitudes than any other political religious or social cause which interests a great many people and is the subject of much discussion even the historical method has its own claptrap but one must not make too much of these things in order to love mankind said helvétius one must not expect too much from them and fairly to appreciate institutions you must not hold them up against the light that blazes in utopia you must not expect them to satisfy microscopic analysis nor judge their working which is inevitably rough awkward clumsy and secondbest by the fastidious standards of closet logic  before saying more as to the substance of the hook we may be allowed to notice one or two matters of literary or historical interest in which sir henry maine is certainly open to criticism there is an old question about burke which was discussed by the present writer a long time ago a great disillusion says sir henry maine has always seemed to him to separate the thoughts on the present discontents and the speech on taxation from the magnificent panegyric on the british constitution in 1790 not many persons in the last century could have divined from the previous opinions of edmund burke the real substructure of his political creed or did in fact suspect it till it was uncovered by the early and comparatively slight miscarriage of french revolutionary institutions this is as a statement of fact not at all correct lord chatham detected what he believed to be the mischievous conservatism in burkes constitutional doctrines at the very outset so did the constitutional society detect it so did mrs macaulay bishop watson and many other people the story of burkes inconsistency is of course as old as sheridan hazlitt declared that the burke of 1770 and the burke of 1790 were not merely opposite persons but deadly enemies mr buckle who is full of veneration for the early writings but who dislikes the later ones gets over the difficulty by insisting that burke actually went out of his mind after 1789 we should have expected a subtler judgment from sir henry maine burke belonged from first to last to the great historic and positive school of which the founder was montesquieu its whole method principle and sentiment all animated him with equal force whether he was defending the secular pomps of oude or the sanctity of benares the absolutism of versailles or the free and ancient parliament at westminster1  footnote 1 it is satisfactory to have the authority of mr lecky on the same side england in the eighteenth century vol iii chap ix p 209  versailles reminds us of a singular overstatement by sir henry maine of the blindness of the privileged classes in france to the approach of the revolution he speaks as if lord chesterfields famous passage were the only anticipation of the coming danger there is at least one utterance of louis xv himself which shows that he did not expect things to last much beyond his time dargenson in the very year of chesterfields prophecy pronounced that a revolution was inevitable and he even went so close to the mark as to hint that it would arise on the first occasion when it should be necessary to convoke the states general rousseau in a page of the confessions not only divined a speedy revolution but enumerated the operative causes of it with real precision there is a striking prediction in voltaire and another in mercier de la rivière other names might be quoted to the same effect including maria theresa who described the ruined condition of the french monarchy and only hoped that the ruin might not overtake her daughter the mischief was not so much that the privileged classes were blind as that they were selfish stubborn helpless and reckless the point is not very important in itself but it is characteristic of a very questionable way of reading human history sir henry maines readiness to treat revolutions as due to erroneous abstract ideas naturally inclines him to take too narrow a view both of the preparation in circumstances and of the preparation in the minds of observant onlookers  in passing by the way we are curious to know the writers authority for what he calls the odd circumstance that the jacobins generally borrowed their phrases from the legendary history of the early roman republic while the girondins preferred to take metaphors from the literature of rousseau p 75 there was plenty of nonsense talked about brutus and scaevola by both parties and it is not possible to draw the line with precision but the received view is that the girondins were voltairean and the jacobins rousseauite while danton was of the school of the encyclopaedia and hébert and chaumette were inspired by holbach  the author seems to us greatly to exaggerate the whole position of rousseau and even in a certain sense to mistake the nature of his influence that jeanjacques was a farreaching and important voice the present writer is not at all likely to deny but no estimate of his influence in the world is correct which does not treat him rather as moralist than publicist emilius went deeper into mens minds in france and in europe at large and did more to quicken the democratic spirit than the social contract apart from this sir henry maine places rousseau on an isolated eminence which does not really belong to him it did not fall within the limited scope of such an essay as sir henry maines to trace the leading ideas of the social contract to the various sources from which they had come but his account of these sources is even for its scale inadequate portions of rousseaus ideas he says truly may be discovered in the speculations of older writers and he mentions hobbes and the french economists but the most characteristic of all the elements in rousseaus speculation were drawn from locke the theoretic basis of popular government is to be found in more or less definite shape in various authors from thomas aquinas downwards but it was lockes philosophic vindication of the revolution of 1688 in the famous essay on civil government that directly taught rousseau the lesson of the sovereignty of the people such originality as the social contract possesses is due to its remarkable union of the influence of the two antagonistic english thinkers the differences between hobbes and rousseau were striking enough rousseau looked on men as good hobbes looked on them as bad the one described the state of nature as a state of peace the other as a state of war the first believed that laws and institutions had depraved man the second that they had improved him in spite of these differences the influence of hobbes was important but only important in combination the total result is as i have said elsewhere a curious fusion between the premises and the temper of hobbes and the conclusions of locke this fusion produced that popular absolutism of which the social contract was the theoretical expression and jacobin supremacy the practical manifestation rousseau borrowed from hobbes the true conception of sovereignty and from locke the true conception of the ultimate seat and original of authority and of the two together he made the great image of the sovereign people strike the crowned head from that monstrous figure which is the frontispiece of the leviathan and you have a frontispiece that will do excellently well for the social contract1  footnote 1 rousseau chap xii  one more word may be said by the way the very slightest account of rousseau is too slight to be tolerable if it omits to mention calvin rousseaus whole theory of the legislator which produced such striking results in certain transitory phases of the french revolution grew up in his mind from the constitution which the great reformer had so predominant a share in framing for the little republic where rousseau was born  this omission of locke and calvin again exemplifies the authors characteristic tendency to look upon political ideas as if speculative writers got them out of their own heads or out of the heads of other people apart from the suggestions of events and the requirements of circumstance calvin was the builder of a working government and locke was the defender of a practical revolution  nor does the error stop at the literary sources of political theories a point more or less in an estimate of a writer or a book is of trivial importance compared with what strikes us as sir henry maines tendency to impute an unreal influence to writers and books altogether there is no doubt a vulgar and superficial opinion that mere speculation is so remote from the real interests of men that it is a waste of time for practical people to concern themselves about speculation no view could be more foolish save one and that one is the opposite view that the real interests of men have no influence on their speculative opinions and no share either in moulding those opinions or in causing their adoption sir henry maine does not push things quite so far as this still he appears to us to attribute almost exclusive influence to political theories and almost entirely to omit what we take to be the much more important reaction upon theory both of human nature and of the experience of human life and outward affairs he makes no allowance among innovating agencies for native rationalism without a formula his brilliant success in other applications of the historic method has disposed him to see survivals where other observers will be content with simpler explanations the reader is sometimes tempted to recall edie ochiltrees rude interruption of mr oldbucks enthusiasm over the praetorium of the immortal roman camp at monkbarns praetorian here praetorian there i mind the bigging o t  sir henry maine believes that the air is thick with ideas about democracy that were conceived a priori and that sprung from the teaching of rousseau a conviction of the advantages of legislative change for example he considers to owe its origin much less to active and original intelligence than to the remote effect of words and notions derived from brokendown political theories there are two great fountains of political theory in our country according to the author rousseau is one and bentham is the other current thought and speech is infested by the floating fragments of these two systemsby loose phrases by vague notions by superstitions that enervate the human intellect and endanger social safety this is the constant refrain of the pages before us we should have liked better evidence we do not believe that it is a roman praetorium men often pick up old phrases for new events even when they are judging events afresh with independent minds when a politician of the day speaks of natural rights he uses a loose traditional expression for a view of social equities which has come to him not from a book but from a survey of certain existing social facts now the phrase the literary description is the least significant part of the matter when mr mill talks of the influence of benthams writings he is careful to tell us that he does not mean that they caused the reform bill or the appropriation clause the changes which have been made says mill and the greater changes which will be made in our institutions are not the work of philosophers but of the interests and instincts of large portions of society recently grown into strength dissertations i 332 that is the point it is the action of these interests and instincts which sir henry maine habitually overlooks for is the omission a mere speculative imperfection it has an important bearing on the whole practical drift of the book if he had made more room for the common intellect roughhewing political truths at the suggestion of common wants and common experience he would have viewed existing circumstances with a less lively apprehension  it is easy to find an apposite illustration of what is meant by saying that this talk of the influence of speculation is enormously exaggerated and misleading when arthur young was in france in the autumn of 1787 he noticed a remarkable revolution in manners in two or three important respects one of them was a new fashion that had just come in of spending some weeks in the country everybody who had a country seat went to live there and such as had none went to visit those who had this new custom observed the admirable young is one of the best that they have taken from england and its introduction was effected the easier being assisted by the magic of rousseaus writings the other and more generally known change was that women of the first fashion were no longer ashamed of nursing their own children and that infants were no longer tightly bound round by barbarous stays and swaddling clothes this wholesome change too was assisted by rousseaus eloquent pleas for simplicity and the life natural of these particular results of his teaching in france a hundred years ago the evidence is ample direct and beyond denial but whenever we find gentlemen with a taste for country life and ladies with a fancy for nursing their own children we surely need not cry out that here is another proof of the extraordinary influence of the speculations of jeanjacques rousseau we need not treat it as a survival of a brokendown theory great nature is more wise than i says the poet great nature had much more to do with moulding men and women to these things than all the books that have ever been printed  we are entirely sceptical as to the proposition that men have at all times quarrelled more fiercely about phrases and formulas than even about material interests p 124 there has been a certain amount of fighting in the world about mere words as idle as the faction fights between caravats and shanavests or twoyearolds and threeyearolds in ireland but the more carefully we look into human history the more apparent it becomes that underneath the phrase or the formula there is usually a material or a quasimaterial or a political or a national or an ecclesiastical interest few quarrels now seem so purely verbal as those which for several centuries raged about the mysteries of the faith in the western and the eastern churches yet these quarrels apparently as frivolous as they were ferocious about the relations of mind and matter about the composition of the trinity about the divine nature turned much less on futile metaphysics than on the solid competition for ecclesiastical power or the conflict of rival nationalities the most transcendental heresy or orthodoxy generally had business at the bottom of it  in limiting the parentage of modern english liberalism of a radical or democratic type to rousseau and bentham the author has left out of sight what is assuredly a much more important factor than any speculative literary or philosophic matter whatever englishmen he says truly are wont to be content with the rough rule of success or failure as the test of right or wrong in national undertakings the same habit of mind and temper marks the attitude of englishmen towards their national institutions they look to success and failure they take the measure of things from results they consult the practical working of the machine they will only go to school with experience we cannot find the proof that a priori radicalism ever at any time got a real hold of any considerable mass of the people of this country or that any of the great innovations in domestic policy since the end of lord liverpools administration have been inspired or guided by rousseauite assumptions godwin whose book on political justice was for a long time the great literary fountain of english radicalism owed quite as much to the utilitarian helvétius as to the sentimental rousseau nor can either william cobbett or joseph hume be said to have dealt largely in a priori what makes the radical of the street is mostly motherwit exercising itself upon the facts of the time his weakness is that he does not know enough of the facts of other times  sir henry maine himself points to what has had a far more decisive influence on english ways of thinking about politics than his two philosophers put together the american republic he says p 11 has greatly influenced the favour into which popular government grew it disproved the once universal assumptions that no republic could govern a large territory and that no strictly republican government could be stable nothing can be more true when burke and chatham and fox persistently declared that the victory of england over the colonists would prove fatal in the long run to the liberties of england itself those great men were even wiser than they knew the success of popular government across the atlantic has been the strongest incentive to the extension of popular government here we need go no further back than the reform bill of 1867 to remind ourselves that the victory of the north over the south and the extraordinary clemency and good sense with which that victory was used had more to do with the concession of the franchise to householders in boroughs than all the eloquence of mr gladstone and all the diplomacies of mr disraeli  to the influence of the american union must be added that of the british colonies the success of popular selfgovernment in these thriving communities is reacting on political opinion at home with a force that no statesman neglects and that is every day increasing there is even a danger that the influence may go too far they are solving some of our problems but not under our conditions and not in presence of the same difficulties still the effect of colonial prosperitya prosperity alike of admirable achievement and boundless promiseis irresistible it imparts a freedom an elasticity an expansiveness to english political notions and gives our people a confidence in free institutions and popular government which they would never have drawn from the most eloquent assumptions of speculative systemmongers nor from any other source whatever save practical experience carefully observed and rationally interpreted this native and independent rationality in men is what the jealous votary of the historic method places far too low  in coming closer to the main current of the book our first disappointment is that sir henry maine has not been very careful to do full justice to the views that he criticises he is not altogether above lending himself to the hearsay of the partisan he allows expressions to slip from him which show that he has not been anxious to face the problems of popular government as popular government is understood by those who have best right to speak for it the more the difficulties of multitudinous government are probed he says p 180 the stronger grows the doubt of the infallibility of popularly elected legislatures we do not profess to answer for all that may have been said by mr bancroft or walt whitman or all the orators of all the fourths of july since american independence but we are not acquainted with any english writer or politician of the very slightest consideration or responsibility who has committed himself to the astounding proposition that popularly elected legislatures are infallible who has ever advanced such a doctrine further it requires some attention to facts to see how widely spread is the misgiving as to the absolute wisdom of popularly elected chambers we are not surprised at the misgiving but after reasonable attention to facts we cannot recall any publicist whom it could be worth while to spend five minutes in refuting who has ever said that popularly elected chambers are absolutely wise again we should like the evidence for the statement that popularly elected houses do not nowadays appeal to the wise deduction from experience as old as aristotle which no student of constitutional history will deny that the best constitutions are those in which there is a large popular element it is a singular proof of the widespread influence of the speculations of rousseau that although very few first chambers really represent the entire community nevertheless in europe they almost invariably claim to reflect it and as a consequence they assume an air of divinity which if it rightfully belonged to them would be fatal to all argument for a second chamber that would be very important if it were true but is it true that first chambers assume an air of divinity or is such an expression a burlesque of the real argument a reasonable familiarity with the course of the controversy in france where the discussion has been abundant and in england where it has been comparatively meagre leaves me for one entirely ignorant that this claim for divinity or anything like it is ever heard in the debate the most powerful modern champion of popular government was gambetta did gambetta consider first chambers divine on the contrary some of the most strenuous pleas for the necessity of a second chamber are to be found precisely in the speeches of gambetta eg his speech at grenoble in the autumn of 1878 discours viii 270 etc abstract thinking is thinking withdrawn from the concrete and particular facts but the abstract thinker should not withdraw too far  sir henry maine speaks p 185 of the saner political theorist who holds that in secular matters it is better to walk by sight than by faith he allows that a theorist of this kind as regards popularly elected chambers will be satisfied that experience has shown the best constitutions to be those in which the popular element is large and he will readily admit that as the structure of each society of men slowly alters it is well to alter and amend the organisation by which this element makes itself felt sir henry maine would surely have done better service in this grave and difficult discussion if he had dealt with views which he mistrusts as they are really held and expressed by sane theorists and not by insane theorists out of sight in france a hundred years ago from causes that are capable of explanation the democracy of sentiment swept away the democracy of utility in spite of casual phrases in public discussion and in spite of the incendiary trash of red journalists without influence it is the democracy of reason experience and utility that is now in the ascendant both in france and elsewhere  the same spirit of what we must call parody is shown in such a statement as that p 78 an audience composed of roughs or clowns is boldly told by an educated man that it has more political information than an equal number of scholars by roughs sir henry maine explains that he means the artisans of the towns the designation is hardly felicitous it is not even fashionable for the roughs and clowns are now by common consent of tories and liberals alike transformed into capable citizens such a phrase gives us a painful glimpse of the accurate knowledge of their countrymen that is possessed by eminent men who write about them from the dim and distant seclusion of college libraries and official bureaux if sir henry maine could spare a few evenings from dispassionate meditations on popular government in the abstract to the inspection of the governing people in the concrete he would be the first to see that to dispatch an audience of skilled artisans as an assembly of roughs is as unscientific to use the mildest word as the habit in a certain religious world of lumping all the unconverted races of the earth in every clime and age in the summary phrase the heathen a great meeting of artisans listening to mr arthur balfour or sir henry roscoe at manchester to sir lyon playfair at leeds the modern democrat at any rate does not think the republic has no need of chemists or to anybody else in a great industrial centre anywhere else is no more an assemblage of roughs than convocation or the house of lords decidedly an enemy of the unverified assumptions of democracy ought to be on his guard against the unverified assumptions of pedantocracy  as for the particular bit of sycophancy which educated men wickedly dangle before roughs and clowns we should like to be sure that the proposition is correctly reported if the educated man tells his roughs if that be the right name for the most skilful industrious and effective handicraftsmen in the world that they have as much of the information necessary for shaping a sound judgment on the political issues submitted to them as an equal number of average masters of arts and doctors of laws then we should say that the educated man unless he has been very unlucky with his audience is perfectly right he proves that his education has not confined itself to books bureaux and an exclusive society but has been carried on in the bracing air of common life i will not add anything of my own on this point because any candidate or member of parliament is suspect but i will venture to transcribe a page or so from mr frederic harrison mr harrisons intellectual equipment is not inferior to that of sir henry maine himself and he has long had close and responsible contact with the class of men of whom he is speaking which cannot be quite a disqualification after all      no worse nonsense is talked than what we are told as to the     requisites for the elective franchise to listen to some people     it is almost as solemn a function as to be a trustee of the     british museum what you want in a body of electors is a rough     shrewd eye for men of character honesty and purpose very plain     men know who wish them well and the sort of thing which will     bring them good electors have not got to govern the country they     have only to find a set of men who will see that the government is     just and active all things go best by comparison and a body     of men may be as good voters as their neighbours without basing     the type of the christian hero      so far from being the least fit for political influence of all     classes in the community the best part of the working class forms     the most fit of all others if any section of the people is to     be the paramount arbiter in public affairs the only section     competent for this duty is the superior order of workmen     governing is one thing but electors of any class cannot or ought     not to govern electing or the giving an indirect approval     of government is another thing and demands wholly different     qualities these are moral not intellectual practical not     special giftsgifts of a very plain and almost universal order     such are firstly social sympathies and sense of justice then     openness and plainness of character lastly habits of action and     a practical knowledge of social misery these are the qualities     which fit men to be the arbiters or ultimate source though     certainly not the instruments of political power these qualities     the best working men possess in a far higher degree than any other     portion of the community indeed they are almost the only part of     the community which possesses them in any perceptible degree1  footnote 1 order and progress pp 14954 and again at p 174  the worst of it is that if sir henry maine is right we have no more to hope from other classes than from roughs and clowns he can discern no blue sky in any quarter in politics he says the most powerful of all causes is the timidity the listlessness and the superficiality of the generality of minds p 73 this is carrying criticism of democracy into an indictment against human nature what is to become of us thus placed between the devil of mob ignorance and corruption and the deep sea of genteel listlessness and superficiality after all sir henry maine is only repeating in more sober tones the querulous remonstrances with which we are so familiar on the lips of ultramontanes and legitimists a less timid observer of contemporary events certainly in the land that all of us know best and love best would judge that when it comes to a pinch liberals are still passably prudent and conservatives quite sufficiently wideawake  another of the passages in sir henry maines book that savours rather of the party caricaturist than of the dispassionate student of politics is the following      there is some resemblance between the period of political reform     in the nineteenth century and the period of religious reformation     in the sixteenth now as then the multitude of followers must be     distinguished from the smaller group of leaders now as then     there are a certain number of zealots who desire that truth shall     prevail but behind these now as then there is a crowd which     has imbibed a delight in change for its own sake who would reform     the suffrage or the house of lords or the land laws or the     union with ireland in precisely the same spirit in which the mob     behind the reformers of religion broke the nose of a saint in     stone made a bonfire of copes and surplices or shouted for the     government of the church by presbyteries p 130  we should wish to look at this remarkable picture a little more closely that there exist anabaptists in the varied hosts of the english reformers is true the feats of the social democrats however at the recent election hardly convince us that they have very formidable multitudes behind them nor is it they who concern themselves with such innovations as those which sir henry maine specifies the social democrats even of the least red shade go a long way beyond and below such trifles as suffrage or the upper house to say of the crowd who do concern themselves with reform of the suffrage or the land laws or the house of lords or the union with ireland that they are animated by a delight in change for its own sake apart from the respectable desire to apply a practical remedy to a practical inconvenience is to show a rather highflying disregard of easily ascertainable facts the crowd listen with interest to talk about altering the land laws because they suspect the english land system to have something to do with the unprosperous condition of the landlord the farmer and the labourer with the depopulation of the country and the congestion in the towns with the bad housing of the poor and with various other evils which they suppose themselves to see staring them daily in the face they may be entirely mistaken alike in their estimate of mischief and their hope of mitigation but they are not moved by delight in change for its own sake when the crowd sympathises with disapproval of the house of lords it is because the legislative performances of that body are believed to have impeded useful reforms in the past to be impeding them now and to be likely to impede them in the future this may be a sad misreading of the history of the last fifty years and a painfully prejudiced anticipation of the next fifty at any rate it is in intention a solid and practical appeal to experience and results and has no affinity to a restless love of change for the sake of change no doubt in the progress of the controversy the assailants of the house of lords attack the principle of birth but the principle of birth is not attacked from the a priori point of view the whole force of the attack lies in what is taken to be the attested fact that the principle of a hereditary chamber supervising an elective chamber has worked is working and will go on working inconveniently stupidly and dangerously finally there is the question of the irish union is it the english or scottish crowd that is charged with a wanton desire to recast the union nobody knows much about the matter who is not perfectly aware that the english statesman whoever he may be who undertakes the inevitable task of dealing with the demand for home rule will have to make his case very plain indeed in order to make the cause popular here then is it the irish crowd sir henry maine of all men is not likely to believe that a sentiment which the wisest people of all parties in ireland for a hundred years have known to lie in the depths of the mind of the great bulk of the irish population to whom we have now for the first time given the chance of declaring their wishes is no more than a gratuitous and superficial passion for change for its own sake the sentiment of irish nationality may or may not be able to justify itself in the eye of prudential reason and english statesmen may or may not have been wise in inviting it to explode those are different questions but sir henry maine himself admits in another connection p 83 that vague and shadowy as are the recommendations of what is called a nationality a state founded on this principle has generally one real practical advantage through its obliteration of small tyrannies and local oppressions it is not to be denied that it is exactly the expectation of this very practical advantage that has given its new vitality to the irish national movement which seems now once more for good or for evil to have come to a head when it is looked into then the case against the multitudes who are as senselessly eager to change institutions as other multitudes once were to break off the noses of saints in stone falls to pieces at every point  among other vices ascribed to democracy we are told that it is against science and that even in our day vaccination is in the utmost danger p 98 the instance is for various reasons not a happy one it is not even precisely stated i have never understood that vaccination is in much danger compulsory vaccination is perhaps in danger but compulsion as a matter of fact was strengthened as the franchise went lower it is a comparative novelty in english legislation 1853 and as a piece of effectively enforced administration it is more novel still 1871 i admit however that it is not endured in the united states and only two or three years ago it was rejected by an overwhelming majority on an appeal to the popular vote in the swiss confederation obligatory vaccination may therefore one day disappear from our statute book if democracy has anything to do with it but then the obligation to practise a medical rite may be inexpedient in spite of the virtues of the rite itself that is not all sir henry maine will admit that mr herbert spencer is not against science and he expresses in the present volume his admiration for mr spencers work on man and the state mr spencer is the resolute opponent of compulsory vaccination and a resolute denier moreover of the pretension that the evidence for the advantages of vaccination takes such account of the ulterior effects in the system as to amount to a scientific demonstration therefore if science demands compulsory vaccination democracy in rejecting the demand and even if it went further is at least kept in countenance by some of those who are of the very household of science the illustration is hardly impressive enough for the proposition that it supports  another and a far more momentous illustration occurs on another page 37 a very little consideration is enough to show that it will by no means bear sir henry maines construction there is in fact he says just enough evidence to show that even now there is a marked antagonism between democratic opinion and scientific truth as applied to human societies the central seat in all political economy was from the first occupied by the theory of population this theory  has become the central truth of biological science yet it is evidently disliked by the multitude and those whom the multitude permits to lead it  sir henry maine goes on to say that it has long been intensely unpopular in france and this i confess is a surprise to me it has usually been supposed that a prudential limitation of families is rooted in the minds and habits of nearly though not quite all classes of the french nation an excellent work on france written by a sound english observer seven or eight years ago chances to be lying before me at the moment and here is a passage taken almost at random the opinions of thoughtful men seem to tend towards the wish to introduce into france some of that improvidence which allows english people to bring large families into the world without first securing the means of keeping them and which has peopled the continent of north america and the australian colonies with an englishspeaking race richardsons corn and cattle producing districts of france p 47 etc surely this is a wellestablished fact it is possible that denunciations of malthus may occasionally be found both in clerical and socialistic prints but then there are reasons for that it can hardly be made much of a charge against french democracy that it tolerates unscientific opinion so long as it cultivates scientific practice  as for our own country and those whom the multitude permits to lead it we cannot forget that by far the most popular and powerful man in faece romulias sir henry maine insists on our putting it in that polite waywas tried and condemned not many years ago for publishing a certain pamphlet which made a limitation of population the very startingpoint of social reform it is not necessary to pronounce an opinion on the particular counsels of the pamphlet but the motives which prompted its circulation motives admitted to be respectable by the chiefjustice who tried the case and the extraordinary reception of the pamphlet by the serious portion of the workmen of the towns would make a careful writer think twice before feeling sure that popular bodies will never listen to the truth about population no doubt as sir henry maine says in the same place certain classes now resist schemes for relieving distress by emigration but there is a pretty obvious reason for that that reason is not mere aversion to face the common sense of the relations between population and subsistence but a growing suspicionas to the reasonableness of which again i give no opinionthat emigration is made into an easy and slovenly substitute for a scientific reform in our system of holding and using land in the case of ireland other political considerations must be added  democracy will be against science we admit in one contingency if it loses the battle with the ultramontane church the worst enemy of science is also the bitterest enemy of democracy cest le cléricalisme the interests of science and the interests of democracy are one let us take a case suppose that popular government in france were to succumb a military or any other more popular government would be forced to lean on ultramontanes ultramontanes would gather the spoils of democratic defeat sir henry maine is much too well informed to think that a clerical triumph would be good for science whatever else it might be good for then are not propositions about democracy being against science very idle and a little untrue modern politics said a wise man pattison sermons p 191 resolve themselves into the struggle between knowledge and tradition democracy is hardly on the side of tradition  we have dwelt on these secondary matters because they show that the author hardly brings to the study of modern democracy the ripe preparation of detail which he gave to ancient law in the larger field of his speculation the value of his thought is seriously impaired by the absence of anything like a philosophy of society as a whole nobody who has studied burke or comte or milli am not sure whether we should not add even de maistrecan imagine any of them as setting to work on a general political speculation without reference to particular social conditions they would have conducted the inquiry in strict relation to the stage at which a community happened to be in matters lying outside of the direct scope of political government so before all other living thinkers should we have expected sir henry maine to do it is obvious that systems of government called by the same name bearing the same superficial marks founded and maintained on the same nominal principles framed in the same verbal forms may yet work with infinite diversity of operation according to the variety of social circumstances around them yet it is here inferred that democracy in england must be fragile difficult and sundry other evil things because out of fourteen presidents of the bolivian republic thirteen have died assassinated or in exile if england and bolivia were at all akin in history religion race industry the fate of bolivian presidents would be more instructive to english premiers  one of the propositions which sir henry maine is most anxious to bring home to his readers is that democracy in the extreme form to which it tends is of all kinds of government by far the most difficult he even goes so far as to say p 87 that while not denying to democracies some portion of the advantage which bentham claimed for them and putting this advantage at the highest it is more than compensated by one great disadvantage namely its difficulty this generalisation is repeated with an emphasis that surprises us for two reasons in the first place if the proposition could be proved to be true we fail to see that it would be particularly effective in its practical bearings everybody whose opinions are worth consideration and everybody who has ever come near the machinery of democratic government is only too well aware that whether it be far the most difficult form of government or not it is certainly difficult enough to tax the powers of statesmanship to the very uttermost is not that enough is anything gained by pressing us further than that better be a poor fisherman said danton as he walked in the last hours of his life on the banks of the aube better be a poor fisherman than meddle with the governing of men we wonder whether there has been a single democratic leader either in france or england who has not incessantly felt the full force of dantons ejaculation there may indeed be simpletons in the political world who dream that if only the system of government were made still more popular all would be plain sailing but then sir henry maine is not the man to write for simpletons  the first reason then for surprise at the immense stress laid by the author on the proposition about the difficulty of popular government is that it would not be of the first order of importance if it were true our second reason is that it cannot be shown to be true you cannot measure the relative difficulty of diverse systems of government governments are things of far too great complexity for precise quantification of this sort will anybody for example read through the second volume of the excellent work of m leroybeaulieu on the empire of the czars 1882 and then be prepared to maintain that democracy is more difficult than autocracy it would be interesting too to know whether the prince on whose shoulders will one day be laid the burden of the german empire will read the dissertation on the unparalleled difficulties of democracy with acquiescence there are many questions of which the terms are no sooner stated than we at once see that a certain and definite answer to them is impossible the controversy as to the relative fragility or the relative difficulty of popular government and other forms of government appears to be a controversy of this kind we cannot decide it until we have weighed measured sifted and tested a great mass of heterogeneous facts and then supposing the process to have been ever so skilfully and laboriously performed no proposition could be established as the outcome that would be an adequate reward for the pains of the operation  this we venture to think must be pronounced a grave drawback to the value of the authors present speculation he attaches an altogether excessive and unscientific importance to form it would be unreasonable to deny to a writer on democracy as a form of government the right of isolating his phenomenon but it is much more unreasonable to predicate fragility difficulty or anything else of a particular form of government without reference to other conditions which happen to go along with it in a given society at a given time none of the properties of popular government are independent of surrounding circumstances social economic religious and historic all the conditions are bound up together in a closely interdependent connection and are not secondary to or derivative from the mere form of government it is if not impossible at least highly unsafe to draw inferences about forms of government in universals  no writer seems to us to approach machiavelli in the acuteness with which he pushes behind mere political names and passes on to the real differences that may exist in movements and institutions that are covered by the same designation nothing in its own way can be more admirable for instance than his reflections on the differences between democracy at florence and democracy in old romehow the first began in great inequality of conditions and ended in great equality while the process was reversed in the second how at rome the people and the nobles shared power and office while at florence the victors crushed and ruined their adversaries how at rome the people by common service with the nobles acquired some of their virtues while at florence the nobles were forced down to seem as well as to be like the common people istorie fiorentine bk iii  this is only an example of the distinctions and qualifications which it is necessary to introduce before we can prudently affirm or deny anything about political institutions in general terms who would deny that both the stability and the degree of difficulty of popular government are closely connected in the united states with the abundance of accessible land who would deny that in great britain they are closely connected with the greater or less prosperity of our commerce and manufactures to take another kind of illustration from mr diceys brilliant and instructive volume on the law of the constitution the governments of england and of france are both of them popular in form but does not a fundamental difference in their whole spirit and working result from the existence in one country of the droit administratif and the absolute predominance in the other of regular law applied by the ordinary courts and extending equally over all classes of citizens distinctions and differences of this order go for nothing in the pages before us yet they are vital to the discussion  the same fallacious limitation the same exclusion of the many various causes that cooperate in the production of political results is to be discerned in nearly every argument the author justly calls attention to the extraordinary good luck which has befallen us as a nation he proceeds to warn us that if the desire for legislative innovation be allowed to grow upon us at its present pacepace assumed to be very headlong indeedthe chances are that our luck will not last we shall have a disaster like sedan or the loss of alsace lorraine p 151 this is a curiously narrow reading of contemporary history did austria lose sadowa or was the french empire ruined at sedan in consequence of the passion of either of those governments for legislative innovations or must we not rather in order to explain these striking events look to a large array of military geographical financial diplomatic and dynastic considerations and conditions if so what becomes of the moral england is no doubt the one great civilised power that has escaped an organic or structural change within the last fiveandtwenty years within that period the american union after a tremendous war has revolutionised the social institutions of the south and reconstructed the constitution the french empire has foundered and a french republic once more bears the fortunes of a great state over troubled waters germany has undergone a complete transformation so has the italian peninsula the internal and the external relations alike of the austrian power are utterly different today from what they were twenty years ago spain has passed from monarchy to republic and back to monarchy again and gone from dynasty to dynasty but what share had legislative innovation in producing these great changes no share at all in any one case what is the logic then of the warning that if we persist in our taste for legislative innovation we shall lose our immunity from the violent changes that have overtaken other stateschanges with which legislative innovation had nothing to do  in short modern societies whether autocratic or democratic are passing through a great transformation social religious and political the process is full of embarrassments difficulties and perils these are the dominant marks of our era to set them all down to popular government is as narrow as confused and as unintelligent as the imputation in a papal encyclical of all modern ills to liberalism you cannot isolate government and judge it apart from the other and deeper forces of the time western civilisation is slowly entering on a new stage form of government is the smallest part of it it has been well said that those nations have the best chance of escaping a catastrophe in the obscure and uncertain march before us who find a way of opening the most liberal career to the aspirations of the present without too rudely breaking with all the traditions of the past this is what popular government wisely guided is best able to do  but will wise guidance be endured sir henry maine seems to think that it will not mill thought that it would in a singularly luminous passage in an essay which for some reason or another he never republished mill says      we are the last persons to undervalue the power of moral     convictions but the convictions of the mass of mankind run hand     in hand with their interests or their class feelings we have a     strong faith stronger than either politicians or philosophers     generally have in the influence of reason and virtue over mens     minds but it is in that of the reason and virtue of their own     side of the question we expect few conversions by the mere force     of reason from one creed to the other mens intellects and hearts     have a large share in determining what sort of conservatives or     liberals they will be but it is their position saving individual     exceptions which makes them conservatives or liberals  this double truth points to the good grounds that exist why we should think hopefully of popular government and why we should be slow to believe that it has no better foundation to build upon than the unreal assumptions of some bad philosophers french or others     a few words on french models1  footnote 1 march 1888                     nunquamne reponam   vexatus toties rauci theseide codri   historians are only too fond of insisting on the effect of the french revolution in checking english reform one of the latest of them dwells on the fatal influence of this great event in our own country in checking blighting and distorting the natural progress of things but for that influence he says the closing years of the century would probably have seen the abolition of the english slave trade the reform of parliament and the repeal of the test act1 the question of the precise degree of vitality in sectarian pride and of tenacity in a great material interest a hundred years ago or at any time is not very easy to settle it is quite possible that the slave trade and the test act might have died nearly as hard if there had been no french revolution in any case it is a curious implication that underlies all writing in this familiar vein that france ought to have gone on with a bad government in order to secure to england the advantages of a good one  footnote 1 lecky vi 297  as to one disservice however there can be no doubt the french revolution has furnished the enemies of each successive proposal of reform with a boundless supply of prejudicial analogies appalling parallels and ugly nicknames which are all just as conclusive with the unwise as if they were the aptest arguments sydney smith might well put the awful example of a neighbouring nation among the standing topics of the noodles oration the abolition of rotten boroughs brought down a thousand ominous references to noyades fusillades and guillotines when sir robert peel took the duty off corn croker warned him with great solemnity that he was breaking up the old interests dividing the great families and beginning exactly such a castastrophe as did the noailles and the montmorencis in 1789 cobden and bright were promiscuously likened to baboeuf chaumette and anacharsis clootz baboeuf it is true was for dividing up all property and chaumette was an aggressive atheist but these were mere nuances not material to the purposes of obloquy robespierre danton marat have been mercilessly trotted forth in their sanguinary shrouds and treated as the counterparts and precursors of worthies so obviously and exactly like them as mr beales and mr odger while an innocent caucus for the registration of voters recalls to some wellknown writers lurid visions of the cordeliers and the jacobin club  a recent addition has been made to the stock of nicknames drawn from the terrible melodrama of the last century the chancellor of the exchequer at dublin described the present very humble writer as the saintjust of our revolution the description was received with lively applause it would be indelicate to wonder how many in a hundred even in that audience of the elect had ever heard of saintjust how many in five hundred could have spelt his name and how many in a thousand could have told any three facts in his career but let us muse for a moment upon the portrait i take down the first picture of saintjust that comes to my hand m taine is the artist      among these energetic nullities we see gradually rising a young     monsterwith face handsome and tranquilsaintjust a sort of     precocious sulla who at fiveandtwenty suddenly springs from     the ranks and by force of atrocity wins his place six years     before he began life by an act of domestic robbery while on a     visit at his mothers he ran away in the night with her plate and     jewels for that he was locked up for six months on his release     he employed his leisure in the composition of an odious poem then     he flung himself head foremost into the revolution blood calcined     by study a colossal pride a conscience completely unhinged     an imagination haunted by the bloody recollections of rome and     sparta an intelligence falsified and twisted until it found     itself most at its ease in the practice of enormous paradox     barefaced sophism and murderous lyingall these perilous     ingredients mixed in a furnace of concentrated ambition boiled     and fermented long and silently in his breast  it is no doubt hard to know ourselves one may entertain demons unawares and have calcined blood without being a bit the wiser still i do not find the likeness striking it would have done just as well to call me nero torquemada iago or bluebeard  whether the present writer does or does not deserve all the compliments that history has paid to saintjust is a very slight and trivial question with which the public will naturally not much concern itself but as some use is from time to time made of the writers imputed delinquencies to prejudice an important cause it is perhaps worth while to try in a page or two to give a better account of things it is true that he has written on revolutionists like robespierre and destructive thinkers like rousseau and voltaire it is true that he believes the two latter to have been on the whole when all deductions are made on the side of human progress but what sort of foundation in this for the inference that he finds his models in the heroes of the french revolution and looks for his methods in the reign of terror it would be equally logical to infer that because i have written not without sympathy and appreciation of joseph de maistre i therefore find my model in a hero of the catholic reaction and look for my methods in the revived supremacy of the holy see over all secular and temporal authorities it would be just as fair to say that because i pointed out as it was the critics business to do the many admirable merits and the important moral influences on the society of that time of the new heloïsa therefore i am bound to think saint preux a very fine fellow particularly fit to be a model and a hero for young ireland only on the principle that who drives fat oxen must himself be fat can it be held that who writes on danton must be himself in all circumstances a dantonist  the most insignificant of literary contributions have a history and an origin and the history of these contributions is short and simple enough carlyle with all the force of his humoristic genius had impressed upon his generation an essentially onesided view both of the eighteenth century as a whole and of the french thinkers of that century in particular his essay on diderot his lecture on rousseau his chapters on voltaire with all their brilliance penetration and incomparable satire were the highwater mark in this country of the literary reaction against the french school of revolution everybody knows the famous diatribes against the bankrupt century and all its men and all its works voltaires furies diderots indigestions rousseaus nauseous amours and the odd tricks and shifts of the whole of them and their company offered ready material for the boisterous horseplay of the transcendental humourist then the tide began to turn mr buckles book on the history of civilisation had something to do with it but it was the historical chapters in comtes positive philosophy that first opened the minds of many of us who fiveandtwenty years ago were young men to a very different judgment of the true place of those schools in the literary and social history of western europe we learnt to perceive that though much in the thought and the lives of the literary precursors of the revolution laid them fairly open to carlyles banter yet banter was not all and even grave condemnation was not all in essays like mine written from this point of view and with the object of trying to trim the balance rather more correctly it may well have been that the better side of the thinkers concerned was sometimes unduly dwelt upon and their worse side unduly left in the background it may well have been that an impression of personal adhesion was conveyed which only very partially existed or even where it did not exist at all that is a risk of misinterpretation which it is always hard for the historical critic to escape there may have been a too eager tone but to be eager is not a very bad vice at any age under the critical forty there were some needlessly aggressive passages and some sallies which ought to have been avoided because they gave pain to good people there was perhaps too much of the particular excitement of the time it was the date when essays and reviews was still thought a terrible explosive when bishop colensos arithmetical tests as to the flocks and herds of the children of israel were believed to be sapping not only the inspiration of the pentateuch but the foundations of the faith and the church and when darwins scientific speculations were shaking the civilised world some excitement was to be pardoned in days like those and i am quite sure that one side needed pardon at least as much as the other for the substantial soundness of the general views winch i took of the french revolutionary thinkers at that time i feel no apprehension norsome possible occasional phrases or sentences excepted and apartdo i see the smallest reason to shrink or to depart from any one of them so far as one particular reference may serve to illustrate the tenour of the whole body of criticism the following lines which close my chapter on the encyclopaedia will answer the purpose as well as any others and i shall perhaps be excused for transcribing them      an urgent social task lay before france and before europe it     could not be postponed until the thinkers had worked out a scheme     of philosophic completeness the thinkers did not seriously make     any effort after this completeness the encyclopaedia was the most     serious attempt and it did not wholly fail as i replace in my     shelves this mountain of volumes dusky and huge enlarging on     the sight i have a presentiment that their pages will seldom     again be disturbed by me or by others they served a great purpose     a hundred years ago they are now a monumental ruin clothed with     all the profuse associations of history it is no ozymandias of     egypt king of kings whose wrecked shape of stone and sterile     memories we contemplate we think rather of the grey and crumbling     walls of an ancient stronghold reared by the endeavour of stout     hands and faithful whence in its own day and generation a band     once went forth against barbarous hordes to strike a blow for     humanity and truth1  footnote 1 diderot i 247  it is gratifying to find that the same view of the work of these famous men and of its relation to the social necessities of the time commends itself to mr lecky who has since gone diligently and with a candid mind over the same ground1 then where is the literary jacobin  footnote 1 see his vol vi 305 et seq  of course it is easy enough to fish out a sentence or a short passage here and there which if taken by itself may wear a very sinister look and carry the most alarming impressions not many days ago a writer addressed a letter to the times which furnishes a specimen of this kind of controversy he gave himself the ambiguous designation of catholicus but his style bore traces of the equivocally catholic climate of munich his aim was the lofty and magnanimous one of importing theological prejudice into the great political dispute of the day in the interest strange to say of the irish party who have been for ages the relentless oppressors of the church to which he belongs and who even now hate and despise it with all the virulence of a parisian red this masked assailant conveys to the mind of the reader that i applaud and sympathise with the events of the winter of 1793 and more particularly with the odious procession of the goddess of reason at notre dame he says moreover that i have the effrontery to imply that the horrible massacres of the revolution  were a very mild story compared with the atrocities of the jews or the crimes of catholicism no really honest and competent disputant would have hit on effrontery as the note of the passage referred to if he had had its whole spirit and drift before him the reader shall if he pleases judge for himself after the words just quoted i go on to say      historical recriminations however are not edifying it is     perfectly fair when catholics talk of the atheist terror to     rejoin that the retainers of anjou and montpensier slew more men     and women on the first day of the saint bartholomew than perished     in paris through the years i and ii but the retort does us no     good beyond the region of dialectic some of the opinions of     chaumette were full of enlightenment and hope but it would be     far better to share the superstitious opinions of a virtuous and     benignant priest like the bishop in victor hugos misérables     than to hold these good opinions of chaumette as he held them     with a rancorous intolerance a reckless disregard of the rights     and feelings of others and a shallow forgetfulness of all that     great and precious part of our nature that lies out of the domain     of the logical understanding in every family where a mother     sought to have her child baptised or where sons and daughters     sought to have the dying spirit of the old consoled by the last     sacrament there sprang up a bitter enemy to the government which     had closed the churches and proscribed the priests how could a     society whose spiritual life had been nourished in the solemn     mysticism of the middle ages suddenly turn to embrace a gaudy     paganism the common selfrespect of humanity was outraged by     apostate priests  as they filed before the convention led by     the archbishop of paris and accompanied by rude acolytes bearing     piles of the robes and the vessels of silver and gold with which     they had once served their holy office1  footnote 1 misc i 7779  where is the effrontery the search for methods in the reign of terror the applause for revolutionary models such inexcusable perversion of a writers meaning for an evanescent political objectand a very shabby object toois enough to make one think that george iii knew what he was talking about when he once delivered himself of the saying that politics are a trade for a rascal not for a gentleman  let me cite another more grotesque piece of irrelevancy with a similar drift some months ago the present writer chanced to express an opinion upon welsh disestablishment wales at any rate would seem to be far enough away from emile candide the law of prairial and the committee of public safety the times however instantly said1 that it would be affectation to express any surprise because my unfortunate theories and principles drawn from french sources and framed on french models all tend to the disintegration of comprehensive political organisations and the encouragement of arrangements based on the minor peculiarities of race or dialect was there ever in the world such prodigious nonsense what french sources what french models if french models point in any one direction rather than another it is away from disintegration and straight towards centralisation everybody knows that this is one of the most notorious facts of french history from the days of lewis xi or cardinal richelieu down to napoleon bonaparte so far from french models encouraging arrangements based on the minor peculiarities of race and dialect france is the first great example in modern history for good or for evil of a persevering process of national unification and the firm suppression of all provincial particularismus this is not only true of french political leaders in general it is particularly true of the jacobin leaders rousseau himself i admit did in one place point in the direction of confederation but only in the sense that for freedom on the one hand and just administration on the other the unit should not be too large to admit of the participation of the persons concerned in the management of their own public affairs if the jacobins had not been overwhelmed by the necessity of keeping out the invaders they might have developed the germ of truth in rousseaus loose way of stating the expediency of decentralisation as it was above all other french schools the jacobins dealt most sternly with particularist pretensions of all men these supposed masters teachers and models of mine are least to be called separatists to them more than to any other of the revolutionary parties the great heresy of federalism was most odious and if i were a faithful follower of the jacobin model i should have least patience with nationalist sentiment whether in ireland scotland or wales and should most rigorously insist on that castiron incorporation which as it happens in the case of ireland i believe to be equally hopeless and undesirable this explanation therefore of my favour for welsh disestablishment is as absurdly ignorant as it is farfetched and irrelevant  footnote 1 nov 3 1886  the logical process is worth an instants examination the position is no less than thisthat to attempt truly to appreciate the place and the value in the history of thought and social movements of men who have been a hundred years in their graves and to sympathise with certain sides and certain effects of their activity under the peculiar circumstances in which french society then found itself is the same thing as binding yourself to apply their theories and to imitate their activity under an entirely heterogeneous set of circumstances in a different country and in a society with wholly dissimilar requirements that is the argument if we straighten it out the childishness of any such contention is so obvious that i should be ashamed of reproducing it were it not that this very contention has made its appearance at my expense several times a month for the last two years in all sorts of important and respectable prints  for instance it appears that i once said somewhere that danton looked on at the doings of his bloodier associates with sombre acquiescence argal it was promptly pointed outand i espy the dark phrase constantly adorning leading articles to this daythe man who said that danton sombrely acquiesced in the doings of billaud collet and the rest must of necessity being of a firm and logical mind himself sombrely acquiesce in moonlighting and cattlehoughing in ireland apart from the curious compulsion of the reasoning what is the actual state of the case acquiescence is hardly a good description of the mood of a politician who scorns delights and lives laborious days in actively fighting for a vigorous policy and an effective plan which as he believes would found order in ireland on a new and more hopeful base he may be wrong but where is the acquiescence whether sombre or serene  the equally misplaced name of fatalism is sometimes substituted for acquiescence in criticisms of this stamp in any such sense anybody is a fatalist who believes in a relation between cause and effect if it is fatalism to assume that given a certain chain of social or political antecedents they will inevitably be followed by a certain chain of consequences then every sensible observer of any series of events is a fatalist catholic emancipation the extension of the franchise and secret ballot have within the last sixty years completely shifted the balance of political power in ireland land legislation has revolutionised the conditions of ownership these vast and vital changes in ireland have been accompanied by the transfer of decisive power from aristocracy to numbers in great britain and great britain is arbiter is it fatalism or is it common sense to perceive that one new effect of new causes so potent must be the necessity of changing the system of irish government to dream that you could destroy the power of the old masters without finding new and that having invited the nation to speak you could continue to ignore the national sentiment was and is the very height of political folly and the longer the dream is persisted in the ruder will be the awakening surely the stupidest fatalism is far more truly to be ascribed to those who insist that ireland was eternally predestined to turmoil confusion and torment that there alone the event defies calculation and that however wisely carefully and providently you modify or extinguish causes in ireland though nowhere else effects will still survive with shape unaltered and force unabated  no author has a right to assume that anybody has read all his books or any of them but he may reasonably claim that he shall not be publicly classified labelled catalogued and placed in the shelves on the strength of half of his work and that half arbitrarily selected if it be permitted to me without excess of egotism to name the masters to whom i went to school in the days of early manhood so far from being revolutionists and terrorists they belonged entirely to the opposite camp austins jurisprudence and mills logic and utilitarianism were everything and rousseaus social contract was nothing to the best of my knowledge and belief i never said a word about natural rights in any piece of practical public business in all my life and when that famous phrase again made its naked appearance on the platform three or four years ago it gave me as much surprise and dismay as if i were this afternoon to meet a deinotherium shambling down parliament street mill was the chief influence for me as he was for most of my contemporaries in those days experience of life and independent use of ones mindwhich he would have been the most ready of men to applaudhave since as is natural led to many important corrections and deductions in mills political and philosophical teaching but then we were disciples and not critics and nobody will suppose that the admirer of wordsworth the author of the essay on coleridge and of the treatise on representative government the administrator in the most bureaucratic and authoritative of public services was a terrorist or an unbridled democrat or anything else but the most careful and rationalistic of political theorisers it was mill who first held up for my admiration the illustrious man whom austin enthusiastically called the godlike turgot and it was he who encouraged me to write a study on that great and inspiring character i remember the suspicion and the murmurings with which louis blanc then living in brave and honourable exile in london and the good friend of so many of us and who was really a literary jacobin to the tips of his fingers remonstrated against that piece of what he thought grievously misplaced glorification turgot was indeed a very singular hero with whom to open the career of literary jacobin so was burkethe author of those wise sentences that still ring in our ears the question with me is not whether you have a right to render your people miserable but whether it is not your interest to make them happy it is not what a lawyer tells me i may do but what humanity reason and justice tell me i ought to do nobody shall persuade me where a whole people are concerned that acts of lenity are not means of conciliation burke austin mill turgot comtewhat strange sponsors for the theories and principles of the terror  what these opinions came to roughly speaking was something to this effect that the power alike of statesmen and of publicists over the course of affairs is strictly limited that institutions and movements are not capable of immediate or indefinite modification by any amount of mere will that political truths are always relative and never absolute that the test of practical political and social proposals is not their conformity to abstract ideals but to convenience utility expediency and occasion that for the reformer considerations of time and place may be paramount and finally as mill himself has put it that government is always either in the hands or passing into the hands of whatever is the strongest power in society and that what this power is and shall be depends less on institutions than institutions depend upon it if i were pressed for an illustration of these principles at work inspiring the minds and guiding the practice of responsible statesmen in great transactions of our own day and generation i should point to the sage the patient the triumphant action of abraham lincoln in the emancipation of the negro slaves however that may be contrast a creed of this kind with the abstract absolute geometric unhistoric peremptory notions and reasonings that formed the stock in trade of most though not quite all of the french revolutionists alike in action and in thought it is plain that they are the direct opposite and contradictory of one another  to clench the matter by chapter and verse i should like to recall what i have said of these theories and principles in their most perfect and most important literary version how have i described rousseaus social contract it placed i said the centre of social activity elsewhere than in careful and rational examination of social conditions and careful and rational effort to modify them it substituted a retrograde aspiration for direction and emotion for the discovery of law it overlooked the crucial difficultynamely how to summon new force without destroying the sound parts of a structure which it has taken many generations to erect its method was geometric instead of being historic and hence its desperate absurdity its whole theory was constructed with an imperfect consideration of the qualities of human nature and with too narrow a view of society it ignored the great fact that government is the art of wisely dealing with huge groups of conflicting interests of hostile passions of hardly reconcilable aims of vehemently opposed forces it gives us not the least help towards the solution of any of the problems of actual government  such language as all this is hardly that of a disciple to a master in respect of theories and principles which he is making his own for the use of a lifetime there has been no attempt in these pages i said in winding up to palliate either the shallowness or the practical mischievousness of the social contract but there is another side to its influence we should be false to our critical principle if we do not recognise the historical effect of a speculation scientifically valueless any writer would have stamped himself as both unfit for the task that i had undertaken and entirely below the level of the highest critical standard of the day if he had for a moment dreamed of taking any other point of view  as for historical heroworship after carlyles fashion whether with jacobin idols or any other it is a mood of mind that must be uncongenial to anybody who had ever been at all under the influence of mill without being so foolish as to disparage the part played by great men in great crises we could have no sympathy with the barbaric and cynical school who make greatness identical with violence force and mere iron will cromwell said in vindication of himself that england had need of a constable and it was true the constable the soldier the daring counsellor at the helm are often necessities of the time it is often a necessity of the time that the energy of a nation or of a movement should gather itself up in a resolute band or a resolute chief as the revolutionary energy of france gathered itself up in the greater jacobins or that of england in oliver cromwell goethe says that nature bids us take all but pay revolutions and heroes may give us all but not without price this is at the best and the best is the exception the grandiose types mostly fail in our own day people talk for example with admiration of cromwells government in irelandas if it were a success instead of being one of the worst chapters in the whole history of irish failure it was force carried to its utmost hundreds were put to the sword thousands were banished to be slaves of the planters in the west indies and the remnant were driven miserably off into the desolate wilds of connaught but all this only prepared the way for further convulsions and deadlier discontent  it is irrational to contrast carlyles heroes cromwell mirabeau frederick napoleon with men like washington or lincoln the circumstances were different the conditions of public use and of personal greatness were different but if we are to talk of ideals heroes and models i for one should hardly look to france at all jefferson was no flatterer of george washington but his character of washington comes far nearer to the right pattern of a great ruler than can be found in any of carlyles splendid dithyrambs and it is no waste of time to recall and to transcribe it      his mind was great and powerful without being of the very first     order his penetration strong though not so acute as that of a     newton bacon or locke and as far as he saw no judgment was     ever sounder it was slow in operation being little aided by     invention or imagination but sure in conclusion hence the common     remark of his officers of the advantage he derived from councils     of war where hearing all suggestions he selected whatever was     best and certainly no general ever planned his battles more     judiciously but if deranged during the course of the action if     any member of his plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances     he was slow in a readjustment he was incapable of fear meeting     personal dangers with the calmest unconcern perhaps the strongest     feature in his character was prudence never acting until     every circumstance every consideration was maturely weighed     refraining if he saw a doubt but when once decided going through     with his purpose whatever obstacles opposed his integrity was     most pure his justice the most inflexible i have ever known no     motives of interest or consanguinity of friendship or hatred     being able to bias his decision he was indeed in every sense     of the word a wise a good and a great man his temper was     naturally irritable and high toned but reflection and resolution     had obtained a firm and habitual ascendency over it  in conclusion the plain truth is that all parallels analogies and similitudes between the french revolution or any part or phase of it and our affairs in ireland are moonshine for the practical politician his problem is always individual for his purposes history never repeats itself human nature doubtless has a weakness for a precedent it is a weakness to be respected but there is no such thing as an essential reproduction of social and political combinations of circumstance to talk about robespierre in connection with ireland is just as idle as it was in robespierre to harangue about lycurgus and brutus in paris to compare the two is to place ireland under a preposterous magnifyingglass of monstrous dimension nor is disparity of scale the only difference vital as that is in no one of the leading characteristics of a community in a state of ferment save the odium that surrounds the landlords and that not universal does ireland today really resemble the france of a hundred years ago manners ideas beliefs traditions crumbling institutions rising aspirations the ordering of castes and classes the rivalry of creeds the relations with the governing powerall constitute elements of such radical divergence as to make comparison between modern ireland and revolutionary france for any more serious purpose than giving a conventional and familiar point to a sentence entirely worthless  it is pure dilettantism again to seek the moral of irish commotions in the insurrection of la vendée that as somebody has said was like a rising of the ancient gauls at the voice of the druids and led by their great chiefs it will be time enough to compare la vendée with ireland when the peasantry take the field against the british government with beresfords fitzgeralds and bourkes at their head if the vendéans had risen to drive out the charettes the bonchamps the larochejacquelins the parallel would have been nearer the mark the report of the devon commission the green pamphlet containing an account of the famous three days discussion between oconnell and butt in the dublin corporation in 1843 or half a dozen of lord clares speeches between 1793 and 1800 will give a clearer insight into the irish problem than a bushel of books about the vendéan or any other episode of the revolution  equally frivolous is it for any useful purpose of practical enlightenment to draw parallels between the action of the catholic clergy in ireland today and that of the french clergy on the eve of the revolution there is no sort of force in the argument that because the french clergy fared ill at the revolution1 therefore the irish clergy will fare ill when selfgovernment is bestowed on ireland such talk is mere ingenious guesswork at best without any of the foundations of a true historical analogy the differences between the two cases are obvious and they go to the heart of the matter for instance the men who came to the top of affairs in france were saturated both with speculative unbelief for one thing and with active hatred of the church for another in ireland on the contrary there is no speculative unbelief as oconnell used so constantly to boast and the church being poor voluntary and intensely national and popular has nourished none of those gross and swollen abuses which provoked the not unreasonable animosity of revolutionary france in truth it is with precisely as much or as little reason that most of the soothsayers and prognosticators of evil take the directly opposite line instead of france these persons choose as they have an equally good right to do to look for precedents to spain belgium or south america why not they assure us in their jingling phrase that home rule means rome rule that the priests will be the masters and that irish autonomy is only another name for the reign of bigotry superstition and obscurantism one of these two mutually destructive predictions has just as much to say for itself as the other and no more we may leave the prophets to fight it out between them while we attend to our business and examine facts and probabilities as they are without the aid of capriciously adopted precedents and fantastical analogies  footnote 1 the church did not fare so very ill after all the state in 1790 undertook the debts of the church to the tune of 130000000 livres and assured it an annual budget of rather more than that amountboiteaus etat de la france p 202  parallels from france or anywhere else may supply literary amusement they may furnish a weapon in the play of controversy they shed no light and do no service as we confront the solid facts of the business to be done lewis the fourteenth was the author of a very useful and superior commonplace when he wrote no man who is badly informed can avoid reasoning badly i believe that whoever is rightly instructed and rightly persuaded of all the facts would never do anything else but what he ought another great french ruler who even more than lewis had a piercing eye for men and the world of action said that the mind of a general ought to be like a fieldglass and as clear to see things exactly as they are et jamais se faire des tableauxnever to compose the objects before him into pictures the same maxim is nearly as good for the man who has to conquer difficulties in the field of government and analogies and parallels are one way of substituting pictures for plans and charts just because the statesmans problem is individual history can give him little help i am not so graceless as to depreciate history or literature either for public or for private persons you are a man napoleon said to goethe and there is no reason why literature should prevent the reader of books from being a man why it should blind him to the great practical truths that the end of life is not to think but to will that everything in the world has its decisive moment which statesmen know and seize that the genius of politics as a great man of letters truly wrote has not all or nothing for its motto but seeks on the contrary to extract the greatest advantage from situations the most compromised and never flings the helve after the hatchet like literature the use of history in politics is to refresh to open to make the mind generous and hospitable to enrich to impart flexibility to quicken and nourish political imagination and invention to instruct in the common difficulties and the various experiences of government to enable a statesman to place himself at a general and spacious standpoint all this whether it be worth much or little and it is surely worth much is something wholly distinct from directly aiding a statesman in the performance of a specific task in such a case an analogy from history if he be not sharply on his guard is actually more likely than not to mislead him i certainly do not mean the history of the special problem itself of that he cannot possibly know too much nor master its past course and foregone bearings too thoroughly ireland is a great standing instance there is no more striking example of the disastrous results of trying to overcome political difficulties without knowing how they came into existence and where they have their roots the only history that furnishes a clue in irish questions is the history of ireland and the people who have lived in it or have been driven out of it     on the study of literature1  footnote 1 the annual address to the students of the london society for the extension of university teaching delivered at the mansion house february 26th 1887   when my friend mr goschen invited me to discharge the duty which has fallen to me this afternoon i confess that i complied with many misgivings he desired me to say something on the literary side of education now it is almost impossibleand i think those who know most of literature will be readiest to agree with meto say anything new in recommendation of literature in a scheme of education i have felt however that mr goschen has worked with such zeal and energy for so many years on behalf of this good cause that anybody whom he considered able to render him any cooperation owed it to him in its fullest extent the lord mayor has been kind enough to say that i am especially qualified to speak on english literature i must however remind the lord mayor that i have strayed from literature into the region of politics and i am not at all sure that such a journey conduces to the aptness of ones judgment on literary subjects or adds much to the force of ones arguments on behalf of literary study politics are a field where action is one long secondbest and where the choice constantly lies between two blunders nothing can be more unlike in aim in ideals in method and in matter than are literature and politics i have however determined to do the best that i can and i feel how great an honour it is to be invited to partake in a movement which i do not hesitate to call one of the most important of all those now taking place in english society  what is the object of the movement what do the promoters aim at i take it that what they design is to bring the very best teaching that the country can afford through the hands of the most thoroughly competent men within the reach of every class of the community their object is to give to the many that sound systematic and methodical knowledge which has hitherto been the privilege of the few who can afford the time and money to go to oxford and cambridge to diffuse the fertilising waters of intellectual knowledge from their great and copious fountainheads at the universities by a thousand irrigating channels over the whole length and breadth of our busy indomitable land gentlemen this is a most important point goethe said that nothing is more frightful than a teacher who only knows what his scholars are intended to know we may depend upon it that the man who knows his own subject most thoroughly is most likely to excite interest about it in the minds of other people we hear perhaps more often than we like that we live in a democratic age it is true enough and i can conceive nothing more democratic than such a movement as this nothing which is more calculated to remedy defects that are incident to democracy more thoroughly calculated to raise modern democracy to heights which other forms of government and older orderings of society have never yet attained no movement can be more wisely democratic than one which seeks to give to the northern miner or the london artisan knowledge as good and as accurate though he may not have so much of it as if he were a student at oxford or cambridge something of the same kind may be said of the new frequency with which scholars of great eminence and consummate accomplishments like jowett lang myers leaf and others bring all their scholarship to bear in order to provide for those who are not able or do not care to read old classics in the originals brilliant and faithful renderings of them in our own tongue nothing but good i am persuaded can come of all these attempts to connect learning with the living forces of society and to make industrial england a sharer in the classic tradition of the lettered world  i am well aware that there is an apprehension that the present extraordinary zeal for education in all its formselementary secondary and highermay bear in its train some evils of its own it is said that before long nobody in england will be content to practise a handicraft and that every one will insist on being at least a clerk it is said that the moment is even already at hand when a great deal of practical distress does and must result from this tendency i remember years ago that in the united states i heard something of the same kind all i can say is that this tendency if it exists is sure to right itself in no case can the spread of so mischievous a notion as that knowledge and learning ought not to come within reach of handicraftsmen be attributed to literature there is a familiar passage in which pericles the great athenian describing the glory of the community of which he was so farshining a member says we at athens are lovers of the beautiful yet simple in our tastes we cultivate the mind without loss of manliness but then remember that after all athenian society rested on a basis of slavery athenian citizens were able to pursue their love of the beautiful and their simplicity and to cultivate their minds without loss of manliness because the drudgery and hard work and rude service of society were performed by those who had no share in all these good things with us happily it is very different we are all more or less upon a level our object isand it is that which in my opinion raises us infinitely above the athenian levelto bring the periclean ideas of beauty and simplicity and cultivation of the mind within the reach of those who do the drudgery and the service and rude work of the world and it can be donedo not let us be afraidit can be done without in the least degree impairing the skill of our handicraftsmen or the manliness of our national life it can be done without blunting or numbing the practical energies of our people  i know they say that if you meddle with literature you are less qualified to take your part in practical affairs you run a risk of being labelled a dreamer and a theorist but after all if we take the very highest form of all practical energythe governing of the countryall this talk is ludicrously untrue i venture to say that in the present government 1887 including the prime minister there are three men at least who are perfectly capable of earning their bread as men of letters in the late government besides the prime minister there were also three men of letters and i have never heard that those three were greater simpletons than their neighbours there is a commission now at work on that very important and abstruse subjectthe currency i am told that no one there displays so acute an intelligence of the difficulties that are to be met and so ready an apprehension of the important arguments that are brought forward and the practical ends to be achieved as the chairman of the commission who is not what is called a practical man but a man of study literature theoretical speculation and university training1 oh no gentlemen some of the best men of business in the country are men who have had the best collegians equipment and are the most accomplished bookmen  footnote 1 mr arthur balfour  it is true that we cannot bring to london with this movement the indefinable charm that haunts the grey and venerable quadrangles of oxford and cambridge we cannot take you into the stately halls the silent and venerable libraries the solemn chapels the studious oldworld gardens we cannot surround you with all those elevated memorials and sanctifying associations of scholars and poets of saints and sages that march in glorious procession through the ages and make of oxford and cambridge a dream of music for the inward ear and of delight for the contemplative eye we cannot bring all that to you but i hope and i believe it is the object of those who are more intimately connected with the society than i have been that every partaker of the benefits of this society will feel himself and herself in living connection with those two famous centres and feel conscious of the links that bind the modern to the older england one of the most interesting facts mentioned in your report this year is that last winter four prizes of £10 each were offered in the mining district of northumberland one each to the male and female student in every term who should take the highest place in the examination in order to enable them to spend a month in cambridge in the long vacation for the purpose of carrying on in the laboratories and museums the work in which they had been engaged in the winter at the local centre that is not a step taken by our society but the university of cambridge has inspired and worked out the scheme and i am not without hope that from london some of those who attend these classes may be able to realise in person the attractions and the associations of these two great historic sites one likes to think how poor scholars three or four hundred years ago used to flock to oxford regardless of cold privation and hardship so that they might satisfy their hunger and thirst for knowledge i like to think of them in connection with this movement i like to think of them in connection with students like those miners in northumberland whom i know well and who are mentioned in the report of the cambridge extension society as after a days hard work in the pit walking four or five miles through cold and darkness and rough roads to hear a lecture and then walking back again the same four or five miles you must look for the same enthusiasm the same hunger and thirst for knowledge that presided over the foundation of the universities many centuries ago to carry on this work to strengthen and stimulate mens faith in knowledge their hopes from it and their zeal for it  speaking now of the particular kind of knowledge of which i am going to say a few wordshow does literature fare in these important operations last term out of fiftyseven courses in the cambridge scheme there were ten on literature out of thirtyone of our courses seven were on literature i am bound to say i think that such a position for literature in the scheme is very reasonably satisfactory i have made some inquiries since i knew that i was going to speak here in the great popular centres of industry in the north and in scotland as to the popularity of literature as a subject of teaching i find very much what i should have expected the professors all tell very much the same story and this is that it is extremely hard to interest any considerable number of people in subjects that seem to have no direct bearing upon the practical work of everyday life there is a disinclination to study literature for its own sake or to study anything which does not seem to have a visible and direct influence upon the daily work of life the nearest approach to a taste for literature is a certain demand for instruction in history with a little flavour of contemporary politics in short the demand for instruction in literature is strictly moderate that is what men of experience tell me and we have to recognise it nor ought we to be at all surprised mr goschen when he spoke some years ago said there were three motives which might induce people to seek the higher education first to obtain greater knowledge for breadwinning purposes from that point of view science would be most likely to feed the classes secondly the improvement of ones knowledge of political economy and history and facts bearing upon the actual political work and life of the day thirdly was the desire of knowledge as a luxury to brighten life and kindle thought i am very much afraid that in the ordinary temper of our people and the ordinary mode of looking at life the last of these motives savours a little of selfindulgence and sentimentality and other objectionable qualities there is a great stir in the region of physical science at this moment and it is likely as any one may see to take a chief and foremost place in the field of intellectual activity after the severity with which science was for so many ages treated by literature we cannot wonder that science now retaliates now mightily exalts herself and thrusts literature down into the lower place i only have to say on the relative claims of science and literature what dr arnold saidif one might wish for impossibilities i might then wish that my children might be well versed in physical science but in due subordination to the fulness and freshness of their knowledge on moral subjects this however i believe cannot be wherefore rather than have it the principal thing in my sons mind i would gladly have him think that the sun went round the earth and that the stars were so many spangles set in the bright blue firmament stanleys life of arnold ii 31 it is satisfactory that one may know something of these matters and yet not believe that the sun goes round the earth but if there is to be exclusion i for one am not prepared to accept the rather enormous pretensions that are nowadays sometimes made for physical science as the beall and endall of education  next to this we know that there is a great stir on behalf of technical and commercial education the special needs of our time and country compel us to pay a particular attention to this subject here knowledge is business and we shall never hold our industrial preeminence with all that hangs upon that preeminence unless we push on technical and commercial education with all our might but there is a third kind of knowledge and that too in its own way is business there is the cultivation of the sympathies and imagination the quickening of the moral sensibilities and the enlargement of the moral vision the great need in modern culture which is scientific in method rationalistic in spirit and utilitarian in purpose is to find some effective agency for cherishing within us the ideal that is the business and function of literature literature alone will not make a good citizen it will not make a good man history affords too many proofs that scholarship and learning by no means purge men of acrimony of vanity of arrogance of a murderous tenacity about trifles mere scholarship and learning and the knowledge of books do not by any means arrest and dissolve all the travelling acids of the human system nor would i pretend for a moment that literature can be any substitute for life and action burke said what is the education of the generality of the world reading a parcel of books no restraint and discipline examples of virtue and of justice these are what form the education of the world that is profoundly true it is life that is the great educator but the parcel of books if they are well chosen reconcile us to this discipline they interpret this virtue and justice they awaken within us the diviner mind and rouse us to a consciousness of what is best in others and ourselves  as a matter of rude fact there is much to make us question whether the spread of literature as now understood does awaken the diviner mind the numbers of the books that are taken out from public libraries are not all that we could wish i am not going to inflict many figures on you but there is one set of these figures that distresses bookloversi mean the enormous place that fiction occupies in the books that are taken out in one great town in the north prose fiction forms 76 per cent of all the books lent in another great town prose fiction is 82 per cent in a third 84 per cent and in a fourth 67 per cent i had the curiosity to see what happens in the libraries of the united states and theresupposing the system of cataloguing and enumeration to be the samethey are a trifle more serious in their taste than we are where our average is about 70 per cent at a place like chicago it is only about 60 per cent in scotland too it ought to be said that they have a better average in respect to prose fiction there is a larger demand for books called serious than in england and i suspect though i do not know that one reason why there is in scotland a greater demand for the more serious classes of literature than fiction is that in the scotch universities there are what we have not in englandwellattended chairs of literature systematically and methodically studied do not let it be supposed that i at all underrate the value of fiction on the contrary when a man has done a hard days work what can he do better than fall to and read the novels of walter scott or the brontes or mrs gaskell or some of our living writers i am rather a voracious reader of fiction myself i do not therefore point to it as a reproach or as a source of discouragement that fiction takes so large a place in the objects of literary interest i only suggest that it is much too large and we should be better pleased if it sank to about 40 per cent and what is classified as general literature rose from 13 to 25 per cent  there are other complaints of literature as an object of interest in this country i was reading the other day an essay by the late head of my old college at oxford that very learned and remarkable man mark pattison who was a booklover if ever there was one he complained that the booksellers bill in the ordinary english middle class family is shamefully small it appeared to him to be monstrous that a man who is earning £1000 a year should spend less than £1 a week on booksthat is to say less than a shilling in the pound per annum i know that chancellors of the exchequer take from us 8d or 6d in the pound and i am not sure that they always use it as wisely as if they left us to spend it on books still a shilling in the pound to be spent on books by a clerk who earns a couple of hundred pounds a year or by a workman who earns a quarter of that sum is rather more i think than can be reasonably expected a man does not really need to have a great many books pattison said that nobody who respected himself could have less than 1000 volumes he pointed out that you can stack 1000 octavo volumes in a bookcase that shall be 13 feet by 10 feet and 6 inches deep and that everybody has that small amount of space at disposal still the point is not that men should have a great many books but that they should have the right ones and that they should use those that they have we may all agree in lamenting that there are so many houseseven some of considerable social pretensionwhere you will not find a good atlas a good dictionary or a good cyclopaedia of reference what is still more lamentable in a good many more houses where these books are they are never referred to or opened that is a very discreditable fact because i defy anybody to take up a single copy of the times newspaper and not come upon something in it upon which if their interest in the affairs of the day were active intelligent and alert as it ought to be they would consult an atlas dictionary or cyclopaedia of reference  no sensible person can suppose for a single moment that everybody is born with the ability for using books for reading and studying literature certainly not everybody is born with the capacity of being a great scholar all people are no more born great scholars like gibbon and bentley than they are all born great musicians like handel and beethoven what is much worse than that many come into the world with the incapacity of reading just as they come into it with the incapacity of distinguishing one tune from another to them i have nothing to say even the morning paper is too much for them they can only skim the surface even of that i go further and frankly admit that the habit and power of reading with reflection comprehension and memory all alert and awake does not come at once to the natural man any more than many other sovereign virtues come to that interesting creature what i do venture to press upon you is that it requires no preterhuman force of will in any young man or womanunless household circumstances are more than usually vexatious and unfavourableto get at least half an hour out of a solid busy day for good and disinterested reading some will say that this is too much to expect and the first persons to say it i venture to predict will be those who waste their time most at any rate if i cannot get half an hour i will be content with a quarter now in half an hour i fancy you can read fifteen or twenty pages of burke or you can read one of wordsworths masterpiecessay the lines on tintern or say onethirdif a scholar in the original and if not in a translationof a book of the iliad or the aeneid i do not think that i am filling the halfhour too full but try for yourselves what you can read in half an hour then multiply the halfhour by 365 and consider what treasures you might have laid by at the end of the year and what happiness fortitude and wisdom they would have given you during all the days of your life  i will not take up your time by explaining the various mechanical contrivances and aids to successful study they are not to be despised by those who would extract the most from books many people think of knowledge as of money they would like knowledge but cannot face the perseverance and selfdenial that go to the acquisition of it the wise student will do most of his reading with a pen or a pencil in his hand  he will not shrink from the useful toil of making abstracts and summaries of what he is reading sir william hamilton was a strong advocate for underscoring books of study intelligent underlining he said gave a kind of abstract of an important work and by the use of different coloured inks to mark a difference of contents and discriminate the doctrinal from the historical or illustrative elements of an argument or exposition the abstract became an analysis very serviceable for ready reference1 this assumes as hamilton said that the book to be operated on is your own and perhaps is rather too elaborate a counsel of perfection for most of us again some great mengibbon was one and daniel webster was another and the great lord strafford was a thirdalways before reading a book made a short rough analysis of the questions which they expected to be answered in it the additions to be made to their knowledge and whither it would take them  footnote 1 veitchs life of hamilton pp 314 392  after glancing my eye says gibbon over the design and order of a new book i suspended the perusal until i had finished the task of selfexamination till i had revolved in a solitary walk all that i knew or believed or had thought on the subject of the whole work or of some particular chapter i was then qualified to discern how much the author added to my original stock and if i was sometimes satisfied by the agreement i was sometimes armed by the opposition of our ideas1  footnote 1 dr smiths gibbon i 64  i have sometimes tried that way of steadying and guiding attention and i commend it to you i need not tell you that you will find that most books worth reading once are worth reading twice andwhat is most important of allthe masterpieces of literature are worth reading a thousand times it is a great mistake to think that because you have read a masterpiece once or twice or ten times therefore you have done with it because it is a masterpiece you ought to live with it and make it part of your daily life another practice is that of keeping a commonplace book and transcribing into it what is striking and interesting and suggestive and if you keep it wisely as locke has taught us you will put every entry under a head division or subdivision1 this is an excellent practice for concentrating your thought on the passage and making you alive to its real point and significance here however the high authority of gibbon is against us he refuses strenuously to recommend the action of the pen he says will doubtless imprint an idea on the mind as well as on the paper but i much question whether the benefits of this laborious method are adequate to the waste of time and i must agree with dr johnson idler no 74 that what is twice read is commonly better remembered than what is transcribed2  footnote 1 if i would put anything in my commonplace book i find out a head to which i may refer it each head ought to be some important and essential word to the matter in hand lockes works iii 308 ed 1801  footnote 2 this is for indexing purposes but it is worth while to go further and make a title for the passage extracted indicating its pith and purport  various correspondents have asked me to say something about those lists of a hundred books that have been circulating through the world within the last few months i have examined some of these lists with considerable care and whatever else may be said of themand i speak of them with deference and reserve because men for whom one must have a great regard have compiled themthey do not seem to me to be calculated either to create or satisfy a wise taste for literature in any very worthy sense to fill a man with a hundred parcels of heterogeneous scraps from the mahabharata and the sheking down to pickwick and whites selborne may pass the time but i cannot perceive how it would strengthen or instruct or delight for instance it is a mistake to think that every book that has a great name in the history of books or of thought is worth reading some of the most famous books are least worth reading their fame was due to their doing something that needed in their day to be done the work done the virtue of the book expires again i agree with those who say that the steady working down one of these lists would end in the manufacture of that obnoxious productthe prig a prig has been defined as an animal that is overfed for its size i think that these bewildering miscellanies would lead to an immense quantity of that kind of overfeeding the object of reading is not to dip into everything that even wise men have ever written in the words of one of the most winning writers of english that ever existedcardinal newmanthe object of literature in education is to open the mind to correct it to refine it to enable it to comprehend and digest its knowledge to give it power over its own faculties application flexibility method critical exactness sagacity address and expression these are the objects of that intellectual perfection which a literary education is destined to give i will not venture on a list of a hundred books but will recommend you instead to one book well worthy of your attention those who are curious as to what they should read in the region of pure literature will do well to peruse mr frederic harrisons admirable volume called the choice of books you will find there as much wise thought eloquently and brilliantly put as in any volume of its size and on its subject whether it be in the list of a hundred or not  let me pass to another topic we are often asked whether it is best to study subjects or authors or books well i think that is like most of the stock questions with which the perverse ingenuity of mankind torments itself there is no universal and exclusive answer my own answer is a very plain one it is sometimes best to study books sometimes authors and sometimes subjects but at all times it is best to study authors subjects and books in connection with one another whether you make your first approach from interest in an author or in a book the fruit will be only half gathered if you leave off without new ideas and clearer lights both on the man and the matter one of the noblest masterpieces in the literature of civil and political wisdom is to be found in burkes three performances on the american warhis speech on taxation in 1774 on conciliation in 1775 and his letter to the sheriffs of bristol in 1777 i can only repeat to you what i have been saying in print and out of it for a good many years and what i believe more firmly as observation is enlarged by time and occasion that these three pieces are the most perfect manual in all literature for the study of great affairs whether for the purpose of knowledge or action they are an example as i have said before now an example without fault of all the qualities which the critic whether a theorist or an actor of great political situations should strive by night and by day to possess if their subject were as remote as the quarrel between the corinthians and corcyra or the war between rome and the allies instead of a conflict to which the world owes the opportunity of one of the most important of political experiments we should still have everything to learn from the authors treatment the vigorous grasp of masses of compressed detail the wide illumination from great principles of human experience the strong and masculine feeling for the two great political ends of justice and freedom the large and generous interpretation of expediency the morality the vision the noble temper no student worthy of the name will lay aside these pieces so admirable in their literary expression so important for history so rich in the lessons of civil wisdom until he has found out something from other sources as to the circumstances from which such writings arose and as to the man whose resplendent genius inspired them there are great personalities like burke who march through history with voices like a clarion trumpet and something like the glitter of swords in their hands they are as interesting as their work contact with them warms and kindles the mind you will not be content after reading one of these pieces without knowing the character and personality of the man who conceived it and until you have spent an hour or twoand an hour or two will go a long way with burke still fresh in your mindover other compositions in political literature over bacons civil pieces or machiavellis prince and others in the same order of thought  this points to the right answer to another question that is constantly asked we are constantly asked whether desultory reading is among things lawful and permitted may we browse at large in a library as johnson said or is it forbidden to open a book without a definite aim and fixed expectations i am for a compromise if a man has once got his general point of view if he has striven with success to place himself at the centre what follows is of less consequence if he has got in his head a good map of the country he may ramble at large with impunity if he has once well and truly laid the foundations of a methodical systematic habit of mind what he reads will find its way to its proper place if his intellect is in good order he will find in every quarter something to assimilate and something that will nourish  next i am going to deal with another question with which perhaps i ought to have started what is literature it has often been defined emerson says it is a record of the best thoughts by literature says another author we mean the written thoughts and feelings of intelligent men and women arranged in a way that shall give pleasure to the reader a third account is that the aim of a student of literature is to know the best that has been thought in the world definitions always appear to me in these things to be in the nature of vanity i feel that the attempt to be compact in the definition of literature ends in something that is rather meagre partial starved and unsatisfactory i turn to the answer given by a great french writer to a question not quite the same viz what is a classic literature consists of a whole body of classics in the true sense of the word and a classic as saintebeuve defines him is an author who has enriched the human mind who has really added to its treasure who has got it to take a step further who has discovered some unequivocal moral truth or penetrated to some eternal passion in that heart of man where it seemed as though all were known and explored who has produced his thought or his observation or his invention under some form no matter what so it be great large acute and reasonable sane and beautiful in itself who has spoken to all in a style of his own yet a style which finds itself the style of everybodyin a style that is at once new and antique and is the contemporary of all the ages another frenchman doudan who died in 1872 has an excellent passage on the same subject      the man of letters properly so called is a rather singular being     he does not look at things exactly with his own eyes he has not     impressions of his own we could not discover the imagination with     which he started tis a tree on which have been grafted homer     virgil milton dante petrarch hence have grown peculiar flowers     which are not natural and yet which are not artificial study has     given to the man of letters something of the reverie of rené with     homer he has looked upon the plain of troy and there has remained     in his brain some of the light of the grecian sky he has taken a     little of the pensive lustre of virgil as he wanders by his side     on the slopes of the aventine he sees the world as milton saw it     through the grey mists of england as dante saw it through the     clear and glowing light of italy of all these colours he composes     for himself a colour that is unique and his own from all these     glasses by which his life passes on its journey to the real     world there is formed a special tint and that is what makes the     imagination of men of letters  at a single hearing you may not take all that in but if you should have any opportunity of recurring to it you will find this a satisfactory full and instructive account of what is a classic and will find in it a full and satisfactory account of what those who have thought most on literature hope to get from it and most would desire to confer upon others by it literature consists of till the booksand they are not so manywhere moral truth and human passion are touched with a certain largeness sanity and attraction of form my notion of the literary student is one who through books explores the strange voyages of mans moral reason the impulses of the human heart the chances and changes that have overtaken human ideals of virtue and happiness of conduct and manners and the shifting fortunes of great conceptions of truth and virtue poets dramatists humorists satirists masters of fiction the great preachers the characterwriters the maximwriters the great political oratorsthey are all literature in so far as they teach us to know man and to know human nature this is what makes literature rightly sifted and selected and rightly studied not the mere elegant trifling that it is so often and so erroneously supposed to be but a proper instrument for a systematic training of the imagination and sympathies and of a genial and varied moral sensibility  from this point of view let me remind you that books are not the products of accident and caprice as goethe said if you would understand an author you must understand his age the same thing is just as true of a book if you would fully comprehend it you must know the age there is an order there are causes and relations between great compositions and the societies in which they have emerged just as the naturalist strives to understand and to explain the distribution of plants and animals over the surface of the globe to connect their presence or their absence with the great geological climatic and oceanic changes so the student of literature if he be wise undertakes an ordered and connected survey of ideas of tastes of sentiments of imagination of humour of invention as they affect and as they are affected by the ever changing experiences of human nature and the manifold variations that time and circumstances are incessantly working in human society  those who are possessed and desire to see others possessed by that conception of literary study must watch with the greatest sympathy and admiration the efforts of those who are striving so hard and i hope so successfully to bring the systematic and methodical study of our own literature in connection with other literatures among subjects for teaching and examination in the universities of oxford and cambridge i regard those efforts with the liveliest interest and sympathy everybody agrees that an educated man ought to have a general notion of the course of the great outward events of european history so too an educated man ought to have a general notion of the course of all those inward thoughts and moods which find their expression in literature i think that in cultivating the study of literature as i have perhaps too laboriously endeavoured to define it you will be cultivating the most important side of history knowledge of it gives stability and substance to character it furnishes a view of the ground we stand on it builds up a solid backing of precedent and experience it teaches us where we are it protects us against imposture and surprise  before closing i should like to say one word upon the practice of composition i have suffered by the chance of life many things from the practice of composition it has been my lot i suppose to read more unpublished work than any one else in this room  there is an idea and i venture to think a very mistaken idea that you cannot have a taste for literature unless you are yourself an author i make bold entirely to demur to that proposition it is practically most mischievous and leads scores and even hundreds of people to waste their time in the most unprofitable manner that the wit of man can devise on work in which they can no more achieve even the most moderate excellence than they can compose a ninth symphony or paint a transfiguration it is a terrible error to suppose that because one is happily able to relish wordsworths solemnthoughted idyll or tennysons enchanted reverie therefore a solemn mission calls you to run off to write bad verse at the lakes or the isle of wight i beseech you not all to turn to authorship i will even venture with all respect to those who are teachers of literature to doubt the excellence and utility of the practice of overmuch essaywriting and composition i have very little faith in rules of style though i have an unbounded faith in the virtue of cultivating direct and precise expression but you must carry on the operation inside the mind and not merely by practising literary deportment on paper it is not everybody who can command the mighty rhythm of the greatest masters of human speech but every one can make reasonably sure that he knows what he means and whether he has found the right word these are internal operations and are not forwarded by writing for writings sake everybody must be urgent for attention to expression if that attention be exercised in the right way it has been said a million times that the foundation of right expression in speech or writing is sincerity that is as true now as it has ever been right expression is a part of character as somebody has said by learning to speak with precision you learn to think with correctness and the way to firm and vigorous speech lies through the cultivation of high and noble sentiments so far as my observation has gone men will do better if they seek precision by studying carefully and with an open mind and a vigilant eye the great models of writing than by excessive practice of writing on their own account  much might here be said on what is one of the most important of all the sides of literary study i mean its effect as helping to preserve the dignity and the purity of the english language that noble instrument has never been exposed to such dangers as those which beset it today domestic slang scientific slang pseudoaesthetic affectations hideous importations from american newspapers all bear down with horrible force upon the glorious fabric which the genius of our race has reared i will say nothing of my own on this pressing theme but will read to you a passage of weight and authority from the greatest master of mighty and beautiful speech  whoever in a state said milton knows how wisely to form the manners of men and to rule them at home and in war with excellent institutes him in the first place above others i should esteem worthy of all honour but next to him the man who strives to establish in maxims and rules the method and habit of speaking and writing received from a good age of the nation and as it were to fortify the same round with a kind of wall the daring to overleap which let a law only short of that of romulus be used to prevent the one as i believe supplies noble courage and intrepid counsels against an enemy invading the territory the other takes to himself the task of extirpating and defeating by means of a learned detective police of ears and a light band of good authors that barbarism which makes large inroads upon the minds of men and is a destructive intestine enemy of genius nor is it to be considered of small consequence what language pure or corrupt a people has or what is their customary degree of propriety in speaking it for let the words of a country be in part unhandsome and offensive in themselves in part debased by wear and wrongly uttered and what do they declare but by no light indication that the inhabitants of that country are an indolent idlyyawning race with minds already long prepared for any amount of servility on the other hand we have never heard that any empire any state did not at least flourish in a middling degree as long as its own liking and care for its language lasted1  footnote 1 letter to bonmattei from florence 1638  the probabilities are that we are now coming to an epoch of a quieter style there have been in our generation three strong masters in the aft of prose writing there was first of all carlyle there was macaulay and there is mr raskin these are all giants and they have the rights of giants but i do not believe that a greater misfortune can befall the students who attend classes here than that they should strive to write like any one of these three illustrious men i think it is the worst thing that can happen to them they can never attain to the high mark which they have set before themselves it is not everybody who can bend the bow of ulysses and most men only do themselves a mischief by trying to bend it if we are now on our way to a quieter style i am not sorry for it truth is quiet miltons phrase ever lingers in our minds as one of imperishable beautywhere he regrets that he is drawn by i know not what from beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful studies moderation and judgment are for most purposes more than the flash and the glitter even of the genius i hope that your professors of rhetoric will teach you to cultivate that golden artthe steadfast use of a language in which truth can be told a speech that is strong by natural force and not merely effective by declamation an utterance without trick without affectation without mannerisms without any of that excessive ambition which overleaps itself as disastrously in prose writing as in so many other things  i will detain you no longer i hope that i have made it clear that we conceive the end of education on its literary side to be to make a man and not a cyclopaedia to make a citizen and not an album of elegant extracts literature does not end with knowledge of forms with inventories of books and authors with finding the key of rhythm with the varying measure of the stanza or the changes from the involved and sonorous periods of the seventeenth century down to the staccato of the nineteenth or all the rest of the technicalities of scholarship do not think i contemn these they are all good things to know but they are not ends in themselves the intelligent man says plato will prize those studies which result in his soul getting soberness righteousness and wisdom and he will less value the others literature is one of the instruments and one of the most powerful instruments for forming character for giving us men and women armed with reason braced by knowledge clothed with steadfastness and courage and inspired by that public spirit and public virtue of which it has been well said that they are the brightest ornaments of the mind of man bacon is right as he generally is when he bids us read not to contradict and refute nor to believe and take for granted nor to find talk and discourse but to weigh and to consider yes let us read to weigh and to consider in the times before us that promise or threaten deep political economical and social controversy what we need to do is to induce our people to weigh and consider we want them to cultivate energy without impatience activity without restlessness inflexibility without illhumour i am not going to preach to you any artificial stoicism i am not going to preach to you any indifference to money or to the pleasures of social intercourse or to the esteem and goodwill of our neighbours or to any other of the consolations and necessities of life but after all the thing that matters most both for happiness and for duty is that we should strive habitually to live with wise thoughts and right feelings literature helps us more than other studies to this most blessed companionship of wise thoughts and right feelings and so i have taken this opportunity of earnestly commending it to your interest and care     victor hugos ninetythree   history has its truth legend has its truth legendary truth is of a different nature from historic truth legendary truth is invention with reality for result for the rest history and legend have the same aimto paint under the man of a day eternal humanity these words from his new and latest work ii 4 are a repetition of what victor hugo had already said in the introduction to his memorable legend of the ages1 but the occasion of their application is far more delicate poetry lends itself naturally to the spacious distant vague highly generalised way of present and real events a prose romance on the other hand is of necessity abundant in details in special circumstances in particularities of time and place this leaves all the more room for historic error and historic error in a work of imagination dealing with actual and known occurrences is obviously fatal not only to legendary truth but to legendary beauty and poetic impressiveness and then the pitfalls which lie about the feet of the frenchman who has to speak of 1793the terrible year of the modern epoch the delirium of the terror haunts most of the revolutionary historians and the choicest examples in all literature of bombast folly emptiness political immorality inhumanity formal repudiation of common sense and judgment are to be found in the rhapsodies which men of letters some of them men of eminence call histories of the revolution or lives of this or that actor in it  footnote 1 the references are to the Édition définitive in two volumes  it was hardly a breach therefore of ones allegiance to hugos superb imaginative genius if one had misgivings as to the result of an attempt even in his strong hands to combine legend with truth on a disastrous field in which grave writers with academic solemnity had confounded truth with the falsest kind of legend the theme was so likely to emphasise the defects incident to his mighty qualities so likely to provoke an exaggeration of those mannerisms of thought no less than of phrase which though never ignoble nor paltry yet now and then take something from the loftiness and sincerity of the writers work wisdom however is justified of her children and m hugos genius has justified his choice of a difficult and perilous subject quatrevingttreize is a monument of its authors finest gifts and while those who are happily endowed with the capacity of taking delight in nobility and beauty of imaginative work will find themselves in possession of a new treasure the lover of historic truth who hates to see abstractions passed off for actualities and legend erected in the place of fact escapes with his sensibilities almost unwounded  the historic interlude at the beginning of the second volume is undoubtedly open to criticism from the political students point of view as a sketch of the convention the scene of its sittings the stormful dramas that were enacted there one after another for month after month the singular men who one after another rode triumphant upon the whirlwind for a little space and were then mercilessly in an instant swept into outer darkness the commoner men who cowered before the fury of the storm and were like smoke driven hither and thither by the wind and laboured hard upon a thousand schemes for human improvement some admirable others mere frenzy while mobs filed in and danced mad carmagnoles before themall this is a magnificent masterpiece of accurate full and vivid description to the philosophy of it we venture to demur the mystic supernatural view of the french revolution which is so popular among french writers who object to the supernatural and the mystical everywhere else is to us a thing most incredible most puerile most mischievous people talk of 93 as a greek tragedian treats the tale of troy divine or the terrible fortunes of the house of atreus as the result of dark invincible fate as the unalterable decree of the immortal gods even victor hugos strong spirit does not quite overcome the demoralising doctrine of a certain revolutionary school though he has the poets excuse thus of the convention      minds all a prey to the wind but this wind was a wind of miracle     and portent to be a member of the convention was to be a wave     of the ocean and this was true of its greatest the force of     impulsion came from on high there was in the convention a will     which was the will of all and yet was the will of no one it was     an idea an idea resistless and without measure which breathed in     the shadow from the high heavens we call that the revolution as     this idea passed it threw down one and raised up another it bore     away this man in the foam and broke that man to pieces upon the     rocks the idea knew whither it went and drove the gulf of waters     before it to impute the revolution to men is as one who should     impute the tide to the waves the revolution is an action of the     unknown it is a form of the abiding phenomenon that shuts us     in on every side and that we call necessity in presence     of these climacteric catastrophes which waste and vivify     civilisation one is slow to judge detail to blame or praise men     on account of the result is as if one should blame or praise the     figures on account of the total that which must pass passes the     storm that must rage rages the eternal serenity does not suffer     from these boisterous winds above revolutions truth and justice     abide as the starry heaven abides above the tempests i     188189  as a lyric passage full of the breath of inspiration as history superficial and untrue as morality enervating and antinomian the author is assuredly far nearer the mark in another place when he speaks of that immense improvisation which is the french revolution ii 35an improvisation of which every step can be rationally explained  after all this is no more than an interlude victor hugo only surveys the events of 93 as a field for the growth of types of character his instinct as an artist takes him away from the paris of 93 where the confusion uproar human frenzy leave him no background of nature with natures fixity sternness indifference sublimity this he found in la vendée whose vast forests grow under the pencil of this master of all the more terrible and majestic effects into a picture hardly less sombre and mighty in its impressiveness than the memorable ocean pieces of the toilers of the sea if the waves are appalling in their agitation their thunders their sterility the forest is appalling in its silence its dimness its rest and the invisibleness of the thousand kinds of life to which it gives a shelter if the violence and calm and mercilessness of the sea penetrated the romance of eight years ago with transcendent fury so does the stranger more mysterious and in a sense even the more inhuman life of the forest penetrate the romance of today from the opening chapter down to the very close even while the interlude takes us for a little while to the paris café where danton robespierre and marat sit in angry counsel even while we are on the sea with the royalist marquis and halmalo the reader is subtly haunted by the great vendean woods their profundity their mystery their tragic and sinister beauties      the forest is barbarous      the configuration of the land counsels man in many an act more     than we suppose it is his accomplice in the presence of certain     savage landscapes you are tempted to exonerate man and blame     creation you feel a silent challenge and incitement from nature     the desert is constantly unwholesome for conscience especially     for a conscience without light conscience may be a giant that     makes a socrates or a jesus it may be a dwarf that makes an     atreus or a judas the puny conscience soon turns reptile the     twilight thickets the brambles the thorns the marsh waters     under branches make for it a fatal haunting place amid all this     it undergoes the mysterious infiltration of ill suggestions the     optical illusions the unexplained images the scaring hour     the scaring spot all throw man into that kind of affright     halfreligious halfbrutal which in ordinary times engenders     superstition and in epochs of violence savagery hallucinations     hold the torch that lights the path to murder there is something     like vertigo in the brigand nature with her prodigies has a     double effect she dazzles great minds and blinds the duller     soul when man is ignorant when the desert offers visions     the obscurity of the solitude is added to the obscurity of the     intelligence thence in man comes the opening of abysses certain     rocks certain ravines certain thickets certain wild openings     of the evening sky through the trees drive man towards mad or     monstrous exploits we might almost call some places criminal     ii 21  with la vendée for background and some savage incidents of the bloody vendean war for external machinery victor hugo has realised his conception of 93 in three types of character lantenac the royalist marquis cimourdain the puritan turned jacobin and gauvain for whom one can as yet find no short name he belonging to the millenarian times lantenac though naturally a less original creation than the other two is still an extremely bold and striking figure drawn with marked firmness of hand and presenting a thoroughly distinct and coherent conception it is a triumph of the poetic or artistic part of the authors nature over the merely political part that he should have made even his type of the old feudal order which he execrates so bitterly a heroic if ever so little also a diabolic personage there is everything that is cruel merciless unflinching in lantenac there is nothing that is mean or insignificant a gunner at sea by inattention to the lashing of his gun causes an accident which breaks the ship to pieces and then he saves the lives of the crew by hazarding his own life to secure the wandering monster lantenac decorates him with the cross of saint lewis for his gallantry and instantly afterwards has him shot for his carelessness he burns homesteads and villages fusillades men and women and makes the war a war without quarter or grace yet he is no swashbuckler of the melodramatic stage there is a fine reserve a brief gravity in the delineation of him his clear will his quickness his intrepidity his relentlessness which make of him the incarnation of aristocratic coldness hatred and pride you might guillotine lantenac with exquisite satisfaction and yet he does not make us ashamed of mankind into his mouth as he walks about his dungeon impatiently waiting to be led out to execution victor hugo has put the aristocratic view of the revolution some portions of it ii 224226 would fit amazingly well into m renans notions about the moral and intellectual reform of france  if the breton aristocrat of 93 was fearless intrepid and without mercy in defence of god and the kingand his qualities were all shared the democrat may love to remember by the breton peasant whether peasant follower or peasant leaderthe jacobin was just as vigorous as intrepid as merciless in defence of his republic pays patrie says victor hugo in words which perhaps will serve to describe many a future passage in french history ces deux mots résument toute la guerre de vendée querelle de lidée locale centre lidée universelle paysans contre patriotes ii 221 certainly the jacobins were the patriots of that era the deliverers of france from something like that process of partition which further east was consummated in this very 93 we do not mean the handful of odious miscreants who played fool and demon in turns in the insurrectionary commune and elsewhere such men as collot dherbois or carrier or panis the normal jacobin was a remarkable type he has been excellently described by louis blanc as something powerful original sombre half agitator and half statesman half puritan and half monk half inquisitor and half tribune these words of the historian are the exact prose version of the figure of cimourdain the typical jacobin of the poet cimourdain was a pure conscience but sombre he had in him the absolute he had been a priest and that is a serious thing man like the sky may have a dark serenity it is enough that something should have brought night into his soul priesthood had brought night into cimourdain he who has been a priest is one still what brings night upon us may leave the stars with us cimourdain was full of virtues full of truths but they shone in the midst of darkness i 123 if the aristocrat had rigidity so had the jacobin cimourdain had the blind certitude of the arrow which only sees the mark and makes for it in revolution nothing so formidable as the straight line cimourdain strode forward with fatality in his step he believed that in social genesis the very extreme point must always be solid ground an error peculiar to minds that for reason substitute logic i 127 and so forth until the character of the jacobin lives for us with a precision a fulness a naturalness such as neither carlyle nor michelet nor quinet has been able to clothe it with though these too have the sacred illumination of genius victor hugos jacobin is a poetic creation yet the creation only lies in the vivid completeness with which the imagination of a great master has realised to itself the traits and life of an actual personality it is not that he has any special love for his jacobin but that he has the poets eye for types politics apart he sees how much the aristocrat slaying hip and thigh for the king and the jacobin slaying hip and thigh for the republic resembled one another let us confess he says these two men the marquis and the priest lantenac and cimourdain were up to a certain point the selfsame man the bronze mask of civil war has two profiles one turned towards the past the other towards the future but as tragic the one as the other lantenac was the first of these profiles cimourdain was the second only the bitter rictus of lantenac was covered with shadow and night and on the fatal brow of cimourdain was a gleaming of the dawn ii 91  footnote 1 in corroboration of this view of the vendean rising as democratic see mortimerternaux hist de la terreur vol vi bk 30  and let us mark victor hugos signal distinction in his analysis of character it is not mere vigour of drawing nor acuteness of perception nor fire of imagination though he has all these gifts in a singular degree and truest of their kind but then scott had them too and yet we feel in victor hugos work a seriousness a significance a depth of tone which never touches us in the work of his famous predecessor in romance delightful as the best of that work is balfour of burley is one of scotts most commanding figures and the stern covenanter is nearly in the same plane of character as the stern heroic jacobin yet cimourdain impresses us more profoundly he is as natural as human as readily conceivable and yet he produces something of the subtle depth of effect which belongs to the actor in a play of aeschylus why is this because hugo makes us conscious of that tragedy of temperament that sterner necessity of character that resistless compulsion of circumstance which is the modern and positive expression for the old destiny of the greeks and which in some expression or other is now an essential element in the highest presentation of human life here is not the unknown on the contrary we are in the very heart of science tragedy to the modern is not greek tuchae but a thing of cause and effect invariable antecedent and invariable consequent it is the presence of this tragic force underlying action that gives to all hugos work its lofty quality its breadth and generality and fills both it and us who read with pity and gravity and an understanding awe  the action is this cimourdain had the young gauvain to train from his earliest childhood and the pupil grew up with the same rigid sense of duty as the master though temperament modified its form when the revolution came gauvain though a noble took sides with the people but he was not of the same spirit as his teacher the revolution says victor hugo by the side of youthful figures of giants such as danton saintjust and robespierre has young ideal figures like hoche and marceau gauvain was one of these figures ii 34 cimourdain has himself named delegate from the committee of public safety to the expeditionary column of which gauvain is in command the warmth of affection between them was undiminished but difference in temperament bred difference in their principles they represented as the author says with the candour of the poet the two poles of the truth the two sides of the inarticulate subterranean fatal contention of the year of the terror their arguments with one another make the situation more intelligible to the historic student as they make the characters of the speakers more transparent for the purposes of the romance  this is cimourdain      beware there are terrible duties in life do not accuse what is     not responsible since when has the disorder been the fault of the     physician yes what marks this tremendous year is being without     pity why because it is the great revolutionary year this year     incarnates the revolution the revolution has an enemy the old     world and to that it is pitiless just as the surgeon has     an enemy gangrene and is pitiless to that the revolution     extirpates kingship in the king aristocracy in the noble     despotism in the soldier superstition in the priest barbarity in     the judge in a word whatever is tyranny in whatever is tyrant     the operation is frightful the revolution performs it with a sure     hand as to the quantity of sound flesh that it requires ask     boerhave what he thinks of it what tumour that has to be cut out     does not involve loss of blood the revolution devotes itself     to its fated task it mutilates but it saves it has the past     in its grasp it will not spare it makes in civilisation a deep     incision whence shall come the safety of the human race you     suffer no doubt how long will it last the time needed for the     operation then you will live etc ii 6566  one day he adds the revolution will justify the terror to which gauvain retorts thus      fear lest the terror be the calumny of the revolution liberty     equality fraternity are dogmas of peace and harmony why give     them an aspect of alarm what do we seek to win nations to the     universal

blood save at hazard of my own in the fight let us be     the enemies of our foes and after the victory their brothers     ii 67  these two together cimourdain and gauvain make an ideal pair of the revolutionists of 93 strip each of them of the beauty of character with which the poets imagination has endowed them add instead passion violence envy egoism malice then you understand how in the very face of the foreign enemy girondins sharpened the knife for the men of the mountain hébertists screamed for the lives of robespierrists robespierre struck off the head of danton thermidorians crushed robespierre  victor hugo has given to this typic historical struggle of 93 the qualities of nobleness and beauty which art requires in dealing with real themes lantenac falls into the hands of the blues headed by cimourdain and gauvain but he does so in consequence of yielding to a heroic and selfdevoting impulse of humanity cimourdain true to his temperament insists on his instant execution gauvain true also to his temperament is seized with a thousand misgivings and there is no more ample original and masterly presentation of a case of conscience that in civil war is always common enough than the struggle through which gauvain passes before he can resolve to deliver lantenac this pathetic debatethe stone of sisyphus which is only the quarrel of man with himselfturns on the loftiest broadest most generous motives touching the very bases of character and reaching far beyond the issue of 93 the political question is seen to be no more than a superficial aspect of the deeper moral question lantenac the representative of the old order had performed an exploit of signal devotion was it not well that one who had faith in the new order should show himself equally willing to cast away his life to save one whom selfsacrifice had transformed from the infernal satan into the heavenly lucifer      gauvain saw in the shade the sinister smile of the sphinx the     situation was a sort of dread crossway where the conflicting     truths issued and confronted one another and where the three     supreme ideas of man stood face to facehumanity the family the     fatherland each of the voices spoke in turn and each in turn     declared the truth how choose each in turn seemed to hit the     mark of reason and justice and said do that was that the thing     to be done yes no reasoning counselled one thing sentiment     another the two counsels were contradictory reasoning is only     reason sentiment is often conscience the one comes from man     the other from a loftier source that is why sentiment has less     distinctness and more might yet what strength in the severity     of reason gauvain hesitated his perplexity was so fierce two     abysses opened before him to destroy the marquis or to save him     which of these two gulfs was duty  the whole scene ii 206219 is a masterpiece of dramatic strength sustention and flexibilityonly equalled by the dramatic vivacity of the scene in which cimourdain sitting as judge orders the prisoner to be brought forward to his horror sees gauvain instead of lantenac and then proceeds to condemn the man whom he loves best on earth to be taken to the guillotine                                       the tragedy of the story its sombre tone the overhanging presence of death in it are prevented from being oppressive to us by the variety of minor situation and subordinate character with which the writer has surrounded the central figures no writer living is so consummate a master of landscape and besides the forest we here have an elaborate seapiece full of the weird ineffable menacing suggestion of the sea in some of her unnumbered moods and there is a scene of late twilight on a high solitary down over the bay of mont saintmichel to which a reader blessed with sensibility to the subtler impressions of landscape will turn again and again as one visits again and again some actual prospect where the eye procures for the inner sense a dream of beauty and the incommensurable perhaps the palm for exquisite workmanship will be popularly given and justly given to the episode humorously headed the massacre of saint bartholomew at the opening of the third volume it is the story of three little children barely out of infancy awaking playing eating wondering slumbering in solitude through a summer day in an old tower as a rule the attempt to make infancy interesting in literature ends in maudlin failure but at length the painters have found an equal or more than an equal in an artist whose medium lends itself less easily than colour and form to the reproduction of the beauty and life of childhood in his poetry victor hugo had already shown his passing sensibility to the pathos of the beginnings of our life witness such pieces as chose vue un jour de printemps les pauvres gens the wellknown pieces in lannée terrible and a hundred other lively touches and fragments of finished loveliness and penetrating sympathy in prose it is a more difficult feat to collect the trivial details which make up the life of the tiny human animal into a whole that shall be impressive finished and beautiful and prose can only describe by details enumerated one by one this most arduous feat is accomplished in the childrens summer day in the tower and with enchanting success intensely realistic yet the picture overflows with emotionnot the emotion of the mother but of the poet there is infinite tenderness pathos love but all heightened at once and strengthened by the selfcontrol of masculine force a man writing about little ones seems able to place himself outside and thus to gain more calmness and freedom of vision than the more passionate interest or yearning of women permits to them in this field of art not a detail is spared yet the whole is full of delight and pity and humour only one lyric passage is allowed to poetise and accentuate the realism of the description georgette some twenty months old scrambles from her cradle and prattles to the sunbeam      what a bird says in its song a child says in its prattle tis     the same hymn a hymn indistinct lisping profound the child has     what the bird has not the sombre human destiny in front of it     hence the sadness of men as they listen mingling with the joy of     the little one as it sings the sublimest canticle to be heard on     earth is the stammering of the human soul on the lips of infancy     that confused chirruping of a thought that is as yet no more than     an instinct has in it one knows not what sort of artless appeal     to the eternal justice or is it a protest uttered on the     threshold before entering in a protest meek and poignant this     ignorance smiling at the infinite compromises all creation in the     lot that shall fall to the weak defenceless being ill if it     shall come will be an abuse of confidence      the childs murmuring is more and is less than words there are     no notes and yet it is a song there are no syllables and yet it     is a language this poor stammering is a compound of what the     child said when it was an angel and of what it will say when     it becomes a man the cradle has a yesterday as the grave has a     morrow the morrow and the yesterday mingle in that strange cooing     their twofold mystery      her lips smiled her eyes smiled the dimples in her cheeks     smiled there came forth in this smile a mysterious welcome of the     morning the soul has faith in the ray the heavens were blue     warm was the air the fragile creature without knowing anything     or recognising anything or understanding anything softly     floating in musings which are not thought felt itself in safety     in the midst of nature among those good trees and that guileless     greenery in the pure and peaceful landscape amid the rustle of     nests of flowing springs of insects of leaves while over all     there glowed the great innocency of the sun ii 104  as an eminent man has recently written about wordsworths most famous ode there may be some bad philosophy here but there is assuredly some noble and touching poetry  if the carelessness of infancy is caught with this perfection of finish there is a tragic companion piece in the horror and gnawing anguish of the wretched woman from whom her young have been takenher rescue from death her fierce yearnings for them like the yearnings of a beast her brutelike heedlessness of her life and her body in the cruel search  and so the poet conducts us along the strange excursive windings of the life and passion of humanity the same hand which draws such noble figures as gauvainand the real lanjuinais of history was fully as heroic and as noble as the imaginary gauvain of fictionis equally skilful in drawing the wild breton beggar who dwells underground among the branching treeroots and the monstrous imânus the barbarous retainer of the lord of the seven forests and radoub the serjeant from paris a man of hearty oaths hideous heroic humoursome of a bloody ingenuity in combat and the same hand which described the silent sundown on the sandy shore of the bay and the mysterious darkness of the forests and the blameless play of the little ones gives us the prodigious animation of the night surprise at dôl the furious conflict at la tourgue and perhaps most powerful of all the breaking loose of the gun on the deck of the claymore you may say that this is only melodrama but if we turn to the actual events of 93 the melodrama of the romancer will seem tame compared with the melodrama of the faithful chronicler and so long as the narrative of melodramatic action is filled with poetry and beauty there is no reproach in uncommon situation in intense passion in magnanimous or subtle motives that are not of every day of hugos art we may say what dr newman has said of something else such work is always open to criticism and it is always above it  there is poetry and beauty no doubt in the common lives about us if we look at them with imaginative and sympathetic eye and we owe much to the art that reveals to us the tragedy of the parlour and the frockcoat and analyses the bitterness and sorrow and high passion that may underlie a life of outer smoothness and decorum still criticism cannot accept this as the final and exclusive limitation of imaginative work art is nothing if not catholic and manysided and it is certainly not exhausted by mere domestic possibilities goethes fine and luminous feeling for practical life which has given such depth of richness and wisdom to his best prose writing fills us with a delightful sense of satisfaction and adequateness and yet why should it not leave us with a mind eagerly open for the larger and more inventive romance in which nature is clothed with some of that awe and might and silent contemplation of the puny destinies of man that used to surround the conception of the supernatural victor hugo seeks strong and extraordinary effects he is a master of terrible image profound emotion audacious fancy but then these are as real as natural as true to fact as the fairest reproduction of the moral poverties and meannesses of the world and let it be added that while he is without a rival in the dark mysterious heights of imaginative effect he is equally a master in strokes of tenderness and the most delicate human sympathy his last book seems to contain pieces that surpass every other book of hugos in the latter range of qualities and not to fall at all short in the former and so in the words of the man of genius who last wrote on victor hugo in these pages1 as we pity ourselves for the loss of poems and pictures which have perished and left of sappho but a fragment and of zeuxis but a name so are we inclined to pity the dead who died too soon to enjoy the great works we have enjoyed at each new glory that swims into our ken we surely feel that it is something to have lived to see that too rise  footnote 1 mr swinburne     on the ring and the book   when the first volume of mr brownings new poem came before the critical tribunals public and private recognised or irresponsible there was much lamentation even in quarters where a manlier humour might have been expected over the poets choice of a subject with facile largeness of censure it was pronounced a murky subject sordid unlovely morally sterile an ugly leaf out of some ancient italian newgate calendar one hinted in vain that wisdom is justified of her children that the poet must be trusted to judge of the capacity of his own theme and that it is his conception and treatment of it that ultimately justify or discredit his choice now that the entire work is before the world this is plain and it is admitted when the second volume containing giuseppe caponsacchi appeared men no longer found it sordid or ugly the third with pompilia convinced them that the subject was not after all so incurably unlovely and the fourth with the pope and the passage from the friars sermon may well persuade those who needed persuasion that moral fruitfulness depends on the master his eye and hand his vision and grasp more than on this and that in the transaction which has taken possession of his imagination  the truth is we have for long been so debilitated by pastorals by graceful presentation of the arthurian legend for drawingrooms by idylls not robust and theocritean by verse directly didactic that a rude blast of air from the outside welter of human realities is apt to give a shock that might well show in what simpletons paradise we have been living the ethics of the rectory parlour set to sweet music the respectable aspirations of the sentimental curate married to exquisite verse the everlasting glorification of domestic sentiment in blameless princes and others as if that were the poets single province and the divinelyappointed end of all art as if domestic sentiment included and summed up the whole throng of passions emotions strife and desire all this might seem to be making valetudinarians of us all our public is beginning to measure the right and possible in art by the superficial probabilities of life and manners within a tenmile radius of charing cross is it likely asks the critic that duke silva would have done this that fedalma would have done that who shall suppose it possible that caponsacchi acted thus that count guido was possessed by devils so the poser is triumphant because the critic is tacitly appealing to the normal standard of probabilities in our own day in the tragedy of pompilia we are taken far from the serene and homely region in which some of our teachers would fain have it that the whole moral universe can be snugly pent up we see the black passions of man at their blackest hate so fierce undiluted implacable passionate as to be hard of conception by our simpler northern natures cruelty so vindictive subtle persistent deadly as to fill us with a pain almost too great for true art to produce greediness lust craft penetrating a whole stock and breed even down to the ancient mother of that fell house of hate    the gaunt grey nightmare in the furthest smoke   the hag that gave these three abortions birth   unmotherly mother and unwomanly   woman that near turns motherhood to shame   womanliness to loathing no one word   no gesture to curb cruelty a whit   more than the shepard thwarts her playsome whelps   trying their milkteeth on the soft o the throat   o the first fawn flung with those beseeching eyes   flat in the covert how should she but couch   lick the dry lips unsheathe the blunted claw   catch twixt her placid eyewinks at what chance   old bloody halfforgotten dream may flit   born when herself was novice to the taste   the while she lets youth take its pleasure iv 40  but then if the poet has lighted up for us these grim and appalling depths he has not failed to raise us too into the presence of proportionate loftiness and purity                 tantum vertice in auras   aetherias quantum radice in tartara tendit  like the gloomy and umbrageous grove of which the sibyl spake to the pious aeneas the poem conceals a golden branch and golden leaves in the second volume guido servile and false is followed by caponsacchi as noble alike in conception and execution as anything that mr browning has ever achieved in the third volume the austere pathos of pompilias tale relieves the too oppressive jollity of don giacinto and the flowery rhetoric of bottini while in the fourth the deep wisdom justice and righteous mind of the pope reconcile us to endure the sulphurous whiff from the pit in the confession of guido now desperate naked and satanic from what at first was sheer murk there comes out a long procession of human figures infinitely various in form and thought in character and act a group of men and women eager passionate indifferent tender and ravenous mean and noble humorous and profound jovial with prosperity or halfdumb with misery skirting the central tragedy or plunged deep into the thick of it passersby who put themselves off with a glance at the surface of a thing and another or two who dive to the heart of it and they all come out with a certain shakespearian fulness vividness directness above all they are every one of them men and women with free play of human life in limb and feature as in an antique sculpture so much of modern art in poetry as in painting runs to mere drapery i grant said lessing that there is also a beauty in drapery but can it be compared with that of the human form and shall he who can attain to the greater rest content with the less i much fear that the most perfect master in drapery shows by that very talent wherein his weakness lies this was spoken of plastic art but it has a yet deeper meaning in poetic criticism there too the master is he who presents the natural shape the curves the thews of men and does not labour and seek praise for faithful reproduction of the mere moral drapery of the hour this or another who gives you hercules at strife with antaeus laocoon writhing in the coils of the divine serpents the wrestle with circumstance or passion with outward destiny or inner character in the free outlines of nature and reality the capacity which it possesses for this presentation at once so varied and so direct is one reason why the dramatic form ranks as the highest expression and measure of the creative power of the poet and the extraordinary grasp with which mr browning has availed himself of this double capacity is one reason why we should reckon the ring and the book as one of his masterpieces  we may say this and still not be blind to the faults of the poem many persons agree that they find it too long and if they find it so then for them it is too long others who cannot resist the critics temptation of believing that a remark must be true if it only look acute and specific vow that the disclosure in the first volume of the whole plan and plot vitiates subsequent artistic merit if one cannot enjoy what comes for knowing beforehand what is coming this objection may be allowed to have a root in human nature but then two things might perhaps be urged on the other sidefirst that the interest of the poem lies in the development and presentation of character on the one hand and in the many sides which a single transaction offered to as many minds on the other and therefore that this true interest could not be marred by the bare statement what the transaction was or baldly looked at seemed to be and second that the poem was meant to find its reader in a mood of mental repose ready to receive the poets impressions undisturbed by any agitating curiosity as to plot or final outcome a more valid accusation touches the many verbal perversities in which a poet has less right than another to indulge the compound latin and english of don giacinto notwithstanding the fan of the piece still grows a burden to the flesh then there are harsh and formless lines bursts of metrical chaos from which a writers dignity and selfrespect ought surely to be enough to preserve him again there are passages marked by a coarse violence of expression that is nothing short of barbarous for instance ii 190 or 245 the only thing to be said is that the countrymen of shakespeare have had to learn to forgive uncouth outrages on form and beauty to fine creative genius if only one could be sure that readers unschooled as too many are to love the simple and elevated beauty of such form as sophocles or as corneille gives would not think the worst fault the chief virtue and confound the poets bluntnesses with his admirable originality it is certain that in shakespeares case his defects are constantly fastened upon by critics who have never seriously studied the forms of dramatic art except in the literature of england and extolled as instances of his characteristic mightiness it may well be therefore that the grotesque caprices which mr browning unfortunately permits to himself may find misguided admirers or what is worse even imitators it would be most unjust however while making due mention of these things to pass over the dignity and splendour of the verse in many places where the intensity of the writers mood finds worthy embodiment in a sustained gravity and vigour and finish of diction not to be surpassed the concluding lines of the caponsacchi comprising the last page of the second volume the appeal of the greek poet in the pope one or two passages in the first guido eg vol ii p 156 from line 1957 and the close of the pompilia ought to be referred to when one wishes to know what power over the instrument of his art mr browning might have achieved if he had chosen to discipline himself in instrumentation  when all is said that can be said about the violences which from time to time invade the poem it remains true that the complete work affects the reader most powerfully with that wide unity of impression which it is the highest aim of dramatic art and perhaps of all art to produce after we have listened to all the whimsical dogmatising about beauty to all the odious cant about morbid anatomy to all the welldeserved reproach for unpardonable perversities of phrase and outrages on rhythm there is left to us the consciousness that a striking human transaction has been seized by a vigorous and profound imagination that its many diverse threads have been wrought into a single rich and manycoloured web of art in which we may see traced for us the labyrinths of passion and indifference stupidity and craft prejudice and chance along which truth and justice have to find a devious and doubtful way the transaction itself lurid and fuliginous is secondary to the manner of its handling and presentment we do not derive our sense of unity from the singleness and completeness of the horrid tragedy so much as from the power with which its own circumstances as they happened the rumours which clustered about it from the minds of men without the many moods fancies dispositions which it for the moment brought out into light playing round the fact the halfsportive flights with which lawyers judges quidnuncs of the street darted at conviction and snatched haphazard at truth are all wrought together into one selfsufficient and compacted shape  but this shape is not beautiful and the end of art is beauty verbal fanaticism is always perplexing and rubbing my eyes i ask whether that beauty means anything more than such an arrangement and disposition of the parts of the work as first kindling a great variety of dispersed emotions and thoughts in the mind of the spectator finally concentrates them in a single mood of joyous sad meditative or interested delight the sculptor the painter and the musician have each their special means of producing this final and superlative impression each is bound by the strictly limited capability in one direction and another of the medium in which he works in poetry it is because they do not perceive how much more manifold and varied are the means of reaching the end than in the other expressions of art that people insist each upon some particular quiddity which entering into composition alone constitutes it genuinely poetic beautiful or artistic pressing for definition you never get much further than that each given quiddity means a certain whatness this is why poetical criticism is usually so little catholic a man remembers that a poem in one style has filled him with consciousness of beauty and delight why conclude that this style constitutes the one access to the same impression why not rather perceive that to take contemporaries the beauty of thyrsis is mainly produced by a fine suffusion of delicatelytoned emotion that of atalanta by splendid and barely rivalled music of verse of in memoriam by its ordered and harmonious presentation of a sacred mood of the spanish gypsy in the parts where it reaches beauty by a sublime ethical passion of the earthly paradise by sweet and simple reproduction of the spirit of the youngerhearted times there are poems by mr browning in which it is difficult or let us frankly say impossible for most of us at all events and as yet to discover the beauty or the shape but if beauty may not be denied to a work which abounding in manycoloured scenes and diverse characters in vivid image and portraiture wide reflection and multiform emotion does further by a broad thread of thought running under all bind these impressions into one supreme and elevated conviction then assuredly whatever we may think of this passage or that that episode or the other the first volume or the third we cannot deny that the ring and the book in its perfection and integrity fully satisfies the conditions of artistic triumph are we to ignore the grandeur of a colossal statue and the nobility of the human conceptions which it embodies because here and there we notice a flaw in the marble a blemish in its colour a jagged slip of the chisel it is not force of intellect as george eliot has said which causes ready repulsion from the aberration and eccentricities of greatness any more than it is force of vision that causes the eye to explore the warts in a face bright with human expression it is simply the negation of high sensibilities  then it is asked by persons of another and still more rigorous temper whether as the world goes the subject or its treatment either justifies us in reading some twentyone thousand and seventyfive lines which do not seem to have any direct tendency to make us better or to improve mankind this objection is an old enemy with a new face and need not detain us though perhaps the crude and incessant application of a narrow moral standard thoroughly misunderstood is one of the intellectual dangers of our time you may now and again hear a man of really masculine character confess that though he loves shakespeare and takes habitual delight in his works he cannot see that he was a particularly moral writer that is to say shakespeare is never directly didactic you can no more get a system of morals out of his writings than you can get such a system out of the writings of the eversearching plato but if we must be quantitative one great creative poet probably exerts a nobler deeper more permanent ethical influence than a dozen generations of professed moral teachers it is a commonplace to the wise and an everlasting puzzle to the foolish that direct inculcation of morals should invariably prove so powerless an instrument so futile a method the truth is that nothing can be more powerfully efficacious from the moral point of view than the exercise of an exalted creative art stirring within the intelligence of the spectator active thought and curiosity about many types of character and many changeful issues of conduct and fortune at once enlarging and elevating the range of his reflections on mankind ever kindling his sympathies into the warm and continuous glow which purifies and strengthens nature and fills men with that love of humanity which is the best inspirer of virtue is not this why music too is to be counted supreme among moral agents soothing disorderly passion by diving down into the hidden deeps of character where there is no disorder and touching the diviner mind given a certain rectitude as well as vigour of intelligence then whatever stimulates the fancy expands the imagination enlivens meditation upon the great human drama is essentially moral shakespeare does all this as if sent irislike from the immortal gods and the ring and the book has a measure of the same incomparable quality  a profound and moving irony subsists in the very structure of the poem any other human transaction that ever was tragic or comic or plain prosaic may be looked at in a like spirit as the worlds talk bubbled around the dumb anguish of pompilia or the cruelty and hate of guido so it does around the hourly tragedies of all times and places    the instinctive theorizing whence a fact   looks to the eye as the eye likes the look   vibrations in the general mind   at depth of deed already out of reach                  live fact deadened down   talked over bruited abroad whispered away  if we reflect that these are the conditions which have marked the formation of all the judgments that we hold by and which are vivid in operation and effect at this hour the deep irony and the impressive meaning of the poem are both obvious                   so learn one lesson hence   of many which whatever lives should teach   this lesson that our human speech is naught   our human testimony false our fame   and human estimation words and wind iv 234  it is characteristic of mr browning that he thus casts the moral of his piece in an essentially intellectual rather than an emotional form appealing to hard judgment rather than to imaginative sensibility another living poet of original genius of whom we have much right to complain that he gives us so little ends a poem in two or three lines which are worth quoting here for the illustration they afford of what has just been said about mr browning    ah what dusty answer gets the soul   when hot for certainties in this our life   in tragic hints here see what evermore   moves dark as yonder midnight oceans force   thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse   to throw that faint thin line upon the shore1  footnote 1 mr george merediths modern love  this is imaginative and sympathetic in thought as well as expression and the truth and the image enter the writers mind together the one by the other the lines convey poetic sentiment rather than reasoned truth while mr brownings close would be no unfit epilogue to a scientific essay on history or a treatise on the errors of the human understanding and the inaccuracy of human opinion and judgment this is the common note of his highest work hard thought and reason illustrating themselves in dramatic circumstance and the thought and reason are not wholly fused they exist apart and irradiate with farshooting beams the moral confusion of the tragedy this is at any rate emphatically true of the ring and the book the fulness and variety of creation the amplitude of the play and shifting of characters and motive and mood are absolutely unforced absolutely uninterfered with by the artificial exigencies of ethical or philosophic purpose there is the purpose fullgrown clear in outline unmistakeable in significance but the just proprieties of place and season are rigorously observed because mr browning like every other poet of his quality has exuberant and adequate delight in mere creation simple presentment and returns to bethink him of the meaning of it all only byandby the pictures of guido of pompilia of caponsacchi of dominus hyacinthus de archangelis of pope innocent are each of them full and adequate as conceptions of character in active manifestation apart from the truth which the whole composition is meant to illustrate and which clothes itself in this most excellent drama  the scientific attitude of the intelligence is almost as markedly visible in mr browning as the strength of his creative power the lesson of the ring and the book is perhaps as nearly positive as anything poetic can be it is true that ultimately the drama ends in a vindication of what are called the ways of god to man if indeed people are willing to put themselves off with a form of omnipotent justice which is simply a partial retribution inflicted on the monster while torture and butchery fall upon victims more or less absolutely blameless as if the fact of punishment at length overtaking the guilty franceschini were any vindication of the justice of that assumed providence which had for so long a time awarded punishment far more harsh to the innocent pompilia so far as you can be content with the vindication of a justice of this less than equivocal quality the sight of the monster brought to the                               close fetid cell   where the hot vapour of an agony   struck into drops on the cold wall runs down   horrible worms made out of sweat and tears  may in a sense prove satisfactory enough but a man must be very dull who in reading the poem does not perceive that the very spirit of it points to the thousand hazards which even this fragment of justice had to run in saving itself and bringing about such partially righteous consummation as destiny permits true opinion fares yet more perilously halfrome the other halfrome the tertium quid which is perhaps most masterly and finished of the three show us how ill truth sifts itself to how many it never comes at all how blurred confused next door to false it is figured even to those who seize it by the hem of the garment we may perhaps yawn over the intermingled latin and law of arcangeli in spite of the humour of parts of it as well as over the vapid floweriness of his rival but for all that we are touched keenly by the irony of the methods by which the two professional truthsifters darken counsel with words and make skilful sport of life and fact the whole poem is a parable of the feeble and halfhopeless struggle which truth has to make against the ways of the world that in this particular case truth and justice did win some pale sort of victory does not weaken the force of the lesson the victory was such and so won as to stir in us awful thoughts of fatal risks and certain defeats of falsehood a thousand times clasped for truth of fact a thousand times banished for fancy    because pompilias purity prevails   conclude you all truth triumphs in the end   so might those old inhabitants of the ark   witnessing haply their doves

the pope confronts the long perplexity and entanglement of circumstances with the fatuous optimism which insists that somehow justice and virtue do rule in the world consider all the doings at arezzo

whom she went imploring him to write to rome    he meets the first cold sprinkle of the world   and shudders to the marrow save this child   oh my superiors oh the archbishop here   who was it dared lay hand upon the ark   his betters saw fall nor put finger forth  worst of all the convent of the convertites women to whom she was consigned for help    they do help they are prompt to testify   to her pure life and saintly dying days   she dies and lo who seemed so poor proves rich   what does the body that lives through helpfulness   to women for christs sake the kiss turns bite   the doves note changes to the crows cry judge     seeing that this our convent claims of right   what goods belong to those we succour be   the same proved women of dishonest life   and seeing that this trial made appear   pompilia was in such predicament   the convent hereupon pretends to said   succession of pompilia issues writ   and takes possession by the fiscs advice   such is their attestation to the cause   of christ who had one saint at least they hoped   but is a titledeed to filch a corpse   to slander and an infantheir to cheat   christ must give up his gains then they unsay   all the fine speecheswho was saint is whore  it is not wonderful if his review of all the mean and dolorous circumstance of this cycle of wrong brings the pope face to face with the unconquerable problem for the christian believer the keystone of the grim arch of religious doubt and despair through which the courageous soul must needs pass to creeds of reason and life where is the gloriously decisive change the immeasurable metamorphosis in human worth that should in some sort justify the consummate price that had been paid for man these seventeen hundred years before    had a mere adept of the rosy cross   spent his life to consummate the great work   would not we start to see the stuff it touched   yield not a grain more than the vulgar got   by the old smeltingprocess years ago   if this were sad to see in just the sage   who should profess so much perform no more   what is it when suspected in that power   who undertook to make and made the world   devised and did effect man body and soul   ordained salvation for them both and yet    well is the thing we see salvation  it is certain that by whatever other deficiencies it may be marked the ring and the book is blameless for the most characteristic of all the shortcomings of contemporary verse a grievous sterility of thought and why because sterility of thought is the blight struck into the minds of men by timorous and haltfooted scepticism by a halfhearted dread of what chill thing the truth might prove itself by unmanly reluctance or moral incapacity to carry the faculty of poetic vision over the whole field and because mr brownings intelligence on the other hand is masculine and courageous moving cheerfully on the solid earth of an articulate and defined conviction and careful not to omit realities from the conception of the great drama merely for being unsightly to the too fastidious eye or jarring in the ear or too bitterly perplexing to faith or understanding it is this resolute feeling after and grip of fact which is at the root of his distinguishing fruitfulness of thought and it is exuberance of thought spontaneous wellmarked and sapid that keeps him out of poetical preaching on the one hand and mere making of music on the other regret as we may the fantastic rudeness and unscrupulous barbarisms into which mr brownings art too often falls and find what fault we may with his method let us ever remember how much he has to say and how effectively he communicates the shock of new thought which was first imparted to him by the vivid conception of a large and farreaching story the value of the thought indeed is not to be measured by poetic tests but still the thought has poetic value too for it is this which has stirred in the writer that keen yet impersonal interest in the actors of his story and in its situations which is one of the most certain notes of true dramatic feeling and which therefore gives the most unfailing stimulus to the interest of the appreciative reader  at first sight the ring and the book appears to be absolutely wanting in that grandeur which in a composition of such enormous length criticism must pronounce to be a fundamental and indispensable element in an ordinary way this effect of grandeur is produced either by some heroic action surrounded by circumstances of worthy stateliness as in the finest of the greek plays or as in paradise lost by the presence of personages of majestic sublimity of bearing and association or as in faust or hamlet by the stupendous moral abysses which the poet discloses fitfully on this side and that none of these things are to be found in the ring and the book the action of caponsacchi though noble and disinterested is hardly heroic in the highest dramatic sense for it is not much more than the lofty defiance of a conventionality the contemplated penalty being only small not for example as if life or ascertained happiness had been the fixed or even probable price of his magnanimous enterprise there was no marching to the stake no deliberate encountering of the mightier risks no voluntary submission to a lifelong endurance true this came in the end but it was an end unforeseen and one therefore not to be associated with the first conception of the original act besides guido is so saturated with hateful and ignoble motive as to fill the surrounding air with influences that preclude heroic association it has been said of the great men to whom the byzantine empire once or twice gave birth that even their fame has a curiously tarnished air as if that too had been touched by the evil breath of the times and in like manner we may say of guido franceschini that even to have touched him in the way of resistance detracts from pure heroism perhaps the same consideration explains the comparative disappointment which most people seem to have felt with pompilia in the third volume again there is nothing which can be rightly called majesty of character visible in one personage or another there is high devotion in caponsacchi a largeminded and free sagacity in pope innocent and around pompilia the tragic pathos of an incurable woe which by its intensity might raise her to grandeur if it sprang from some more solemn source than the mere malignity and baseness of an unworthy oppressor lastly there is nothing in the ring and the book of that certain incommensurableness which goethe found in his own faust the poem is kept closely concrete and strictly commensurable by the very framework of its story        pure crude fact   secreted from mans life when hearts beat hard   and brains highblooded ticked two centuries since  it moves from none of the supernatural agencies which give the impulse to our interest in faust nor from the sublimer passions and yearning after things unspeakable alike in faust and in hamlet  yet notwithstanding its lack of the accustomed elements of grandeur there is a profound impressiveness about the ring and the book which must arise from the presence of some other fine compensating or equivalent quality perhaps one may say that this equivalent for grandeur is a certain simple touching of our sense of human kinship of the large identity of the conditions of the human lot of the piteous fatalities which bring the lives of the great multitude of men to be little more than grains of sand to be blown by the wind this old woe the poet says now in the fulness of the days again lives    if precious be the soul of man to man  this is the deeply implanted sentiment to which his poem makes successful appeal nor is it mocked by mere outpouring of scorn on the blind and fortuitous groping of men and societies of men after truth and justice and traces of the watchfulness of the unlidded eye of god rather it is this inability to see beyond the facts of our condition to some diviner everpresent law which helps to knit us to our kind our brethren whom we have seen        clouds obscure   but for which obscuration all were bright   too hastily concluded sunsuffused   a cloud may soothe the eye made blind by blaze   better the very clarity of heaven   the soft streaks are the beautiful and dear   what but the

for man     memorials of a man of letters   what are the qualities of a good contributor what makes a good review is the best literature produced by the writer who does nothing else but write or by the man who tempers literature by affairs what are the different recommendations of the rival systems of anonymity and signature what kind of change if any has passed over periodical literature since those two great periodicals the edinburgh and the quarterly held sway these and a number of other questions in the same mattersome of them obviously not to be opened with propriety in these pagesmust naturally be often present to the mind of any one who is concerned in the control of a review and a volume has just been printed which sets such musings once more astir mr macvey napier was the editor of the edinburgh review from 1829when jeffrey after a reign of sevenandtwenty years resigned it into his handsuntil his death in 1847 a portion of the correspondence addressed to mr napier during this period is full of personal interest both to the man of letters and to that more singular being the editor the impresario of men of letters the entrepreneur of the spiritual power  to manage an operahouse is usually supposed to tax human powers more urgently than any position save that of a general in the very heat and stress of battle the orchestra the chorus the subscribers the first tenor a pair of rival prima donnas the newspapers the boxagents in bond street the army of hangerson in the fliesall combine to demand such gifts of tact resolution patience foresight tenacity flexibility as are only expected from the great ruler or the great soldier the editor of a periodical of public considerationand the edinburgh review in the hands of mr napier was the avowed organ of the ruling whig powersis sorely tested in the same way the rival house may bribe his stars his popular epigrammatist is sometimes as full of humours as a spoiled soprano the favourite pyrotechnist is systematically late and procrastinatory or is piqued because his punctuation or his paragraphs have been meddled with the contributor whose article would be in excellent time if it did not appear before the close of the century or never appeared at all pesters you with warnings that a months delay is a deadly blow to progress and stays the great procession of the ages the contributor who could profitably fill a sheet insists on sending a treatise sir george cornewall lewis who had charge of the edinburgh for a short space truly described prolixity as the bête noire of an editor every contributor he said has some special reason for wishing to write at length on his own subject  ah que de choses dans un menuet cried marcel the great dancingmaster and ah what things in the type and greek idea of an article cries an editor with the enthusiasm of his calling such proportion measure comprehension variety of topics pithiness of treatment all within a space appointed with procrustean rigour this is what the soul of the volunteer contributor is dull to of the minor vexations who can tell there is one single tribulation dire enough to poison lifeeven if there were no otherand this is disorderly manuscript empson mr napiers wellknown contributor was one of the worst offenders he would never even take the trouble to mark his paragraphs it is my misfortune to have a manuscript before me at this moment that would fill thirty of these pages and yet from beginning to end there is no indication that it is not to be read at a single breath the paragraph ought to be and in all good writers it is as real and as sensible a division as the sentence it is an organic member in prose composition with a beginning a middle and an end just as a stanza is an organic and definite member in the composition of an ode i fear my manuscript is rather disorderly says another but i will correct carefully in print just so because he is too heedless to do his work in a workmanlike way he first inflicts fatigue and vexation on the editor whom he expects to read his paper second he inflicts considerable and quite needless expense on the publisher and thirdly he inflicts a great deal of tedious and thankless labour on the printers who are for the most part far more meritorious persons than fifthrate authors it is true that burke returned such disordered proofs that the printer usually found it least troublesome to set the whole afresh and miss martineau tells a story of a scotch compositor who fled from edinburgh to avoid carlyles manuscript and to his horror was presently confronted with a piece of the too familiar copy which made him cry lord have mercy have you got that man to print for but most editors will cheerfully forgive such transgressions to all contributors who will guarantee that they write as well as burke or carlyle alas it is usually the case that those who have least excuse are the worst offenders the slovenliest manuscripts come from persons to whom the difference between an hour and a minute is of the very smallest importance this however is a digression only to be excused partly by the natural desire to say a word against ones persecutors and partly by a hope that some persons of sensitive conscience may be led to ponder whether there may not be after all some moral obligations even towards editors and printers  mr napier had one famous contributor who stands out alone in the history of editors lord broughams traditional connection with the reviewhe had begun to write either in its first or third number and had written in it ever sincehis encyclopaedic ignorance his power his great fame in the country and the prestige which his connection reflected on the review all made him a personage with whom it would have been most imprudent to quarrel yet the position in which mr napier was placed after broughams breach with the whigs was one of the most difficult in which the conductor of a great organ could possibly be placed the review was the representative the champion and the mouthpiece of the whig party and of the whigs who were in office before william iv dismissed the whigs in 1834 as arbitrarily as his father had dismissed the whigs in 1784 brougham had covered himself with disrepute among his party by a thousand pranks and after the dismissal he disgusted them by asking the new chancellor to make him chief baron of the exchequer when lord melbourne returned to power in the following year this and other escapades were remembered against him if left out said lord melbourne he would indeed be dangerous but if taken in he would simply be destructive so brougham was left out pepys was made chancellor and the premier compared himself to a man who has broken with a termagant mistress and married the best of cooks mr napier was not so happy the termagant was left on his hands he had to keep terms with a contributor who hated with deadly hatred the very government that the review existed to support no editor ever had such a contributor as brougham in the long history of editorial torment since the world began he scolds he storms he hectors he lectures he is for ever threatening desertion and prophesying ruin he exhausts the vocabulary of opprobrium against his correspondents best friends they are silly slaves base traitors a vile clique whose treatment of me has been the very ne plus ultra of ingratitude baseness and treachery he got the review and its editor into a scrape which shook the world at the time 1834 by betraying cabinet secrets to spite lord durham his cries against his adversaries are as violent as the threats of ajax in his tent and as loud as the bellowings of philoctetes at the mouth of his cave here is one instance out of a hundred      that is a trifle and i only mention it to beg of you to pluck up     a little courage and not be alarmed every time any of the little     knot of threateners annoy you they want to break off all kind of     connection between me and the edinburgh review i have long seen     it their fury against the article in the last number knows no     bounds and they will never cease till they worry you out of your     connection with me and get the whole control of the review into     their own hands by forcing you to resign it yourself a party     and a personal engine is all they want to make it what possible     right can any of these silly slaves have to object to my opinion     beingwhat it truly isagainst the holland house theory of lord     chathams madness i know that lord grenville treated it with     contempt i know others now living who did so too and i know that     so stout a whig as sir p francis was clearly of that opinion and     he knew lord chatham personally i had every ground to believe     that horace walpole a vile malignant and unnatural wretch     though a very clever writer of letters was ninetenths of the     holland house authority for the tale i knew that a baser man in     character or a meaner in capacity than the first lord holland     existed not even in those days of job and mediocrity why then     was i bound to take a false view because lord hollands family     have inherited his hatred of a great rival  another instance is as follows      i solicit your best attention to the fate which seems hastening     upon the edinburgh review the having always been free from the     least control of booksellers is one of its principal distinctions     and long was peculiarly soperhaps it still has it nearly to     itself but if it shall become a treasury journal i hardly see     any great advantage in one kind of independence without the     rest nay i doubt if its literary freedom any more than its     political will long survive books will be treated according as     the treasury or their understrappers regard the authors     but is it after all possible that the review should be suffered     to sink into such a state of subserviency that it dares not insert     any discussion upon a general question of politics because it     might give umbrage to the government of the day i pass over the     undeniable fact that it is underlings only whom you are scared     by and that the ministers themselves have no such inordinate     pretension as to dream of interfering i say nothing of those     underlings generally except this that i well know the race and     a more despicable above all in point of judgment exists not     never mind their threats they can do no harm even if any of     them are contributors be assured they never will withdraw because     you choose to keep your course free and independent  mr napier who seems to have been one of the most considerate and highminded of men was moved to energetic remonstrance on this occasion lord brougham explained his strong language away but he was incapable of really controlling himself and the strain was never lessened until 1843 when the correspondence ceases and we learn that there had been a quarrel between him and his too longsuffering correspondent yet john allenthat able scholar and conspicuous figure in the annals of holland housewrote of brougham to mr napierhe is not a malignant or badhearted man but he is an unscrupulous one and where his passions are concerned or his vanity irritated there is no excess of which he is not capable of broughams strong and manly sense when passion or vanity did not cloud it and even of a sort of careful justice these letters give more than one instance the quarterly review for instance had an article on romillys memoirs which to romillys friends seemed to do him less than justice brougham took a more sensible view      surely we had no right whatever to expect that they whom romilly     had all his life so stoutly opposed and who were treated by him     with great harshness should treat him as his friends would do     and at the very moment when a most injudicious act of his family     was bringing out all his secret thoughts against them only place     yourself in the same position and suppose that cannings private     journals had been publishedthe journals he may have kept while     the bitterest enemy of the whigs and in every page of which there     must have been some passage offensive to the feelings of the     living and of the friends of the dead would any mercy have been     shown to cannings character and memory by any of the whig party     either in society or in reviews would the line have been drawn of     only attacking cannings executors who published the papers and     leaving canning himself untouched clearly and certainly not     and yet i am putting a very much weaker case for we had joined     canning and all political enmity was at an end whereas the     tories and romilly never had for an hour laid aside their mutual     hostility  and if he was capable of equity brougham was also capable of hearty admiration even of an old friend who had on later occasions gone into a line which he intensely disliked it is a relief in the pages of blusterous anger and raging censure to come upon what he says of jeffrey      i can truly say that there never in all my life crossed my mind     one single unkind feeling respecting him or indeed any feeling     but that of the warmest affection and the most unmingled     admiration of his character believing and knowing him to be as     excellent and amiable as he is great in the ordinary and as i     think the far less important sense of the word  of the value of broughams contributions we cannot now judge they will not in spite of their energy and force bear rereading today and perhaps the same may be said of threefourths of jeffreys once famous essays broughams selfconfidence is heroic he believed that he could make a speech for bolingbroke but byandby he had sense enough to see that in order to attempt this he ought to read bolingbroke for a year and then practise for another year in 1838 he thought nothing of undertaking amid all the demands of active life such a bagatelle as a history of the french revolution i have some little knack of narrative he says the most difficult by far of all styles and never yet attained in perfection but by hume and livy and i bring as much oratory and science to the task as most of my predecessors but what sort of science and what has oratory to do with it and how could he deceive himself into thinking that he could retire to write a history nobody that ever lived would have more speedily found out the truth of voltaires saying le repos est une bonne chose mais lennui est son frère the truth is that one learns after a certain observation of the world to divide ones amazement pretty equally between the literary voluptuary or overfastidious collegian on the one hand who is so impressed by the size of his subject that he never does more than collect material and make notes and the presumptuous politician on the other hand who thinks that he can write a history or settle the issues of philosophy and theology in odd halfhours the one is so enfeebled in will and literary energy after his viginti annorum lucubrationes the other is so accustomed to be content with the hurry the unfinishedness the roughandready methods of practical affairs and they both in different ways measure the worth and seriousness of literature so wrongly in relation to the rest of human interests  the relations between lord brougham and mr napier naturally suggest a good many reflections on the vexed question of the comparative advantages of the old and the new theory of a periodical the new theory is that a periodical should not be an organ but an open pulpit and that each writer should sign his name without disrespect to ably conducted and eminent contemporaries of long standing it may be said that the tide of opinion and favour is setting in this direction yet on the whole experience perhaps leads to a doubt whether the gains of the system of signature are so very considerable as some of us once expected an editor on the new system is no doubt relieved of a certain measure of responsibility lord cockburns panegyric on the first great editor may show what was expected from a man in such a position as jeffreys he had to discover and to train authors to discern what truth and the public mind required to suggest subjects to reject and more offensive still to improve contributions to keep down absurdities to infuse spirit to excite the timid to repress violence to soothe jealousies to quell mutinies to watch times and all this in the morning of the reviewing day before experience had taught editors conciliatory firmness and contributors reasonable submission he directed and controlled the elements he presided over with a masters judgment there was not one of his associates who could have even held these elements together for a single year inferior to these excellences but still important was his dexterity in revising the writings of others without altering the general tone or character of the composition he had great skill in leaving out defective ideas or words and in so aiding the original by lively or graceful touches that reasonable authors were surprised and charmed on seeing how much better they looked than they thought they would cockburns life of jeffrey i 301  from such toils and dangers as these the editor of a review with signed articles is in the main happily free he has usually suggestions to make for his experience has probably given him points of view as to the effectiveness of this or that feature of an article for its own purpose which would not occur to a writer the writer is absorbed in his subject and has been less accustomed to think of the public but this exercise of a claim to a general acquiescence in the judgment and experience of a man who has the best reasons for trying to judge rightly is a very different thing from the duty of drilling contributors and dressing contributions as they were dressed and drilled by jeffrey as southey said when groaning under the mutilations inflicted by gifford on iris contributions to the quarterly there must be a power expurgatory in the hands of the editor and the misfortune is that editors frequently think it incumbent on them to use that power merely because they have it southeys life iv 18 this is probably true on the anonymous system where the editor is answerable for every word and for the literary form no less than for the substantial soundness or interest of an article in a man of weakish literary vanityjeffrey was evidently full of itthere may well be a constant itch to set his betters right in trifles as gifford thought that he could mend southeys adjectives to a vain editor or a too masterful editor the temptation under the anonymous system is no doubt strong m buloz it is true the renowned conductor of the revue des deux mondes is said to have insisted on and to have freely practised the fullest editorial prerogative over articles that were openly signed by the most eminent names in france but m buloz had no competitor and those who did not choose to submit to his sultanic despotism were shut out from the only pulpit whence they were sure of addressing the congregation that they wanted in england contributors are better off and no editor of a signed periodical would feel either bound or permitted to take such trouble about mere wording of sentences as gifford and jeffrey were in the habit of taking  there is however another side to this from an editors point of view with responsibilitynot merely for commas and niceties and literary kickshaws but in its old sensedisappears also a portion of the interest of editorial labour one would suppose it must be more interesting to command a manofwar than a trading vessel it would be more interesting to lead a regiment than to keep a tiltingyard but the times are not ripe for such enterprises of literary ability of a good and serviceable kind there is a hundred or five hundred times more in the country than there was when jeffrey smith brougham and horner devised their review in a ninth storey in edinburgh seventysix years ago it is the cohesion of a political creed that is gone and the strength and fervour of a political school the principles that inspired that group of strong men have been worked out after their reforms had been achieved the next great school was economic and though it produced one fine orator its work was at no time literary the manchester school with all their shortcomings had at least the signal distinction of attaching their views on special political questions to a general and presiding conception of the modern phase of civilisation as industrial and pacific the next party of advance when it is formed will certainly borrow from cobden and bright their hatred of war and their hatred of imperialism after the sagacity and enlightenment of this school came the school of persiflage a knot of vigorous and brilliant men towards 1856 rallied round the late editor of the saturday reviewand a strange chief he was for such a groupbut their flag was that of the red rover they gave philistinism many a shrewd blow but perhaps at the same time helped to some degreewith other far deeper and stronger forcesto produce that sceptical and centrifugal state of mind which now tends to nullify organised liberalism and paralyse the spirit of improvement the benthamites led first by james mill and afterwards in a secondary degree by john mill had pushed a number of political improvements in the radical and democratic direction during the time when the edinburgh so powerfully represented more orthodox liberalism they were the last important group of men who started together from a set of common principles accepted a common programme of practical applications and set to work in earnest and with due order and distribution of parts to advocate the common cause  at present 1878 there is no similar agreement either among the younger men in parliament or among a sufficiently numerous group of writers outside of parliament the edinburgh reviewers were most of them students of the university of that city the westminster reviewers had all sat at the feet of bentham each group had thus a common doctrine and a positive doctrine in practical politics it does not much matter by what different roads men have travelled to a given position but in an organ intended to lead public opinion towards certain changes or to hold it steadfast against wayward gusts of passion its strength would be increased a hundredfold if all the writers in it were inspired by that thorough unity of conviction which comes from sincerely accepting a common set of principles to start from and reaching practical conclusions by the same route we are probably not very far from a time when such a group might form itself and its work would for some years lie in the formation of a general body of opinion rather than in practical realisation of this or that measure the success of the french republic the peaceful order of the united states perhaps some trouble within our own borders will lead men with open minds to such a conception of a high and stable type of national life as will unite a sufficient number of them in a common project for pressing with systematic iteration for a complete set of organic changes a country with such a landsystem such an electoral system such a monarchy as ours has a trying time before it those will be doing good service who shall unite to prepare opinion for the inevitable changes at the present moment the only motto that can be inscribed on the flag of a liberal review is the general device of progress each writer interpreting it in his own sense and within such limits as he may set for himself for such a state of things signature is the natural condition and an editor even of a signed review would hardly decline to accept the account of his function which we find jeffrey giving to mr napierthere are three legitimate considerations by which you should be guided in your conduct as editor generally and particularly as to the admission or rejection of important articles of a political sort 1 the effect of your decision on the other contributors upon whom you mainly rely 2 its effect on the sale and circulation and on the just authority of the work with the great body of its readers and 3 your own deliberate opinion as to the safety or danger of the doctrines maintained in the article under consideration and its tendency either to promote or retard the practical adoption of those liberal principles to which and their practical advancement you must always consider the journal as devoted  as for discovering and training authors the editor under the new system has inducements that lie entirely the other way namely to find as many authors as possible whom the public has already discovered and accepted for itself young unknown writers certainly have not gained anything by the new system neither perhaps can they be said to have lost for though of two articles of equal merit an editor would naturally choose the one which should carry the additional recommendation of a name of recognised authority yet any marked superiority in literary brilliance or effective argument or originality of view would be only too eagerly welcomed in any review in england so much public interest is now taken in periodical literature and the honourable competition in securing variety weight and attractiveness is so active that there is no risk of a literary candle remaining long under a bushel miss martineau saysi have always been anxious to extend to young or struggling authors the sort of aid which would have been so precious to me in that winter of 182930 and i know that in above twenty years i have never succeeded but once one of the most distinguished editors in london who had charge of a periodical for many years told the present writer what comes to the same thing namely that in no single case during all these years did a volunteer contributor of real quality or with any promise of eminence present himself or herself so many hundreds think themselves called so few are chosen it used to be argued that the writer under the anonymous system was hidden behind a screen and robbed of his wellearned distinction in truth however it is impossible for a writer of real distinction to remain anonymous if a writer in a periodical interests the public they are sure to find out who he is  again there is folly unfathomable in a periodical affecting an eternal consistency and giving itself the airs of continuous individuality and being careful not to talk sense on a given question today because its founders talked nonsense upon it fifty years ago this is quite true there is a monstrous charlatanry about the old editorial we but perhaps there are some tolerably obvious openings for charlatanry of a different kind under our own system the man who writes in his own name may sometimes be tempted to say what he knows he is expected from his position or character to say rather than what he would have said if his personality were not concerned as far as honesty goes signature perhaps offers as many inducements to one kind of insincerity as anonymity offers to another kind and on the public it might perhaps be contended that there is an effect of a rather similar sort they are in some cases tempted away from serious discussion of the matter into frivolous curiosity and gossip about the man all this criticism of the principle of which the fortnightly review was the earliest english adherent will not be taken as the result in the present writer of chamforts maladie des désabusés that would be both extremely ungrateful and without excuse or reason it is merely a fragment of disinterested contribution to the study of a remarkable change that is passing over a not unimportant department of literature one gain alone counterbalances all the drawbacks and that is a gain that could hardly have been foreseen or expected i mean the freedom with which the great controversies of religion and theology have been discussed in the new reviews the removal of the mask has led to an outburst of plain speaking on these subjects which to mr napiers generation would have seemed simply incredible the frank avowal of unpopular beliefs or nonbeliefs has raised the whole level of the discussion and perhaps has been even more advantageous to the orthodox in teaching them more humility than to the heterodox in teaching them more courage and honesty  let us return to mr napiers volume we have said that it is impossible for a great writer to be anonymous no reader will need to be told who among mr napiers correspondents is the writer of the following      i have been thinking sometimes likewise of a paper on napoleon     a man whom though handled to the extreme of triteness it will be     long years before we understand hitherto in the english tongue     there is next to nothing that betokens insight into him or even     sincere belief of such on the part of the writer i should like     to study the man with what heartiness i could and form to myself     some intelligible picture of him both as a biographical and as     a historical figure in both of which senses he is our chief     contemporary wonder and in some sort the epitome of his age     this however were a task of far more difficulty than byron and     perhaps not so promising at present  and if there is any difficulty in recognising the same hand in the next proposal it arises only from the circumstance that it is this writer above all others who has made benthamism a term of reproach on the lips of men less wise than himself      a far finer essay were a faithful loving and yet critical and     in part condemnatory delineation of jeremy bentham and his place     and working in this section of the worlds history bentham will     not be put down by logic and should not be put down for we need     him greatly as a backwoodsman neither can reconciliation be     effected till the one party understands and is just to the other     bentham is a denyer he denies with a loud and universally     convincing voice his fault is that he can affirm nothing     except that money is pleasant in the purse and food in the     stomach and that by this simplest of all beliefs he can     reorganise society he can shatter it in piecesno thanks to him     for its old fastenings are quite rottenbut he cannot reorganise     it this is work for quite others than he such an essay on     bentham however were a great task for any one for me a very     great one and perhaps rather out of my road  perhaps carlyle would have agreed that mr mills famous pair of essays on bentham and coleridge have served the purpose which he had in his mind though we may well regret the loss of such a picture of benthams philosophic personality as he would surely have given us it is touching to think of him whom we all know as the most honoured name among living veterans of letters1 passing through the vexed ordeal of the young recruit and battling for his own against the waywardness of critics and the blindness of publishers in 1831 he writes to mr napier all manner of perplexities have occurred in the publishing of my poor book which perplexities i could only cut asunder not unloose so the ms like an unhappy ghost still lingers on the wrong side of styx the charon of  street durst not risk it in his sutilis cymba so it leaped ashore again and three months later i have given up the notion of hawking my little manuscript book about any further for a long time it has lain quiet in its drawer waiting for a better day and yet this little book was nothing less than the history of the french revolution  footnote 1 carlyle died on february 5 1881  it might be a lesson to small men to see the reasonableness sense and patience of these greater men macaulays letters show him to have been a pattern of good sense and considerateness mr carlyle seems indeed to have found jeffreys editorial vigour more than could be endured      my respected friend your predecessor had some difficulty with me     in adjusting the respective prerogatives of author and editor for     though not as i hope insensible to fair reason i used sometimes     to rebel against what i reckoned mere authority and this partly     perhaps as a matter of literary conscience being wont to write     nothing without studying it if possible to the bottom and writing     always with an almost painful feeling of scrupulosity that light     editorial hacking and hewing to right and left was in general     nowise to my mind  but we feel that the fault must have lain with jeffrey the qualifications that lord cockburn admired so much were not likely to be to the taste of a man of mr carlyles grit that did not prevent the most original of mr napiers contributors from being one of the most just and reasonable      i have barely within my time finished that paper     characteristics to which you are now heartily welcome if you     have room for it the doctrines here set forth have mostly long     been familiar convictions with me yet it is perhaps only within     the last twelvemonth that the public utterance of some of them     could have seemed a duty i have striven to express myself with     what guardedness was possible and as there will now be no time     for correcting proofs i must leave it wholly in your editorial     hands nay should it on due consideration appear to you in your     place for i see that matter dimly and nothing is clear but my     own mind and the general condition of the world unadvisable to     print the paper at all then pray understand my dear sir now and     always that i am no unreasonable man but if dogmatic enough as     jeffrey used to call it in my own beliefs also truly desirous to     be just towards those of others i shall in all sincerity beg of     you to do without fear of offence for in no point of view will     there be any what you yourself see good a mighty work lies     before the writers of this time  it is always interesting to the man of letters at any rate if not to his neighbours to find what was first thought by men of admitted competence of the beginnings of writers who are now seen to have made a mark on the world when the reputation of authors is made said saintebeuve it is easy to speak of them convenablement we have only to guide ourselves by the common opinion but at the start at the moment when they are trying their first flight and are in part ignorant of themselves then to judge them with tact with precision not to exaggerate their scope to predict their flight or divine their limits to put the reasonable objections in the midst of all due respectthis is the quality of the critic who is born to be a critic we have been speaking of mr carlyle this is what jeffrey thought of him in 1832      i fear carlyle will not do that is if you do not take the     liberties and the pains with him that i did by striking out     freely and writing in occasionally the misfortune is that he     is very obstinate and unluckily in a place like this he finds     people enough to abet and applaud him to intercept the operation     of the otherwise infallible remedy of general avoidance and     neglect it is a great pity for he is a man of genius and     industry and with the capacity of being an elegant and impressive     writer  the notion of jeffrey occasionally writing elegantly and impressively into carlyles proofsheets is rather striking some of jeffreys other criticisms sound very curiously in our ear in these days it is startling to find mills logic described 1843 as a great unreadable book and its elaborate demonstration of axioms and truisms a couple of years later jeffrey admits in speaking of mr mills paper on guizotthough i have long thought very highly of his powers as a reasoner i scarcely gave him credit for such large and sound views of realities and practical results as are displayed in this article sir james stephenthe distinguished sire of two distinguished contributors who may remind more than one editor of our generation of the horatian saying that    fortes creantur fortibus et bonis    neque imbellera feroces      progenerant aquilae columbam  this excellent writer took a more just measure of the book which jeffrey thought unreadable      my more immediate object in writing is to remind you of john     mills book system of logic of which i have lately been reading     a considerable part and i have done so with the conviction that     it is one of the most remarkable productions of this nineteenth     century exceedingly debatable indeed but most worthy of debate     are many of his favourite tenets especially those of the last     two or three chapters no man is fit to encounter him who is not     thoroughly conversant with the moral sciences which he handles     and remembering what you told me of your own studies under dugald     stewart i cannot but recommend the affair to your own personal     attention you will find very few men fit to be trusted with it     you ought to be aware that although with great circumspection     not to say timidity mill is an opponent of religion in the     abstract not of any particular form of it that is he evidently     maintains that superhuman influences on the mind of man are but a     dream whence the inevitable conclusion that all acts of devotion     and prayer are but a superstition that such is his real meaning     however darkly conveyed is indisputable you are well aware that     it is in direct conflict with my own deepest and most cherished     convictions yet to condemn him for holding and for calmly     publishing such views is but to add to the difficulties of fair     and full discussion and to render truth or supposed truth less     certain and valuable than if it had invited and encountered     and triumphed over every assault of every honest antagonist i     therefore wish mill to be treated respectfully and handsomely  few of mr napiers correspondents seem to have been more considerate at one period 1844 a long time had passed without any contribution from sir james stephens pen appearing in the review mr senior wrote a hint on the subject to the editor and napier seems to have communicated with sir james stephen who replied in a model strain      have you any offer of a paper or papers from my friend john     austin if you have and if you are not aware what manner of man     he is it may not be amiss that you should be apprised that in     these parts he enjoys and deservedly a very high and yet a     peculiar reputation i have a great attachment to him he is in     the best sense of the word a philosopher an earnest and humble     lover of wisdom i know not anywhere a larger minded man and yet     eloquent as he is in speech there is in his written style an     involution and a lack of vivacity which renders his writings a     sealed book to almost every one whether he will be able to assume     an easier and a lighter manner i do not know if not i rather     fear for him when he stands at your bar all i ask is that you     would convey your judgment in measured and as far as you can     honestly in courteous terms for he is for so considerable a     man strangely sensitive you must have an odd story to tell of     your intercourse with the knights of the order of the quill  and the letter closed with what an editor values more even than decently christian treatment namely the suggestion of a fine subject this became the admirable essay on the clapham sect  the author of one of the two or three most delightful biographies in all literature has published the letter to mr napier in which macaulay speaks pretty plainly what he thought about brougham and the extent of his services to the review brougham in turn hated macaulay whom he calls the third or greatest bore in society that he has ever known he is furiousand here brougham was certainly not wrongover the most profligate political morality of macaulays essay on clive      in my eyes his defence of clive and the audacious ground of     it merit execration it is a most serious and to me a painful     subject nonoall the sentences a man can turn even if he made     them in pure taste and not in toms snipsnap taste of the lower     empireall wont avail against a rotten morality the first and     most sacred duty of a public man and above all an author is     to keep by honest and true doctrinenever to relaxnever to     countenance viceever to hold fast by virtue what are we     gravely to be told at this time of day that a setoff may be     allowed for public and therefore atrocious crimes though he     admits that a common felon pleads it in vain gracious god where     is this to end what horrors will it not excuse tiberiuss great     capacity his firstrate wit that which made him the charm of     society will next i suppose be set up to give a splendour to     the inhabitants of capreae why olives address and his skill     and his courage are not at all more certain nor are they     qualities of a different cast every great ruffian who has filled     the world with blood and tears will be sure of an acquittal     because of his talents and his success after i had and chiefly     in the edinburgh review been trying to restore a better a     purer a higher standard of morals and to wean men from the silly     love of military glory for which they are the first to pay i     find the edinburgh review preaching not merely the old and     common heresies but ten thousand times worse adopting a vile     principle never yet avowed in terms though too often and too much     taken for a guide unknown to those who followed it in forming     their judgments of great and successful criminals  of the essay on warren hastings he thought better bating some vulgarity and macaulays usual want of all power of reasoning lord cockburn wrote to mr napier 1844 a word or two on macaulay delighting as i do says lord cockburn in his thoughts views and knowledge i feel too often compelled to curse and roar at his words and the structure of his composition as a corrupter of style he is more dangerous to the young than gibbon his seductive powers greater his defects worse all good critics now accept this as true jeffrey by the way speaking of the same essay thinks that macaulay rates chatham too high i have always had an impression he says though perhaps an ignorant and unjust one that there was more good luck than wisdom in his foreign policy and very little to admire except his personal purity in any part of his domestic administration  it is interesting to find a record in the energetic speech of contemporary hatred of the way in which orthodox science regarded a once famous book of heterodox philosophy here is professor sedgwick on the vestiges of creation      i now know the vestiges well and i detest the book for its     shallowness for the intense vulgarity of its philosophy for its     gross unblushing materialism for its silly credulity in catering     out of every fools dish for its utter ignorance of what is meant     by induction for its gross and i dare to say filthy views of     physiologymost ignorant and most falseand for its shameful     shuffling of the facts of geology so as to make them play a     rogues game i believe some woman is the author partly from the     fair dress and agreeable exterior of the vestiges and partly from     the utter ignorance the book displays of all sound physical logic     a man who knew so much of the surface of physics must at least     on some one point or other have taken a deeper plunge but all     parts of the book are shallow from the bottom of my soul i     loathe and detest the vestiges tis a rank pill of asafoetida and     arsenic covered with gold leaf i do therefore trust that your     contributor has stamped with an iron heel upon the head of the     filthy abortion and put an end to its crawlings there is not one     subject the author handles bearing on life of which he does not     take a degrading view  mr napier seems to have asked him to write on the book and sedgwicks article the first he ever wrote for a review eventually appeared 1845without it is to be hoped too much of the raging contempt of the above and other letters i do feel contempt and i hope i shall express it eats hatched by the incubations of a goosedogs playing dominosmonkeys breeding men and womenall distinctions between natural and moral done awaythe bible proved all a lie and mental philosophy one mass of folly all of it to be pounded down and done over again in the cooking vessels of gall and spurzheim this was the beginning of a long campaign which is just now drawing near its close let us at least be glad that orthodoxy whether scientific or religious has mended his temper one among other causes of the improvement as we have already said is probably to be found in the greater selfrestraint which comes from the fact of the writer appearing in his own proper person     valedictory1  footnote 1 on the writers retirement from the editorship of the fortnightly review in 1882   the present number of the review marks the close of a task which was confided to me no less than fifteen years agogrande mortalis cevi spatium a long span of ones mortal days fifteen years are enough to bring a man from youth to middle age to test the working value of convictions to measure the advance of principles and beliefs and alas to cut off many early associates and to extinguish many lights it is hardly possible that a review should have been conducted for so considerable a time without the commission of some mistakes articles admitted which might as well have been left out opinions expressed which have a crudish look in the mellow light of years phrases dropped in the heat or hurry of the moment which one would fain obliterate many a regret must rise in mens minds on any occasion that compels them to look back over a long reach of years the disparity between aim and performance the unfulfilled promise the wrong turnings taken at critical pointsas an accident of the hour draws us to take stock of a complete period of our lives all these things rise up in private and internal judgment against anybody who is not either too stupid or too fatuously complacent to recognise facts when he sees them but the mood passes time happily is merciful and mens memories are benignly short  more painful is the recollection of those earlier contributors of ours who have vanished from the world periodical literature is like the manna in the wilderness it quickly loses its freshness and to turn over thirty volumes of old reviews can hardly be exhilarating at the best least of all so when it recalls friends and coadjutors who can give their help no more george henry lewes the founder of the review and always cordially interested in its fortunes has not survived to see the end of the reign of his successor his vivacious intelligence had probably done as much as he was competent to do for his generation but there were other important contributors now gone of whom this could not be said in the region of political theory the loss of je cairnes was truly lamentable and untimely he had as mill said of him that rare qualification among writers on political and social subjectsa genuine scientific intellect not a month passes in which one does not feel how great an advantage it would have been to be able to go down to blackheath and discuss the perplexities of the time in that genial and manly companionship where facts were weighed with so much care where conclusions were measured with such breadth and comprehension and where even the great stolid idols of the cave and the market place were never too rudely buffeted of a very different order of mind from cairnes but not less to be permanently regretted by all of us who knew him was mr bagehot whose books on the english constitution on physics and politics and the fragment on the postulates of political economy were all published in these pages he wrote in fact the first article in the first number though himself extremely cool and sceptical about political improvement of every sort he took abundant interest in more ardent friends perhaps it was that they amused him in return his goodnatured ironies put them wholesomely on their mettle as has been well said of him he had a unique power of animation without combat it was all stimulus and yet no contest his talk was full of youth yet had all the wisdom of mature judgment rh hutton those who were least willing to assent to bagehots practical maxims in judging current affairs yet were well aware how much they profited by his socratic objections and knew too what real acquaintance with men and business what honest sympathy and friendliness and what serious judgment and interest all lay under his playful and racy humour  more untimely in one sense than any other was the death of professor clifford whose articles in this review attracted so much attention and i fear that i may add gave for a season so much offence six or seven years ago cairnes was scarcely fifty when he died and bagehot was fiftyone but clifford was only fourandthirty yet in this brief space he had not merely won a reputation as a mathematician of the first order but had made a real mark on his time both by the substance of his speculations in science religion and ethics and by the curious audacity with which he proclaimed at the pitch of his voice on the housetops religious opinions that had hitherto been kept among the family secrets of the domus socratica it is melancholy to think that exciting work done under pressure of time of his own imposing should have been the chief cause of his premature decline how intense that pressure was the reader may measure by the fact that a paper of his on the unseen universe which filled eighteen pages of the review was composed at a single sitting that lasted from a quarter to ten in the evening till nine oclock the following morning as one revolves these and other names of eminent men who actively helped to make the review what it has been it would be impossible to omit the most eminent of them all time has done something to impair the philosophical reputation and the political celebrity of js mill but it cannot alter the affectionate memory in which some of us must always hold his wisdom and goodness his rare union of moral ardour with a calm and settled mind he took the warmest interest in this review from the moment when i took it up partly from the friendship with which he honoured me but much more because he wished to encourage what was thenthough it is now happily no longerthe only attempt to conduct a periodical on the principles of free discussion and personal responsibility while recalling these and others who are no more it was naturally impossible for me to forget the constant and valuable help that has been so freely given to me often at much sacrifice of their own convenience by those friends and contributors who are still with us no conductor ever laid down his bâton with a more cordial and sincere sense of gratitude to those who took their several parts in his performance  one chief experiment which the review was established to try was that of signed articles when mr lewes wrote his farewell causerie as i am doing now he said that we have been enabled to bring together men so various in opinion and so distinguished in power has been mainly owing to the principle adopted of allowing each writer perfect freedom which could only have been allowed under the condition of personal responsibility the question of signing articles had long been debated it has now been tested the arguments in favour of it were mainly of a moral order the arguments against it while admitting the morality mainly asserted its inexpediency the question of expediency has i venture to say been materially enlightened by the success of the review the success of other periodicals conducted still more rigorously on the principle that every article ought to bear its writers signature leaves no further doubt on the subject so that it is now almost impossible to realise that only fifteen or sixteen years ago scarcely anybody of the class called practical could believe that the sacred principle of the anonymous was doomed one of the shrewdest publishers in edinburgh and also himself the editor of a famous magazine once said to me while mr lewes was still editor of this review that he had always thought highly of our friends judgment until he had taken up the senseless notion of a magazine with signed articles and open to both sides of every question nobody will call the notion senseless any longer the question is rather how long the exclusively anonymous periodicals will resist the innovation  personally i have attached less stern importance to signature as an unvarying rule than did my predecessor though even he was compelled by obvious considerations of convenience to make his chronique of current affairs anonymous our practice has been signature as the standing rule occasionally suspended in favour of anonymity when there seemed to be sufficient reason on the whole it may be said that the change from anonymous to signed articles has followed the course of most changes it has not led to onehalf either of the evils or of the advantages that its advocates and its opponents foretold that it has produced some charlatanry can hardly be denied readers are tempted to postpone serious and persistent interest in subjects to a semipersonal curiosity about the casual and unconnected deliverances of the literary or social star of the hour that this conception has been worked out with signal ability in more cases than one that it has made periodical literature full of actuality that it has tickled and delighted the palateis all most true the obvious danger is lest we should be tempted to think more of the man who speaks than of the precise value of what he says  one indirect effect that is not unworthy of notice in the new system is its tendency to narrow the openings for the writer by profession if an article is to be signed the editor will naturally seek the name of an expert of special weight and competence on the matter in hand a reviewer on the staff of a famous journal once received for his weeks task general hamley on the art of war a threevolume novel a work on dainty dishes and a translation of pindar this was perhaps taxing versatility and omniscience overmuch and it may be taken for granted that the writer made no serious contribution to tactics cookery or scholarship but being a man of a certain intelligence passably honest and reasonably painstaking probably he produced reviews sufficiently useful and just to answer their purpose on the new system we should have an article on general hamleys work by sir garnet wolseley and one on the cookerybook from m trompette it is not certain that this is all pure gain there is a something to be said for the writer by profession who without being an expert will take trouble to work up his subject to learn what is said and thought about it to penetrate to the real points to get the same mastery over it as an advocate or a judge does over a patent case or a suit about rubrics and vestments he is at least as likely as the expert to tell the reader all that he wants to know and at least as likely to be free from bias and injurious prepossession  nor does experience so far as it has yet gone quite bear out mr lewess train of argument that the first condition of all writing is sincerity and that one means of securing sincerity is to insist on personal responsibility and that this personal responsibility can only be secured by signing articles the old talk of literary bravoes men in masks anonymous assassins and so forth is out of date longer experience has only confirmed the present writers opinion expressed here from the very beginning everybody who knows the composition of any respectable journal in london knows very well that the articles which those of our own way of thinking dislike most intensely are written by men whom to call bravoes in any sense whatever would be simply monstrous let us say as loudly as we choose if we see good reason that they are half informed about some of the things which they so authoritatively discuss that they are under strong class feeling that they have not mastered the doctrines which they are opposing that they have not sufficiently meditated their subject that they have not given themselves time to do justice even to their scanty knowledge journalists are open to charges of this kind but to think of them as a shameless body thirsting for the blood of better men than themselves or ready to act as an editors instrument for money involves a thoroughly unjust misconception  as to the comparative effects of the two systems on literary quality no prudent observer with adequate experience will lay down an unalterable rule habit no doubt counts for a great deal but apart from habit there are differences of temperament and peculiar sensibilities some men write best when they sign what they write they find impersonality a mystification and an incumbrance anonymity makes them stiff pompous and overmagisterial with others however the effect is just the reverse if they sign they become selfconscious stilted and even pretentious it is only when they are anonymous that they recover simplicity and ease it is as if an actor who is the soul of what is natural under the disguises of his part should become extremely artificial if he were compelled to come upon the stage in his own proper clothes and speaking only in his ordinary voice  the newspaper press has not yet followed the example of the new reviews but we are probably not far from the time when here too the practice of signature will make its way there was a silly cry at one time for making the disuse of anonymity compulsory by law but we shall no more see this than we shall see legal penalties imposed for publishing a book without an index though that also has been suggested the same end will be reached by other ways within the last few years a truly surprising shock has been given to the idea of a newspaper as a sort of impersonal thing coming from nobody knows where the readers never thinking of the writer nor caring whether he thinks what he writes so long as they think what he writes of course it is still true and will most likely always remain true that like the athenian sophist great newspapers will teach the conventional prejudices of those who pay for it a writer will long be able to say that like the sophist the newspaper reflects the morality the intelligence the tone of sentiment of its public and if the latter is vicious so is the former but there is infinitely less of this than there used to be the press is more and more taking the tone of a man speaking to a man the childish imposture of the editorial we is already thoroughly exploded the names of all important journalists are now coming to be as publicly known as the names of important members of parliament there is even something over and above this more than one editor has boldly aspired to create and educate a public of his own and he has succeeded the press is growing to be much more personal in the sense that its most important directors are taking to themselves the right of pursuing an individual line of their own with far less respect than of old to the supposed exigencies of party or the communiqués of political leaders the editor of a review of great eminence said to the present writer who for his own part took a slightly more modest view that he regarded himself as equal in importance to seventyfive members of parliament it is not altogether easy to weigh and measure with this degree of precision but what is certain is that there are journalists on both sides in politics to whom the public looks for original suggestion and from whom leading politicians seek not merely such mechanical support as they expect from their adherents in the house of commons nor merely the uses of the vane to show which way the wind blows but ideas guidance and counsel as from persons of coequal authority with themselves england is still a long way from the point at which french journalism has arrived in this matter we cannot count an effective host of girardins lemoinnes abouts or even cassagnacs and rocheforts each recognised as the exponent of his own opinions and each read because the opinions written are known to be his own but there is a distinctly nearer approach to this as the general state of english journalism than there was twenty years ago  of course nobody of sense supposes that any journalist however independent and however possessed by the spirit of his personal responsibility tries to form his opinions out of his own head without reference to the view of the men practically engaged in public affairs the temper of parliament and the feeling of constituencies and so forth all these are part of the elements that go to the formation of his own judgment and he will certainly not neglect to find out as much about them as he possibly can nor again does the increase of the personal sentiment about our public prints lessen the general working fidelity of their conductors to a party it is their duty no doubt to discuss the merits of measures as they arise in this respect any one can see how radically they differ from the member of parliament whose business is not only to discuss but to act the member of parliament must look at the effect of his vote in more lights than one besides the merits of the given measure it is his duty to think of the wishes of those who chose him to represent them and if moreover the effect of voting against a measure of which he disapproves would be to overthrow a whole ministry of which he strongly approves then unless some very vital principle indeed were involved to give such a vote would be to prefer a small object to a great one and would indicate a very queasy monkish sort of conscience the journalist is not in the same position he is an observer and a critic and can afford and is bound to speak the truth but even in his case the disagreement as burke said will be only enough to indulge freedom without violating concord or disturbing arrangement there is a certain partiality which becomes a wellchosen friendship men thinking freely will in particular instances think differently but still as the greater part of the measures which arise in the course of public business are related to or dependent on some great leading general principles in government a man must be peculiarly unfortunate in the choice of his political company if he does not agree with them at least nine times in ten the doctrine that was good enough for burke in this matter may be counted good enough for most of us some of the current talk about political independence is mere hypocrisy some of it is mere vanity for the new priest of literature is quite as liable to the defects of spiritual pride and ambition as the old priest of the church and it is quite as well for him that he should be on his guard against these scarlet and highcrested sins  the success of reviews of which our own was the first english type marks a very considerable revolution in the intellectual habits of the time they have brought abstract discussion from the library down to the parlour and from the serious student down to the first man in the street we have passed through a perfect cyclone of religious polemics the popularity of such reviews means that really large audiences le gros public are eagerly interested in the radical discussion of propositions which twenty years ago were only publicly maintained and then in their crudest least true and most repulsive form in obscure debating societies and little secularist clubs everybody male or female who reads anything serious at all now reads a dozen essays a year to show with infinite varieties of approach and of demonstration that we can never know whether there be a supreme being or not whether the soul survives the body or whether mind is more and other than a mere function of matter no article that has appeared in any periodical for a generation back excited so profound a sensation as mr huxleys memorable paper on the physical basis of life published in this review in february 1869 it created just the same kind of stir that in a political epoch was made by such a pamphlet as the conduct of the allies or the reflections on the french revolution this excitement was a sign that controversies which had hitherto been confined to books and treatises were now to be admitted to popular periodicals and that the common man of the world would now listen and have an opinion of his own on the bases of belief just as he listens and judges in politics or art or letters the clergy no longer have the pulpit to themselves for the new reviews became more powerful pulpits in which heretics were at least as welcome as orthodox speculation has become entirely democratised this is a tremendous change to have come about in little more than a dozen years how far it goes let us not be too sure it is no new discovery that what looks like complete tolerance may be in reality only complete indifference intellectual fairness is often only another name for indolence and inconclusiveness of mind just as love of truth is sometimes a fine phrase for temper to be piquant counts for much and the interest of seeing on the drawingroom tables of devout catholics and highflying anglicans article after article sending divinities creeds and churches all headlong into limbo was indeed piquant much of all this elegant dabbling in infidelity has been a caprice of fashion the agnostic has had his day with the fine ladies like the black footboy of other times or the spiritrapper and tableturner of our own what we have been watching after all was perhaps a tournament not a battle  it would not be very easy for us now and perhaps it would not be particularly becoming at any time to analyse the position that has been assigned to this review in common esteem those who have watched it from without can judge better than those who have worked within though it has been open so far as editorial goodwill was concerned to opinions from many sides the review has unquestionably gathered round it some of the associations of sect what that sect is people have found it difficult to describe with anything like precision for a long time it was the fashion to label the review as comtist and it would be singularly ungrateful to deny that it has had no more effective contributors than some of the bestknown disciples of comte byandby it was felt that this was too narrow it was nearer the truth to call it the organ of positivists in the wider sense of that designation but even this would not cover many directly political articles that have appeared in our pages and made a mark in their time the memorable programme of free labour free land free schools free church had nothing at all positivist about it nor could that programme and many besides from the same pen and others be compressed under the nickname of academic liberalism there was too strong a flavour of action for the academic and the philosophic this passion for a label after all is an infirmity yet people justly perceived that there seemed to be a certain undefinable concurrence among writers coming from different schools and handling very different subjects perhaps the instinct was right which fancied that it discerned some common drift a certain pervading atmosphere and scented a subtle connection between speculations on the physical basis of life and the unseen universe and articles on trades unions and national education  so far as the review has been more specially identified with one set of opinions than another it has been due to the fact that a certain dissent from received theologies has been found in company with new ideas of social and political reform this suspicious combination at one time aroused considerable anger the notion of anything like an intervention of the literary and scientific class in political affairs touched a certain jealousy which is always to be looked for in the positive and practical man they think as napoleon thought of men of letters and savansce sont des coquettes avec lesquelles il faut entretenir un commerce de galanterie et dont il ne faut jamais songer à faire ni sa femme ni son ministre men will listen to your views about the unknowable with a composure that instantly disappears if your argument comes too near to the rates and taxes it is amusing as we read the newspapers today to think that mr harrisons powerful defence of trades unions fifteen years ago caused the review to be regarded as an incendiary publication some papers that appeared here on national education were thought to indicate a deliberate plot for suppressing the holy scriptures in the land extravagant misjudgment of this kind has passed away but it was far from being a mistake to suppose that the line taken here by many writers did mean that there was a new radicalism in the air which went a good deal deeper than fidgeting about an estimate or the amount of the queens contribution to her own taxes time has verified what was serious in those early apprehensions principles and aims are coming into prominence in the social activity of today which would hardly have found a hearing twenty years ago and it would be sufficient justification for the past of our review if some writers in it have been instrumental in the process of showing how such principles and aims meet the requirements of the new time reformers must always be open to the taunt that they find nothing in the world good enough for them you write said a popular novelist to one of this unthanked tribe as if you believed that everything is bad nay said the other but i do believe that everything might be better such a belief naturally breeds a spirit which the easygoers of the world resent as a spirit of ceaseless complaint and scolding hence our liberalism here has often been taxed with being ungenial discontented and even querulous but such liberals will wrap themselves in their own virtue remembering the cheering apophthegm that those who are dissatisfied are the sole benefactors of the world  this will not be found i think too lofty or too thrasonical an estimate of what has been attempted a certain number of people have been persuaded to share opinions that fifteen years ago were more unpopular than they are now a certain resistance has been offered to the stubborn influence of prejudice and use and wont the original scheme of the review even if there had been no other obstacle prevented it from being the organ of a systematic and constructive policy there is not in fact a body of systematic political thought at work in our own day the liberals of the benthamite school surveyed society and institutions as a whole they connected their advocacy of political and legal changes with carefully formed theories of human nature they considered the great art of government in connection with the character of man his proper education his potential capacities yet as we then said it cannot be pretended that we are less in need of systematic politics than our fathers were sixty years since or that general principles are now more generally settled even among members of the same party than they were then the perplexities of today are as embarrassing as any in our history and they may prove even more dangerous the renovation of parliamentary government the transformation of the conditions of the ownership and occupation of land the relations between the government at home and our adventurers abroad in contact with inferior races the limitations on free contract and the rights of majorities to restrict the private acts of minorities these are only some of the questions that time and circumstances are pressing upon us these are in the political and legislative sphere alone in education in economics the problems are as many yet ideas are hardly ripe for realisation we shall need to see great schools before we can make sure of powerful parties meanwhile whatever gives freedom and variety to thought and earnestness to mens interest in the world must contribute to a good end
