21720309	the spirit of the border a romance of the early settlers in the ohio valley  by zane grey  1906    to my brother  with many fond recollections of days spent in the solitude of the forests where only can be satisfied that wild fever of freedom of which this book tells where to hear the whirr of a wild duck in his rapid flight is joy where the quiet of an autumn afternoon swells the heart and where one may watch the fragrant woodsmoke curl from the campfire and see the stars peep over dark wooded hills as twilight deepens and know a happiness that dwells in the wilderness alone    introduction  the author does not intend to apologize for what many readers may call the brutality of the story but rather to explain that its wild spirit is true to the life of the western border as it was known only a little more than one hundred years ago  the writer is the fortunate possessor of historical material of undoubted truth and interest it is the longlost journal of colonel ebenezer zane one of the most prominent of the hunterpioneer who labored in the settlement of the western country  the story of that tragic period deserves a higher place in historical literature than it has thus far been given and this unquestionably because of a lack of authentic data regarding the conquering of the wilderness considering how many years the pioneers struggled on the border of this country the history of their efforts is meager and obscure  if the years at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century were full of stirring adventure on the part of the colonists along the atlantic coast how crowded must they have been for the almost forgotten pioneers who daringly invaded the trackless wilds none there was to chronicle the fight of these sturdy travelers toward the setting sun the story of their stormy lives of their heroism and of their sacrifice for the benefit of future generations is too little known  it is to a better understanding of those days that the author has labored to draw from his ancestors notes a new and striking portrayal of the frontier one which shall paint the fever of freedom that powerful impulse which lured so many to unmarked graves one which shall show his work his love the effect of the causes which rendered his life so hard and surely one which does not forget the wronged indian  the frontier in 1777 produced white men so savage as to be men in name only these outcasts and renegades lived among the savages and during thirty years harassed the border perpetrating all manner of fiendish cruelties upon the settlers they were no less cruel to the redmen whom they ruled and at the height of their bloody careers made futile the moravian missionaries long labors and destroyed the beautiful hamlet of the christian indians called gnaddenhutten or village of peace  and while the border produced such outlaws so did it produce hunters eke boone the zanes the mccollochs and wetzel that strange silent man whose deeds are still whispered in the country where he once roamed in his insatiate pursuit of savages and renegades and who was purely a product of the times civilization could not have brought forth a man like wetzel great revolutions great crises great moments come and produce the men to deal with them  the border needed wetzel the settlers would have needed many more years in which to make permanent homes had it not been for him he was never a pioneer but always a hunter after indians when not on the track of the savage foe he was in the settlement with his keen eye and ear ever alert for signs of the enemy to the superstitious indians he was a shadow a spirit of the border which breathed menace from the dark forests to the settlers he was the right arm of defense a fitting leader for those few implacable and unerring frontiersmen who made the settlement of the west a possibility  and if this story of one of his relentless pursuits shows the man as he truly was loved by pioneers respected and feared by redmen and hated by renegades if it softens a little the ruthless name history accords him the writer will have been well repaid  z g    the spirit of the border    chapter i  nell im growing powerful fond of you  so you must be master joe if often telling makes it true  the girl spoke simply and with an absence of that roguishness which was characteristic of her playful words arch smiles and a touch of coquetry had seemed natural to nell but now her grave tone and her almost wistful glance disconcerted joe  during all the long journey over the mountains she had been gay and bright while now when they were about to part perhaps never to meet again she showed him the deeper and more earnest side of her character it checked his boldness as nothing else had done suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a womans love when she bestows it without reservation silenced by the thought that he had not understood her at all and the knowledge that he had been half in sport he gazed out over the wild country before them  the scene impressed its quietness upon the young couple and brought more forcibly to their minds the fact that they were at the gateway of the unknown west that somewhere beyond this rude frontier settlement out there in those unbroken forests stretching dark and silent before them was to be their future home  from the high bank where they stood the land sloped and narrowed gradually until it ended in a sharp point which marked the last bit of land between the allegheny and monongahela rivers here these swift streams merged and formed the broad ohio the newborn river even here at its beginning proud and swelling as if already certain of its faraway grandeur swept majestically round a wide curve and apparently lost itself in the forest foliage  on the narrow point of land commanding a view of the rivers stood a long low structure enclosed by a stockade fence on the four corners of which were little boxshaped houses that bulged out as if trying to see what was going on beneath the massive timbers used in the construction of this fort the square compact form and the small dark holes cut into the walls gave the structure a threatening impregnable aspect  below nell and joe on the bank were many log cabins the yellow clay which filled the chinks between the logs gave these a peculiar striped appearance there was life and bustle in the vicinity of these dwellings in sharp contrast with the still grandeur of the neighboring forests there were canvascovered wagons around which curlyheaded youngsters were playing several horses were grazing on the short grass and six red and white oxen munched at the hay that had been thrown to them the smoke of many fires curled upward and near the blaze hovered ruddyfaced women who stirred the contents of steaming kettles one man swung an axe with a vigorous sweep and the clean sharp strokes rang on the air another hammered stakes into the ground on which to hang a kettle before a large cabin a furtrader was exhibiting his wares to three indians a second redskin was carrying a pack of pelts from a canoe drawn up on the river bank a small group of persons stood near some were indifferent and others gazed curiously at the savages two children peeped from behind their mothers skirts as if halfcurious halffrightened  from this scene the significance of which had just dawned on him joe turned his eyes again to his companion it was a sweet face he saw one that was sedate but had a promise of innumerable smiles the blue eyes could not long hide flashes of merriment the girl turned and the two young people looked at each other her eyes softened with a womans gentleness as they rested upon him for broad of shoulder and lithe and strong as a deer stalker he was good to look at  listen she said we have known each other only three weeks since you joined our wagontrain and have been so kind to me and so helpful to make that long rough ride endurable you have won my regard ii cannot say more even if i would you told me you ran away from your virginian home to seek adventure on the frontier and that you knew no one in all this wild country you even said you could not or would not work at farming perhaps my sister and i are as unfitted as you for this life but we must cling to our uncle because he is the only relative we have he has come out here to join the moravians and to preach the gospel to these indians we shall share his life and help him all we can you have been telling me youyou cared for me and now that we are about to part ii dont know what to say to youunless it is give up this intention of yours to seek adventure and come with us it seems to me you need not hunt for excitement here it will come unsought  i wish i were jim said he suddenly  who is jim  my brother  tell me of him  theres nothing much to tell he and i are all that are left of our people as are you and kate of yours jims a preacher and the best fellowoh i cared a lot for jim  then why did you leave him  i was tired of williamsburgi quarreled with a fellow and hurt him besides i wanted to see the west id like to hunt deer and bear and fight indians oh im not much good  was jim the only one you cared for asked nell smiling she was surprised to find him grave  yes except my horse and dog and i had to leave them behind answered joe bowing his head a little  youd like to be jim because hes a preacher and could help uncle convert the indians  yes partly that but mostly becausesomehowsomething youve said or done has made me care for you in a different way and id like to be worthy of you  i dont think i can believe it when you say you are no good she replied  nell he cried and suddenly grasped her hand  she wrenched herself free and leaped away from him her face was bright now and the promise of smiles was made good  behave yourself sir she tossed her head with a familiar backward motion to throw the chestnut hair from her face and looked at him with eyes veiled slightly under their lashes you will go with kate and me  before he could answer a cry from some one on the plain below attracted their attention they turned and saw another wagontrain pulling into the settlement the children were shooting and running alongside the weary oxen men and women went forward expectantly  that must be the train uncle expected let us go down said nell  joe did not answer but followed her down the path when they gained a clump of willows near the cabins he bent forward and took her hand she saw the reckless gleam in his eyes  dont theyll see she whispered  if thats the only reason you have i reckon i dont care said joe  what do you mean i didnt sayi didnt telloh let me go implored nell  she tried to release the hand joe had grasped in his broad palm but in vain the more she struggled the firmer was his hold a frown wrinkled her brow and her eyes sparkled with spirit she saw the furtraders wife looking out of the window and remembered laughing and telling the good woman she did not like this young man it was perhaps because she feared those sharp eyes that she resented his audacity she opened her mouth to rebuke him but no words came joe had bent his head and softly closed her lips with his own  for the single instant during which nell stood transfixed as if with surprise and looking up at joe she was dumb usually the girl was ready with sharp or saucy words and impulsive in her movements but now the bewilderment of being kissed particularly within view of the traders wife confused her then she heard voices and as joe turned away with a smile on his face the unusual warmth in her heart was followed by an angry throbbing  joes tall figure stood out distinctly as he leisurely strolled toward the incoming wagontrain without looking backward flashing after him a glance that boded wordy trouble in the future she ran into the cabin  as she entered the door it seemed certain the grizzled frontiersman sitting on the bench outside had grinned knowingly at her and winked as if to say he would keep her secret mrs wentz the furtraders wife was seated by the open window which faced the fort she was a large woman strong of feature and with that calm placidity of expression common to people who have lived long in sparsely populated districts nell glanced furtively at her and thought she detected the shadow of a smile in the gray eyes  i saw you and your sweetheart makin love behind the willow mrs wentz said in a matteroffact voice i dont see why you need hide to do it we folks out here like to see the young people sparkin your young man is a fineappearin chap i felt certain you was sweethearts for all you allowed youd known him only a few days lize davis said she saw he was sweet on you i like his face jake my man says as how hell make a good husband for you and hell take to the frontier like a duck does to water im sorry youll not tarry here awhile we dont see many lasses especially any as pretty as you and youll find it more quiet and lonesome the farther west you get jake knows all about fort henry and jeff lynn the hunter outside he knows eb and jack zane and wetzel and all those fort henry men youll be gettin married out there wont you  you arequite wrong said nell who all the while mrs wentz was speaking grew rosier and rosier were not anything  then nell hesitated and finally ceased speaking she saw that denials or explanations were futile the simple woman had seen the kiss and formed her own conclusions during the few days nell had spent at fort pitt she had come to understand that the dwellers on the frontier took everything as a matter of course she had seen them manifest a certain pleasure but neither surprise concern nor any of the quick impulses so common among other people and this was another lesson nell took to heart she realized that she was entering upon a life absolutely different from her former one and the thought caused her to shrink from the ordeal yet all the suggestions regarding her future home the stories told about indians renegades and of the wild borderlife fascinated her these people who had settled in this wild region were simple honest and brave they accepted what came as facts not to be questioned and believed what looked true evidently the furtraders wife and her female neighbors had settled in their minds the relation in which the girl stood to joe  this latter reflection heightened nells resentment toward her lover she stood with her face turned away from mrs wentz the little frown deepened and she nervously tapped her foot on the floor  where is my sister she presently asked  she went to see the wagontrain come in everybodys out there  nell deliberated a moment and then went into the open air she saw a number of canvascovered wagons drawn up in front of the cabins the vehicles were dusty and the wheels encrusted with yellow mud the grizzled frontiersman who had smiled at nell stood leaning on his gun talking to three men whose travelstained and worn homespun clothes suggested a long and toilsome journey there was the bustle of excitement incident to the arrival of strangers to the quick exchange of greetings the unloading of wagons and unharnessing of horses and oxen  nell looked here and there for her sister finally she saw her standing near her uncle while he conversed with one of the teamsters the girl did not approach them but glanced quickly around in search of some one else at length she saw joe unloading goods from one of the wagons his back was turned toward her but she at once recognized the challenge conveyed by the broad shoulders she saw no other person gave heed to nothing save what was to her righteous indignation  hearing her footsteps the young man turned glancing at her admiringly said  good evening miss  nell had not expected such a matteroffact greeting from joe there was not the slightest trace of repentance in his calm face and he placidly continued his labor  arent you sorry youyou treated me so burst out nell  his coolness was exasperating instead of the contrition and apology she had expected and which was her due he evidently intended to tease her as he had done so often  the young man dropped a blanket and stared  i dont understand he said gravely i never saw you before  this was too much for quicktempered nell she had had some vague idea of forgiving him after he had sued sufficiently for pardon but now forgetting her good intentions in the belief that he was making sport of her when he should have pleaded for forgiveness she swiftly raised her hand and slapped him smartly  the red blood flamed to the young mans face as he staggered backward with his hand to his cheek she heard a smothered exclamation behind her and then the quick joyous barking of a dog  when nell turned she was amazed to see joe standing beside the wagon while a big white dog was leaping upon him suddenly she felt faint bewildered she looked from joe to the man she had just struck but could not say which was the man who professed to love her  jim so you followed me cried joe starting forward and flinging his arms around the other  yes joe and right glad i am to find you answered the young man while a peculiar expression of pleasure came over his face  its good to see you again and heres my old dog mose but how on earth did you know where did you strike my trail what are you going to do out here on the frontier tell me all what happened after i left  then joe saw nell standing nearby pale and distressed and he felt something was amiss he glanced quickly from her to his brother she seemed to be dazed and jim looked grave  what the deuce nell this is my brother jim the one i told you about jim this is my friend miss wells  i am happy to meet miss wells said jim with a smile even though she did slap my face for nothing  slapped you what for then the truth dawned on joe and he laughed until the tears came into his eyes she took you for me ha ha ha oh this is great  nells face was now rosy red and moisture glistened in her eyes but she tried bravely to stand her ground humiliation had taken the place of anger  iiam sorry mr downs i did take you for him hehe has insulted me then she turned and ran into the cabin    chapter ii  joe and jim were singularly alike they were nearly the same size very tall but so heavily built as to appear of medium height while their grey eyes and indeed every feature of their cleancut faces corresponded so exactly as to proclaim them brothers  already up to your old tricks asked jim with his hand on joes shoulder as they both watched nells flight  im really fond of her jim and didnt mean to hurt her feelings but tell me about yourself what made you come west  to teach the indians and i was no doubt strongly influenced by your being here  youre going to do as you ever havemake some sacrifice you are always devoting yourself if not to me to some other now its your life youre giving up to try to convert the redskins and influence me for good is in both cases impossible how often have i said there wasnt any good in me my desire is to kill indians not preach to them jim im glad to see you but i wish you hadnt come this wild frontier is no place for a preacher  i think it is said jim quietly  what of rosethe girl you were to marry  joe glanced quickly at his brother jims face paled slightly as he turned away  ill speak once more of her and then never again he answered you knew rose better than i did once you tried to tell me she was too fond of admiration and i rebuked you but now i see that your wider experience of women had taught you things i could not then understand she was untrue when you left williamsburg apparently because you had gambled with jewett and afterward fought him i was not misled you made the game of cards a pretense you sought it simply as an opportunity to wreak your vengeance on him for his villainy toward me well its all over now though you cruelly beat and left him disfigured for life he will live and you are saved from murder thank god when i learned of your departure i yearned to follow then i met a preacher who spoke of having intended to go west with a mr wells of the moravian mission i immediately said i would go in his place and here i am im fortunate in that i have found both him and you  im sorry i didnt kill jewett i certainly meant to anyway theres some comfort in knowing i left my mark on him he was a sneaking coldblooded fellow with his white hair and pale face and always fawning round the girls i hated him and gave it to him good joe spoke musingly and complacently as though it was a trivial thing to compass the killing of a man  well jim youre here now and theres no help for it well go along with this moravian preacher and his nieces if you havent any great regrets for the past why all may be well yet i can see that the border is the place for me but now jim for once in your life take a word of advice from me were out on the frontier where every man looks after himself your being a minister wont protect you here where every man wears a knife and a tomahawk and where most of them are desperadoes cut out that soft voice and most of your gentle ways and be a little more like your brother be as kind as you like and preach all you want to but when some of these buckskinlegged frontiermen try to walk all over you as they will take your own part in a way you have never taken it before i had my lesson the first few days out with that wagontrain it was a case of four fights but im all right now  joe i wont run if thats what you mean answered jim with a laugh yes i understand that a new life begins here and i am content if i can find my work in it and remain with you i shall be happy  ah old mose im glad to see you joe cried to the big dog who came nosing round him youve brought this old fellow did you bring the horses  look behind the wagon  with the dog bounding before him joe did as he was directed and there found two horses tethered side by side little wonder that his eyes gleamed with delight one was jetblack the other irongray and in every line the cleanlimbed animals showed the thoroughbred the black threw up his slim head and whinnied with affection clearly shining in his soft dark eyes as he recognized his master  lance old fellow how did i ever leave you murmured joe as he threw his arm over the arched neck mose stood by looking up and wagging his tail in token of happiness at the reunion of the three old friends there were tears in joes eyes when with a last affectionate caress he turned away from his pet  come jim ill take you to mr wells  they stated across the little square while mose went back under the wagon but at a word from joe he bounded after them trotting contentedly at their heels half way to the cabins a big rawboned teamster singing in a drunken voice came staggering toward them evidently he had just left the group of people who had gathered near the indians  i didnt expect to see drunkenness out here said jim in a low tone  theres lots of it i saw that fellow yesterday when he couldnt walk wentz told me he was a bad customer  the teamster his red face bathed in perspiration and his sleeves rolled up showing brown knotty arms lurched toward them as they met he aimed a kick at the dog but mose leaped nimbly aside avoiding the heavy boot he did not growl nor show his teeth but the great white head sank forward a little and the lithe body crouched for a spring  dont touch that dog hell tear your leg off joe cried sharply  say pard cum an hev a drink replied the teamster with a friendly leer  i dont drink answered joe curtly and moved on  the teamster growled something of which only the word parson was intelligible to the brothers joe stopped and looked back his gray eyes seemed to contract they did not flash but shaded and lost their warmth jim saw the change and knowing what it signified took joes arm as he gently urged him away the teamsters shrill voice could be heard until they entered the furtraders cabin  an old man with long white hair flowing from beneath his widebrimmed hat sat near the door holding one of mrs wentzs children on his knee his face was deeplined and serious but kindness shone from his mild blue eyes  mr wells this is my brother james he is a preacher and has come in place of the man you expected from williamsburg  the old minister arose and extended his hand gazing earnestly at the newcomer meanwhile evidently he approved of what he saw in his quick scrutiny of the others face for his lips were wreathed with a smile of welcome  mr downs i am glad to meet you and to know you will go with me i thank god i shall take into the wilderness one who is young enough to carry on the work when my days are done  i will make it my duty to help you in whatsoever way lies in my power answered jim earnestly  we have a great work before us i have heard many scoffers who claim that it is worse than folly to try to teach these fierce savages christianity but i know it can be done and my heart is in the work i have no fear yet i would not conceal from you young man that the danger of going among these hostile indians must be great  i will not hesitate because of that my sympathy is with the redman i have had an opportunity of studying indian nature and believe the race inherently noble he has been driven to make war and i want to help him into other paths  joe left the two ministers talking earnestly and turned toward mrs wentz the furtraders wife was glowing with pleasure she held in her hand several rude trinkets and was explaining to her listener a young woman that the toys were for the children having been brought all the way from williamsburg  kate wheres nell joe asked of the girl  she went on an errand for mrs wentz  kate wells was the opposite of her sister her motions were slow easy and consistent with her large full form her brown eyes and hair contrasted sharply with nells the greatest difference in the sisters lay in that nells face was sparkling and full of the fire of her eager young life while kates was calm like the unruffled surface of a deep lake  thats jim my brother were going with you said joe  are you im glad answered the girl looking at the handsome earnest face of the young minister  your brothers like you for all the world whispered mrs wentz  he does look like you said kate with her slow smile  which means you think or hope that that is all retorted joe laughingly well kate there the resemblance ends thank god for jim  he spoke in a sad bitter tone which caused both women to look at him wonderingly joe had to them ever been full of surprises never until then had they seen evidences of sadness in his face a moments silence ensued mrs wentz gazed lovingly at the children who were playing with the trinkets while kate mused over the young mans remark and began studying his halfaverted face she felt warmly drawn to him by the strange expression in the glance he had given his brother the tenderness in his eyes did not harmonize with much of this wild and reckless boys behavior to kate he had always seemed so bold so cold so different from other men and yet here was proof that master joe loved his brother  the murmured conversation of the two ministers was interrupted by a low cry from outside the cabin a loud coarse laugh followed and then a husky voice  hol on my purty lass  joe took two long strides and was on the doorstep he saw nell struggling violently in the grasp of the halfdrunken teamster  ill jes hev to kiss this lassie fer luck he said in a tone of good humor  at the same instant joe saw three loungers laughing and a fourth the grizzled frontiersman starting forward with a yell  let me go cried nell  just when the teamster had pulled her close to him and was bending his red moist face to hers two brown sinewy hands grasped his neck with an angry clutch deprived thus of breath his mouth opened his tongue protruded his eyes seemed starting from their sockets and his arms beat the air then he was lifted and flung with a crash against the cabin wall falling he lay in a heap on the grass while the blood flowed from a cut on his temple  whats this cried a man authoritatively he had come swiftly up and arrived at the scene where stood the grizzled frontiersman  it was purty handy wentz i couldnt hev did better myself and i was comin for that purpose said the frontiersman leffler was tryin to kiss the lass hes been drunk fer two days that little girls sweetheart kin handle himself some now you take my word on it  ill agree leffs bad when hes drinkin answered the furtrader and to joe he added hes liable to look you up when he comes around  tell him if i am here when he gets sober ill kill him joe cried in a sharp voice his gaze rested once more on the fallen teamster and again an odd contraction of his eyes was noticeable the glance was cutting as if with the flash of cold gray steel nell im sorry i wasnt round sooner he said apologetically as if it was owing to his neglect the affair had happened  as they entered the cabin nell stole a glance at him this was the third time he had injured a man because of her she had on several occasions seen that cold steely glare in his eyes and it had always frightened her it was gone however before they were inside the building he said something which she did not hear distinctly and his calm voice allayed her excitement she had been angry with him but now she realized that her resentment had disappeared he had spoken so kindly after the outburst had he not shown that he considered himself her protector and lover a strange emotion sweet and subtle as the taste of wine thrilled her while a sense of fear because of his strength was mingled with her pride in it any other girl would have been only too glad to have such a champion she would too hereafter for he was a man of whom to be proud  look here nell you havent spoken to me joe cried suddenly seeming to understand that she had not even heard what he said so engrossed had she been with her reflections are you mad with me yet he continued why nell im ini love you  evidently joe thought such fact a sufficient reason for any act on his part his tender tone conquered nell and she turned to him with flushed cheeks and glad eyes  i wasnt angry at all she whispered and then eluding the arm he extended she ran into the other room    chapter iii  joe lounged in the doorway of the cabin thoughtfully contemplating two quiet figures that were lying in the shade of a maple tree one he recognized as the indian with whom jim had spent an earnest hour that morning the red son of the woods was wrapped in slumber he had placed under his head a manyhued homespun shirt which the young preacher had given him but while asleep his head had rolled off this improvised pillow and the bright garment lay free attracting the eye certainly it had led to the train of thought which had found lodgment in joes fertile brain  the other sleeper was a short stout man whom joe had seen several times before this last fellow did not appear to be wellbalanced in his mind and was the butt of the settlers jokes while the children called him loorey he like the indian was sleeping off the effects of the previous nights dissipation  during a few moments joe regarded the recumbent figures with an expression on his face which told that he thought in them were great possibilities for sport with one quick glance around he disappeared within the cabin and when he showed himself at the door surveying the village square with mirthful eyes he held in his hand a small basket of indian design it was made of twisted grass and simply contained several bits of soft chalky stone such as the indians used for painting which collection joe had discovered among the furtraders wares  he glanced around once more and saw that all those in sight were busy with their work he gave the short man a push and chuckled when there was no response other than a lazy grunt joe took the indians gaudy shirt and lifting loorey slipped it around him shoved the latters arms through the sleeves and buttoned it in front he streaked the round face with red and white paint and then dexterously extracting the eagle plume from the indians headdress stuck it in looreys thick shock of hair it was all done in a moment after which joe replaced the basket and went down to the river  several times that morning he had visited the rude wharf where jeff lynn the grizzled old frontiersman busied himself with preparations for the raftjourney down the ohio lynn had been employed to guide the missionarys party to fort henry and as the brothers had acquainted him with their intention of accompanying the travelers he had constructed a raft for them and their horses  joe laughed when he saw the dozen twofoot logs fastened together upon which a rude shack had been erected for shelter this slight protection from sun and storm was all the brothers would have on their long journey  joe noted however that the larger raft had been prepared with some thought for the comfort of the girls the floor of the little hut was raised so that the waves which broke over the logs could not reach it taking a peep into the structure joe was pleased to see that nell and kate would be comfortable even during a storm a buffalo robe and two red blankets gave to the interior a cozy warm look he observed that some of the girls luggage was already on board  whenll we be off he inquired  sunup answered lynn briefly  im glad of that i like to be on the go in the early morning said joe cheerfully  most folks from over eastways aint in a hurry to tackle the river replied lynn eyeing joe sharply  its a beautiful river and id like to sail on it from here to where it ends and then come back to go again joe replied warmly  in a hurry to be agoin ill allow youll see some slim red devils with feathers in their hair slipping among the trees along the bank and mebbe youll hear the ping whichs made when whistlin lead hits perhaps youll want to be back here by termorrer sundown  not i said joe with his short cool laugh  the old frontiersman slowly finished his task of coiling up a rope of wet cowhide and then producing a dirty pipe he took a live ember from the fire and placed it on the bowl he sucked slowly at the pipestem and soon puffed out a great cloud of smoke sitting on a log he deliberately surveyed the robust shoulders and long heavy limbs of the young man with a keen appreciation of their symmetry and strength agility endurance and courage were more to a borderman than all else a newcomer on the frontier was always sizedup with reference to these points and respected in proportion to the measure in which he possessed them  old jeff lynn riverman hunter frontiersman puffed slowly at his pipe while he mused thus to himself mebbe im wrong in takin a likin to this youngster so sudden mebbe its because im fond of his sunnyhaired lass an agin mebbe its because im gettin old an likes young folks bettern i onct did anyway im kinder thinkin if this young feller gits worked out say fer about twenty pounds less hell lick a whole raftload of wildcats  joe walked to and fro on the logs ascertained how the raft was put together and took a pull on the long clumsy steeringoar at length he seated himself beside lynn he was eager to ask questions to know about the rafts the river the forest the indianseverything in connection with this wild life but already he had learned that questioning these frontiersmen is a sure means of closing their lips  ever handle the long rifle asked lynn after a silence  yes answered joe simply  ever shoot anythin the frontiersman questioned when he had taken four or five puffs at his pipe  squirrels  good practice shootin squirrels observed jeff after another silence long enough to allow joe to talk if he was so inclined kin ye hit onesay a hundred yards  yes but not every time in the head returned joe there was an apologetic tone in his answer  another interval followed in which neither spoke jeff was slowly pursuing his line of thought after joes last remark he returned his pipe to his pocket and brought out a tobaccopouch he tore off a large portion of the weed and thrust it into his mouth then he held out the little buckskin sack to joe  hev a chaw he said  to offer tobacco to anyone was absolutely a bordermans guarantee of friendliness toward that person  jeff expectorated half a dozen times each time coming a little nearer the stone he was aiming at some five yards distant possibly this was the bordermans way of oiling up his conversational machinery at all events he commenced to talk  yer brothers goin to preach out here aint he preachin is all right ill allow but im kinder doubtful about preachin to redskins howsumever ive knowed injuns who are good fellows and theres no tellin what are ye goin in ferfarmin  no i wouldnt make a good farmer  jest cum out kinder wild like eh rejoined jeff knowingly  i wanted to come west because i was tired of tame life i love the forest i want to fish and hunt and i think id like toto see indians  i kinder thought so said the old frontiersman nodding his head as though he perfectly understood joes case well lad where youre goin seein injuns aint a matter of choice you has to see em and fight em too weve had bad times for years out here on the border and im thinkin wuss is comin did ye ever hear the name girty  yes hes a renegade  hes a traitor and jim and george girty his brothers are pisin rattlesnake injuns simon girtys

deserted from that thar fort right afore yer eyes theyre now livin among the redskins down fort henry way raisin as much hell fer the settlers as they kin  is fort henry near the indian towns asked joe  theres delawares shawnees and hurons all along the ohio below fort henry  where is the moravian mission located  why lad the village of peace as the injuns call it is right in the midst of that injun country i spect its a matter of a hundred miles below and crosscountry a little from fort henry  the fort must be an important point is it not  wal i guess so its the last place on the river answered lynn with a grim smile theres only a stockade there an a handful of men the injuns hev swarmed down on it time and agin but they hev never burned it only such men as colonel zane his brother jack and wetzel could hev kept that fort standin all these bloody years eb zanes got but a few men yet he kin handle em some an with such scouts as jack zane and wetzel he allus knows whats goin on among the injuns  ive heard of colonel zane he was an officer under lord dunmore the hunters here speak often of jack zane and wetzel what are they  jack zane is a hunter an guide i knowed him well a few years back hes a quiet mild chap but a streak of chainlightnin when hes riled wetzel is an injunkiller some people say as how hes crazy over scalphuntin but i reckon thats not so ive seen him a

ashes there couldnt be any farmin done out there but fer wetzel  what does he look like questioned joe much interested  wetzel stands straight as the oak over thar hed hev to go sideways to git his shoulders in that door but hes as light of foot an fast as a deer an his eyeswhy lad ye kin hardly look into em if you ever see wetzel youll know him to onct  i want to see him joe spoke quickly his eyes lighting with an eager flash he must be a great fighter  is he lew wetzel is the heftiest of em all an we hev some as kin fight out here i was down the river a few years ago and joined a party to go out an hunt up some redskins as had been reported wetzel was with us we soon struck injun sign and then come on to a lot of the pesky varmints we was all fer goin home because we had a small force when we started to go we finds wetzel sittin calmlike on a log we said aint ye goin home and he replied i cum out to find redskins an now as weve found em im not goin to run away an we left him settin thar oh wetzel is a fighter  i hope i shall see him said joe once more the warm light which made him look so boyish still glowing in his face  mebbe yell git to and sure yell see redskins an not tame ones nuther  at this moment the sound of excited voices near the cabins broke in on the conversation joe saw several persons run toward the large cabin and disappear behind it he smiled as he thought perhaps the commotion had been caused by the awakening of the indian brave  rising to his feet joe went toward the cabin and soon saw the cause of the excitement a small crowd of men and women all laughing and talking surrounded the indian brave and the little stout fellow joe heard some one groan and then a deep guttural voice  palefacebig stealugh injun madheap madkill paleface  after elbowing his way into the group joe saw the indian holding loorey with one hand while he poked him on the ribs with the other the captives face was the picture of dismay even the streaks of paint did not hide his look of fear and bewilderment the poor halfwitted fellow was so badly frightened that he could only groan  silvertip scalp paleface ugh growled the savage giving loorey another blow on the side this time he bent over in pain the bystanders were divided in feeling the men laughed while the women murmured sympathetically  thiss not a bit funny muttered joe as he pushed his way nearly to the middle of the crowd then he stretched out a long arm that bare and brawny looked as though it might have been a blacksmiths and grasped the indians sinewy wrist with a force that made him loosen his hold on loorey instantly  i stole the shirtfunjoke said joe scalp me if you want to scalp anyone  the indian looked quickly at the powerful form before him with a twist he slipped his arm from joes grasp  big paleface heap funall squaw play he said scornfully there was a menace in his somber eyes as he turned abruptly and left the group  im afraid youve made an enemy said jake wentz to joe an indian never forgets an insult and thats how he regarded your joke silvertip has been friendly here because he sells us his pelts hes a shawnee chief there he goes through the willows  by this time jim and mr wells mrs wentz and the girls had joined the group they all watched silvertip get into his canoe and paddle away  a bad sign said wentz and then turning to jeff lynn who joined the party at that moment he briefly explained the circumstances  never did like silver hes a crafty redskin an not to be trusted replied jeff  he has turned round and is looking back nell said quickly  so he has observed the furtrader  the indian was now several hundred yards down the swift river and for an instant had ceased paddling the sun shone brightly on his eagle plumes he remained motionless for a moment and even at such a distance the dark changeless face could be discerned he lifted his hand and shook it menacingly  if ye dont hear from that redskin agin jeff lynn dont know nothin calmly said the old frontiersman    chapter iv  as the rafts drifted with the current the voyagers saw the settlers on the landingplace diminish until they had faded from indistinct figures to mere black specks against the green background then came the last wave of a white scarf faintly in the distance and at length the dark outline of the fort was all that remained to their regretful gaze quickly that too disappeared behind the green hill which with its bold front forces the river to take a wide turn  the ohio winding in its course between high wooded bluffs rolled on and on into the wilderness  beautiful as was the everchanging scenery rugged grayfaced cliffs on one side contrasting with greenclad hills on the other there hovered over land and water something more striking than beauty above all hung a still atmosphere of calmnessof loneliness  and this penetrating solitude marred somewhat the pleasure which might have been found in the picturesque scenery and caused the voyagers to whom this country was new to take less interest in the gailyfeathered birds and stealthy animals that were to be seen on the way by the forms of wild life along the banks of the river this strange intruder on their peace was regarded with attention the birds and beasts evinced little fear of the floating rafts the sandhill crane stalking along the shore lifted his long neck as the unfamiliar thing came floating by and then stood still and silent as a statue until the rafts disappeared from view blueherons feeding along the bars saw the unusual spectacle and uttering surprised booms they spread wide wings and lumbered away along the shore the crows circled above the voyagers cawing in not unfriendly excitement smaller birds alighted on the raised poles and severala robin a catbird and a little brown wrenventured with hesitating boldness to peck at the crumbs the girls threw to them deer waded kneedeep in the shallow water and lifting their heads instantly became motionless and absorbed occasionally a buffalo appeared on a level stretch of bank and tossing his huge head seemed inclined to resent the coming of this stranger into his domain  all day the rafts drifted steadily and swiftly down the river presenting to the little party evervarying pictures of densely wooded hills of jutting broken cliffs with scant evergreen growth of long reaches of sandy bar that glistened golden in the sunlight and over all the flight and call of wildfowl the flitting of woodland songsters and now and then the whistle and bellow of the horned watchers in the forest  the intense blue of the vault above began to pale and low down in the west a few fleecy clouds gorgeously golden for a fleeting instant then crimsoncrowned for another shaded and darkened as the setting sun sank behind the hills presently the red rays disappeared a pink glow suffused the heavens and at last as gray twilight stole down over the hilltops the crescent moon peeped above the wooded fringe of the western bluffs  hard an fast she is sang out jeff lynn as he fastened the rope to a tree at the head of a small island all off now and well hev supper thars a fine spring under yon curly birch an i fetched along a leg of deermeat hungry little un  he had worked hard all day steering the rafts yet nell had seen him smiling at her many times during the journey and he had found time before the early start to arrange for her a comfortable seat there was now a solicitude in the frontiersmans voice that touched her  i am famished she replied with her bright smile i am afraid i could eat a whole deer  they all climbed the sandy slope and found themselves on the summit of an oval island with a pretty glade in the middle surrounded by birches bill the second raftsman a stolid silent man at once swung his axe upon a log of driftwood mr wells and jim walked to and fro under the birches and kate and nell sat on the grass watching with great interest the old helmsman as he came up from the river his brown hands and face shining from the scrubbing he had given them soon he had a fire cheerfully blazing and after laying out the few utensils he addressed himself to joe  ill tell ye right here lad good venison kin be spoiled by bad cuttin and cookin youre slicin it too thick seethar now salt good an keep outen the flame on the red coals is best  with a sharpened stick jeff held the thin slices over the fire for a few moments then he laid them aside on some clean whiteoak chips bills axe had provided the simple meal of meat bread and afterward a drink of the cold spring water was keenly relished by the hungry voyagers when it had been eaten jeff threw a log on the fire and remarked  seein as how we wont be in redskin territory fer awhile yit we kin hev a fire ill allow yell all be chilly and damp from rivermist afore long so toast yerselves good  how far have we come today inquired mr wells his mind always intent on reaching the scene of his cherished undertaking  bout thirtyodd mile i reckon not much on a trip thets sartin but well pick up termorrer weve some quicker water an the rafts hev to go separate  how quiet exclaimed kate suddenly breaking the silence that followed the frontiersmans answer  beautiful impetuously said nell looking up at joe a quick flash from his gray eyes answered her he did not speak indeed he had said little to her since the start but his glance showed her how glad he was that she felt the sweetness and content of this wild land  i was never in a wilderness before broke in the earnest voice of the young minister i feel an almost overpowering sense of loneliness i want to get near to you all i feel lost yet it is grand sublime  here is the promised landthe fruitful lifenature as it was created by god replied the old minister impressively  tell us a story said nell to the old frontiersman as he once more joined the circle round the fire  so little un ye want a story queried jeff taking up a live coal and placing it in the bowl of his pipe he took off his coonskin cap and carefully laid it aside his weatherbeaten face beamed in answer to the girls request he drew a long and audible pull at his black pipe and send forth slowly a cloud of white smoke deliberately poking the fire with a stick as if stirring into life dead embers of the past he sucked again at his pipe and emitted a great puff of smoke that completely enveloped the grizzled head from out that white cloud came his drawling voice  yeve seen thet big curly birch over tharthet un as bends kind of sorrowful like wal it used to stand straight an proud ive knowed thet tree all the years ive navigated this river an it seems natural like to me thet it now droops dyin fer it shades the grave of as young an sweet an purty a lass

herthet thar wusnt a blame man of us who wouldnt hev died to grant her prayer which wus that she could live to onct more see her lover  there was a long silence during which the old frontiersman sat gazing into the fire with sad eyes  we couldnt do nuthin an we buried her thar under thet birch where she smiled her last sad sweet smile an died ever since then the river has been eatn away at this island its only half as big as it wus onct an another flood will take away this sandbar these few birchesan millys grave  the old frontiersmans story affected all his listeners the elder minister bowed his head and prayed that no such fate might overtake his nieces the young minister looked again as he had many times that day at nells winsome face the girls cast grave glances at the drooping birch and their bright tears glistened in the fireglow once more joes eyes glinted with that steely flash and as he gazed out over the wide darkening expanse of water his face grew cold and rigid  ill allow i might hev told a more cheerful story an ill do so next time but i wanted ye all particular the lasses to know somethin of the kind of country yere goin into the frontier needs women but jist yit it deals hard with them an jim girty with more of his kind aint dead yit  why dont some one kill him was joes sharp question  easier said than done lad jim girty is a white traitor but hes a cunnin an fierce redskin in his ways an life he knows the woods as a crow does an keeps outer sight cept when hes least expected then agin hes got simon girty his brother an almost the whole redskin tribe behind him injuns stick close to a white man that has turned aginst his own people an jim girty haint ever been ketched howsumever i heard last trip thet hed been tryin some of his tricks round fort henry an thet wetzel is on his trail wal if its so thet lew wetzel is arter him i wouldnt give a pinch o powder fer the whiteredskins chances of a long life  no one spoke and jeff after knocking the ashes from his pipe went down to the raft returning shortly afterward with his blanket this he laid down and rolled himself in it presently from under his coonskin cap came the words  wal ive turned in an i advise ye all to do the same  all save joe and nell acted on jeffs suggestion for a long time the young couple sat close together on the bank gazing at the moonlight on the river  the night was perfect a cool wind fanned the dying embers of the fire and softly stirred the leaves earlier in the evening a single frog had voiced his protest against the loneliness but now his dismal croak was no longer heard a snipe belated in his feeding ran along the sandy shore uttering his tweettweet and his little cry breaking in so softly on the silence seemed only to make more deeply felt the great vast stillness of the night  joes arm was around nell she had demurred at first but he gave no heed to her slight resistance and finally her head rested against his shoulder there was no need of words  joe had a pleasurable sense of her nearness and there was a delight in the fragrance of her hair as it waved against his cheek but just then love was not uppermost in his mind all day he had been silent under the force of an emotion which he could not analyze some power some feeling in which the thought of nell had no share was drawing him with irresistible strength nell had just begun to surrender to him in the sweetness of her passion and yet even with that knowledge knocking reproachfully at his heart he could not help being absorbed in the shimmering water in the dark reflection of the trees the gloom and shadow of the forest  presently he felt her form relax in his arms then her soft regular breathing told him she had fallen asleep and he laughed low to himself how she would pout on the morrow when he teased her about it then realizing that she was tired with her long days journey he reproached himself for keeping her from the needed rest and instantly decided to carry her to the raft yet such was the novelty of the situation that he yielded to its charm and did not go at once the moonlight found bright threads in her wavy hair it shone caressingly on her quiet face and tried to steal under the downcast lashes  joe made a movement to rise with her when she muttered indistinctly as if speaking to some one he remembered then she had once told him that she talked in her sleep and how greatly it annoyed her he might hear something more with which to tease her so he listened  yesunclei will gokate we mustgo    another interval of silence then more murmurings he distinguished his own name and presently she called clearly as if answering some inward questioner  ilove himyesi love joehe has mastered me yet i wish he werelike jimjim who looked at mesowith his deep eyesand i     joe lifted her as if she were a baby and carrying her down to the raft gently laid her by her sleeping sister  the innocent words which he should not have heard were like a blow what she would never have acknowledged in her waking hours had been revealed in her dreams he recalled the glance of jims eyes as it had rested on nell many times that day and now these things were most significant  he found at the end of the island a great mossy stone on this he climbed and sat where the moonlight streamed upon him gradually that cold bitterness died out from his face as it passed from his heart and once more he became engrossed in the silver sheen on the water the lapping of the waves on the pebbly beach and in that speaking mysterious silence of the woods                                  when the first faint rays of red streaked over the eastern hilltops and the river mist arose from the water in a vapory cloud jeff lynn rolled out of his blanket stretched his long limbs and gave a hearty call to the morning his cheerful welcome awakened all the voyagers except joe who had spent the night in watching and the early morning in fishing  wal ill be darned ejaculated jeff as he saw joe up afore me an ketched a string of fish  what are they asked joe holding up several bronzebacked fish  bassblack bass an thet big feller is a lammin hefty un howd ye ketch em  i fished for them  wal so it pears growled jeff once more reluctantly yielding to his admiration for the lad howd ye wake up so early  i stayed up all night i saw three deer swim from the mainland but nothing else came around  try yer hand at cleanin em fer breakfast continued jeff beginning to busy himself with preparations for that meal wal wal if he aint surprisin hell do somethin out here on the frontier sure as im a born sinner he muttered to himself wagging his head in his quaint manner  breakfast over jeff transferred the horses to the smaller raft which he had cut loose from his own and giving a few directions to bill started downstream with mr wells and the girls  the rafts remained close together for a while but as the current quickened and was more skillfully taken advantage of by jeff the larger raft gained considerable headway gradually widening the gap between the two  all day they drifted from time to time joe and jim waved their hands to the girls but the greater portion of their attention was given to quieting the horses mose joes big white dog retired in disgust to the hut where he watched and dozed by turns he did not fancy this kind of voyaging bill strained his sturdy arms all day on the steeringoar  about the middle of the afternoon joe observed that the hills grew more rugged and precipitous and the river ran faster he kept a constant lookout for the wall of rock which marked the point of danger when the sun had disappeared behind the hills he saw ahead a gray rock protruding from the green foliage it was ponderous overhanging and seemed to frown down on the river this was shawnee rock joe looked long at the cliff and wondered if there was now an indian scout hidden behind the pines that skirted the edge prominent on the top of the bluff a large dead tree projected its hoary twisted branches  bill evidently saw the landmark for he stopped in his monotonous walk to and fro across the raft and pushing his oar amidships he looked ahead for the other raft the figure of the tall frontiersman could be plainly seen as he labored at the helm  the raft disappeared round a bend and as it did so joe saw a white scarf waved by nell  bill worked the clumsy craft over toward the right shore where the current was more rapid he pushed with all his strength and when the oar had reached its widest sweep he lifted it and ran back across the raft for another push joe scanned the river ahead he saw no rapids only rougher water whirling over some rocks they were where the channel narrowed and ran close to the righthand bank under a willowflanked ledge was a sandbar to joe there seemed nothing hazardous in drifting through this pass  bad place ahead said bill observing joes survey of the river  it doesnt look so replied joe  a raft aint a boat we could pole a boat you has to hev water to float logs an the rivers run out considerable im only afeerd fer the horses if we hit or drag they might plunge around a bit  when the raft passed into the head of the bend it struck the rocks several times but finally gained the channel safely and everything seemed propitious for an easy passage  but greatly to bills surprise the wide craft was caught directly in the channel and swung round so that the steeringoar pointed toward the opposite shore the water roared a foot deep over the logs  hold hard on the horses yelled bill somethins wrong i never seen a snag here  the straining mass of logs insecurely fastened together rolled and then pitched loose again but the short delay had been fatal to the steering apparatus  joe would have found keen enjoyment in the situation had it not been for his horse lance the thoroughbred was difficult to hold as bill was making strenuous efforts to get in a lucky stroke of the oar he failed to see a long length of grapevine floating like a brown snake of the water below in the excitement they heeded not the barking of mose nor did they see the grapevine straighten and become taut just as they drifted upon it but they felt the raft strike and hold on some submerged object it creaked and groaned and the foamy water surged gurgling between the logs  jims mare snorted with terror and rearing high pulled her halter loose and plunged into the river but jim still held her at risk of being drawn overboard  let go shell drag you in yelled joe grasping him with his free hand lance trembled violently and strained at the rope which his master held with a strong grip  crack  the stinging report of a rifle rang out above the splashing of the water  without a cry bills grasp on the oar loosened he fell over it limply his head striking the almost submerged log a darkred fluid colored the water then his body slipped over the oar and into the river where it sank  my god shot cried jim in horrified tones  he saw a puff of white smoke rising above the willows then the branches parted revealing the dark forms of several indian warriors from the rifle in the foremost savages hand a slight veil of smoke rose with the leap of a panther the redskin sprang from the strip of sand to the raft  hold jim drop that ax were caught cried joe  its that indian from the fort gasped jim  the stalwart warrior was indeed silvertip but how changed stripped of the blanket he had worn at the settlement now standing naked but for his buckskin breechcloth with his perfectly proportioned form disclosed in all its sinewy beauty and on his swarthy evil face an expression of savage scorn he surely looked a warrior and a chief  he drew his tomahawk and flashed a dark glance at joe for a moment he steadily regarded the young man but if he expected to see fear in the latters face he was mistaken for the look was returned coolly  paleface steal shirt he said in his deep voice fool paleface playsilvertip no forget    chapter v  silvertip turned to his braves and giving a brief command sprang from the raft the warriors closed in around the brothers two grasping each by the arms and the remaining indian taking care of the horse the captives were then led ashore where silvertip awaited them  when the horse was clear of the raft which task necessitated considerable labor on the part of the indians the chief seized the grapevine that was now plainly in sight and severed it with one blow of his tomahawk the raft dashed forward with a lurch and drifted downstream  in the clear water joe could see the cunning trap which had caused the death of bill and insured the captivity of himself and his brother the crafty savages had trimmed a sixinch sapling and anchored it under the water they weighted the heavy end leaving the other pointing upstream to this last had been tied the grapevine when the drifting raft reached the sapling the indians concealed in the willows pulled hard on the improvised rope the end of the sapling stuck up like a hook and the aft was caught and held the killing of the helmsman showed the indians foresight even had the raft drifted on downstream the brothers would have been helpless on a craft they could not manage after all joe thought he had not been so far wrong when he half fancied that an indian lay behind shawnee rock and he marveled at this clever trick which had so easily effected their capture  but he had little time to look around at the scene of action there was a moment only in which to study the river to learn if the unfortunate raftsmans body had appeared it was not to be seen the river ran swiftly and hid all evidence of the tragedy under its smooth surface when the brave who had gone back to the raft for the goods joined his companion the two hurried joe up the bank after the others  once upon level ground joe saw before him an open forest on the border of this the indians stopped long enough to bind the prisoners wrists with thongs of deerhide while two of the braves performed this office silvertip leaned against a tree and took no notice of the brothers when they were thus securely tied one of their captors addressed the chief who at once led the way westward through the forest the savages followed in single file with joe and jim in the middle of the line the last indian tried to mount lance but the thoroughbred would have none of him and after several efforts the savage was compelled to desist mose trotted reluctantly along behind the horse  although the chief preserved a dignified mien his braves were disposed to be gay they were in high glee over their feat of capturing the palefaces and kept up an incessant jabbering one indian who walked directly behind joe continually prodded him with the stock of a rifle and whenever joe turned the brawny redskin grinned as he grunted ugh joe observed that this huge savage had a broad face of rather a lighter shade of red than his companions perhaps he intended those rifleprods in friendliness for although they certainly amused him he would allow no one else to touch joe but it would have been more pleasing had he shown his friendship in a gentle manner this indian carried joes pack much to his own delight especially as his companions evinced an envious curiosity the big fellow would not however allow them to touch it  hes a cheerful brute remarked joe to jim  ugh grunted the big indian jamming joe with his riflestock  joe took heed to the warning and spoke no more he gave all his attention to the course over which he was being taken here was his first opportunity to learn something of indians and their woodcraft it occurred to him that his captors would not have been so gay and careless had they not believed themselves safe from pursuit and he concluded they were leisurely conducting him to one of the indian towns he watched the supple figure before him wondering at the quick step light as the fall of a leaf and tried to walk as softly he found however that where the indian readily avoided the sticks and brush he was unable to move without snapping twigs now and then he would look up and study the lay of the land ahead and as he came nearer to certain rocks and trees he scrutinized them closely in order to remember their shape and general appearance he believed he was blazing out in his mind this woodland trail so that should fortune favor him and he contrive to escape he would be able to find his way back to the river also he was enjoying the wild scenery  this forest would have appeared beautiful even to one indifferent to such charms and joe was far from that every moment he felt steal stronger over him a subtle influence which he could not define half unconsciously he tried to analyze it but it baffled him he could no more explain what fascinated him than he could understand what caused the melancholy quiet which hung over the glades and hollows he had pictured a real forest so differently from this here was a long lane paved with springy moss and fenced by brightgreen sassafras there a secluded dale dotted with paleblue blossoms over which the giant cottonwoods leaned their heads jealously guarding the delicate flowers from the sun beech trees growing close in clanny groups spread their straight limbs gracefully the white birches gleamed like silver wherever a stray sunbeam stole through the foliage and the oaks monarchs of the forest rose over all dark rugged and kingly  joe soon understood why the party traveled through such open forest the chief seeming hardly to deviate from his direct course kept clear of broken ground matted thickets and tangled windfalls joe got a glimpse of dark ravines and heard the music of tumbling waters he saw gray cliffs grown over with vines and full of holes and crevices steep ridges covered with dense patches of briar and hazel rising in the way yet the shawnee always found an easy path  the sun went down behind the foliage in the west and shadows appeared low in the glens then the trees faded into an indistinct mass a purple shade settled down over the forest and night brought the party to a halt  the indians selected a sheltered spot under the lee of a knoll at the base of which ran a little brook here in this inclosed space were the remains of a campfire evidently the indians had halted there that same day for the logs still smouldered while one brave fanned the embers another took from a neighboring branch a haunch of deer meat a blaze was soon coaxed from the dull coals more fuel was added and presently a cheerful fire shone on the circle of dusky forms  it was a picture which joe had seen in many a boyish dream now that he was a part of it he did not dwell on the hopelessness of the situation nor of the hostile chief whose enmity he had incurred almost it seemed he was glad of this chance to watch the indians and listen to them he had been kept apart from jim and it appeared to joe that their captors treated his brother with a contempt which they did not show him silvertip had no doubt informed them that jim had been on his way to teach the indians of the white mans god  jim sat with drooping head his face was sad and evidently he took the most disheartening view of his capture when he had eaten the slice of venison given him he lay down with his back to the fire  silvertip in these surroundings showed his real character he had appeared friendly in the settlement but now he was the relentless savage a son of the wilds free as an eagle his dignity as a chief kept him aloof from his braves he had taken no notice of the prisoners since the capture he remained silent steadily regarding the fire with his somber eyes at length glancing at the big indian he motioned toward the prisoners and with a single word stretched himself on the leaves  joe noted the same changelessness of expression in the other dark faces as he had seen in silvertips it struck him forcibly when they spoke in their soft guttural tones or burst into a low not unmusical laughter or sat gazing stolidly into the fire their faces seemed always the same inscrutable like the depths of the forest now hidden in night one thing joe felt rather than sawthese savages were fierce and untamable he was sorry for jim because as he believed it would be as easy to teach the panther gentleness toward his prey as to instill into one of these wild creatures a belief in christ  the braves manifested keen pleasure in anticipation as to what they would get out of the pack which the indian now opened time and again the big brave placed his broad hand on the shoulder of a comrade indian and pushed him backward  finally the pack was opened it contained a few articles of wearing apparel a pair of boots and a pipe and pouch of tobacco the big indian kept the latter articles grunting with satisfaction and threw the boots and clothes to the others immediately there was a scramble one brave after a struggle with another got possession of both boots he at once slipped off his moccasins and drew on the white mans footcoverings he strutted around in them a few moments but his proud manner soon changed to disgust  cowhide had none of the soft yielding qualities of buckskin and hurt the indians feet sitting down he pulled one off not without difficulty for the boots were wet but he could not remove the other he hesitated a moment being aware of the subdued merriment of his comrades and then held up his foot to the nearest one this chanced to be the big indian who evidently had a keen sense of humor taking hold of the boot with both hands he dragged the luckless brave entirely around the campfire the fun however was not to be all onesided the big indian gave a more strenuous pull and the boot came off suddenly unprepared for this he lost his balance and fell down the bank almost into the creek he held on to the boot nevertheless and getting up threw it into the fire  the braves quieted down after that and soon lapsed into slumber leaving the big fellow to whom the chief had addressed his brief command acting as guard observing joe watching him as he puffed on his new pipe he grinned and spoke in broken english that was intelligible and much of a surprise to the young man  palefacetobacheap good  then seeing that joe made no effort to follow his brothers initiative for jim was fast asleep he pointed to the recumbent figures and spoke again  ugh paleface sleepinjun wigwamsnear setting sun  on the following morning joe was awakened by the pain in his legs which had been bound all night he was glad when the bonds were cut and the party took up its westward march  the indians though somewhat quieter displayed the same carelessness they did not hurry nor use particular caution but selected the most open paths through the forest they even halted while one of their number crept up on a herd of browsing deer about noon the leader stopped to drink from a spring his braves followed suit and permitted the white prisoners to quench their thirst  when they were about to start again the single note of a bird far away in the woods sounded clearly on the quiet air joe would not have given heed to it had he been less attentive he instantly associated this peculiar birdnote with the sudden stiffening of silvertips body and his attitude of intense listening low exclamations came from the braves as they bent to catch the lightest sound presently above the murmur of the gentle fall of water over the stones rose that musical note once more it was made by a bird joe thought and yet judged by the actions of the indians how potent with meaning beyond that of the simple melody of the woodland songster he turned half expecting to see somewhere in the treetops the bird which had wrought so sudden a change in his captors as he did so from close at hand came the same call now louder but identical with the one that had deceived him it was an answering signal and had been given by silvertip  it flashed into joes mind that other savages were in the forest they had run across the shawnees trail and were thus communicating with them soon dark figures could be discerned against the patches of green thicket they came nearer and nearer and now entered the open glade where silvertip stood with his warriors  joe counted twelve and noted that they differed from his captors he had only time to see that this difference consisted in the headdress and in the color and quantity of paint on their bodies when his gaze was attracted and riveted to the foremost figures  the first was that of a very tall and stately chief toward whom silvertip now advanced with every show of respect in this indians commanding stature in his reddishbronze face stern and powerful there were readable the characteristics of a king in his deepset eyes gleaming from under a ponderous brow in his mastifflike jaw in every feature of his haughty face were visible all the high intelligence the consciousness of past valor and the power and authority that denote a great chieftain  the second figure was equally striking for the remarkable contrast it afforded to the chiefs despite the gaudy garments the paint the fringed and beaded buckskin legginsall the indian accouterments and garments which bedecked this person he would have been known anywhere as a white man his skin was burned to a dark bronze but it had not the red tinge which characterizes the indian this white man had indeed a strange physiognomy the forehead was narrow and sloped backward from the brow denoting animal instincts the eyes were close together yellowishbrown in color and had a peculiar vibrating movement as though they were hung on a pivot like a compassneedle the nose was long and hooked and the mouth set in a thin cruel line there was in the mans aspect an extraordinary combination of ignorance vanity cunning and ferocity  while the two chiefs held a short consultation this savageappearing white man addressed the brothers  whore you an where you goin he asked gruffly confronting jim  my name is downs i am a preacher and was on my way to the moravian mission to preach to the indians you are a white man will you help us  if jim expected the information would please his interrogator he was mistaken  so youre one of em yes ill do suthin fer you when i git back from this hunt ill cut your heart out chop it up an feed it to the buzzards he said fiercely concluding his threat by striking jim a cruel blow on the head  joe paled deathly white at this cowardly action and his eyes as they met the gaze of the ruffian contracted with their characteristic steely glow as if some powerful force within the depths of his being were at white heat and only this pale flash came to the surface  you aint a preacher questioned the man meeting something in joes glance that had been absent from jims  joe made no answer and regarded questioner steadily  ever see me afore ever hear of jim girty he asked boastfully  before you spoke i knew you were girty answered joe quietly  how dyou know aint you afeared  of what  meme  joe laughed in the renegades face  howd you knew me growled girty ill see thet you hev cause to remember me after this  i figured there was only one socalled white man in these woods who is coward enough to strike a man whose hands are tied  boy yere too free with your tongue ill shet off your wind girtys hand was raised but it never reached joes neck  the big indian had an hour or more previous cut joes bonds but he still retained the thong which was left attached to joes left wrist this allowed the young man free use of his right arm which badly swollen or not he brought into quick action  when the renegade reached toward him joe knocked up the hand and instead of striking he grasped the hooked nose with all the powerful grip of his fingers girty uttered a frightful curse he writhed with pain but could not free himself from the viselike clutch he drew his tomahawk and with a scream aimed a vicious blow at joe he missed his aim however for silvertip had intervened and turned the course of the keen hatchet but the weapon struck joe a glancing blow inflicting a painful though not dangerous wound  the renegades nose was skinned and bleeding profusely he was frantic with fury and tried to get at joe but silvertip remained in front of his captive until some of the braves led girty into the forest where the tall chief had already disappeared  the nosepulling incident added to the gayety of the shawnees who evidently were pleased with girtys discomfiture they jabbered among themselves and nodded approvingly at joe until a few words spoken by silvertip produced a sudden change  what the words were joe could not understand but to him they sounded like french he smiled at the absurdity of imagining he had heard a savage speak a foreign language at any rate whatever had been said was trenchant with meaning the indians changed from gay to grave they picked up their weapons and looked keenly on every side the big indian at once retied joe and then all crowded round the chief  did you hear what silvertip said and did you notice the effect it had whispered jim taking advantage of the moment  it sounded like french but of course it wasnt replied joe  it was french le vent de la mort  by jove thats it what does it mean asked joe who was not a scholar  the wind of death  thats english but i cant apply it here can you  no doubt it is some indian omen  the hurried consultation over silvertip tied joes horse and dog to the trees and once more led the way this time he avoided the open forest and kept on low ground for a long time he traveled in the bed of the brook wading when the water was shallow and always stepping where there was the least possibility of leaving a footprint not a word was spoken if either of the brothers made the lightest splash in the water or tumbled a stone into the brook the indian behind rapped him on the head with a tomahawk handle  at certain places indicated by the care which silvertip exercised in walking the indian in front of the captives turned and pointed where they were to step they were hiding the trail silvertip hurried them over the stony places went more slowly through the water and picked his way carefully over the soft ground it became necessary to cross at times he stopped remaining motionless many seconds  this vigilance continued all the afternoon the sun sank twilight spread its gray mantle and soon black night enveloped the forest the indians halted but made no fire they sat close together on a stony ridge silent and watchful  joe pondered deeply over this behavior did the shawnees fear pursuit what had that indian chief told silvertip to joe it seemed that they acted as if believing foes were on all sides though they hid their tracks it was apparently not the fear of pursuit alone which made them cautious  joe reviewed the afternoons march and dwelt upon the possible meaning of the catlike steps the careful brushing aside of branches the roving eyes suspicious and gloomy the eager watchfulness of the advance as well as to the rear and always the strained effort to listen all of which gave him the impression of some grave unseen danger  and now as he lay on the hard ground nearly exhausted by the long march and suffering from the throbbing wound his courage lessened somewhat and he shivered with dread the quiet and gloom of the forest these fierce wild creatures free in the heart of their own wilderness yet menaced by a foe and that strange french phrase which kept recurring in his mindall had the effect of conjuring up giant shadows in joes fanciful mind during all his life until this moment he had never feared anything now he was afraid of the darkness the spectral trees spread long arms overhead and phantom forms stalked abroad somewhere out in that dense gloom stirred this mysterious foethe wind of death  nevertheless he finally slept in the dullgray light of early morning the indians once more took up the line of march toward the west they marched all that day and at dark halted to eat and rest silvertip and another indian stood watch  some time before morning joe suddenly awoke the night was dark yet it was lighter than when he had fallen asleep a pale crescent moon shown dimly through the murky clouds there was neither movement of the air nor the chirp of an insect absolute silence prevailed  joe saw the indian guard leaning against a tree asleep silvertip was gone the captive raised his head and looked around for the chief there were only four indians left three on the ground and one against the tree  he saw something shining near him he looked more closely and made out the object to be an eagle plume silvertip had worn in his headdress it lay on the ground near the tree joe made some slight noise which awakened the guard the indian never moved a muscle but his eyes roved everywhere he too noticed the absence of the chief  at this moment from out of the depths of the woods came a swelling sigh like the moan of the night wind it rose and died away leaving the silence apparently all the deeper  a shudder ran over joes frame fascinated he watched the guard the indian uttered a low gasp his eyes started and glared wildly he rose very slowly to his full height and stood waiting listening the dark hand which held the tomahawk trembled so that little glints of moonlight glanced from the bright steel  from far back in the forestdeeps came that same low moaning  ummmmwooooo  it rose from a faint murmur and swelled to a deep moan soft but clear and ended in a wail like that of a lost soul  the break it made in that dead silence was awful joes blood seemed to have curdled and frozen a cold sweat oozed from his skin and it was as if a clammy hand clutched at his heart he tried to persuade himself that the fear displayed by the savage was only superstition and that that moan was but the sigh of the night wind  the indian sentinel stood as if paralyzed an instant after that weird cry and then swift as a flash and as noiseless he was gone into the gloomy forest he had fled without awakening his companions  once more the moaning cry arose and swelled mournfully on the still night air it was close at hand  the wind of death whispered joe  he was shaken and unnerved by the events of the past two days and dazed from his wound his strength deserted him and he lost consciousness    chapter vi  one evening several day previous to the capture of the brothers a solitary hunter stopped before a deserted log cabin which stood on the bank of a stream fifty miles or more inland from the ohio river it was rapidly growing dark a fine drizzling rain had set in and a rising wind gave promise of a stormy night  although the hunter seemed familiar with his surroundings he moved cautiously and hesitated as if debating whether he should seek the protection of this lonely hut or remain all night under dripping trees feeling of his hunting frock he found that it was damp and slippery this fact evidently decided him in favor of the cabin for he stooped his tall figure and went in it was pitch dark inside but having been there before the absence of a light did not trouble him he readily found the ladder leading to the loft ascended it and lay down to sleep  during the night a noise awakened him for a moment he heard nothing except the fall of the rain then came the hum of voices followed by the soft tread of moccasined feet he knew there was an indian town ten miles across the country and believed some warriors belated on a hunting trip had sought the cabin for shelter  the hunter lay perfectly quiet awaiting developments if the indians had flint and steel and struck a light he was almost certain to be discovered he listened to their low conversation and understood from the language that they were delawares  a moment later he heard the rustling of leaves and twigs accompanied by the metallic click of steel against some hard substance the noise was repeated and then followed by a hissing sound which he knew to be the burning of a powder on a piece of dry wood after which rays of light filtered through cracks of the unstable floor of the loft  the man placed his eye to one of these crevices and counted eleven indians all young braves with the exception of the chief the indians had been hunting they had haunches of deer and buffalo tongues together with several packs of hides some of them busied themselves drying their weapons others sat down listlessly plainly showing their weariness and two worked over the smouldering fire the damp leaves and twigs burned faintly yet there was enough to cause the hunter fear that he might be discovered he believed he had not much to worry about from the young braves but the hawkeyed chief was dangerous  and he was right presently the stalwart chief heard or saw a drop of water fall from the loft it came from the hunters wet coat almost any one save an indian scout would have fancied this came from the roof as the chiefs gaze roamed everywhere over the interior of the cabin his expression was plainly distrustful his eye searched the wet clay floor but hardly could have discovered anything there because the hunters moccasined tracks had been obliterated by the footprints of the indians the chiefs suspicions seemed to be allayed  but in truth this chief with the wonderful sagacity natural to indians had observed matters which totally escaped the young braves and like a wily old fox he waited to see which cub would prove the keenest not one of them however noted anything unusual they sat around the fire ate their meat and parched corn and chatted volubly  the chief arose and walking to the ladder ran his hand along one of the rungs  ugh he exclaimed  instantly he was surrounded by ten eager brighteyed braves he extended his open palm it was smeared with wet clay like that under his feet simultaneously with their muttered exclamations the braves grasped their weapons they knew there was a foe above them it was a paleface for an indian would have revealed himself  the hunter seeing he was discovered acted with the unerring judgment and lightninglike rapidity of one long accustomed to perilous situations drawing his tomahawk and noiselessly stepping to the hole in the loft he leaped into the midst of the astounded indians  rising from the floor like the rebound of a rubber ball his long arm with the glittering hatchet made a wide sweep and the young braves scattered like frightened sheep  he made a dash for the door and incredible as it may seem his movements were so quick he would have escaped from their very midst without a scratch but for one unforeseen circumstance the clay floor was wet and slippery his feet were hardly in motion before they slipped from under him and he fell headlong  with loud yells of triumph the band jumped upon him there was a convulsive heaving motion of the struggling mass one frightful cry of agony and then hoarse commands three of the braves ran to their packs from which they took cords of buckskin so exceedingly powerful was the hunter that six indians were required to hold him while the others tied his hands and feet then with grunts and chuckles of satisfaction they threw him into a corner of the cabin  two of the braves had been hurt in the brief struggle one having a badly wrenched shoulder and the other a broken arm so much for the hunters power in that single moment of action  the loft was searched and found to be empty then the excitement died away and the braves settled themselves down for the night the injured ones bore their hurts with characteristic stoicism if they did not sleep both remained quiet and not a sigh escaped them  the wind changed during the night the storm abated and when daylight came the sky was cloudless the first rays of the sun shone in the open door lighting up the interior of the cabin  a sleepy indian who had acted as guard stretched his limbs and yawned he looked for the prisoner and saw him sitting up in the corner one arm was free and the other nearly so he had almost untied the thongs which bound him a few moments more and he would have been free  ugh exclaimed the young brave awakening his chief and pointing to the hunter  the chief glanced at his prisoner then looked more closely and with one spring was on his feet a drawn tomahawk in his hand a short shrill yell issued from his lips roused by that clarion call the young braves jumped up trembling in eager excitement the chiefs summons had been the sharp warcry of the delawares  he manifested as intense emotion as could possibly have been betrayed by a matured experienced chieftain and pointing to the hunter he spoke a single word                                  at noonday the indians entered the fields of corn which marked the outskirts of the delaware encampment  kollookollookolloo  the long signal heralding the return of the party with important news pealed throughout the quiet valley and scarcely had the echoes died away when from the village came answering shouts  once beyond the aisles of waving corn the hunter saw over the shoulders of his captors the home of the redmen a grassy plain sloping gradually from the woody hill to a winding stream was brightly beautiful with chestnut trees and long wellformed lines of lodges manyhued blankets hung fluttering in the sun and rising lazily were curling columns of blue smoke the scene was picturesque and reposeful the vivid hues suggesting the indians love of color and ornament the absence of life and stir his languorous habit of sleeping away the hot noonday hours  the loud whoops however changed the quiet encampment into a scene of animation children ran from the wigwams maidens and braves dashed here and there squaws awakened from their slumber and many a doughty warrior rose from his rest in the shade french fur traders came curiously from their lodges and renegades hurriedly left their blankets roused to instant action by the wellknown summons  the hunter led down the lane toward the approaching crowd presented a calm and fearless demeanor when the indians surrounded him one prolonged furious yell rent the air and then followed an extraordinary demonstration of fierce delight the young braves staccato yell the maidens scream the old squaws screech and the deep warcry of the warriors intermingled in a fearful discordance  often had this hunter heard the name which the indian called him he had been there before a prisoner he had run the gauntlet down the lane he had been bound to a stake in front of the lodge where his captors were now leading him he knew the chief wingenund sachem of the delawares since that time now five years ago when wingenund had tortured him they had been bitterest foes  if the hunter heard the hoarse cries or the words hissed into his ears if he saw the fiery glances of hatred and sudden giving way to ungovernable rage unusual to the indian nature if he felt in their fierce exultation the hopelessness of succor or mercy he gave not the slightest sign  atelang atelang atelang rang out the strange indian name  the french traders like real savages ran along with the procession their feathers waving their paint shining their faces expressive of as much excitement as the indians as they cried aloud in their native tongue  le vent de la mort le vent de la mort la vent de la mort  the hunter while yet some paces distant saw the lofty figure of the chieftain standing in front of his principal men well he knew them all there were the crafty pipe and his savage comrade the half king there was shingiss who wore on his forehead a scarthe mark of the hunters bullet there were kotoxen the lynx and misseppa the source and winstonah the warcloud chiefs of sagacity and renown three renegades completed the circle and these three traitors represented a power which had for ten years left an awful bloody trail over the country simon girty the socalled white indian with his keen authoritative face turned expectantly elliott the tory deserter from fort pitt a wiry spiderlike little man and last the gaunt and gaudily arrayed form of the demon of the frontierjim girty  the procession halted before this group and two brawny braves pushed the hunter forward simon girtys face betrayed satisfaction elliotts shifty eyes snapped and the dark repulsive face of the other girty exhibited an exultant joy these desperadoes had feared this hunter  wingenund with a majestic wave of his arm silenced the yelling horde of frenzied savages and stepped before the captive  the deadly foes were once again face to face the chieftains lofty figure and dark sleek head now bare of plumes towered over the other indians but he was not obliged to lower his gaze in order to look straight into the hunters eyes  verily this hunter merited the respect which shone in the great chieftains glance like a mountainash he stood straight and strong his magnificent frame tapering wedgelike from his broad shoulders the bulging line of his thick neck the deep chest the knotty contour of his bared forearm and the full curves of his legsall denoted a wonderful muscular development  the power expressed in this mans body seemed intensified in his features his face was white and cold his jaw square and set his coalblack eyes glittered with almost a superhuman fire and his hair darker than the wing of a crow fell far below his shoulders matted and tangled as it was still it hung to his waist and had it been combed out must have reached his knees  one long moment wingenund stood facing his foe and then over the multitude and through the valley rolled his sonorous voice  deathwind dies at dawn  the hunter was tied to a tree and left in view of the indian populace the children ran fearfully by the braves gazed long at the great foe of their race the warriors passed in gloomy silence the savages tricks of torture all their diabolical ingenuity of inflicting pain was suppressed awaiting the hour of sunrise when this hated long knife was to die  only one person offered an insult to the prisoner he was a man of his own color jim girty stopped before him his yellowish eyes lighted by a tigerish glare his lips curled in a snarl and from between them issuing the odor of the fir traders vile rum  youll soon be feed fer the buzzards he croaked in his hoarse voice he had so often strewed the plains with human flesh for the carrion birds that the thought had a deep fascination for him dye hear scalphunter feed for buzzards he deliberately spat in the hunters face dye hear he repeated  there was no answer save that which glittered in the hunters eye but the renegade could not read it because he did not meet that flaming glance wild horses could not have dragged him to face this man had he been free even now a chill crept over girty for a moment he was enthralled by a mysterious fear half paralyzed by a foreshadowing of what would be this hunters vengeance then he shook off his craven fear he was free the hunters doom was sure his sharp face was again wreathed in a savage leer and he spat once more on the prisoner  his fierce impetuosity took him a step too far the hunters arms and waist were fastened but his feet were free his powerful leg was raised suddenly his foot struck girty in the pit of the stomach the renegade dropped limp and gasping the braves carried him away his gaudy feathers trailing his long arms hanging inertly and his face distorted with agony  the maidens of the tribe however showed for the prisoner an interest that had in it something of veiled sympathy indian girls were always fascinated by white men many records of indian maidens kindness of love of heroism for white prisoners brighten the dark pages of frontier history these girls walked past the hunter averting their eyes when within his range of vision but stealing many a sidelong glance at his impressive face and noble proportions one of them particularly attracted the hunters eye  this was because as she came by with her companions while they all turned away she looked at him with her soft dark eyes she was a young girl whose delicate beauty bloomed fresh and sweet as that of a wild rose her costume fringed beaded and exquisitely wrought with fanciful design betrayed her rank she was wingenunds daughter the hunter had seen her when she was a child and he recognized her now he knew that the beauty of aola of whispering winds among the leaves had been sung from the ohio to the great lakes  often she passed him that afternoon at sunset as the braves untied him and led him away he once more caught the full intense gaze of her lovely eyes  that night as he lay securely bound in the corner of a lodge and the long hours wore slowly away he strained at his stout bonds and in his mind revolved different plans of escape it was not in this mans nature to despair while he had life he would fight from time to time he expanded his muscles striving to loosen the wet buckskin thongs  the dark hours slowly passed no sound coming to him save the distant bark of a dog and the monotonous tread of his guard a dim grayness pervaded the lodge dawn was close at handhis hour was nearly come  suddenly his hearing trained to a most acute sensibility caught a faint sound almost inaudible it came from without on the other side of the lodge there it was again a slight tearing sound such as is caused by a knife when it cuts through soft material  some one was slitting the wall of the lodge  the hunter rolled noiselessly over and over until he lay against the skins in the dim grayness he saw a bright blade moving carefully upward through the deerhide then a long knife was pushed into the opening a small brown hand grasped the hilt another little hand followed and felt of the wall and floor reaching out with groping fingers  the hunter rolled again so that his back was against the wall and his wrists in front of the opening he felt the little hand on his arm then it slipped down to his wrists the contact of cold steel set a tremor of joy through his heart the pressure of his bonds relaxed ceased his arms were free he turned to find the longbladed knife on the ground the little hands were gone  in a tinkling he rose unbound armed desperate in another second an indian warrior lay upon the ground in his deaththroes while a fleeing form vanished in the gray morning mist    chapter vii  joe felt the heavy lethargy rise from him like the removal of a blanket his eyes became clear and he saw the trees and the forest gloom slowly he realized his actual position  he was a prisoner lying helpless among his sleeping captors silvertip and the guard had fled into the woods frightened by the appalling moan which they believed sounded their deathknell and joe believed he might have fled himself had he been free what could have caused that sound he fought off the numbing chill that once again began to creep over him he was wideawake now his head was clear and he resolved to retain his senses he told himself there could be nothing supernatural in that wind or wail or whatever it was which had risen murmuring from out the forestdepths  yet despite his reasoning joe could not allay his fears that thrilling cry haunted him the frantic flight of an indian bravenay of a cunning experienced chiefwas not to be lightly considered the savages were at home in these untracked wilds trained from infancy to scent danger and to fight when they had an equal chance they surely would not run without good cause  joe knew that something moved under those dark trees he had no idea what it might be the fretting night wind or a stealthy prowling softfooted beast or a savage alien to these wild indians and wilder than they by far the chirp of a bird awoke the stillness night had given way to morning welcoming the light that was chasing away the gloom joe raised his head with a deep sigh of relief as he did so he saw a bush move then a shadow seemed to sink into the ground he had seen an object lighter than the trees darker than the gray background again that strange sense of the nearness of something thrilled him  moments passedto him long as hours he saw a tall fern waver and tremble a rabbit or perhaps a snake had brushed it other ferns moved their tops agitated perhaps by a faint breeze no that wavering line came straight toward him it could not be the wind it marked the course of a creeping noiseless thing it must be a panther crawling nearer and nearer  joe opened his lips to awaken his captors but could not speak it was as if his heart had stopped beating twenty feet away the ferns were parted to disclose a white gleaming face with eyes that seemingly glittered brawny shoulders were upraised and then a tall powerful man stood revealed lightly he stepped over the leaves into the little glade he bent over the sleeping indians once twice three times a long blade swung high one brave shuddered another gave a sobbing gasp and the third moved two fingersthus they passed from life to death  wetzel cried joe  i reckon so said the deliverer his deep calm voice contrasting strangely with what might have been expected from his aspect then seeing joes head covered with blood he continued able to get up  im not hurt answered joe rising when his bonds had been cut  brothers i reckon wetzel said bending over jim  yes were brothers wake up jim wake up were saved  what whos that cried jim sitting up and staring at wetzel  this man has saved our lives see jim the indians are dead and jim its wetzel the hunter you remember jeff lynn said id know him if i ever saw him and  what happened to jeff inquired wetzel interrupting he had turned from jims grateful face  jeff was on the first raft and for all we know he is now safe at fort henry our steersman was shot and we were captured  has the shawnee anythin aginst you boys  why yes i guess so i played a joke on himtook his shirt and put it on another fellow  might jes as well kick an injun what has he agin you  i dont know perhaps he did not like my talk to him answered jim i am a preacher and have come west to teach the gospel to the indians  theyre good injuns now said wetzel pointing to the prostrate figures  how did you find us eagerly asked joe  run acrost yer trail two days back  and youve been following us  the hunter nodded  did you see anything of another band of indians a tall chief and jim girty were among them  theyve been arter me fer two days i was followin you when silvertip got wind of girty an his delawares the big chief was wingenund i seen you pull girtys nose arter the delawares went i turned loose yer dog an horse an lit out on yer trail  where are the delawares now  i reckon there nosin my back trail we must be gittin silvertipll soon hev a lot of injuns here  joe intended to ask the hunter about what had frightened the indians but despite his eager desire for information he refrained from doing so  girty nigh did fer you remarked wetzel examining joes wound hes in a bad humor he got kicked a few days back and then hed the skin pulled offen his nose somebodyll hev to suffer wal you fellers grab yer rifles an well be startin fer the fort  joe shuddered as he leaned over one of the dusky forms to detach powder and bullet horn he had never seen a dead indian and the tense face the sightless vacant eyes made him shrink he shuddered again when he saw the hunter scalp his victims he shuddered the third time when he saw wetzel pick up silvertips beautiful white eagle plume dabble it in a pool of blood and stick it in the bark of a tree bereft of its graceful beauty drooping with its gory burden the long leather was a deadly message it had been silvertips pride it was now a challenge a menace to the shawnee chief  come said wetzel leading the way into the forest                                  shortly after daylight on the second day following the release of the downs brothers the hunter brushed through a thicket of alder and said thars fort henry  the boys were on the summit of a mountain from which the land sloped in a long incline of rolling ridges and gentle valleys like a green billowy sea until it rose again abruptly into a peak higher still than the one upon which they stood the broad ohio glistening in the sun lay at the base of the mountain  upon the bluff overlooking the river and under the brow of the mountain lay the frontier fort in the clear atmosphere it stood out in bold relief a small low structure surrounded by a high stockade fence was all and yet it did not seem unworthy of its fame those watchful forbidding loopholes the blackened walls and timbers told the history of ten long bloody years the whole effect was one of menace as if the fort sent out a defiance to the wilderness and meant to protect the few dozen log cabins clustered on the hillside  how will we ever get across that big river asked jim practically  wadeswim answered the hunter laconically and began the descent of the ridge an hours rapid walking brought the three to the river depositing his rifle in a clump of willows and directing the boys to do the same with their guns the hunter splashed into the water his companions followed him into the shallow water and waded a hundred yards which brought them near the island that they now perceived hid the fort the hunter swam the remaining distance and climbing the bank looked back for the boys they were close behind him then he strode across the island perhaps a quarter of a mile wide  weve a long swim here said wetzel waving his hand toward the main channel of the river good fer it he inquired of joe since jim had not received any injuries during the short captivity and consequently showed more endurance  good for anything answered joe with that coolness wetzel had been quick to observe in him  the hunter cast a sharp glance at the lads haggard face his bruised temple and his hair matted with blood in that look he read joe thoroughly had the young man known the result of that scrutiny he would have been pleased as well as puzzled for the hunter had said to himself a brave lad an the border fevers on him  swim close to me said wetzel and he plunged into the river the task was accomplished without accident  see the big cabin thar on the hillside thars colonel zane in the door said wetzel  as they neared the building several men joined the one who had been pointed out as the colonel it was evident the boys were the subject of their conversation presently zane left the group and came toward them the brothers saw a handsome stalwart man in the prime of life  well lew what luck he said to wetzel  not much i treed five injuns an two got away answered the hunter as he walked toward the fort  lads welcome to fort henry said colonel zane a smile lighting his dark face the others of your party arrived safely they certainly will be overjoyed to see you  colonel zane i had a letter from my uncle to you replied jim but the indians took that and everything else we had with us  never mind the letter i knew your uncle and your father too come into the house and change those wet clothes and you my lad have got an ugly knock on the head who gave you that  jim girty  what exclaimed the colonel  jim girty did that he was with a party of delawares who ran across us they were searching for wetzel  girty with the delawares the devils to pay now and you say hunting wetzel i must learn more about this it looks bad but tell me how did girty come to strike you  i pulled his nose  you did good good cried colonel zane heartily by george thats great tell mebut wait until you are more comfortable your packs came safely on jeffs raft and you will find them inside  as joe followed the colonel he heard one of the other men say  like as two peas in a pod  farther on he saw an indian standing a little apart from the others hearing joes slight exclamation of surprise he turned disclosing a fine manly countenance characterized by calm dignity the indian read the boys thought  ugh me friend he said in english  thats my shawnee guide tomepomehala hes a good fellow although jonathan and wetzel declare the only good indian is a dead one come right in here there are your packs and youll find water outside the door  thus saying colonel zane led the brothers into a small room brought out their packs and left them he came back presently with a couple of soft towels  now you lads fix up a bit then come out and meet my family and tell us all about your adventure by that time dinner will be ready  geminy dont that towel remind you of home said joe when the colonel had gone from the looks of things colonel zane means to have comfort here in the wilderness he struck me as being a fine man  the boys were indeed glad to change the few articles of clothing the indians had left them and when they were shaved and dressed they presented an entirely different appearance once more they were twin brothers in costume and feature joe contrived by brushing his hair down on his forehead to conceal the discolored bump  i think i saw a charming girl observed joe  suppose you didwhat then asked jim severely  whynothingsee here maynt i admire a pretty girl if i want  no you may not joe will nothing ever cure you i should think the thought of miss wells  look here jim she dont careat least its very little she cares and imim not worthy of her  turn around here and face me said the young minister sharply  joe turned and looked in his brothers eyes  have you trifled with her as you have with so many others tell me i know you dont lie  no  then what do you mean  nothing much jim except im really not worthy of her im no good you know and she ought to get a fellow likelike you  absurd you ought to be ashamed of yourself  never mind me see here dont you admire her  whywhy yes stammered jim flushing a dark guilty red at the direct question who could help admiring her  thats what i thought and i know she admires you for qualities which i lack nells like a tender vine just beginning to creep around and cling to something strong she cares for me but her love is like the vine it may hurt her a little to tear that love away but it wont kill her and in the end it will be best for her you need a good wife what could i do with a woman go in and win her jim  joe youre sacrificing yourself again for me cried jim white to the lips its wrong to yourself and wrong to her i tell you  enough joes voice cut in cold and sharp usually you influence me but sometimes you cant i say this nell will drift into your arms as surely as the leaf falls it will not hurt herwill be best for her remember she is yours for the winning  you do not say whether that will hurt you whispered jim  comewell find colonel zane said joe opening the door  they went out in the hallway which opened into the yard as well as the larger room through which the colonel had first conducted them as jim who was in advance passed into this apartment a trim figure entered from the yard it was nell and she ran directly against him her face was flushed her eyes were beaming with gladness and she seemed the incarnation of girlish joy  oh joe was all she whispered but the happiness and welcome in that whisper could never have been better expressed in longer speech then slightly ever so slightly she tilted her sweet face up to his  it all happened with the quickness of thought in a single instant jim saw the radiant face the outstretched hands and heard the glad whisper he knew that she had a again mistaken him for joe but for his life he could not draw back his head he had kissed her and even as his lips thrilled with her tremulous caress he flushed with the shame of his deceit  youre mistaken againim jim he whispered  for a moment they stood staring into each others eyes slowly awakening to what had really happened slowly conscious of a sweet alluring power then colonel zanes cheery voice rang in their ears  ah heres nellie and your brother now lads tell me which is which  thats jim and im joe answered the latter he appeared not to notice his brother and his greeting to nell was natural and hearty for the moment she drew the attention of the others from them  joe found himself listening to the congratulations of a number of people among the many names he remembered were those of mrs zane silas zane and major mccolloch then he found himself gazing at the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life  my only sister mrs alfred clarkeonce betty zane and the heroine of fort henry said colonel zane proudly with his arm around the slender darkeyed girl  i would brave the indians and the wilderness again for this pleasure replied joe gallantly as he bowed low over the little hand she cordially extended  bess is dinner ready inquired colonel zane of his comely wife she nodded her head and the colonel led the way into the adjoining room i know you boys must be hungry as bears  during the meal colonel zane questioned his guests about their journey and as to the treatment they had received at the hands of the indians he smiled at the young ministers earnestness in regard to the conversion of the redmen and he laughed outright when joe said he guessed he came to the frontier because it was too slow at home  i am sure your desire for excitement will soon be satisfied if indeed it be not so already remarked the colonel but as to the realization of your brothers hopes i am not so sanguine undoubtedly the moravian missionaries have accomplished wonders with the indians not long ago i visited the village of peacethe indian name for the missionand was struck by the friendliness and industry which prevailed there truly it was a village of peace yet it is almost to early to be certain of permanent success of this work the indians nature is one hard to understand he is naturally roving and restless which however may be owing to his habit of moving from place to place in search of good hunting grounds i believethough i must confess i havent seen any pioneers who share my beliefthat the savage has a beautiful side to his character i know of many noble deeds done by them and i believe if they are honestly dealt with they will return good for good there are bad ones of course but the french traders and men like the girtys have caused most of this long war jonathan and wetzel tell me the shawnees and chippewas have taken the warpath again then the fact that the girtys are with the delawares is reason for alarm we have been comparatively quiet here of late did you boys learn to what tribe your captors belong did wetzel say  he did not he spoke little but i will say he was exceedingly active answered joe with a smile  to have seen wetzel fight indians is something you are not likely to forget said colonel zane grimly now tell me how did those indians wear their scalplock  their heads were shaved closely with the exception of a little place on top the remaining hair was twisted into a tuft tied tightly and into this had been thrust a couple of painted pins when wetzel scalped the indians the pins fell out i picked one up and found it to be bone  you will make a woodsman thats certain replied colonel zane the indians were shawnee on the warpath well we will not borrow trouble for when it comes in the shape of redskins it usually comes quickly mr wells seemed anxious to resume the journey down the river but i shall try to persuade him to remain with us awhile indeed i am sorry i cannot keep you all here at fort henry and more especially the girls on the border we need young people and while i do not want to frighten the women i fear there will be more than indians fighting for them  i hope not but we have come prepared for anything said kate with a quiet smile our home was with uncle and when he announced his intention of going west we decided our duty was to go with him  you were right and i hope you will find a happy home rejoined colonel zane if life among the indians proves to be too hard we shall welcome you here betty show the girls your pets and indian trinkets i am going to take the boys to silas cabin to see mr wells and then show them over the fort  as they went out joe saw the indian guide standing in exactly the same position as when they entered the building  cant that indian move he asked curiously  he can cover one hundred miles in a day when he wants to replied colonel zane he is resting now an indian will often stand or sit in one position for many hours  hes a finelooking chap remarked joe and then to himself but i dont like him i guess im prejudiced  youll learn to like tome as we call him  colonel zane i want a light for my pipe i havent had a smoke since the day we were captured that blamed redskin took my tobacco its lucky i had some in my other pack id like to meet him again also silvertip and that brute girty  my lad dont make such wishes said colonel zane earnestly you were indeed fortunate to escape and i can well understand your feelings there is nothing i should like better than to see girty over the sights of my rifle but i never hunt after danger and to look for girty is to court death  but wetzel  ah my lad i know wetzel goes alone in the woods but then he is different from other men before you leave i will tell you all about him  colonel zane went around the corner of the cabin and returned with a live coal on a chip of wood which joe placed in the bowl of his pipe and because of the strong breeze stepped close to the cabin wall being a keen observer he noticed many small round holes in the logs they were so near together that the timbers had an odd speckled appearance and there was hardly a place where he could have put his thumb without covering a hole at first he thought they were made by a worm or bird peculiar to that region but finally lie concluded that they were bulletholes he thrust his knife blade into one and out rolled a leaden ball  id like to have been here when these were made he said  well at the time i wished i was back on the potomac replied colonel zane  they found the old missionary on the doorstep of the adjacent cabin he appeared discouraged when colonel zane interrogated him and said that he was impatient because of the delay  mr wells is it not possible that you underrate the danger of your enterprise  i fear naught but the lord answered the old man  do you not fear for those with you went on the colonel earnestly i am heart and soul with you in your work but want to impress upon you that the time is not propitious it is a long journey to the village and the way is beset with dangers of which you have no idea will you not remain here with me for a few weeks or at least until my scouts report  i thank you but go i will  then let me entreat you to remain here a few days so that i may send my brother jonathan and wetzel with you if any can guide you safely to the village of peace it will be they  at this moment joe saw two men approaching from the fort and recognized one of them as wetzel he doubted not that the other was lord dunmores famous guide and hunter jonathan zane in features he resembled the colonel and was as tall as wetzel although not so muscular or wide of chest  joe felt the same thrill he had experienced while watching the frontiersmen at fort pitt wetzel and jonathan spoke a word to colonel zane and then stepped aside the hunters stood lithe and erect with the easy graceful poise of indians  well take two canoes day after tomorrow said jonathan decisively to colonel zane have you a rifle for wetzel the delawares got his  colonel zane pondered over the question rifles were not scarce at the fort but a weapon that wetzel would use was hard to find  the hunter may have my rifle said the old missionary i have no use for a weapon with which to destroy gods creatures my brother was a frontiersman he left this rifle to me i remember hearing him say once that if a man knew exactly the weight of lead and powder needed it would shoot absolutely true  he went into the cabin and presently came out with a long object wrapped in linsey cloths unwinding the coverings he brought to view a rifle the proportions of which caused jonathans eyes to glisten and brought an exclamation from colonel zane wetzel balanced the gun in his hands it was fully six feet long the barrel was large and the dark steel finely polished the stock was black walnut ornamented with silver trimmings using jonathans powderflask and bulletpouch wetzel proceeded to load the weapon he poured out a quantity of powder into the palm of his hand performing the action quickly and dexterously but was so slow while measuring it that joe wondered if he were counting the grains next he selected a bullet out of a dozen which jonathan held toward him he examined it carefully and tried it in the muzzle of the rifle evidently it did not please him for he took another finally he scraped a bullet with his knife and placing it in the center of a small linsey rag deftly forced it down he adjusted the flint dropped a few grains of powder in the pan and then looked around for a mark at which to shoot  joe observed that the hunters and colonel zane were as serious regarding the work as if at that moment some important issue depended upon the accuracy of the rifle  there lew theres a good shot its pretty far even for you when you dont know the gun said colonel zane pointing toward the river  joe saw the end of a log about the size of a mans head sticking out of the water perhaps an hundred and fifty yards distant he thought to hit it would be a fine shot but was amazed when he heard colonel zane say to several men who had joined the group that wetzel intended to shoot at a turtle on the log by straining his eyes joe succeeded in distinguishing a small lump which he concluded was the turtle  wetzel took a step forward the long black rifle was raised with a stately sweep the instant it reached a level a thread of flame burst forth followed by a peculiarly clear ringing report  did he hit asked colonel zane eagerly as a boy  i allow he did answered jonathan  ill go and see said joe he ran down the bank along the beach and stepped on the log he saw a turtle about the size of an ordinary saucer picking it up he saw a bullethole in the shell near the middle the bullet had gone through the turtle and it was quite dead joe carried it to the waiting group  i allowed so declared jonathan  wetzel examined the turtle and turning to the old missionary said  your brother spoke the truth an i thank you fer the rifle    chapter viii  so you want to know all about wetzel inquired colonel zane of joe when having left jim and mr wells they returned to the cabin  i am immensely interested in him replied joe  well i dont think theres anything singular in that i know wetzel better perhaps than any man living but have seldom talked about him he doesnt like it he is by birth a virginian i should say forty years old we were boys together and and i am a little beyond that age he was like any of the lads except that he excelled us all in strength and agility when he was nearly eighteen years old a band if indiansdelawares i thinkcrossed the border on a marauding expedition far into virginia they burned the old wetzel homestead and murdered the father mother two sisters and a baby brother the terrible shock nearly killed lewis who for a time was very ill when he recovered he went in search of his brothers martin and john wetzel who were hunting and brought them back to their desolated home over the ashes of the home and the graves of the loved ones the brothers swore sleepless and eternal vengeance the elder brothers have been devoted all these twenty years and more to the killing of indians but lewis has been the great foe of the redman you have already seen an example of his deeds and will hear of more his name is a household word on the border scores of times he has saved actually saved this fort and settlement his knowledge of savage ways surpasses by far boones major mccollochs jonathans or any of the hunters  then hunting indians is his sole occupation  he lives for that purpose alone he is very seldom in the settlement sometimes he stays here a few days especially if he is needed but usually he roams the forests  what did jeff lynn mean when he said that some people think wetzel is crazy  there are many who think the man mad but i do not when the passion for indian hunting comes upon him he is fierce almost frenzied yet perfectly sane while here he is quiet seldom speaks except when spoken to and is taciturn with strangers he often comes to my cabin and sits beside the fire for hours i think he finds pleasure in the conversation and laughter of friends he is fond of the children and would do anything for my sister betty  his life must be lonely and sad remarked joe  the life of any borderman is that but wetzels is particularly so  what is he called by the indians  they call him atelang or in english deathwind  by george thats what silvertip said in frenchle vent de la mort  yes you have it right a french fur trader gave wetzel that name years ago and it has clung to him the indians say the deathwind blows through the forest whenever wetzel stalks on their trail  colonel zane dont you think me superstitious whispered joe leaning toward the colonel but i heard that wind blow through the forest  what ejaculated colonel zane he saw that joe was in earnest for the remembrance of the moan had more than once paled his cheek and caused beads of perspiration to collect on his brow  joe related the circumstances of that night and at the end of his narrative colonel zane sat silent and thoughtful  you dont really think it was wetzel who moaned he asked at length  no i dont replied joe quickly but colonel zane i heard that moan as plainly as i can hear your voice i heard it twice now what was it  jonathan said the same thing to me once he had been out hunting with wetzel they separated and during the night jonathan heard the wind the next day he ran across a dead indian he believes wetzel makes the noise and so do the hunters but i think it is simply the moan of the night wind through the trees i have heard it at times when my very blood seemingly ran cold  i tried to think it was the wind soughing through the pines but am afraid i didnt succeed very well anyhow i knew wetzel instantly just as jeff lynn said i would he killed those indians in an instant and he must have an iron arm  wetzel excels in strength and speed any man red or white on the frontier he can run away from jonathan who is as swift as an indian hes stronger than any of the other men i remember one day old hugh bennets wagon wheels stuck in a bog down by the creek hugh tried as several others did to move the wheels but they couldnt be made to budge along came wetzel pushed away the men and lifted the wagon unaided it would take hours to tell you about him in brief among all the border scouts and hunters wetzel stands alone no wonder the indians fear him he is as swift as an eagle strong as mountainash keen as a fox and absolutely tireless and implacable  how long have you been here colonel zane  more than twelve years and it has been one long fight  im afraid im too late for the fun said joe with his quiet laugh  not by about twelve more years answered colonel zane studying the expression on joes face when i came out here years ago i had the same adventurous spirit which i see in you it has been considerably quelled however i have seen many a daring young fellow get the border fever and with it his death let me advise you to learn the ways of the hunters to watch some one skilled in woodcraft perhaps wetzel himself will take you in hand i dont mind saying that he spoke of you to me in a tone i never heard lew use before  he did questioned joe eagerly flushing with pleasure do you think hed take me out dare i ask him  dont be impatient perhaps i can arrange it come over here now to metzars place i want to make you acquainted with him these boys have all been cutting timber theyve just come in for dinner be easy and quiet with them then youll get on  colonel zane introduced joe to five sturdy boys and left him in their company joe sat down on a log outside a cabin and leisurely surveyed the young men they all looked about the same strong without being heavy lighthaired and bronzefaced in their turn they carefully judged joe a newcomer from the east was always regarded with some doubt if they expected to hear joe talk much they were mistaken he appeared goodnatured but not too friendly  fine weather were havin said dick metzar  fine agreed joe laconically  like frontier life  sure  a silence ensued after this breaking of the ice the boys were awaiting their turn at a little wooden bench upon which stood a bucket of water and a basin  hear ye got ketched by some shawnees remarked another youth as he rolled up his shirtsleeves they all looked at joe now it was not improbably their estimate of him would be greatly influenced by the way he answered this question  yes was captive for three days  did ye knock any redskins over this question was artfully put to draw joe out above all things the bordermen detested boastfulness tried on joe the ruse failed signally  i was scared speechless most of the time answered joe with his pleasant smile  by gosh i dont blame ye burst out will metzar i hed that experience onct an oncts enough  the boys laughed and looked in a more friendly manner at joe though he said he had been frightened his cool and careless manner belied his words in joes low voice and clear gray eye there was something potent and magnetic which subtly influenced those with whom he came in contact  while his new friends were at dinner joe strolled over to where colonel zane sat on the doorstep of his home  how did you get on with the boys inquired the colonel  all right i hope say colonel zane id like to talk to your indian guide  colonel zane spoke a few words in the indian language to the guide who left his post and came over to them the colonel then had a short conversation with him at the conclusion of which he pointed toward joe  how doshake said tome extending his hand  joe smiled and returned the friendly handpressure  shawneeketchum asked the indian in his fairly intelligible english  joe nodded his head while colonel zane spoke once more in shawnee explaining the cause of silvertips emnity  shawneechiefonebadinjun replied tome seriously silvertipmadthundermad ketchum palefacescalpum sure  after giving this warning the chief returned to his former position near the corner of the cabin  he can talk in english fairly well much better than the shawnee brave who talked with me the other day observed joe  some of the indians speak the language almost fluently said colonel zane you could hardly have distinguished logans speech from a white mans cornplanter uses good english as also does my brothers wife a wyandot girl  did your brother marry an indian and joe plainly showed his surprise  indeed he did and a most beautiful girl she is ill tell you isaacs story some time he was a captive among the wyandots for ten years the chiefs daughter myeerah loved him kept him from being tortured and finally saved him from the stake  well that floors me said joe yet i dont see why it should im just surprised where is your brother now  he lives with the tribe he and myeerah are working hard for peace we are now on more friendly terms with the great wyandots or hurons as we call them than ever before  who is this big man coming from the the fort asked joe suddenly observing a stalwart frontiersman approaching  major sam mccolloch you have met him hes the man who jumped his horse from yonder bluff  jonathan and he have the same look the same swing observed joe as he ran his eye over the major his faded buckskin costume beaded fringed and laced was similar to that of the colonels brother powderflask and bulletpouch were made from cowhorns and slung around his neck on deerhide strings the hunting coat was unlaced exposing under the long fringed borders a tunic of the same welltanned but finer and softer material as he walked the flaps of his coat fell back showing a belt containing two knives sheathed in heavy buckskin and a bright tomahawk he carried a long rifle in the hollow of his arm  these hunters have the same kind of buckskin suits continued joe still it doesnt seem to me the clothes make the resemblance to each other the way these men stand walk and act is what strikes me particularly as in the case of wetzel  i know what you mean the flashing eye the erect poise of expectation and the springy stepthose my lad come from a life spent in the woods well its a grand way to live  colonel my horse is laid up said major mccolloch coming to the steps he bowed pleasantly to joe  so you are going to short creek you can have one of my horses but first come inside and well talk over you expedition  the afternoon passed uneventfully for joe his brother and mr wells were absorbed in plans for their future work and nell and kate were resting therefore he was forced to find such amusement or occupation as was possible in or near the stockade    chapter ix  joe went to bed that night with a promise to himself to rise early next morning for he had been invited to take part in a raising which term meant that a new cabin was to be erected and such task was ever an event in the lives of the settlers  the following morning joe rose early dressing himself in a complete buckskin suit for which he had exchanged his good garments of cloth never before had he felt so comfortable he wanted to hop skip and jump the soft undressed buckskin was as warm and smooth as silkplush the weight so light the moccasins so wellfitting and springy that he had to put himself under considerable restraint to keep from capering about like a frolicsome colt  the possession of this buckskin outfit and the rifle and accouterments which went with the bargain marked the last stage in joes surrender to the border fever the silent shaded glens the mystery of the woods the breath of this wild free life claimed him from this moment entirely and forever  he met the others however with a serene face showing no trace of the emotion which welled up strongly from his heart nell glanced shyly at him kate playfully voiced her admiration jim met him with a brotherly ridicule which bespoke his affection as well as his amusement but colonel zane having once yielded to the same burning riotous craving for freedom which now stirred in the boys heart understood and felt warmly drawn toward the lad he said nothing though as he watched joe his eyes were grave and kind in his long frontier life where many a day measured the life and fire of ordinary years he had seen lad after lad go down before this forest fever it was well he thought because the freedom of the soil depended on these wild lightfooted boys yet it always made him sad how many youths his brother among them lay under the fragrant pineneedle carpet of the forest in their last earthly sleep  the raising brought out all the settlementthe women to look on and gossip while the children played the men to bend their backs in the moving of the heavy timbers they celebrated the erection of a new cabin as a noteworthy event as a social function it had a prominent place in the settlers short list of pleasures  joe watched the proceeding with the same pleasure and surprise he had felt in everything pertaining to border life  to him this lograising appeared the hardest kind of labor yet it was plain these hardy men these lowvoiced women and merry children regarded the work as something far more significant than the mere building of a cabin after a while he understood the meaning of the scene a kindred spirit the spirit of the pioneer drew them all into one large family this was another cabin another home another advance toward the conquering of the wilderness for which these brave men and women were giving their lives in the brighteyed childrens glee when they clapped their little hands at the mounting logs joe saw the progress the march of civilization  well im sorry youre to leave us tonight remarked colonel zane to joe as the young man came over to where he his wife and sister watched the work jonathan said all was ready for your departure at sundown  do we travel by night  indeed yes my lad there are indians everywhere on the river i think however with jack and lew handling the paddles you will slip by safely the plan is to keep along the south shore all night then cross over at a place called girtys point where you are to remain in hiding during daylight from there you paddle up yellow creek then portage across country to the head of the tuscarwawas another nights journey will then bring you to the village of peace  jim and mr wells with his nieces joined the party now and all stood watching as the last logs were put in place  colonel zane my first lograising is an education to me said the young minister in his earnest manner this scene is so full of life i never saw such goodwill among laboring men look at that brawnyarmed giant standing on the topmost log how he whistles as he swings his ax mr wells does it not impress you  the pioneers must be brothers because of their isolation and peril to be brothers means to love one another to love one another is to love god what you see in this fraternity is god and i want to see this same beautiful feeling among the indians  i have seen it said colonel zane to the old missionary when i came out here alone twelve years ago the indians were peaceable if the pioneers had paid for land as i paid cornplanter there would never have been a border war but no the settlers must grasp every acre they could then the indians rebelled then the girtys and their allies spread discontent and now the border is a bloody warpath  have the jesuit missionaries accomplished anything with these war tribes inquired jim  no their work has been chiefly among the indians near detroit and northward the hurons delawares shawnees and other western tribes have been demoralized by the french traders rum and incited to fierce hatred by girty and his renegades your work at gnaddenhutten must be among these hostile tribes and it is surely a hazardous undertaking  my life is gods murmured the old minister no fear could assail his steadfast faith  jim it strikes me youd be more likely to impress these indians colonel zane spoke of if youd get a suit like mine and wear a knife and tomahawk interposed joe cheerfully then if you couldnt convert you could scalp them  well well let us hope for the best said colonel zane when the laughter had subsided well go over to dinner now come all of you jonathan bring wetzel betty make him come if you can  as the party slowly wended its way toward the colonels cabin jim and nell found themselves side by side they had not exchanged a word since the evening previous when jim had kissed her unable to look at each other now and finding speech difficult they walked in embarrassed silence  doesnt joe look splendid in his hunting suit asked jim presently  i hadnt noticed yes he looks well replied nell carelessly she was too indifferent to be natural  are you angry with him  certainly not  jim was always simple and frank in his relations with women he had none of his brothers fluency of speech with neither confidence boldness nor understanding of the intricate mazes of a womans moods  butyou are angry withme he whispered  nell flushed to her temples yet she did not raise her eyes nor reply  it was a terrible thing for me to do went on jim hesitatingly i dont know why i took advantageofof your mistaking me for joe if you only hadnt held up your mouth noi dont mean thatof course you didnt butwell i couldnt help it im guilty i have thought of little else some wonderful feeling has possessed me ever sincesince  what has joe been saying about me demanded nell her eyes burning like opals  why hardly anything answered jim haltingly i took him to task aboutabout what i considered might be wrong to you joe has never been very careful of young ladies feelings and i thoughtwell it was none of my business he said he honestly cared for you that you had taught him how unworthy he was of a good woman but hes wrong there joe is wild and reckless yet his heart is a well of gold he is a diamond in the rough just now he is possessed by wild notions of hunting indians and roaming through the forests but hell come round all right i wish i could tell you how much he has done for me how much i love him how i know him he can be made worthy of any woman he will outgrow this fiery daring spirit and thenwont you help him  i will if he will let me softly whispered nell irresistibly drawn by the strong earnest love thrilling in his voice    chapter x  once more out under the blueblack vault of heaven with its myriads of twinkling stars the voyagers resumed their westward journey whispered farewells of new but sincere friends lingered in their ears now the great looming bulk of the fort above them faded into the obscure darkness leaving a feeling as if a protector had goneperhaps forever admonished to absolute silence by the stern guides who seemed indeed to have embarked upon a dark and deadly mission the voyagers lay back in the canoes and thought and listened the water eddied with soft gurgles in the wake of the racing canoes but that musical sound was all they heard the paddles might have been shadows for all the splash they made they cut the water swiftly and noiselessly onward the frail barks glided into black space side by side close under the overhanging willows long moments passed into long hours as the guides paddled tirelessly as if their sinews were cords of steel  with gray dawn came the careful landing of the canoes a cold breakfast eaten under cover of a willow thicket and the beginning of a long day while they were lying hidden from the keen eyes of indian scouts waiting for the friendly mantle of night  the hours dragged until once more the canoes were launched this time not on the broad ohio but on a stream that mirrored no shining stars as it flowed still and somber under the dense foliage  the voyagers spoke not nor whispered nor scarcely moved so menacing had become the slow listening caution of wetzel and zane snapping of twigs somewhere in the inscrutable darkness delayed them for long moments any movement the air might resound with the horrible indian warwhoop every second was heavy with fear how marvelous that these scouts penetrating the wilderness of gloom glided on surely silently safely instinct or the eyes of the lynx guide their course but another dark night wore on to the tardy dawn and each of its fearful hours numbered miles past and gone  the sun was rising in ruddy glory when wetzel ran his canoe into the bank just ahead of a sharp bend in the stream  do we get out here asked jim seeing jonathan turn his canoe toward wetzels  the village lies yonder around the bend answered the guide wetzel cannot go there so ill take you all in my canoe  theres no room ill wait replied joe quietly jim noted his looka strange steady glance it wasand then saw him fix his eyes upon nell watching her until the canoe passed around the greenbordered bend in the stream  unmistakable signs of an indian town were now evident dozens of graceful birchen canoes lay upon the wellcleared banks a log bridge spanned the stream above the slight ridge of rising ground could be seen the poles of indian teepees  as the canoe grated upon the sandy beach a little indian boy who was playing in the shallow water raised his head and smiled  thats an indian boy whispered kate  the dear little fellow exclaimed nell  the boy came running up to them when they were landed with pleasure and confidence shining in his dusky eyes save for tiny buckskin breeches he was naked and his shiny skin gleamed goldbronze in the sunlight he was a singularly handsome child  mebenny he lisped in english holding up his little hand to nell  the action was as loving and trusting as any that could have been manifested by a white child jonathan zane stared with a curious light in his dark eyes mr wells and jim looked as though they doubted the evidence of their own sight here even in an indian boy was incontestable proof that the savage nature could be tamed and civilized  with a tender exclamation nell bent over the child and kissed him  jonathan zane swung his canoe upstream for the purpose of bringing joe the trim little bark slipped out of sight round the bend presently its gray curved nose peeped from behind the willows then the canoe swept into view again there was only one person in it and that the guide  where is my brother asked jim in amazement  gone answered zane quietly  gone what do you mean gone perhaps you have missed the spot where you left him  theyre both gone  nell and jim gazed at each other with slowly whitening faces  come ill take you up to the village said zane getting out of his canoe all noticed that he was careful to take his weapons with him  cant you tell us what it meansthis disappearance asked jim his voice low and anxious  theyre gone canoe and all i knew wetzel was going but i didnt calkilate on the lad mebbe he followed wetzel mebbe he didnt answered the taciturn guide and he spoke no more  in his keen expectation and wonder as to what the village would be like jim momentarily forgot his brothers disappearance and when he arrived at the top of the bank he surveyed the scene with eagerness what he saw was more imposing than the village of peace which he had conjured up in his imagination confronting him was a level plain in the center of which stood a wide low structure surrounded by log cabins and these in turn encircled by indian teepees a number of large trees mostly fullfoliaged maples shaded the clearing the settlement swarmed with indians a few shrill halloes uttered by the first observers of the newcomers brought braves maidens and children trooping toward the party with friendly curiosity  jonathan zane stepped before a cabin adjoining the large structure and called in at the open door a short stoopshouldered white man clad in faded linsey appeared on the threshold his serious lined face had the unmistakable benevolent aspect peculiar to most teachers of the gospel  mr zeisberger ive fetched a party from fort henry said zane indicating those he had guided then without another word never turning his dark face to the right or left he hurried down the lane through the throng of indians  jim remembered as he saw the guide vanish over the bank of the creek that he had heard colonel zane say that jonathan as well as wetzel hated the sight of an indian no doubt long years of war and bloodshed had rendered these two great hunters callous to them there could be no discriminationan indian was an indian  mr wells welcome to the village of peace exclaimed mr zeisberger wringing the old missionarys hand the years have not been so long but that i remember you  happy indeed am i to get here after all these dark dangerous journeys returned mr wells i have brought my nieces nell and kate who were children when you left williamsburg and this young man james downs a minister of god and earnest in his hope for our work  a glorious work it is welcome young ladies to our peaceful village and young man i greet you with heartfelt thankfulness we need young men come in all of your and share my cabin ill have your luggage brought up i have lived in this hut alone with some little labor and the magic touch women bring to the making of a home we can be most comfortable here  mr zeisberger gave his own room to the girls assuring them with a smile that it was the most luxurious in the village the apartment contained a chair a table and a bed of indian blankets and buffalo robes a few pegs driven in the chinks between the logs completed the furnishings sparse as were the comforts they appealed warmly to the girls who weary from their voyage lay down to rest  i am not fatigued said mr wells to his old friend i want to hear all about your work what you have done and what you hope to do  we have met with wonderful success far beyond our wildest dreams responded mr zeisberger certainly we have been blessed of god  then the missionary began a long detailed account of the moravian missions efforts among the western tribes the work lay chiefly among the delawares a noble nation of redmen intelligent and wonderfully susceptible to the teaching of the gospel among the eastern delawares living on the other side of the allegheny mountains the missionaries had succeeded in converting many and it was chiefly through the western explorations of frederick post that his church decided the indians of the west could as well be taught to lead christian lives the first attempt to convert the western redmen took place upon the upper allegheny where many indians including allemewi a blind delaware chief accepted the faith the mission decided however it would be best to move farther west where the delawares had migrated and were more numerous  in april 1770 more than ten years before sixteen canoes filled with converted indians and missionaries drifted down the allegheny to fort pitt thence down the ohio to the big beaver up that stream and far into the ohio wilderness  upon a tributary of the muskingong called the tuscarwawas a settlement was founded near and far the news was circulated redmen from all tribes came flocking to the new colony chiefs and warriors squaws and maidens were attracted by the new doctrine of the converted indians they were astonished at the missionaries teachings many doubted some were converted all listened great excitement prevailed when old glickhican one of the wisest chiefs of the turtle tribe of the delawares became a convert to the palefaces religion  the interest widened and in a few years a beautiful prosperous town arose which was called village of peace the indians of the warlike tribes bestowed the appropriate name the vast forests were rich in every variety of game the deep swift streams were teeming with fish meat and grain in abundance buckskin for clothing and soft furs for winter garments were to be had for little labor at first only a few wigwams were erected soon a large log structure was thrown up and used as a church then followed a school a mill and a workshop the verdant fields were cultivated and surrounded by rail fences horses and cattle grazed with the timid deer on the grassy plains  the village of peace blossomed as a rose the reports of the love and happiness existing in this converted community spread from mouth to mouth from town to town with the result that inquisitive savages journeyed from all points to see this haven peaceful and hostile indians were alike amazed at the change in their brethren the goodfellowship and industry of the converts had a widespread and wonderful influence more perhaps than any other thing the great fields of waving corn the hills covered with horses and cattle those evidences of abundance impressed the visitors with the wellbeing of the christians bands of traveling indians whether friendly or otherwise were treated with hospitality and never sent away emptyhanded they were asked to partake of the abundance and solicited to come again  a feature by no means insignificant in the popularity of the village was the church bell the indians loved music and this bell charmed them on still nights the savages in distant towns could hear at dusk the deeptoned mellow notes of the bell summoning the worshipers to the evening service its ringing clang so strange so sweet so solemn breaking the vast dead wilderness quiet haunted the savage ear as though it were a call from a woodland god  you have arrived most opportunely continued mr zeisberger mr edwards and mr young are working to establish other missionary posts heckewelder is here now in the interest of this branching out  how long will it take me to learn the delaware language inquired jim  not long you do not however need to speak the indian tongue for we have excellent interpreters  we heard much at fort pitt and fort henry about the danger as well as uselessness of our venture jim continued the frontiersmen declared that every rod of the way was beset with savage foes and that even in the unlikely event of our arriving safely at the village of peace we would then be hemmed in by fierce vengeful tribes  hostile savages abound here of course but we do not fear them we invite them our work is to convert the wicked to teach them to lead good useful lives we will succeed  jim could not help warming to the minister for his unswervable faith his earnest belief that the work of god could not fail nevertheless while he felt no fear and intended to put all his heart in the work he remembered with disquietude colonel zanes warnings he thought of the wonderful precaution and eternal vigilance of jonathan and wetzelmen of all men who most understood indian craft and cunning it might well be possible that these good missionaries wrapped up in saving the souls of these children of the forest so full of gods teachings as to have little mind for aught else had no knowledge of the indian nature beyond what the narrow scope of their work invited if what these frontiersmen asserted was true then the ministers zeal had struck them blind  jim had a growing idea of the way in which the savages could be best taught he resolved to go slowly to study the redmens natures not to preach one word of the gospel to them until he had mastered their language and could convey to their simple minds the real truth he would make christianity as clear to them as were the deertrails on the moss and leaves of the forest  ah here you are i hope you have rested well said mr zeisberger when at the conclusion of this long recital nell and kate came into the room  thank you we feel much better answered kate the girls certainly looked refreshed the substitution of clean gowns for their former travelstained garments made a change that called forth the ministers surprise and admiration  my my wont edwards and young beg me to keep them here now he exclaimed his pleased eyes resting on nells piquant beauty and kates noble proportions and rich coloring come i will show you over the village of peace  are all these indians christians asked jim  no indeed these indians you see here and out yonder under the shade though they are friendly are not christians our converts employ themselves in the fields or shops come take a peep in here this is where we preach in the evenings and during inclement weather on pleasant days we use the maple grove yonder  jim and the others looked in at the door of the large log structure they saw an immense room the floor covered with benches and a raised platform at one end a few windows let in the light spacious and barnlike was this apartment but undoubtedly seen through the beaming eyes of the missionary it was a grand amphitheater for worship the hardpacked clay floor was velvet carpet the rude seats soft as eiderdown the platform with its whiteoak cross an altar of marble and gold  this is one of our shops said mr zeisberger leading them to a cabin here we make brooms harness for the horses farming implementseverything useful that we can we have a forge here behold an indian blacksmith  the interior of the large cabin presented a scene of bustling activity twenty or more indians bent their backs in earnest employment in one corner a savage stood holding a piece of redhot iron on an anvil while a brawny brave wielded a sledgehammer the sparks flew the anvil rang in another corner a circle of braves sat around a pile of dried grass and flags they were twisting and fashioning these materials into baskets at a bench three indian carpenters were pounding and sawing young braves ran back and forth carrying pails roughhewn boards and blocks of wood  instantly struck by two things jim voiced his curiosity  why do these indians all wear long hair smooth and shiny without adornment  they are christians they wear neither headdress warbonnet nor scalplock replied mr zeisberger with unconscious pride  i did not expect to see a blacksmiths anvil out here in the wilderness where did you procure these tools  we have been years getting them here some came by way of the ohio river others overland from detroit that anvil has a history it was lost once and lay for years in the woods until some indians found it again it is called the ringing stone and indians come from miles around to see and hear it  the missionary pointed out wide fields of corn now growing yellow and hillsides doted with browsing cattle droves of sturdylimbed horses and pens of fat grunting pigsall of which attested to the growing prosperity of the village of peace  on the way back to the cabin while the others listened to and questioned mr zeisberger jim was silent and thoughtful for his thoughts reverted to his brother  later as he walked with nell by the goldenfringed stream he spoke of joe  joe wanted so much to hunt with wetzel he will come back surely he will return to us when he has satisfied his wild craving for adventure do you not think so  there was an eagerness that was almost pleading in jims voice what he so much hoped forthat no harm had befallen joe and that he would returnhe doubted he needed the encouragement of his hope  never answered nell solemnly  oh whywhy do you say that  i saw him look at youa strange intent glance he gazed long at me as we separated oh i can feel his eyes no he will never come back  nell nell you do not mean he went away deliberatelybecause oh i cannot say it  for no reason except that the wilderness called him more than love for you orme  no no returned jim his face white you do not understand he really loved youi know it he loved me too ah how well he has gone becausei cant tell you  oh jim i hopehe lovedme sobbed nell bursting into tears his coldnesshis neglect thoselast few dayshurt meso if he caredas you sayi wont besomiserable  we are both rightyou when you say he will never return and i when i say he loved us both said jim sadly as the bitter certainty forced itself into his mind  as she sobbed softly and he gazed with set stern face into the darkening forest the deep mellow notes of the church bell pealed out so thrilled so startled were they by this melody wondrously breaking the twilight stillness that they gazed mutely at each other then they remembered it was the missionarys bell summoning the christian indians to the evening service    chapter xi  the sultry drowsy summer days passed with no untoward event to mar their slumbering tranquillity life for the newcomers to the village of peace brought a content the like of which they had never dreamed of mr wells at once began active work among the indians preaching to them through an interpreter nell and kate in hours apart from household duties busied themselves brightening their new abode and jim entered upon the task of acquainting himself with the modes and habits of the redmen truly the young people might have found perfect happiness in this new and novel life if only joe had returned his disappearance and subsequent absence furnished a theme for many talks and many a quiet hour of dreamy sadness the fascination of his personality had been so impelling that long after it was withdrawn a charm lingered around everything which reminded them of him a subtle and sweet memory with perverse and half bitter persistence returned hauntingly no trace of joe had been seen by any of the friendly indian runners he was gone into the mazes of deepshadowed forests where to hunt for him would be like striving to trail the flight of a swallow two of those he had left behind always remembered him and in their thoughts followed him in his wanderings  jim settled down to his study of indians with singleheartedness of purpose he spent part of every morning with the interpreters with whose assistance he rapidly acquired the delaware language he went freely among the indians endeavoring to win their goodwill there were always fifty to an hundred visiting indians at the village sometimes when the missionaries had advertised a special meeting there were assembled in the shady maple grove as many as five hundred savages jim had therefore opportunities to practice his offices of friendliness  fortunately for him he at once succeeded in establishing himself in the good graces of glickhican the converted delaware chief the wise old indian was of inestimable value to jim early in their acquaintance he evinced an earnest regard for the young minister and talked with him for hours  from glickhican jim learned the real nature of the redmen the indians love of freedom and honor his hatred of subjection and deceit as explained by the good old man recalled to jim colonel zanes estimate of the savage character surely as the colonel had said the indians had reason for their hatred of the pioneers truly they were a blighted race  seldom had the rights of the redmen been thought of the settler pushed onward plodding as it were behind his plow with a rifle he regarded the indian as little better than a beast he was easier to kill than to tame how little the settler knew the proud independence the wisdom the stainless chastity of honor which belonged so truly to many indian chiefs  the redmen were driven like hounded deer into the untrodden wilds from freemen of the forests from owners of the great boundless plains they passed to stern enduring fugitives on their own lands small wonder that they became cruel where once they had been gentle stratagem and cunning the night assault the daylight ambush took the place of their onetime open warfare their chivalrous courage that sublime inheritance from ancestors who had never known the paleface foe degenerated into a savage ferocity  interesting as was this history to jim he cared more for glickhicans rich portrayal of the redmens domestic life for the beautiful poetry of his tradition and legends he heard with delight the exquisite fanciful indian lore from these romantic legends beautiful poems and marvelous myths he hoped to get ideas of the indians religion sweet and simple as childless dreams were these quaint talestales of how the woodland fairies dwelt in ferncarpeted dells how at sunrise they came out to kiss open the flowers how the forest walks were spirithaunted paths how the leaves whispered poetry to the winds how the rocks harbored indian gods and masters who watched over their chosen ones  glickhican wound up his long discourses by declaring he had never lied in the whole course of his seventy years had never stolen never betrayed never murdered never killed save in selfdefence gazing at the chiefs fine features now calm yet showing traces of past storms jim believed he spoke the truth  when the young minister came however to study the hostile indians that flocked to the village any conclusive delineation of character or any satisfactory analysis of their mental state in regard to the paleface religion eluded him their passive silent sphinxlike secretiveness was baffling glickhican had taught him how to propitiate the friendly braves and with these he was successful little he learned however from the unfriendly ones when making gifts to these redmen he could never be certain that his offerings were appreciated the jewels and gold he had brought west with him went to the french traders who in exchange gave him trinkets baubles bracelets and weapons jim made hundreds of presents boldly going up to befeathered and befringed chieftains he offered them knives hatchets or strings of silvery beads sometimes his kindly offerings were repelled with a haughty stare at other times they would be accepted coldly suspiciously as if the gifts brought some unknown obligation  for a white man it was a nevertobeforgotten experience to see eight or ten of these grim slowly stepping forest kings arrayed in all the rich splendor of their costume stalking among the teepees of the village of peace somehow such a procession always made jim shiver the singing praying and preaching they heard unmoved no emotion was visible on their bronzed faces nothing changed their unalterable mien had they not moved or gazed with burning eyes they would have been statues when these chieftains looked at the converted indians some of whom were braves of their nations the contempt in their glances betrayed that they now regarded these christian indians as belonging to an alien race  among the chiefs glickhican pointed out to jim were wingenund the delaware tellane the halfking shingiss and kotoxenall of the wolf tribe of the delawares  glickhican was careful to explain that the delaware nation had been divided into the wolf and turtle tribes the former warlike people and the latter peaceable few of the wolf tribe had gone over to the new faith and those who had were scorned wingenund the great power of the delawaresindeed the greatest of all the western tribesmaintained a neutral attitude toward the village of peace but it was well known that his righthand warchiefs pipe and wishtonah remained coldly opposed  jim turned all he had learned over and over in his mind trying to construct part of it to fit into a sermon that would be different from any the indians had ever heard he did not want to preach far over their heads if possible he desired to keep to their idealsfor he deemed them more beautiful than his ownand to conduct his teaching along the simple lines of their belief so that when he stimulated and developed their minds he could pass from what they knew to the unknown christianity of the white man  his first address to the indians was made one day during the indisposition of mr wellswho had been overworking himselfand the absence of the other missionaries he did not consider himself at all ready for preaching and confined his efforts to simple earnest talk a recital of the thoughts he had assimilated while living here among the indians  amazement would not have described the state of his feelings when he learned that he had made a powerful impression the converts were loud in his praise the unbelievers silent and thoughtful in spite of himself long before he had been prepared he was launched on his teaching every day he was called upon to speak every day one savage at least was convinced every day the throng of interested indians was augmented the elder missionaries were quite overcome with joy they pressed him day after day to speak until at length he alone preached during the afternoon service  the news flew apace the village of peace entertained more redmen than ever before day by day the faith gained a stronger foothold a kind of religious trance affected some of the converted indians and this greatly influenced the doubting ones many of them half believed the great manitou had come  heckewelder the acknowledged leader of the western moravian mission visited the village at this time and struck by the young missionarys success arranged a three days religious festival indian runners were employed to carry invitations to all the tribes the wyandots in the west the shawnees in the south and the delawares in the north were especially requested to come no deception was practiced to lure the distant savages to the village of peace they were asked to come partake of the feasts and listen to the white mans teaching    chapter xii  the groves were gods first temples  from dawn until noon on sunday bands of indians arrived at the village of peace hundreds of canoes glided down the swift stream and bumped their prows into the pebbly beach groups of mounted warriors rode out of the forests into the clearing squaws with papooses maidens carrying wicker baskets and children playing with rude toys came trooping along the bridlepaths  gifts were presented during the morning after which the visitors were feasted in the afternoon all assembled in the grove to hear the preaching  the maple grove wherein the service was to be conducted might have been intended by nature for just such a purpose as it now fulfilled these trees were large spreading and situated far apart mossy stones and the thick carpet of grass afforded seats for the congregation  heckeweldera tall spare and kindly appearing mandirected the arranging of the congregation he placed the converted indians just behind the knoll upon which the presiding minister was to stand in a half circle facing the knoll he seated the chieftains and important personages of the various tribes he then made a short address in the indian language speaking of the work of the mission what wonders it had accomplished what more good work it hoped to do and concluded by introducing the young missionary  while heckewelder spoke jim who stood just behind employed the few moments in running his eye over the multitude the sight which met his gaze was one he thought he would never forget an involuntary word escaped him  magnificent he exclaimed  the shady glade had been transformed into a theater from which gazed a thousand dark still faces a thousand eagle plumes waved and ten thousand brighthued feathers quivered in the soft breeze the fantastically dressed scalps presented a contrast to the smooth unadorned heads of the converted redmen these proud plumes and defiant feathers told the difference between savage and christian  in front of the knoll sat fifty chiefs attentive and dignified representatives of every tribe as far west as the scioto river were numbered in that circle there were chiefs renowned for war for cunning for valor for wisdom their stately presence gave the meeting tenfold importance could these chiefs be interested moved the whole western world of indians might be civilized  hepote a maumee chief of whom it was said he had never listened to words of the paleface had the central position in this circle on his right and left respectively sat shaushoto and pipe implacable foes of all white men the latters aspect did not belie his reputation his coppercolored repulsive visage compelled fear it breathed vindictiveness and malignity a singular action of his was that he always in what must have been his arrogant vanity turned his profile to those who watched him and it was a remarkable one it sloped in an oblique line from the top of his forehead to his protruding chin resembling somewhat the carved bowl of his pipe which was of flint and a famed inheritance from his ancestors from it he took his name one solitary eagle plume its tip stained vermilion stuck from his scalplock it slated backward on a line with his profile  among all these chiefs striking as they were the figure of wingenund the delaware stood out alone  his position was at the extreme left of the circle where he leaned against a maple a long black mantle trimmed with spotless white enveloped him one bronzed arm circled by a heavy bracelet of gold held the mantle close about his lofty form his headdress which trailed to the ground was exceedingly beautiful the eagle plumes were of uniform length and pure white except the blackpointed tips  at his feet sat his daughter whispering winds her maidens were gathered round her she raised her soft black eyes shining with a wondrous light of surprise and expectation to the young missionarys face  beyond the circle the indians were massed together even beyond the limits of the glade under the trees on every side sat warriors astride their steeds some lounged on the green turf many reclined in the branches of lowspreading maples  as jim looked out over the sea of faces he started in surprise the sudden glance of fiery eyes had impelled his gaze he recognized silvertip the shawnee chief the indian sat motionless on a powerful black horse jim started again for the horse was joes thoroughbred lance but jim had no further time to think of joes enemy for heckewelder stepped back  jim took the vacated seat and with a farreaching resonant voice began his discourse to the indians  chieftains warriors maidens children of the forest listen and your ears shall hear no lie i am come from where the sun rises to tell you of the great spirit of the white man  many many moons ago as many as blades of grass grow on yonder plain the great spirit of whom i shall speak created the world he made the sparkling lakes and swift rivers the boundless plains and tangled forests over which he caused the sun to shine and the rain to fall he gave life to the kingly elk the graceful deer the rolling bison the bear the foxall the beasts and birds and fishes but he was not content for nothing he made was perfect in his sight he created the white man in his own image and from this first mans rib he created his matea woman he turned them free in a beautiful forest  life was fair in the beautiful forest the sun shone always the birds sang the waters flowed with music the flowers cast sweet fragrance on the air in this forest where fruit bloomed always was one tree the tree of life the apple of which they must not eat in all this beautiful forest of abundance this apple alone was forbidden them  now evil was born with woman a serpent tempted her to eat of the apple of life and she tempted the man to eat for their sin the great spirit commanded the serpent to crawl forever on his belly and he drove them from the beautiful forest the punishment for their sin was to be visited on their childrens children always until the end of time the two went afar into the dark forest to learn to live as best they might from them all tribes descended the world is wide a warrior might run all his days and not reach the setting sun where tribes of yellowskins live he might travel half his days toward the southwind where tribes of blackskins abound people of all colors inhabited the world they lived in hatred toward one another they shed each others blood they stole each others lands gold and women they sinned  many moons ago the great spirit sorrowed to see his chosen tribe the palefaces living in ignorance and sin he sent his only son to redeem them and said if they would listen and believe and teach the other tribes he would forgive their sin and welcome them to the beautiful forest  that was moons and moons ago when the paleface killed his brother for gold and lands and beat his women slaves to make them plant his corn the son of the great spirit lifted the cloud from the palefaces eyes and they saw and learned so pleased was the great spirit that he made the palefaces wiser and wiser and master of the world he bid them go afar to teach the ignorant tribes  to teach you is why the young paleface journeyed from the rising sun he wants no lands or power he has given all that he had he walks among you without gun or knife he can gain nothing but the happiness of opening the redmens eyes  the great spirit of whom i teach and the great manitou your idol are the same the happy hunting ground of the indian and the beautiful forest of the paleface are the same the paleface and the redman are the same there is but one great spirit that is god but one eternal home that is heaven but one human being that is man  the indian knows the habits of the beaver he can follow the paths of the forests he can guide his canoe through the foaming rapids he is honest he is brave he is great but he is not wise his wisdom is clouded with the original sin he lives in idleness he paints his face he makes his squaw labor for him instead of laboring for her he kills his brothers he worships the trees and rocks if he were wise he would not make gods of the swift arrow and bounding canoe of the flowering ash and the flaming flint for these things have not life in his dreams he sees his arrow speed to the reeling deer in his dreams he sees his canoe shoot over the crest of shining waves and in his mind he gives them life when his eyes are opened he will see they have no spirit the spirit is in his own heart it guides the arrow to the running deer and steers the canoe over the swirling current the spirit makes him find the untrodden paths and do brave deeds and love his children and his honor it makes him meet his foe face to face and if he is to die it gives him strength to diea man the spirit is what makes him different from the arrow the canoe the mountain and all the birds and beasts for it is born of the great spirit the creator of all him you must worship  redmen this worship is understanding your spirit and teaching it to do good deeds it is called christianity christianity is love if you will love the great spirit you will love your wives your children your brothers your friends your foesyou will love the palefaces no more will you idle in winter and wage wars in summer you will wear your knife and tomahawk only when you hunt for meat you will be kind gentle loving virtuousyou will have grown wise when your days are done you will meet all your loved ones in the beautiful forest there where the flowers bloom the fruits ripen always where the pleasant water glides and the summer winds whisper sweetly there peace will dwell forever  comrades be wise think earnestly forget the wicked paleface for there are many wicked palefaces they sell the serpent firewater they lie and steal and kill these palefaces eyes are still clouded if they do not open they will never see the beautiful forest you have much to forgive but those who forgive please the great spirit you must give yourselves to love but those who love are loved you must work but those who work are happy  behold the village of peace once it contained few now there are many where once the dark forest shaded the land see the cabins the farms the horses the cattle field on field of waving golden grain shine there under your eyes the earth has blossomed abundance idling and fighting made not these rich harvests belief made love love made wise eyes wise eyes saw and lo there came plenty  the proof of love is happiness these christian indians are happy they are at peace with the redman and the paleface they till the fields and work in the shops in days to come cabins and farms and fields of corn will be theirs they will bring up their children not to hide in the forest to slay but to walk hand in hand with the palefaces as equals  oh open your ears god speaks to you peace awaits you cast the bitterness from your hearts it is the serpentpoison while you hate god shuts his eyes you are great on the trail in the council in war now be great in forgiveness forgive the palefaces who have robbed you of your lands then will come peace if you do not forgive the war will go on you will lose lands and homes to find unmarked graves under the forest leaves revenge is sweet but it is not wise the price of revenge is blood and life root it out of your hearts love these christian indians love the missionaries as they love you love all living creatures your days are but few therefore cease the the strife let us say brothers that is gods word his law that is love that is christianity if you will say from your heart brother you are a christian  brothers the paleface teacher beseeches you think not of this long bloody war of your dishonored dead of your silenced wigwams of your nameless graves of your homeless children think of the future one word from you will make peace over all this broad land the paleface must honor a christian he can steal no christians land all the palefaces as many as the stars of the great white path dare not invade the village of peace for god smiles here listen to his words come unto me all that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest  over the multitude brooded an impressive solemn silence then an aged delaware chief rose with a mien of profound thought and slowly paced before the circle of chiefs presently he stopped turned to the awaiting indians and spoke  netawatwees is almost persuaded to be a christian he resumed his seat  another interval of penetrating quiet ensued at length a venerablelooking chieftain got up  white eyes hears the rumbling thunder in his ears the smoke blows from his eyes white eyes is the oldest chief of the lennilenape his days are many they are full they draw near the evening of his life he rejoices that wisdom is come before his sun is set  white eyes believes the young white father the ways of the great spirit are many as the fluttering leaves they are strange and secret as the flight of a loon white eyes believes the redmans happy hunting grounds need not be forgotten to love the palefaces god as a young brave pants and puzzles over his first trail so the grown warrior feels in his understanding of his god he gropes blindly through dark ravines  white eyes speaks few words today for he is learning wisdom he bids his people hearken to the voice of the white father war is wrong peace is best love is the way to peace the paleface advances one step nearer his god he labors for his home he keeps the peace he asks but little he frees his women that is well white eyes has spoken  the old chief slowly advanced toward the christian indians he laid aside his knife and tomahawk and then his eagle plumes and warbonnet bareheaded he seated himself among the converted redmen they began chanting in low murmuring tones  amid the breathless silence that followed this act of such great significance wingenund advanced toward the knoll with slow stately step his dark eye swept the glade with lightning scorn his glance alone revealed the passion that swayed him  wingenunds ears are keen they have heard a feather fall in the storm now they hear a softvoiced thrush wingenund thunders to his people to his friends to the chiefs of other tribes do not bury the hatchet the young white fathers tongue runs smooth like the gliding brook it sings as the thrush calls its mate listen but wait wait let time prove his beautiful tale let the moons go by over the village of peace  wingenund does not flaunt his wisdom he has grown old among his warriors he loves them he fears for them the dream of the palefaces beautiful forest glimmers as the rainbow glows over the laughing falls of the river the dream of the paleface is too beautiful to come true in the days of long ago when wingenunds forefathers heard not the palefaces ax they lived in love and happiness such as the young white father dreams may come again they waged no wars a white dove sat in every wigwam the lands were theirs and they were rich the paleface came with his leaden death his burning firewater his ringing ax and the glory of the redmen faded forever  wingenund seeks not to inflame his braves to anger he is sick of bloodspillingnot from fear for wingenund cannot feel fear but he asks his people to wait remember the gifts of the paleface ever contained a poisoned arrow wingenunds heart is sore the day of the redman is gone his sun is setting wingenund feels already the gray shades of evening  he stopped one long moment as if to gather breath for his final charge to his listeners then with a magnificent gesture he thundered  is the delaware a fool when wingenund can cross unarmed to the big water he shall change his mind when deathwind ceases to blow his bloody trail over the fallen leaves wingenund will believe    chapter xiii  as the summer waned each succeeding day with its melancholy calm its changing lights and shades its cool damp evening winds growing more and more suggestive of autumn the little colony of white people in the village of peace led busy eventful lives  upwards of fifty indians several of them important chiefs had become converted since the young missionary began preaching heckewelder declared that this was a wonderful showing and if it could be kept up would result in gaining a hold on the indian tribes which might not be shaken heckewelder had succeeded in interesting the savages west of the village of peace to the extent of permitting him to establish missionary posts in two other localitiesone near goshhocking a delaware town and one on the muskingong the principal river running through central ohio he had with his helpers young and edwards journeyed from time to time to these points preaching making gifts and soliciting help from chiefs  the most interesting feature perhaps of the varied life of the missionary party was a rivalry between young and edwards for the elder miss wells usually nells attractiveness appealed more to men than kates however in this instance although the sober teachers of the gospel admired nells winsome beauty they fell in love with kate the missionaries were both under forty and good honest men devoted to the work which had engrossed them for years although they were ardent lovers certainly they were not picturesque two homelier men could hardly have been found moreover the sacrifice of their lives to missionary work had taken them far from the companionship of women of their own race so that they lacked the ease of manner which women like to see in men young and edwards were awkward almost uncouth embarrassment would not have done justice to their state of feeling while basking in the shine of kates quiet smile they were happy foolish and speechless  if kate shared in the merriment of the othersheckewelder could not conceal his and nell did not try very hard to hide hersshe never allowed a suspicion of it to escape she kept the easy even tenor of her life always kind and gracious in her quaint way and precisely the same to both her lovers no doubt she well knew that each possessed under all his rough exterior a heart of gold  one day the genial heckewelder lost or pretended to lose his patience  say you worthy gentlemen are becoming ornamental instead of useful all this changing of coats trimming of mustaches and eloquent sighing doesnt seem to have affected the young lady ive a notion to send you both to maumee town one hundred miles away this young lady is charming i admit but if she is to keep on seriously hindering the work of the moravian mission i must object as for that matter i might try conclusions myself im as young as either of you and i flatter myself much handsomer youll have a dangerous rival presently settle it you cant both have her settle it  this outburst from their usually kind leader placed the earnest but awkward gentlemen in a terrible plight  on the afternoon following the crisis heckewelder took mr wells to one of the indian shops and jim and nell went canoeing young and edwards after conferring for one long trying hour determined on settling the question  young was a pale slight man very homely except when he smiled his smile not only broke up the plainness of his face but seemed to chase away a serious shadow allowing his kindly gentle spirit to shine through he was nervous and had a timid manner edwards was his opposite being a man of robust frame with a heavy face and a manner that would have suggested selfconfidence in another man  they were true and tried friends  dave i couldnt ask her said young trembling at the very thought besides theres no hope for me i know it thats why im afraid why i dont want to ask her whatd such a glorious creature see in a poor puny little thing like me  george youre not overhandsome admitted dave shaking his head but you can never tell about women sometimes they like even little insignificant fellows dont be too scared about asking her besides it will make it easier for me you might tell her about meyou know sort of feel her out so id  daves voice failed him here but he had said enough and that was most discouraging to poor george dave was so busy screwing up his courage that he forgot all about his friend  no i couldnt gasped george falling into a chair he was ghastly pale i couldnt ask her to accept me let alone do another mans wooing she thinks more of you shell accept you  you really think so whispered dave nervously  i know she will youre such a fine big figure of a man shell take you and ill be glad this fever and fretting has about finished me when shes yours ill not be so bad ill be happy in your happiness but dave youll let me see her occasionally wont you go hurryget it over  yes we must have it over replied dave getting up with a brave effort truly if he carried that determined front to his ladylove he would look like a masterful lover but when he got to the door he did not at all resemble a conqueror  youre sure shecares for me asked dave for the hundredth time this time as always his friend was faithful and convincing  i know she does gohurry i tell you i cant stand this any longer cried george pushing dave out of the door  you wont gofirst whispered dave clinging to the door  i wont go at all i couldnt ask heri dont want hergo get out  dave started reluctantly toward the adjoining cabin from the open window of which came the song of the young woman who was responsible for all this trouble george flung himself on his bed what a relief to feel it was all over he lay there with eves shut for hours as it seemed after a time dave came in george leaped to his feet and saw his friend stumbling over a chair somehow dave did not look as usual he seemed changed or shrunken and his face wore a discomfited miserable expression  well cried george sharply even to his highly excited imagination this did not seem the proper condition for a victorious lover  she refusedrefused me faltered dave she was very sweet and kind said something about being my sisteri dont remember just whatbut she wouldnt have me  what did you say to her whispered george a paralyzing hope almost rendering him speechless  ii told her everything i could think of replied dave despondently even what you said  what i said dave what did you tell her i said  why you knowabout she cared for methat you were sure of it and that you didnt want her  jackass roared george rising out of his meekness like a lion roused from slumber  didnt yousay so inquired dave weakly  no no no idiot  as one possessed george rushed out of the cabin and a moment later stood disheveled and frantic before kate  did that fool say i didnt love you he demanded  kate looked up startled but as an understanding of georges wild aspect and wilder words dawned upon her she resumed her usual calm demeanor looking again to see if this passionate young man was indeed george she turned her face as she said  if you mean mr edwards yes i believe he did say as much indeed from his manner he seemed to have monopolized all the love near the village of peace  but its not true i do love you i love you to distraction i have loved you ever since i first saw you i told dave that heckewelder knows it even the indians know it cried george protesting vehemently against the disparaging allusion to his affections he did not realize he was making a most impassioned declaration of love when he was quite out of breath he sat down and wiped his moist brow  a pink bloom tinged kates cheeks and her eyes glowed with a happy light but george never saw these womanly evidences of pleasure  of course i know you dont care for me  did mr edwards tell you so asked kate glancing up quickly  why yes he has often said he thought that indeed he always seemed to regard himself as the fortunate object of your affections i always believed he was  but it wasnt true  what  its not true  whats not true  ohabout mynot caring  kate cried george quite overcome with rapture he fell over two chairs getting to her but he succeeded and fell on his knees to kiss her hand  foolish boy it has been you all the time whispered kate with her quiet smile                                  look here downs come to the door see there said heckewelder to jim  somewhat surprised at heckewelders grave tone jim got up from the suppertable and looked out of the door he saw two tall indians pacing to and fro under the maples it was still early twilight and light enough to see clearly one indian was almost naked the lithe graceful symmetry of his dark figure standing out in sharp contrast to the gaunt gaudilycostumed form of the other  silvertip girty exclaimed jim in a low voice  girty i knew of course but i was not sure the other was the shawnee who captured you and your brother replied heckewelder drawing jim into another room  what do they mean by loitering around the village inquired jim apprehensively whenever he heard girtys name mentioned or even thought of him he remembered with a shudder the renegades allusion to the buzzards jim never saw one of these carrion birds soaring overhead but his thoughts instantly reverted to the frontier ruffian and his horrible craving  i dont know answered heckewelder girty has been here several times of late i saw him conferring with pipe at goshhocking i hope theres no deviltry afoot pipe is a relentless enemy of all christians and girty is a fiend a hyena i think perhaps it will be well for you and the girls to stay indoors while girty and silvertip are in the village  that evening the entire missionary party were gathered in mr wells room heckewelder told stories of indian life nell sang several songs and kate told many amusing things said and done by the little indian boys in her class at the school thus the evening passed pleasantly for all  so next wednesday i am to perform the great ceremony remarked heckewelder laying his hand kindly on youngs knee well celebrate the first white wedding in the village of peace  young looked shyly down at his boots edwards crossed one leg over the other and coughed loudly to hide his embarrassment kate wore as usual her pensive smile nells eyes twinkled and she was about to speak when heckewelders quizzical glance in her direction made her lips mute  i hope ill have another wedding on my hands soon he said placidly  this ordinary remark had an extraordinary effect nell turned with burning cheeks and looked out of the window jim frowned fiercely and bit his lips edwards began to laugh and even mr wells serious face lapsed into a smile  i mean ive picked out a nice little delaware squaw for dave said heckewelder seeing his badinage had somehow gone amiss  ohh suddenly cried nell in shuddering tones  they all gazed at her in amazement every vestige of color had receded from her face leaving it marblelike her eves were fixed in startled horror suddenly she relaxed her grasp on the windowsill and fell back limp and senseless  heckewelder ran to the door to look out while the others bent over the unconscious girl endeavoring to revive her presently a fluttering breath and a quivering of her dark lashes noted a return of suspended life then her beautiful eyes opened wide to gaze with wonder and fear into the grave faces bent so anxiously over her  nell dearest you are safe what was it what frightened you so said kate tenderly  oh it was fearful gasped nell sitting up she clung to her sister with one hand while the other grasped jims sleeve  i was looking out into the dark when suddenly i beheld a face a terrible face cried nell those who watched her marveled at the shrinking awful fear in her eyes it was right by the window i could have touched it such a greedy wolfish face with a long hooked nose the eyes oh the eyes ill never forget them they made me sick they paralyzed me it wasnt an indians face it belonged to that white man that awful white man i never saw him before but i knew him  girty said heckewelder who had come in with his quiet step he looked in at the window calm yourself nellie the renegade has gone  the incident worried them all at the time and made nell nervous for several days but as girty had disappeared and nothing more was heard of him gradually they forgot kates wedding day dawned with all the little party well and happy early in the afternoon jim and nell accompanied by kate and her lover started out into the woods just beyond the clearing for the purpose of gathering wild flowers to decorate the cabin  we are both thinking ofhim jim said after he and nell had walked some little way in silence  yes answered nell simply  i hopei pray joe comes back but if he doesntnellwont you care a little for me  he received no answer but nell turned her face away  we both loved him if hes gone forever our very love for him should bring us together i knowi know he would have wished that  jim dont speak of love to me now she whispered then she turned to the others come quickly here are great clusters of wild clematis and goldenrod how lovely let us gather a quantity  the young men had almost buried the girls under huge masses of the beautiful flowers when the soft tread of moccasined feet caused them all to turn in surprise six savages stood waistdeep in the bushes where they had lain concealed fierce painted visages scowled from behind leveled rifles  dont yell cried a hoarse voice in english following the voice came a snapping of twigs and then two other figures came into view they were girty and silvertip  dont yell er ill leave you layin here fer the buzzards said the renegade he stepped forward and grasped young at the same time speaking in the indian language and pointing to a nearby tree strange to relate the renegade apparently wanted no bloodshed while one of the savages began to tie young to the tree girty turned his gaze on the girls his little yellow eyes glinted he stroked his chin with a bony hand and his dark repulsive face was wreathed in a terrible meaning smile  ive been layin fer you he croaked eyeing nell yere the purtiest lass ceptin mebbe bet zane i ever seed on the border i got cheated outen her but ive got you arter i feed yer injun preacher to ther buzzards mebbe yell larn to love me  nell gazed one instant into the monsters face her terrorstricken eyes were piteous to behold she tried to speak but her voice failed then like stricken bird she fell on the grass    chapter xiv  not many miles from the village of peace rose an irregular chain of hills the first faint indications of the grand appalachian mountain system these ridges were thickly wooded with white oak poplar and hickory among which a sentinel pine reared here and there its evergreen head there were clefts in the hills passes lined by graystoned cliffs below which ran clear brooks tumbling over rocks in a hurry to meet their majestic father the ohio  one of these valleys so narrow that the sun seldom brightened the merry brook made a deep cut in the rocks the head of this valley tapered until the walls nearly met it seemed to lose itself in the shade of fernfaced cliffs shadowed as they were by fir trees leaning over the brink as though to search for secrets of the ravine so deep and dark and cool was this sequestered nook that here late summer had not dislodged early spring everywhere was a soft fresh bright green the old gray cliffs were festooned with ferns lichens and moss under a great shelving rock damp and stained by the coppercolored water dripping down its side was a dewy dell into which the sunshine had never peeped here the swift brook tarried lovingly making a wide turn under the cliff as though loth to leave this quiet nook and then leaped once more to enthusiasm in its murmuring flight  life abounded in this wild beautiful almost inaccessible spot little brown and yellow birds flitted among the trees thrushes ran along the leafstrewn ground orioles sang their melancholy notes robins and flickers darted beneath the spreading branches squirrels scurried over the leaves like little whirlwinds and leaped daringly from the swinging branches or barked noisily from woody perches rabbits hopped inquisitively here and there while nibbling at the tender shoots of sassafras and laurel  along this flowerskirted stream a tall young man carrying a rifle cautiously stepped peering into the branches overhead a gray flash shot along a limb of a white oak then the bushy tail of a squirrel flitted into a wellprotected notch from whence no doubt a keen little eye watched the hunters every movement  the rifle was raised then lowered the hunter walked around the tree presently up in the tree top snug under a knotty limb he spied a little ball of gray fur grasping a branch of underbush he shook it vigorously the thrashing sound worried the gray squirrel for he slipped from his retreat and stuck his nose over the limb crack with a scratching and tearing of bark the squirrel loosened his hold and then fell alighting with a thump as the hunter picked up his quarry a streak of sunshine glinting through the tree top brightened his face  the hunter was joe  he was satisfied now for after stowing the squirrel in the pocket of his hunting coat he shouldered his rifle and went back up the ravine presently a dull roar sounded above the babble of the brook it grew louder as he threaded his way carefully over the stones spots of white foam flecked the brook passing under the gray stained cliff joe turned around a rocky corner and came to an abrupt end of the ravine a waterfall marked the spot where the brook entered the water was brown as it took the leap light green when it thinned out and below as it dashed on the stones it became a beautiful sheeny white  upon a flat rock so near the cascade that spray flew over him sat another hunter the roaring falls drowned all other sounds yet the man roused from his dreamy contemplation of the waterfall when joe rounded the corner  i heerd four shots he said as joe came up  yes i got a squirrel for every shot  wetzel led the way along a narrow foot trail which gradually wound toward the top of the ravine this path emerged presently some distance above the falls on the brink of a bluff it ran along the edge of the precipice a few yards then took a course back into densely wooded thickets just before stepping out on the open cliff wetzel paused and peered keenly on all sides there was no living thing to be seen the silence was the deep unbroken calm of the wilderness  wetzel stepped to the bluff and looked over the stony wall opposite was only thirty feet away and somewhat lower from wetzels action it appeared as if he intended to leap the fissure in truth many a band of indians pursuing the hunter into this rocky fastness had come out on the bluff and marveling at what they thought wetzels prowess believed he had made a wonderful leap thus eluding them but he had never attempted that leap first because he knew it was wellnigh impossible and secondly there had never been any necessity for such risk  any one leaning over this cliff would have observed perhaps ten feet below a narrow ledge projecting from the face of the rock he would have imagined if he were to drop on that ledge there would be no way to get off and he would be in a worse predicament  without a moments hesitation wetzel swung himself over the ledge joe followed suit at one end of this lower ledge grew a hardy shrub of the ironwood species and above it a scrub pine leaned horizontally out over the ravine laying his rifle down wetzel grasped a strong root and cautiously slid over the side when all of his body had disappeared with the exception of his sinewy fingers they loosened their hold on the root grasped the rifle and dragged it down out of sight quietly with similar caution joe took hold of the same root let himself down and when at full length swung himself in under the ledge his feet found a pocket in the cliff letting go of the root he took his rifle and in another second was safe  of all wetzels retreatsfor he had manyhe considered this one the safest the cavern under the ledge he had discovered by accident one day being hotly pursued by shawnees he had been headed off on this cliff and had let himself down on the ledge intending to drop from it to the tops of the trees below taking advantage of every little aid he hung over by means of the shrub and was in the act of leaping when he saw that the cliff shelved under the ledge while within reach of his feet was the entrance to a cavern he found the cave to be small with an opening at the back into a split in the rock evidently the place had been entered from the rear by bears who used the hole for winter sleeping quarters by crawling on his hands and knees wetzel found the rear opening thus he had established a hiding place where it was almost impossible to locate him he provisioned his retreat which he always entered by the cliff and left by the rear  an evidence of wetzels strange nature and of his love for this wild home manifested itself when he bound joe to secrecy it was unlikely even if the young man ever did get safely out of the wilderness that any stories he might relate would reveal the hunters favorite rendezvous but wetzel seriously demanded this secrecy as earnestly as if the forest were full of indians and white men all prowling in search of his burrow  joe was in the seventh heaven of delight and took to the free life as a wild gosling takes to the water no place had ever appealed to him as did this dark silent hole far up on the side of a steep cliff his interest in wetzel soon passed into a great admiration and from that deepened to love  this afternoon when they were satisfied that all was well within their refuge joe laid aside his rifle and whistling softly began to prepare supper the back part of the cave permitted him to stand erect and was large enough for comparative comfort there was a neat little stone fireplace and several cooking utensils and gourds from time to time wetzel had brought these things a pile of wood and a bundle of pine cones lay in one corner haunches of dried beef bear and buffalo meat hung from pegs a bag of parched corn another of dried apples lay on a rocky shelf nearby hung a powderhorn filled with salt and pepper in the cleft back of the cave was a spring of clear cold water  the wants of woodsmen are few and simple joe and wetzel with appetites whetted by their stirring outdoor life relished the frugal fare as they could never have enjoyed a feast as the shadows of evening entered the cave they lighted their pipes to partake of the hunters sweetest solace a quiet smoke  strange as it may appear this lonely stern indianhunter and the reckless impulsive boy were admirably suited for companionship wetzel had taken a liking to the young man when he led the brothers to fort henry subsequent events strengthened his liking and now many days after joe having followed him into the forest a strong attachment had been insensibly forged between them  wetzel understood joes burning desire to roam the forests but he half expected the lad would soon grow tired of this roving life but exactly the opposite symptoms were displayed the hunter had intended to take his comrade on a hunting trip and to return with him after that was over to fort henry they had now been in the woods for weeks and every day in some way had joe showed his mettle wetzel finally admitted him into the secrets of his most cherished hiding place he did not want to hurt the lads feelings by taking him back to the settlement he could not send him back so the days wore on swiftly full of heartsatisfying incident and life with man and boy growing closer in an intimacy that was as warm as it was unusual  two reasons might account for this first there is no sane human being who is not better off for companionship an exile would find something of happiness in one who shared his misery and secondly joe was a most acceptable comrade even for a slayer of indians wedded as wetzel was to the forest trails to his lonely life to the nemesispursuit he had followed for eighteen long years he was still a white man kind and gentle in his quiet hours and because of this though he knew it not still capable of affection he had never known youth his manhood had been one pitiless warfare against his sworn foes but once in all those years had his sore cold heart warmed and that was toward a woman who was not for him his life had held only one purposea bloody one yet the man had a heart and he could not prevent it from responding to another in his simple ignorance he rebelled against this affection for anything other than his forest homes man is weak against hate what can he avail against love the dark caverns of wetzels great heart opened admitting to their gloomy depths this stranger so now a new love was born in that cheerless heart where for so long a lonely inmate the ghost of old love had dwelt in chill seclusion  the feeling of comradeship which wetzel had for joe was something altogether new in the hunters life true he had hunted with jonathan zane and accompanied expeditions where he was forced to sleep with another scout but a companion not to say friend he had never known joe was a boy wilder than an eagle yet he was a man he was happy and enthusiastic still his good spirits never jarred on the hunter they were restrained he never asked questions as would seem the case in any eager lad he waited until he was spoken to he was apt he never forgot anything he had the eye of a born woodsman and lastly perhaps what went far with wetzel he was as strong and supple as a young lynx and absolutely fearless  on this evening wetzel and joe followed their usual custom they smoked a while before lying down to sleep tonight the hunter was even more silent than usual and the lad tired out with his days tramp lay down on a bed of fragrant boughs  wetzel sat there in the gathering gloom while he pulled slowly on his pipe the evening was very quiet the birds had ceased their twittering the wind had died away it was too early for the bay of a wolf the wail of a panther or hoot of an owl there was simply perfect silence  the lads deep even breathing caught wetzels ear and he found himself meditating as he had often of late on this new something that had crept into his life for joe loved him he could not fail to see that the lad had preferred to roam with the lonely indianhunter through the forests to encounter the perils and hardships of a wild life rather than accept the smile of fortune and of love wetzel knew that colonel zane had taken a liking to the boy and had offered him work and a home and also the hunter remembered the warm light he had seen in nells hazel eyes musing thus the man felt stir in his heart an emotion so long absent that it was unfamiliar the avenger forgot for a moment his brooding plans he felt strangely softened when he laid his head on the rude pillow it was with some sense of gladness that although he had always desired a lonely life and wanted to pass it in the fulfillment of his vow his loneliness was now shared by a lad who loved him  joe was awakened by the merry chirp of a chipmunk that every morning ran along the seamy side of the opposite wall of the gorge getting up he went to the back of the cave where he found wetzel combing out his long hair the lad thrust his hands into the cold pool and bathed his face the water was icy cold and sent an invigorating thrill through him then he laughed as he took a rude comb wetzel handed to him  my scalp is nothing to make an indian very covetous is it said he eyeing in admiration the magnificent black hair that fell over the hunters shoulders  itll grow answered wetzel  joe did not wonder at the care wetzel took of his hair nor did he misunderstand the hunters simple pride wetzel was very careful of his rifle he was neat and clean about his person he brushed his buckskin costume he polished his knife and tomahawk but his hair received more attention than all else it required much care when combed out it reached fully to his knees joe had seen him after he returned from a long hunt work patiently for an hour with his wooden comb and not stop until every little burr was gone or tangle smoothed out then he would comb it again in the morningthis of course when time permittedand twist and tie it up so as to offer small resistance to his slipping through the underbush joe knew the hunters simplicity was such that if he cut off his hair it would seem he feared the indiansfor that streaming black hair the indians had long coveted and sworn to take it would make any brave a famous chief and was the theme of many a savage war tale  after breakfast wetzel said to joe  you stay here an ill look round some mebbe ill come back soon and well go out an kill a buffalo injuns sometimes foller up a buffalo trail an i want to be sure none of the varlets are chasin that herd we saw today  wetzel left the cave by the rear it took him fifteen minutes to crawl to the head of the tortuous stony passage lifting the stone which closed up the aperture he looked out and listened then rising he replaced the stone and passed down the wooded hillside  it was a beautiful morning the dew glistened on the green leaves the sun shone bright and warm the birds warbled in the trees the hunters moccasins pressed so gently on the moss and leaves that they made no more sound than the soft foot of a panther his trained ear was alert to catch any unfamiliar noise his keen eyes sought first the remoter open glades and glens then bent their gaze on the mossy bluff beneath his feet fox squirrels dashed from before him into bushy retreats grouse whirred away into the thickets startled deer whistled and loped off with their whiteflags upraised wetzel knew from the action of these denizens of the woods that he was the only creature not native to these haunts who had disturbed them this morning otherwise the deer would not have been grazing but lying low in some close thicket fox squirrels seldom or never were disturbed by a hunter twice in one day for after being frightened these little animals wilder and shyer than gray squirrels remained hidden for hours and grouse that have been flushed a little while before always get up unusually quick and fly very far before alighting  wetzel circled back over the hill took a long survey from a rocky eminence and then reconnoitered the lowland for several miles he located the herd of buffalo and satisfying himself there were no indians nearfor the bison were grazing quietlyhe returned to the cave a soft whistle into the back door of the rocky home told joe that the hunter was waiting  coast clear whispered the lad thrusting his head out of the entrance his gray eyes gleamed brightly showing his eager spirit  the hunter nodded and throwing his rifle in the hollow of his arm proceeded down the hill joe followed closely endeavoring as wetzel had trained him to make each step precisely in the hunters footprints the lad had soon learned to step nimbly and softly as a cat when half way down the bill wetzel paused  see anythin he whispered  joe glanced on all sides many mistakes had taught him to be cautious he had learned from experience that for every woodland creature he saw there were ten watching his every move just now he could not see even a little red squirrel everywhere were sturdy hickory and oak trees thickets and hazelnuts slender ash saplings and in the open glades patches of sumach rotting trees lay on the ground while ferns nodded long slender heads over the fallen monarchs joe could make out nothing but the colors of the woods the gray of the tree trunks and in the openings through the forestgreen the dead purple haze of forests farther on he smiled and shaking his head at the hunter by his action admitted failure  try again dead ahead whispered wetzel  joe bent a direct gaze on the clump of sassafras one hundred feet ahead he searched the open places the shadowseven the branches then he turned his eyes slowly to the right whatever was discernible to human vision he studied intently suddenly his eye became fixed on a small object protruding from behind a beech tree it was pointed and in color darker than the gray bark of the beech it had been a very easy matter to pass over this little thing but now that the lad saw it he knew to what it belonged  thats a bucks ear he replied  hardly had he finished speaking when wetzel intentionally snapped a twig there was a crash and commotion in the thicket branches moved and small saplings waved then out into the open glade bounded a large buck with a whistle of alarm throwing his rifle to a level joe was trying to cover the bounding deer when the hunter struck up his piece  lad dont kill fer the sake of killin he said quietly we have plenty of venison well go arter a buffalo i hev a hankerin fer a good rump steak  half an hour later the hunters emerged from the forest into a wide plain of waving grass it was a kind of oval valley encircled by hills and had been at one time perhaps covered with water joe saw a herd of large animals browsing like cattle in a meadow his heart beat high for until that moment the only buffalo he had seen were the few which stood on the river banks as the raft passed down the ohio he would surely get a shot at one of these huge fellows  wetzel bade joe do exactly as he did whereupon he dropped on his hands and knees and began to crawl through the long grass this was easy for the hunter but very bard for the lad to accomplish still he managed to keep his comrade in sight which was a matter for congratulation because the man crawled as fast as he walked at length after what to joe seemed a very long time the hunter paused  are we near enough whispered joe breathlessly  nope were just circlin on em the winds not right an im afeered theyll get our scent  wetzel rose carefully and peeped over the top of the grass then dropping on all fours he resumed the advance  he paused again presently and waited for joe to come up  see here young fellar remember never hurry unless the bizness calls fer speed an then act like lightnin  thus admonishing the eager lad wetzel continued to crawl it was easy for him joe wondered how those wide shoulders got between the weeds and grasses without breaking or at least shaking them but so it was  flat now whispered wetzel putting his broad hand on joes back and pressing him down nows yer time fer good practice trail yer rifle over yer backif yer careful it wont slide offan reach out far with one arm an dig yer fingers in deep then pull yerself forrard  wetzel slipped through the grass like a huge buckskin snake his long lithe body wormed its way among the reeds but for joe even with the advantage of having the hunters trail to follow it was difficult work the dry reeds broke under him and the stalks of sawgrass shook he worked persistently at it learning all the while and improving with every rod he was surprised to hear a swish followed by a dull blow on the ground raising his head he looked forward he saw the hunter wipe his tomahawk on the grass  snake whispered wetzel  joe saw a huge blacksnake squirming in the grass its head had been severed he caught glimpses of other snakes gliding away and glossy round moles darting into their holes a gray rabbit started off with a leap  were near enough whispered wetzel stopping behind a bush he rose and surveyed the plain then motioned joe to look  joe raised himself on his knees as his gaze reached the level of the grassy plain his heart leaped not fifty yards away was a great shaggy black buffalo he was the king of the herd but ill at ease for he pawed the grass and shook his huge head near him were several cows and a halfgrown calf beyond was the main herd extending as far as joe could seea great sea of black humps the lad breathed hard as he took in the grand sight  pick out the little fellarthe reddishbrown onean plug him behind the shoulder shoot close now fer if we miss mebbe i cant hit one because im not used to shootin at sich small marks  wetzels rare smile lighted up his dark face probably he could have shot a fly off the horn of the bull if one of the big flies or bees plainly visible as they swirled around the huge head had alighted there  joe slowly raised his rifle he had covered the calf and was about to pull the trigger when with a sagacity far beyond his experience as hunter he whispered to wetzel  if i fire they may run toward us  nope theyll run away answered wetzel thinking the lad was as keen as an indian  joe quickly covered the calf again and pulled the trigger bellowing loud the big bull dashed off the herd swung around toward the west and soon were galloping off with a lumbering roar the shaggy humps bobbed up and down like hot angry waves on a stormblackened sea  upon going forward wetzel and joe found the calf lying dead in the grass  you might hev did bettern that remarked the hunter as he saw where the bullet had struck you went a little too fer back but mebbe thet was cause the calf stepped as you shot    chapter xv  so the days passed swiftly dreamily each one bringing joe a keener delight in a single month he was as good a woodsman as many pioneers who had passed years on the border for he had the advantage of a teacher whose woodcraft was incomparable besides he was naturally quick in learning and with all his interest centered upon forest lore it was no wonder he assimilated much of wetzels knowledge he was ever willing to undertake anything whereby he might learn often when they were miles away in the dense forest far from their cave he asked wetzel to let him try to lead the way back to camp and he never failed once though many times he got off a straight course thereby missing the easy travelling  joe did wonderfully well but he lacked as nearly all white men do the subtler intuitive forestinstinct which makes the indian as much at home in the woods as in his teepee wetzel had this developed to a high degree it was born in him years of training years of passionate unrelenting search for indians had given him a knowledge of the wilds that was incomprehensible to white men and appalling to his red foes  joe saw how wetzel used this ability but what it really was baffled him he realized that words were not adequate to explain fully this great art its possession required a marvelously keen vision an eye perfectly familiar with every creature tree rock shrub and thing belonging in the forest an eye so quick in flight as to detect instantly the slightest change in nature or anything unnatural to that environment the hearing must be delicate like that of a deer and the finer it is the keener will be the woodsman lastly there is the feeling that prompts the old hunter to say no game today it is something in him that speaks when as he sees a nighthawk circling low near the ground he says a storm tomorrow it is what makes an indian at home in any wilderness the clouds may hide the guiding star the northing may be lost there may be no moss on the trees or difference in their bark the ridges may be flat or lost altogether and there may be no watercourses yet the indian brave always goes for his teepee straight as a crow flies it was this voice which rightly bade wetzel when he was baffled by an indians trail fading among the rocks to cross or circle or advance in the direction taken by his wily foe  joe had practiced trailing deer and other hoofed game until he was true as a hound then he began to perfect himself in the art of following a human being through the forest except a few old indian trails which the rain had half obliterated he had no tracks to discover save wetzels and these were as hard to find as the airy course of a grosbeak on soft ground or marshy grass which wetzel avoided where he could he left a faint trail but on a hard surface for all the traces he left he might as well not have gone over the ground at all  joes persistence stood him in good stead he hung on and the more he failed the harder he tried often he would slip out of the cave after wetzel had gone and try to find which way he had taken in brief the lad became a fine marksman a good hunter and a close persevering student of the wilderness he loved the woods and all they contained he learned the habits of the wild creatures each deer each squirrel each grouse that he killed taught him some lesson  he was always up with the lark to watch the sun rise red and grand over the eastern hills and chase away the white mist from the valleys even if he was not hunting or roaming the woods if it was necessary for him to lie low in camp awaiting wetzels return he was always content many hours he idled away lying on his back with the west wind blowing softly over him his eye on the distant hills where the cloud shadows swept across with slow majestic movement like huge ships at sea  if wetzel and joe were far distant from the cave as was often the case they made camp in the open woods and it was here that joes contentment was fullest twilight shades stealing down over the campfire the cheery glow of red embers the crackling of dry stocks the sweet smell of wood smoke all had for the lad a subtle potent charm  the hunter would broil a venison steak or a partridge on the coals then they would light their pipes and smoke while twilight deepened the oppressive stillness of the early evening hour always brought to the younger man a sensation of awe at first he attributed this to the fact that he was new to this life however as the days passed and the emotion remained nay grew stronger he concluded it was imparted by this close communion with nature deep solemn tranquil the gloaming hour brought him no ordinary fullness of joy and clearness of perception  do you ever feel this stillness he asked wetzel one evening as they sat near their flickering fire  the hunter puffed his pipe and like an indian seemed to let the question take deep root  ive scalped redskins every hour in the day ceptin twilight he replied  joe wondered no longer whether the hunter was too hardened to feel this beautiful tranquillity that hour which wooed wetzel from his implacable pursuit was indeed a bewitching one  there was never a time when joe lay alone in camp waiting for wetzel that he did not hope the hunter would return with information of indians the man never talked about the savages and if he spoke at all it was to tell of some incident of his days travel one evening he came back with a large black fox that he had killed  what beautiful glossy fur said joe i never saw a black fox before  ive been layin fer this fellar some time replied wetzel as he began his first evening task that of combing his hair jest back here in a clump of cottonwoods theres a holler log full of leaves happenin to see a blacksnake sneakin round i thought mebbe he was up to somethin so i investigated an found a nest full of young rabbits i killed the snake an arter that took an interest in em every time i passed id look in at the bunnies an each time i seen signs that some tarnal varmint had been prowlin round one day i missed a bunny an next day another so on until only one was left a peart white and gray little scamp somethin was stealin of em an it made me mad so yistidday an today i watched an finally i plugged this black thief yes hes got a glossy coat but hes a bad un fer all his fine looks these black foxes are bigger stronger an cunniner than red ones in every litter youll find a dark one the black sheep of the family because he grows so much faster an steals all the food from the others the mother jest takes him by the nape of the neck an chucks him out in the world to shift fer hisself an its a good thing  the next day wetzel told joe they would go across country to seek new game fields accordingly the two set out and tramped industriously until evening they came upon a country no less beautiful than the one they had left though the picturesque cliffs and rugged hills had given way to a rolling land the luxuriance of which was explained by the abundant springs and streams forests and fields were thickly interspersed with bubbling springs narrow and deep streams and here and there a small lake with a running outlet  wetzel had said little concerning this region but that little was enough to rouse all joes eagerness for it was to the effect that they were now in a country much traversed by indians especially runners and hunting parties travelling from north to south the hunter explained that through the center of this tract ran a buffalo road that the buffalo always picked out the straightest lowest and dryest path from one range to another and the indians followed these first pathfinders  joe and wetzel made camp on the bank of a stream that night and as the lad watched the hunter build a hidden campfire he peered furtively around half expecting to see dark forms scurrying through the forest wetzel was extremely cautious he stripped pieces of bark from fallen trees and built a little hut over his firewood he rubbed some powder on a piece of punk and then with flint and steel dropped two or three sparks on the inflammable substance soon he had a blaze he arranged the covering so that not a ray of light escaped when the flames had subsided and the wood had burned down to a glowing bed of red he threw aside the bark and broiled the strips of venison they had brought with them  they rested on a bed of boughs which they had cut and arranged alongside a huge log for hours joe lay awake he could not sleep he listened to the breeze rustling the leaves and shivered at the thought of the sighing wind he had once heard moan through the forest presently he turned over the slight noise instantly awakened wetzel who lifted his dark face while he listened intently he spoke one word sleep and lay back again on the leaves joe forced himself to be quiet relaxed all his muscles and soon slumbered  on the morrow wetzel went out to look over the hunting prospects about noon he returned joe was surprised to find some slight change in the hunter he could not tell what it was  i seen injun sign said wetzel theres no tellin how soon we may run agin the sneaks we cant hunt here like as not theres hurons and delawares skulkin round i think id better take you back to the village  its all on my account you say that said joe  sure wetzel replied  if you were alone what would you do  i calkilate id hunt fer some redskinned game  the supreme moment had come joes heart beat hard he could not miss this opportunity he must stay with the hunter he looked closely at wetzel  i wont go back to the village he said  the hunter stood in his favorite position leaning on his long rifle and made no response  i wont go continued joe earnestly let me stay with you if at any time i hamper you or can not keep the pace then leave me to shift for myself but dont make me go until i weaken let me stay  fire and fearlessness spoke in joes every word and his gray eyes contracted with their peculiar steely flash plain it was that while he might fail to keep pace with wetzel he did not fear this dangerous country and if it must be would face it alone  wetzel extended his broad hand and gave his comrades a viselike squeeze to allow the lad to remain with him was more than he would have done for any other person in the world far better to keep the lad under his protection while it was possible for joe was taking that wartrail which had for every hunter somewhere along its bloody course a bullet a knife or a tomahawk wetzel knew that joe was conscious of this inevitable conclusion for it showed in his white face and in the resolve in his big gray eyes  so there in the shade of a towering oak the indiankiller admitted the boy into his friendship and into a life which would no longer be play but eventful stirring hazardous  wal lad stay he said with that rare smile which brightened his dark face like a ray of stray sunshine well hang round these diggins a few days first off well take in the lay of the land you go down stream a ways an scout round some while i go up an then circle down move slow now an dont miss nothin  joe followed the stream a mile or more he kept close in the shade of willows and never walked across an open glade without first waiting and watching he listened to all sounds but none were unfamiliar he closely examined the sand along the stream and the moss and leaves under the trees when he had been separated from wetzel several hours and concluded he would slowly return to camp he ran across a wellbeaten path winding through the forest this was perhaps one of the bridletrails wetzel had referred to he bent over the worn grass with keen scrutiny  crack  the loud report of a heavily charged rifle rang out joe felt the zip of a bullet as it fanned his cheek with an agile leap he gained the shelter of a tree from behind which he peeped to see who had shot at him he was just in time to detect the dark form of an indian dart behind the foliage an hundred yards down the path joe expected to see other indians and to hear more shots but he was mistaken evidently the savage was alone for the tree joe had taken refuge behind was scarcely large enough to screen his body which disadvantage the other indians would have been quick to note  joe closely watched the place where his assailant had disappeared and presently saw a dark hand then a naked elbow and finally the ramrod of a rifle the savage was reloading soon a riflebarrel protruded from behind the tree with his heart beating like a triphammer and the skin tightening on his face joe screened his body as best he might the tree was small but it served as a partial protection rapidly he revolved in his mind plans to outwit the enemy the indian was behind a large oak with a low limb over which he could fire without exposing his own person to danger  bang the indians rifle bellowed the bullet crumbled the bark close to joes face the lad yelled loudly staggered to his knees and then fell into the path where he lay quiet  the redskin gave an exultant shout seeing that the fallen figure remained quite motionless he stepped forward drawing his knife as he came he was a young brave quick and eager in his movements and came nimbly up the path to gain his coveted trophy the palefaces scalp  suddenly joe sat up raised his rifle quickly as thought and fired pointblank at the indian  but he missed  the redskin stopped aghast when he saw the lad thus seemingly come back to life then realizing that joes aim had been futile he bounded forward brandishing his knife and uttering infuriated yells  joe rose to his feet with rifle swung high above his head  when the savage was within twenty feet so near that his dark face swollen with fierce passion could be plainly discerned a peculiar whistling noise sounded over joes shoulder it was accompanied rather than followed by a clear ringing rifleshot  the indian stopped as if he had encountered a heavy shock from a tree or stone barring his way clutching at his breast he uttered a weird cry and sank slowly on the grass  joe ran forward to bend over the prostrate figure the indian a slender handsome young brave had been shot through the breast he held his hand tightly over the wound while bright red blood trickled between his fingers flowed down his side and stained the grass  the brave looked steadily up at joe shot as he was dying as he knew himself to be there was no yielding in the dark eyeonly an unquenchable hatred then the eyes glazed the fingers ceased twitching  joe was bending over a dead indian  it flashed into his mind of course that wetzel had come up in time to save his life but he did not dwell on the thought he shrank from this violent death of a human being but it was from the aspect of the dead not from remorse for the deed his heart beat fast his fingers trembled yet he felt only a strange coldness in all his being the savage had tried to kill him perhaps even now had it not been for the hunters unerring aim would have been gloating over a bloody scalp  joe felt rather than heard the approach of some one and he turned to see wetzel coming down the path  hes a lone shawnee runner said the hunter gazing down at the dead indian he was tryin to win his eagle plumes i seen you both from the hillside  you did exclaimed joe then he laughed it was lucky for me i tried the dodge you taught me but in my eagerness i missed  wal you hadnt no call fer hurry you worked the trick clever but you missed him when there was plenty of time i had to shoot over your shoulder or id hev plugged him sooner  where were you asked joe  up there by that bit of sumach and wetzel pointed to an open ridge on a hillside not less than one hundred and fifty yards distant  joe wondered which of the two bullets the deathseeking one fired by the savage or the lifesaving missile from wetzels fatal weapon had passed nearest to him  come said the hunter after he had scalped the indian  whats to be done with this savage inquired joe as wetzel started up the path  let him lay  they returned to camp without further incident while the hunter busied himself reinforcing their temporary shelterfor the clouds looked threateningjoe cut up some buffalo meat and then went down to the brook for a gourd of water he came hurriedly back to where wetzel was working and spoke in a voice which he vainly endeavors to hold steady  come quickly i have seen something which may mean a good deal  he led the way down to the brookside  look joe said pointing at the water  here the steam was about two feet deep perhaps twenty wide and had just a noticeable current shortly before it had been as clear as a bright summer sky it was now tinged with yellow clouds that slowly floated downstream each one enlarging and becoming fainter as the clear water permeated and stained grains of sand glided along with the current little pieces of bark floated on the surface and minnows darted to and fro nibbling at these drifting particles  deer wouldnt roil the water like that what does it mean asked joe  injuns an not fer away  wetzel returned to the shelter and tore it down then he bent the branch of a beech tree low over the place he pulled down another branch over the remains of the campfire these precautions made the spot less striking wetzel knew that an indian scout never glances casually his roving eyes survey the forest perhaps quickly but thoroughly an unnatural position of bush or log always leads to an examination  this done the hunter grasped joes hand and led him up the knoll making his way behind a wellscreened tree which had been uprooted he selected a position where hidden themselves they could see the creek  hardly had wetzel admonished joe to lie perfectly still when from a short distance up the stream came the sound of splashing water but nothing could be seen above the open glade as in that direction willows lined the creek in dense thickets the noise grew more audible  suddenly joe felt a muscular contraction pass over the powerful frame lying close beside him it was a convulsive thrill such as passes through a tiger when he is about to spring upon his quarry so subtle and strong was its meaning so clearly did it convey to the lad what was coming that he felt it himself save that in his case it was a cold chill shudder  breathless suspense followed then into the open space along the creek glided a tall indian warrior he was kneedeep in the water where he waded with low cautious steps his garish befrilled costume seemed familiar to joe he carried a rifle at a low trail and passed slowly ahead with evident distrust the lad believed he recognized that head with its tangled black hair and when he saw the swarthy villainous countenance turned full toward him he exclaimed  girty by  wetzels powerful arm forced him so hard against the log that he could not complete the exclamation but he could still see girty had not heard that stifled cry for he continued his slow wading and presently his tall gaudily decorated form passed out of sight  another savage appeared in the open space and then another close between them walked a white man with hands bound behind him the prisoner and guards disappeared down stream among the willows  the splashing continuedgrew even louder than before a warrior came into view then another and another they walked close together two more followed they were wading by the side of a raft made of several logs upon which were two prostrate figures that closely resembled human beings  joe was so intent upon the lithe forms of the indians that he barely got a glimpse of their floating prize whatever it might have been bringing up the rear was an athletic warrior whose broad shoulders sinewy arms and shaved polished head joe remembered well it was the shawnee chief silvertip  when he too passed out of sight in the curve of willows joe found himself trembling he turned eagerly to wetzel but instantly recoiled  terrible indeed had been the hunters transformation all calmness of facial expression was gone he was now stern somber an intense emotion was visible in his white face his eyes seemed reduced to two dark shining points and they emitted so fierce so piercing a flash so deadly a light that joe could not bear their glittering gaze  three white captives two of em women uttered the hunter as if weighing in his mind the importance of this fact  were those women on the raft questioned joe and as wetzel only nodded he continued a white man and two women six warriors silvertip and that renegade jim girty  wetzel deigned not to answer joes passionate outburst but maintained silence and his rigid posture joe glanced once more at the stern face  considering wed go after girty and his redskins if they were alone were pretty likely to go quicker now that theyve got white women prisoners eh and joe laughed fiercely between his teeth  the lads heart expanded while along every nerve tingled an exquisite thrill of excitement he had yearned for wild border life here he was in it with the hunter whose name alone was to the savages a symbol for all that was terrible  wetzel evidently decided quickly on what was to be done for in few words he directed joe to cut up so much of the buffalo meat as they could stow in their pockets then bidding the lad to follow he turned into the woods walking rapidly and stopping now and then for a brief instant soon they emerged from the forest into more open country they faced a wide plain skirted on the right by a long winding strip of bright green willows which marked the course of the stream on the edge of this plain wetzel broke into a run he kept this pace for a distance of an hundred yards then stopped to listen intently as he glanced sharply on all sides after which he was off again  half way across this plain joes wind began to fail and his breathing became labored but he kept close to the hunters heels once he looked back to see a great wide expanse of waving grass they had covered perhaps four miles at a rapid pace and were nearing the other side of the plain the lad felt as if his head was about to burst a sharp pain seized upon his side a bloodred film obscured his sight he kept doggedly on and when utterly exhausted fell to the ground  when a few minutes later having recovered his breath he got up they had crossed the plain and were in a grove of beeches directly in front of him ran a swift stream which was divided at the rocky head of what appeared to be a wooded island there was only a slight ripple and fall of the water and after a second glance it was evident that the point of land was not an island but a portion of the mainland which divided the stream the branches took almost opposite courses  joe wondered if they had headed off the indians certainly they had run fast enough he was wet with perspiration he glanced at wetzel who was standing near the mans broad breast rose and fell a little faster that was the only evidence of exertion the lad had a painful feeling that he could never keep pace with the hunter if this fivemile run was a sample of the speed he would be forced to maintain  theyve got ahead of us but which crick did they take queried wetzel as though debating the question with himself  how do you know theyve passed  we circled answered wetzel as he shook his head and pointed into the bushes joe stepped over and looked into the thicket he found a quantity of dead leaves sticks and litter thrown aside exposing to light a long hollowed place on the ground it was what would be seen after rolling over a log that had lain for a long time little furrows in the ground holes mounds and curious winding passages showed where grubs and crickets had made their homes the frightened insects were now running round wildly  what was here a log  a twentyfoot canoe was hid under thet stuff the injuns has taken one of these streams  how can we tell which one  mebbe we cant but well try grab up a few of them bugs go below thet rocky point an crawl close to the bank so you can jest peep over be keerful not to show the tip of your head an dont knock nothin offen the bank into the water watch fer trout look everywheres an drop in a bug now and then ill do the same fer the other stream then well come back here an talk over what the fish has to say about the injuns  joe walked down stream a few paces and dropping on his knees crawled carefully to the edge of the bank he slightly parted the grass so he could peep through and found himself directly over a pool with a narrow shoal running out from the opposite bank the water was so clear he could see the pebbly bottom in all parts except a dark hole near a bend in the shore close by he did not see a living thing in the water not a crawfish turtle nor even a frog he peered round closely then flipped in one of the bugs he had brought along a shiny yellow fish flared up from the depths of the deep hole and disappeared with the cricket but it was a bass or a pike not a trout wetzel had said there were a few trout living near the cool springs of these streams the lad tried again to coax one to the surface this time the more fortunate cricket swam and hopped across the stream to safety  when joes eyes were thoroughly accustomed to the clear water with its deceiving lights and shades he saw a fish lying snug under the side of a stone the lad thought he recognized the snubnose the hooked wolfish jaw but he could not get sufficient of a view to classify him he crawled to a more advantageous position farther down stream and then he peered again through the woods yes sure enough he had espied a trout he well knew those spotted silver sides that broad square tail such a monster in his admiration for the fellow and his wish for a hook and line to try conclusions with him joe momentarily forgot his object remembering he tossed out a big fat cricket which alighted on the water just above the fish the trout never moved nor even blinked the lad tried again with no better success the fish would not rise thereupon joe returned to the point where he had left wetzel  i couldnt see nothin over there said the hunter who was waiting did you see any  one and a big fellow  did he see you  no  did he rise to a bug  no he didnt but then maybe he wasnt hungry answered joe who could not understand what wetzel was driving at  tell me exactly what he did  thats just the trouble he didnt do anything replied joe thoughtfully he just lay low stifflike under a stone he never batted an eye but his sidefins quivered like an aspen leaf  them sidefins tell us the story girty an his redskins hev took this branch said wetzel positively the other leads to the huron towns girtys got a place near the delaware camp somewheres ive tried to find it a good many times hes took moren one white lass there an nobody ever seen her agin  fiend to think of a white woman maybe a girl like nell wells at the mercy of those red devils  young fellar dont go wrong ill allow injuns is bad enough but i never hearn tell of one abusin a white woman as mayhap you mean injuns marry white women sometimes kill an scalp em often but thats all its men of our own color renegades like this girty as do worsen murder  here was the amazing circumstance of lewis wetzel the acknowledged unsatiable foe of all redmen speaking a good word for his enemies joe was so astonished he did not attempt to answer  heres where they got in the canoe one more look an then were off said wetzel he strode up and down the sandy beach examined the willows and scrutinized the sand suddenly he bent over and picked up an object from the water his sharp eyes had caught the glint of something white which upon being examined proved to be a small ivory or bone buckle with a piece broken out he showed it to joe  by heavens wetzel thats a buckle off nell wells shoe ive seen it too many times to mistake it  i was afeared girty hed your friends the sisters an mebbe your brother too jack zane said the renegade was hangin round the village an that couldnt be fer no good  come on lets kill the fiend cried joe white to the lips  i calkilate theyre about a mile down stream makin camp fer the night i know the place theres a fine spring an look dye see them crows flyin round thet big oak with the bleached top hear them cawin you might think they was chasin a hawk or kingbirds were arter em but thet fuss theyre makin is because they see injuns  well asked joe impatiently  itll be moonlight a while arter midnight well lay low an wait an then  the sharp click of his teeth like the snap of a steel trap completed the sentence joe said no more but followed the hunter into the woods stopping near a fallen tree wetzel raked up a bundle of leaves and spread them on the ground then he cut a few spreading branches from a beech and leaned them against a log bidding the lad crawl in before he took one last look around and then made his way under the shelter  it was yet daylight which seemed a strange time to creep into this little nook but joe thought it was not to sleep only to wait wait wait for the long hours to pass he was amazed once more because by the time twilight had given place to darkness wetzel was asleep the lad said then to himself that he would never again be surprised at the hunter he assumed once and for all that wetzel was capable of anything yet how could he lose himself in slumber feeling as he must over the capture of the girls eager to draw a bead on the blackhearted renegade hating indians with all his soul and strength and lying there but a few hours before what he knew would be a bloody battle wetzel calmly went to sleep knowing the hunter to be as bloodthirsty as a tiger joe had expected he would rush to a combat with his foes but no this man with his keen sagacity knew when to creep upon his enemy he bided that time and while he waited slept  joe could not close his eyes in slumber through the interstices in the branches he saw the stars come out one by one the darkness deepened and the dim outline of tall trees over the dark hill came out sharply the moments dragged each one an hour he heard a whippoorwill call lonely and dismal then an owl hoot monotonously a stealthy footed animal ran along the log sniffed at the boughs and then scurried away over the dry leaves by and by the dead silence of night fell over all still joe lay there wide awake listeninghis heart on fire he was about to rescue nell to kill that hawknosed renegade to fight silvertip to the death  the hours passed but not joes passionate eagerness when at last he saw the crescent moon gleam silverwhite over the black hilltop he knew the time was nigh and over him ran thrill on thrill    chapter xvi  when the waning moon rose high enough to shed a pale light over forest and field two dark figures moving silently from the shade of the trees crossed the moonlit patches of ground out to the open plain where low on the grass hung silver mists  a timber wolf gray and gaunt came loping along with lowered nose a new scent brought the animal to a standstill his nose went up his fiery eyes scanned the plain two men had invaded his domain and with a short dismal bark he dashed away  like spectres gliding swiftly with noiseless tread the two vanished the long grass had swallowed them  deserted once again seemed the plain it became unutterably lonely no stir no sound no life nothing but a wide expanse bathed in sad gray light  the moon shone steadily the silver radiance mellowed the stars paled before this brighter glory  slowly the night hours wore away  on the other side of the plain near where the adjoining forest loomed darkling the tall grass parted to disclose a black form was it only a deceiving shade cast by a leafy branchonly a shadow slowly it sank and was lost once more the gray unwavering line of silvercrested grass tufts was unbroken  only the night breeze wandering caressingly over the grass might have told of two dark forms gliding gliding gliding so softly so surely so surely toward the forest only the moon and the pale stars had eyes to see these creeping figures  like avengers they moved on a mission to slay and to save  on over the dark line where plain merged into forest they crawled no whispering no hesitating but a silent slow certain progress showed their purpose in single file they slipped over the moss the leader clearing the path inch by inch they advanced tedious was this slow movement difficult and painful this journey which must end in lightninglike speed they rustled no leaf nor snapped a twig nor shook a fern but passed onward slowly like the approach of death the seconds passed as minutes minutes as hours an entire hour was spent in advancing twenty feet  at last the top of the knoll was reached the avenger placed his hand on his followers shoulder the strong pressure was meant to remind to warn to reassure then like a huge snake the first glided away  he who was left behind raised his head to look into the open place called the glade of the beautiful spring an oval space lay before him exceedingly lovely in the moonlight a spring as if a pearl gemmed the center an indian guard stood statuelike against a stone other savages lay in a row their polished heads shining one slumbering form was bedecked with feathers and frills near him lay an indian blanket from the border of which peered two faces gleaming white and sad in the pitying moonlight  the watcher quivered at the sight of those pale faces but he must wait while long moments passed he must wait for the avenger to creep up silently kill the guard and release the prisoners without awakening the savages if that plan failed he was to rush into the glade and in the excitement make off with one of the captives  he lay there waiting listening wrought up to the intensest pitch of fierce passion every nerve was alert every tendon strung and every muscle strained ready for the leap  only the faint rustling of leaves the low swish of swaying branches the soft murmur of falling water and over all the sigh of the night wind proved to him that this picture was not an evil dream his gaze sought the quiet figures lingered hopefully on the captives menacingly on the sleeping savages and glowered over the gaudily arrayed form his glance sought the upright guard as he stood a dark blot against the gray stone he saw the indians plume a single feather waving silverwhite then it became riveted on the bubbling refulgent spring the pool was round perhaps five feet across and shone like a burnished shield it mirrored the moon the twinkling stars the spectre trees  an unaccountable horror suddenly swept over the watching man his hair stood straight up a sensation as of cold stole chillingly over him whether it was the climax of this long nights excitement or anticipation of the bloody struggle soon to come he knew not did this boiling spring shimmering in the sliver moonrays hold in its murky depths a secret did these lonesome shadowing trees with their sad drooping branches harbor a mystery if a future tragedy was to be enacted here in this quiet glade could the murmuring water or leaves whisper its portent no they were only silent only unintelligible with natures mystery  the waiting man cursed himself for a craven coward he fought back the benumbing sense he steeled his heart was this his vaunted willingness to share the avengers danger his strong spirit rose up in arms once more he was brave and fierce  he fastened a piercing gaze on the plumed guard the indians lounging posture against the rock was the same as it had been before yet now it seemed to have a kind of strained attention the savages head was poised like that of a listening deer the wary indian scented danger  a faint moan breathed low above the sound of gently splashing water somewhere beyond the glade  wooooo  the guards figure stiffened and became rigidly erect his blanket slowly slid to his feet  ahooo sighed the soft breeze in the tree tops  louder then with a deep wail a moan arose out of the dark gray shadows swelled thrilling on the still air and died away mournfully  ummmmwooooo  the sentinels form melted into the shade he was gone like a phantom  another indian rose quickly and glanced furtively around the glade he bent over a comrade and shook him instantly the second indian was on his feet scarcely had he gained a standing posture when an object bounding like a dark ball shot out of the thicket and hurled both warriors to the earth a moonbeam glinted upon something bright it flashed again on a swift sweeping circle a short choking yell aroused the other savages up they sprang alarmed confused  the shadowform darted among them it moved with inconceivable rapidity it became a monster terrible was the convulsive conflict dull blows the click of steel angry shouts agonized yells and thrashing wrestling sounds mingled together and half drowned by an awful roar like that of a mad bull the strife ceased as suddenly as it had begun warriors lay still on the grass others writhed in agony for an instant a fleeting shadow crossed the open lane leading out of the glade then it vanished  three savages had sprung toward their rifles a blinding flash a loud report burst from the thicket overhead the foremost savage sank lifelessly the others were intercepted by a giant shadow with brandished rifle the watcher on the knoll had entered the glade he stood before the stacked rifles and swung his heavy gun crash an indian went down before that sweep but rose again the savages backed away from this threatening figure and circled around it  the noise of the other conflict ceased more savages joined the three who glided to and fro before their desperate foe they closed in upon him only to be beaten back one savage threw a glittering knife another hurled a stone a third flung his tomahawk which struck fire from the swinging rifle  he held them at bay while they had no firearms he was master of the situation with every sweep of his arms he brought the long rifle down and knocked a flint from the firelock of an enemys weapon soon the indians guns were useless slowly then he began to edge away from the stone toward the opening where he had seen the fleeting form vanish  his intention was to make a dash for life for he had heard a noise behind the rock and remembered the guard he saw the savages glance behind him and anticipated danger from that direction but he must not turn a second there might be fatal he backed defiantly along the rock until he gained its outer edge but too late the indians glided before him now behind him he was surrounded he turned around and around with the evercircling rifle whirling in the faces of the baffled foe  once opposite the lane leading from the glade he changed his tactics and plunged with fierce impetuosity into the midst of the painted throng then began a fearful conflict the indians fell before the sweep of his powerful arms but grappled with him from the ground he literally plowed his way through the struggling mass warding off an hundred vicious blows savage after savage he flung off until at last he had a clear path before him freedom lay beyond that shiny path into it he bounded  as he left the glade the plumed guard stepped from behind a tree near the entrance of the path and cast his tomahawk  a white glittering flash it flew after the fleeing runner its aim was true  suddenly the moonlight path darkened in the runners sight he saw a million flashing stars a terrible pain assailed him he sank slowly slowly down then all was darkness    chapter xvii  joe awoke as from a fearsome nightmare returning consciousness brought a vague idea that he had been dreaming of clashing weapons of yelling savages of a conflict in which he had been clutched by sinewy fingers an acute pain pulsed through his temples a bloody mist glazed his eyes a sore pressure cramped his arms and legs surely he dreamed this distress as well as the fight the red film cleared from his eyes his wandering gaze showed the stern reality  the bright sun making the dewdrops glisten on the leaves lighted up a tragedy near him lay an indian whose vacant sightless eyes were fixed in death beyond lay four more savages the peculiar inert position of whose limbs the formlessness as it were as if they had been thrown from a great height and never moved again attested that here too life had been extinguished joe took in only one detailthe cloven skull of the nearestwhen he turned away sickened he remembered it all now the advance the rush the fightall returned he saw again wetzels shadowy form darting like a demon into the whirl of conflict he heard again that hoarse booming roar with which the avenger accompanied his blows joes gaze swept the glade but found no trace of the hunter  he saw silvertip and another indian bathing a wound on girtys head the renegade groaned and writhed in pain near him lay kate with white face and closed eyes she was unconscious or dead jim sat crouched under a tree to which he was tied  joe are you badly hurt asked the latter in deep solicitude  no i guess not i dont know answered joe is poor kate dead  no she has fainted  wheres nell  gone replied jim lowering his voice and glancing at the indians they were too busy trying to bandage girtys head to pay any attention to their prisoners that whirlwind was wetzel wasnt it  yes howd you know  i was awake last night i had an oppressive feeling perhaps a presentiment anyway i couldnt sleep i heard that wind blow through the forest and thought my blood would freeze the moan is the same as the night wind the same soft sigh only louder and somehow pregnant with superhuman power to speak of it in broad daylight one seems superstitious but to hear it in the darkness of this lonely forest it is fearful i hope i am not a coward i certainly know i was deathly frightened no wonder i was scared look at these dead indians all killed in a moment i heard the moan i saw silvertip disappear and the other two savages rise then something huge dropped from the rock a bright object seemed to circle round the savages they uttered one short yell and sank to rise no more somehow at once i suspected that this shadowy form with its lightninglike movements its glittering hatchet was wetzel when he plunged into the midst of the other savages i distinctly recognized him and saw that he had a bundle possibly his coat wrapped round his left arm and his right hand held the glittering tomahawk i saw him strike that big indian there the one lying with split skull his wonderful daring and quickness seemed to make the savages turn at random he broke through the circle swung nell under his arm slashed at my bonds as he passed by and then was gone as he had come not until after you were struck and silvertip came up to me was i aware my bonds were cut wetzels hatchet had severed them it even cut my side which was bleeding i was free to help to fight and i did not know it fool that i am  i made an awful mess of my part of the rescue groaned joe i wonder if the savages know it was wetzel  do they well i rather think so did you not hear them scream that french name as far as i am able to judge only two indians were killed instantly the others died during the night i had to sit here tied and helpless listening as they groaned and called the name of their slayer even in their deaththroes deathwind they have named him well  i guess he nearly killed girty  evidently but surely the evil one protects the renegade  jim girtys doomed whispered joe earnestly hes as good as dead already ive lived with wetzel and know him he told me girty had murdered a settler a feeble old man who lived near fort henry with his son the hunter has sworn to kill the renegade but mind you he did not tell me that i saw it in his eyes it wouldnt surprise me to see him jump out of these bushes at any moment im looking for it if he knows there are only three left hell be after them like a hound on a trail girty must hurry wheres he taking you  to the delaware town  i dont suppose the chiefs will let any harm befall you but kate and i would be better off dead if we can only delay the march wetzel will surely return  hush girtys up  the renegade staggered to an upright position and leaned on the shawnees arm evidently he had not been seriously injured only stunned covered with blood from a swollen gashed lump on his temple he certainly presented a savage appearance  wheres the yellowhaired lass he demanded pushing away silvertips friendly arm he glared around the glade the shawnee addressed him briefly whereupon he raged to and fro under the tree cursing with foamflecked lips and actually howling with baffled rage his fury was so great that he became suddenly weak and was compelled to sit down  shes safe you villainous renegade cried joe  hush joe do not anger him it can do no good interposed jim  why not we couldnt be worse off answered joe  ill git her ill git her agin panted girty ill keep her an shell love me  the spectacle of this perverted wretch speaking as if he had been cheated out of love was so remarkable so pitiful so monstrous that for a moment joe was dumbfounded  bah you whitelivered murderer joe hissed he well knew it was not wise to give way to his passion but he could not help it this beast in human guise whining for love maddened him any white woman on earth would die a thousand deaths and burn for a million years afterward rather than love you  ill see you killed at the stake beggin fer mercy an be feed fer buzzards croaked the renegade  then kill me now or you may slip up on one of your cherished buzzardfeasts cried joe with glinting eye and taunting voice then go sneaking back to your hole like a hyena and stay there wetzel is on your trail he missed you last night but it was because of the girl hes after you girty hell get you one of these days and when he doesmy god  nothing could be more revolting than that swarthy evil face turned pale with fear girtys visage was a ghastly livid white so earnest so intense was joes voice that it seemed to all as if wetzel was about to dart into the glade with his avenging tomahawk uplifted to wreak an awful vengeance on the abductor the renegades white craven heart contained no such thing as courage if he ever fought it was like a wolf backed by numbers the resemblance ceased here for even a cornered wolf will show his teeth and girty driven to bay would have cringed and cowered even now at the mention of wetzels enmity he trembled  ill shet yer wind he cried catching up his tomahawk and making for joe  silvertip intervened and prevented the assault he led girty back to his seat and spoke low evidently trying to soothe the renegades feelings  silvertip give me a tomahawk and let me fight him implored joe  paleface bravelike injun chief paleface shawnees prisonerno speak more answered silvertip with respect in his voice  oh wheres nellie  a griefstricken whisper caught jims ear he turned to see kates wide questioning eyes fixed upon him  nell was rescued  thank god murmured the girl  come along shouted girty in his harsh voice as grasping kates arm he pulled the girl violently to her feet then picking up his rifle he led her into the forest silvertip followed with joe while the remaining indian guarded jim                                  the great councillodge of the delawares rang with savage and fiery eloquence wingenund paced slowly before the orators wise as he was he wanted advice before deciding what was to be done with the missionary the brothers had been taken to the chief who immediately called a council the indians sat in a half circle around the lodge the prisoners with hands bound guarded by two brawny braves stood in one corner gazing with curiosity and apprehension at this formidable array jim knew some of the braves but the majority of those who spoke bitterly against the palefaces had never frequented the village of peace nearly all were of the wolf tribe of delawares jim whispered to joe interpreting that part of the speeches bearing upon the disposal to be made of them two white men dressed in indian garb held prominent positions before wingenund the boys saw a resemblance between one of these men and jim girty and accordingly concluded he was the famous renegade or socalled white indian simon girty the other man was probably elliott the tory with whom girty had deserted from fort pitt jim girty was not present upon nearing the encampment he had taken his captive and disappeared in a ravine  shingiss seldom in favor of drastic measures with prisoners eloquently urged initiating the brothers into the tribe several other chiefs were favorably inclined though not so positive as shingiss kotoxen was for the death penalty the implacable pipe for nothing less than burning at the stake not one was for returning the missionary to his christian indians girty and elliott though requested to speak maintained an ominous silence  wingenund strode with thoughtful mien before his council he had heard all his wise chiefs and his fiery warriors supreme was his power freedom or death for the captives awaited the wave of his hand his impassive face gave not the slightest inkling of what to expect therefore the prisoners were forced to stand there with throbbing hearts while the chieftain waited the customary dignified interval before addressing the council  wingenund has heard the delaware wise men and warriors the white indian opens not his lips his silence broods evil for the palefaces pipe wants the blood of the white men the shawnee chief demands the stake wingenund says free the white father who harms no indian wingenund hears no evil in the music of his voice the white fathers brother should die kill the companion of deathwind  a plaintive murmur remarkable when coming from an assembly of sternbrowed chiefs ran round the circle at the mention of the dread appellation  the white father is free continued wingenund let one of my runners conduct him to the village of peace  a brave entered and touched jim on the shoulder  jim shook his head and pointed to joe the runner touched joe  no no i am not the missionary cried joe staring aghast at his brother jim have you lost your senses  jim sadly shook his head and turning to wingenund made known in a broken indian dialect that his brother was the missionary and would sacrifice himself taking this opportunity to practice the christianity he had taught  the white father is brave but he is known broke in wingenunds deep voice while he pointed to the door of the lodge let him go back to his christian indians  the indian runner cut joes bonds and once more attempted to lead him from the lodge rage and misery shown in the lads face he pushed the runner aside he exhausted himself trying to explain to think of indian words enough to show he was not the missionary he even implored girty to speak for him when the renegade sat there stolidly silent joes rage burst out  curse you all for a lot of ignorant redskins i am not a missionary i am deathwinds friend i killed a delaware i was the companion of le vent de la mort  joes passionate vehemence and the truth that spoke from his flashing eyes compelled the respect if not the absolute belief of the indians the savages slowly shook their heads they beheld the spectacle of two brothers one a friend the other an enemy of all indians each willing to go to the stake to suffer an awful agony for love of the other chivalrous deeds always stir an indians heart it was like a redman to die for his brother the indifference the contempt for death won their admiration  let the white father stand forth sternly called wingenund  a hundred somber eyes turned on the prisoners except that one wore a buckskin coat the other a linsey one there was no difference the strong figures were the same the white faces alike the stern resolve in the gray eyes identicalthey were twin brothers  wingenund once more paced before his silent chiefs to deal rightly with this situation perplexed him to kill both palefaces did not suit him suddenly he thought of a way to decide  let wingenunds daughter come he ordered  a slight girlish figure entered it was whispering winds her beautiful face glowed while she listened to her father  wingenunds daughter has her mothers eyes that were beautiful as a does keen as a hawks farseeing as an eagles let the delaware maiden show her blood let her point out the white father  shyly but unhesitatingly whispering winds laid her hand jims arm  missionary begone came the chieftains command thank wingenunds daughter for your life not the god of your christians  he waved his hand to the runner the brave grasped jims arm  goodby joe brokenly said jim  old fellow goodby came the answer  they took one last long look into each others eyes jims glance betrayed his fearhe would never see his brother again the light in joes eyes was the old steely flash the indomitable spiritwhile there was life there was hope  let the shawnee chief paint his prisoner black commanded wingenund  when the missionary left the lodge with the runner whispering winds had smiled for she had saved him whom she loved to hear speak but the dread command that followed paled her cheek black paint meant hideous death she saw this man so like the white father her piteous gaze tried to turn from that white face but the cold steely eyes fascinated her  she had saved one only to be the others doom  she had always been drawn toward white men many prisoners had she rescued she had even befriended her nations bitter foe deathwind she had listened to the young missionary with rapture she had been his savior and now when she looked into the eyes of this young giant whose fate had rested on her all unwitting words she resolved to save him  she had been a shy shrinking creature fearing to lift her eyes to a palefaces but now they were raised clear and steadfast  as she stepped toward the captive and took his hand her whole person radiated with conscious pride in her power it was the knowledge that she could save when she kissed his hand and knelt before him she expressed a tender humility  she had claimed questionable right of an indian maiden she asked what no indian dared refuse a chiefs daughter she took the paleface for her husband  her action was followed by an impressive silence she remained kneeling wingenund resumed his slow march to and fro silvertip retired to his corner with gloomy face the others bowed their heads as if the maidens decree was irrevocable  once more the chieftains sonorous command rang out an old indian wrinkled and worn weird of aspect fanciful of attire entered the lodge and waved his wampum wand he mumbled strange words and departed chanting a long song  whispering winds arose a soft radiant smile playing over her face and still holding joes hand she led him out of the lodge through long rows of silent indians down a land bordered by teepees he following like one in a dream  he expected to awaken at any minute to see the stars shining through the leaves yet he felt the warm soft pressure of a little hand surely this slender graceful figure was real  she bade him enter a lodge of imposing proportions still silent in amazement and gratitude he obeyed  the maiden turned to joe though traces of pride still lingered all her fire had vanished her bosom rose with each quickpanting breath her lips quivered she trembled like a trapped doe  but at last the fluttering lashes rose joe saw two velvety eyes dark with timid fear yet veiling in their lustrous depths an unuttered hope and love  whispering windssavepaleface she said in a voice low and tremulous fearfather feartellwingenundshechristian                                  indian summer that enchanted time unfolded its golden dreamy haze over the delaware village the forests blazed with autumn fire the meadows boomed in rich luxuriance all day low down in the valleys hung a purple smoke which changed as the cool evening shades crept out of the woodland into a cloud of white mist all day the asters along the brooks lifted goldenbrown faces to the sun as if to catch the warning warmth of his smile all day the plains and forests lay in melancholy repose the sad swish of the west wind over the tall grass told that he was slowly dying away before his enemy the north wind the sound of dropping nuts was heard under the motionless trees  for joe the days were days of enchantment his wild heart had found its mate a willing captive he was now all his fancy for other women all his memories faded into love for his indian bride  whispering winds charmed the eye mind and heart every day her beauty seemed renewed she was as apt to learn as she was quick to turn her blackcrowned head but her supreme beauty was her loving innocent soul untainted as the clearest spring it mirrored the purity and simplicity of her life indian she might be one of a race whose morals and manners were alien to the man she loved yet she would have added honor to the proudest name  when whispering winds raised her dark eyes they showed radiant as a lone star when she spoke low her voice made music  beloved she whispered one day to him teach the indian maiden more love for you and truth and god whispering winds yearns to go to the christians but she fears her stern father wingenund would burn the village of peace the indian tribes tremble before the thunder of his wrath be patient my chief time changes the leaves so it will the anger of the warriors whispering winds will set you free and be free herself to go far with you toward the rising sun where dwell your people she will love and be constant as the northern star her love will be an eternal spring where blossoms bloom ever anew and fresh and sweet she will love your people and raise christian children and sit ever in the door of your home praying for the west wind to blow or if my chief wills we shall live the indian life free as two eagles on their lonely crag  although joe gave himself up completely to his love for his bride he did not forget that kate was in the power of the renegade and that he must rescue her knowing girty had the unfortunate girls somewhere near the delaware encampment he resolved to find the place plans of all kinds he resolved in his mind the best one he believed lay through whispering winds first to find the whereabouts of girty kill him if possible or at least free kate and then get away with her and his indian bride sanguine as he invariably was he could not but realize the peril of this undertaking if whispering winds betrayed her people it meant death to her as well as to him he would far rather spend the remaining days of his life in the indian village than doom the maiden whose love had saved him yet he thought he might succeed in getting away with her and planned to that end his natural spirit daring reckless had gained while he was associated with wetzel  meanwhile he mingled freely with the indians and here as elsewhere his winning personality combined with his athletic prowess soon made him well liked he was even on friendly terms with pipe the swarthy war chief liked joe because despite the animosity he had aroused in some former lovers of whispering winds he actually played jokes on them in fact joes pranks raised many a storm but the young braves who had been suitors for wingenunds lovely daughter feared the muscular paleface and the tribes ridicule more so he continued his trickery unmolested joes idea was to lead the savages to believe he was thoroughly happy in his new life and so he was but it suited him better to be free he succeeded in misleading the savages at first he was closely watched the the vigilance relaxed and finally ceased  this last circumstance was owing no doubt to a ferment of excitement that had suddenly possessed the delawares council after council was held in the big lodge the encampment was visited by runner after runner some important crisis was pending  joe could not learn what it all meant and the fact that whispering winds suddenly lost her gladsome spirit and became sad caused him further anxiety when he asked her the reason for her unhappiness she was silent moreover he was surprised to learn when he questioned her upon the subject of their fleeing together that she was eager to go immediately while all this mystery puzzled joe it did not make any difference to him or in his plans it rather favored the latter he understood that the presence of simon girty and elliott with several other renegades unknown to him was significant of unrest among the indians these presagers of evil were accustomed to go from village to village exciting the savages to acts of war peace meant the downfall and death of these men they were busy all day and far into the night often joe heard girtys hoarse voice lifted in the council lodge pipe thundered incessantly for war but joe could not learn against whom elliotts suave oily oratory exhorted the indians to vengeance but joe could not guess upon whom he was however destined to learn  the third day of the councils a horseman stopped before whispering winds lodge and called out stepping to the door joe saw a white man whose dark keen handsome face seemed familiar yet joe knew he had never seen this stalwart man  a word with you said the stranger his tone was curt authoritative as that of a man used to power  as many as you like who are you  i am isaac zane are you wetzels companion or the renegade deering  i am not a renegade any more than you are i was rescued by the indian girl who took me as her husband said joe coldly he was surprised and did not know what to make of zanes manner  good im glad to meet you instantly replied zane his tone and expression changing he extended his hand to joe i wanted to be sure i never saw the renegade deering he is here now i am on my way to the wyandot town i have been to fort henry where my brother told me of you and the missionaries when i arrived here i heard your story from simon girty if you can you must get away from here if i dared id take you to the huron village but its impossible go while you have a chance  zane i thank you ive suspected something was wrong what is it  couldnt be worse whispered zane glancing round to see if they were overheard girty and elliott backed by this deering are growing jealous of the influence of christianity on the indians they are plotting against the village of peace tarhe the huron chief has been approached and asked to join in a concerted movement against religion seemingly it is not so much the missionaries as the converted indians that the renegades are fuming over they know if the christian savages are killed the strength of the missionaries hold will be forever broken pipe is wild for blood these renegades are slowly poisoning the minds of the few chiefs who are favorably disposed the outlook is bad bad  what can i do  cut out for yourself get away if you can with a gun take the creek below follow the current down to the ohio and then make east for fort henry  but i want to rescue the white girl jim girty has concealed here somewhere  impossible dont attempt it unless you want to throw your life away buzzard jim as we call girty is a butcher he has probably murdered the girl  i wont leave without trying and theres my wife the indian girl who saved me zane shes a christian she wants to go with me i cant leave her  i am warning you thats all if i were you id never leave without a try to find the white girl and id never forsake my indian bride ive been through the same thing you must be a good woodsman or wetzel wouldnt have let you stay with him pick out a favorable time and make the attempt i suggest you make your indian girl show you where girty is she knows but is afraid to tell you for she fears girty get your dog and horse from the shawnee thats a fine horse he can carry you both to safety take him away from silvertip  how  go right up and demand your horse and dog most of these delawares are honest for all their bloodshedding and cruelty with them might is right the delawares wont try to get your horse for you but theyll stick to you when you assert your rights they dont like the shawnee anyhow if silvertip refuses to give you the horse grab him before he can draw a weapon and beat him good youre big enough to do it the delawares will be tickled to see you pound him hes thick with girty thats why he lays round here take my word its the best way do it openly and no one will interfere  by heavens zane ill give him a drubbing i owe him one and am itching to get hold of him  i must go now i shall send a wyandot runner to your brother at the village they shall be warned goodby good luck may we meet again  joe watched zane ride swiftly down the land and disappear in the shrubbery whispering winds came to the door of the lodge she looked anxiously at him he went within drawing her along with him and quickly informed her that he had learned the cause of the council that he had resolved to get away and she must find out girtys hiding place whispering winds threw herself into his arms declaring with an energy and passion unusual to her that she would risk anything for him she informed joe that she knew the direction from which girty always returned to the village no doubt she could find his retreat with a cunning that showed her indian nature she suggested a plan which joe at once saw was excellent after joe got his horse she would ride around the village then off into the woods where she could leave the horse and return to say he had run away from her as was their custom during afternoons they would walk leisurely along the brook and trusting to the excitement created by the councils get away unobserved find the horse if possible rescue the prisoner and then travel east with all speed  joe left the lodge at once to begin the working out of the plan luck favored him at the outset for he met silvertip before the council lodge the shawnee was leading lance and the dog followed at his heels the spirit of mose had been broken poor dog joe thought he had been beaten until he was afraid to wag his tail at his old master joes resentment blazed into fury but he kept cool outwardly  right before a crowd of indians waiting for the council to begin joe planted himself in front of the shawnee barring his way  silvertip has the palefaces horse and dog said joe in a loud voice  the chief stared haughtily while the other indians sauntered nearer they all knew how the shawnee had got the animals and now awaited the outcome of the white mans challenge  palefaceheapliar growled the indian his dark eyes glowed craftily while his hand dropped apparently in careless habit to the haft of his tomahawk  joe swung his long arm his big fist caught the shawnee on the jaw sending him to the ground uttering a frightful yell silvertip drew his weapon and attempted to rise but the moments delay in seizing the hatchet was fatal to his design joe was upon him with tigerlike suddenness one kick sent the tomahawk spinning another landed the shawnee again on the ground blind with rage silvertip leaped up and without a weapon rushed at his antagonist but the indian was not a boxer and he failed to get his hands on joe shifty and elusive the lad dodged around the struggling savage one two three hard blows staggered silvertip and a fourth delivered with the force of joes powerful arm caught the indian when he was off his balance and felled him battered and bloody on the grass the surrounding indians looked down at the vanquished shawnee expressing their approval in characteristic grunts  with lance prancing proudly and mose leaping lovingly beside him joe walked back to his lodge whispering winds sprang to meet him with joyful face she had feared the outcome of trouble with the shawnee but no queen ever bestowed upon returning victorious lord a loftier look of pride a sweeter glance of love than the indian maiden bent upon her lover  whispering winds informed joe that an important council was to be held that afternoon it would be wise for them to make the attempt to get away immediately after the convening of the chiefs accordingly she got upon lance and rode him up and down the village lane much to the pleasure of the watching indians she scattered the idle crowds on the grass plots she dashed through the side streets and let every one in the encampment see her clinging to the black stallion then she rode him out along the creek accustomed to her imperious will the indians thought nothing unusual when she returned an hour later with flying hair and disheveled costume no one paid particular attention to her  that afternoon joe and his bride were the favored of fortune with mose running before them they got clear of the encampment and into the woods once in the forest whispering winds rapidly led the way east when they climbed to the top of a rocky ridge she pointed down into a thicket before her saying that somewhere in this dense hollow was girtys hut joe hesitated about taking mose he wanted the dog but in case he had to run it was necessary whispering winds should find his trail and for this he left the dog with her  he started down the ridge and had not gone a hundred paces when over some gray boulders he saw the thatched roof of a hut so wild and secluded was the spot that he would never have discovered the cabin from any other point than this which he had been so fortunate as to find  his study and practice under wetzel now stood him in good stead he picked out the best path over the rough stones and through the brambles always keeping under cover he stepped as carefully as if the hunter was behind him soon he reached level ground a dense laurel thicket hid the cabin but he knew the direction in which it lay throwing himself flat on the ground he wormed his way through the thicket carefully yet swiftly because he knew there was no time to lose finally the rear of the cabin stood in front of him  it was made of logs rudely hewn and as rudely thrown together in several places clay had fallen from chinks between the timbers leaving small holes like a snake joe slipped close to the hut raising his head he looked through one of the cracks  instantly he shrank back into the grass shivering with horror he almost choked in his attempt to prevent an outcry    chapter xviii  the sight which joe had seen horrified him for several moments into helpless inaction he lay breathing heavily impotent in an awful rage as he remained there stunned by the shock he gazed up through the open space in the leaves trying to still his fury to realize the situation to make no hasty move the soft blue of the sky the fleecy clouds drifting eastward the fluttering leaves and the twittering birdsall assured him he was wide awake he had found girtys den where so many white women had been hidden to see friends and home no more he had seen the renegade sleeping calmly sleeping like any other man how could the wretch sleep he had seen kate it had been the sight of her that had paralyzed him to make a certainty of his fears he again raised himself to peep into the hole as he did so a faint cry came from within  girty lay on a buffalo robe near a barred door beyond him sat kate huddled in one corner of the cabin a long buckskin thong was knotted round her waist and tied to a log her hair was matted and tangled and on her face and arms were many discolored bruises worse still in her plaintive moaning in the meaningless movement of her head in her vacant expression was proof that her mind had gone she was mad even as an agonizing pity came over joe to be followed by the surging fire of rage blazing up in his breast he could not but thank god that she was mad it was merciful that kate was no longer conscious of her suffering  like leaves in a storm wavered joes hands as he clenched them until the nails brought blood be calm be cool whispered his monitor wetzel ever with him in spirit but god could he be cool bounding with lionspring he hurled his heavy frame against the door  crash the door was burst from its fastenings  girty leaped up with startled yell drawing his knife as he rose it had not time to descend before joes second spring more fierce even than the other carried him directly on top of the renegade as the two went down joe caught the villains wrist with a grip that literally cracked the bones the knife fell and rolled away from the struggling men for an instant they tumbled about on the floor clasped in a crushing embrace the renegade was strong supple slippery as an eel twice he wriggled from his foe gnashing his teeth he fought like a hyena he was fighting for lifelife which is never so dear as to a coward and a murderer doom glared from joes big eyes and scream after scream issued from the renegades white lips  terrible was this struggle but brief joe seemingly had the strength of ten men twice he pulled girty down as a wolf drags a deer he dashed him against the wall throwing him nearing and nearer the knife once within reach of the blade joe struck the renegade a severe blow on the temple and the villains wrestling became weaker planting his heavy knee on girtys breast joe reached for the knife and swung it high exultantly he cried mad with lust for the brutes blood  but the slight delay saved girtys life  the knife was knocked from joes hand and he leaped erect to find himself confronted by silvertip the chief held a tomahawk with which he had struck the weapon from the young mans grasp and to judge from his burning eyes and malignant smile he meant to brain the now defenseless paleface  in a single fleeting instant joe saw that girty was helpless for the moment that silvertip was confident of his revenge and that the situation called for wetzels characteristic advice act like lightnin  swifter than the thought was the leap he made past silvertip it carried him to a wooden bar which lay on the floor escape was easy for the door was before him and the shawnee behind but joe did not flee he seized the bar and rushed at the indian then began a duel in which the savages quickness and cunning matched the white mans strength and fury silvertip dodged the vicious swings joe aimed at him he parried many blows any one of which would have crushed his skull nimble as a cat he avoided every rush while his dark eyes watched for an opening he fought wholly on the defensive craftily reserving his strength until his opponent should tire  at last catching the bar on his hatchet he broke the force of the blow and then with agile movement dropped to the ground and grappled joes legs long before this he had drawn his knife and now he used it plunging the blade into the young mans side  cunning and successful as was the savages ruse it failed signally for to get hold of the shawnee was all joe wanted feeling the sharp pain as they fell together he reached his hand behind him and caught silvertips wrist exerting all his power he wrenched the indians arm so that it was not only dislocated but the bones cracked  silvertip saw his fatal mistake but he uttered no sound crippled though he was he yet made a supreme effort but it was as if he had been in the hands of a giant the lad handled him with remorseless and resistless fury suddenly he grasped the knife which silvertip had been unable to hold with his crippled hand and thrust it deeply into the indians side  all silvertips muscles relaxed as if a strong tension had been removed slowly his legs straightened his arms dropped and from his side gushed a dark flood a shadow crept over his face not dark nor white but just a shadow his eyes lost their hate they no longer saw the foe they looked beyond with gloomy question and then were fixed cold in death silvertip died as he had liveda chief  joe glared round for girty he was gone having slipped away during the fight the lad turned to release the poor prisoner when he started back with a cry of fear kate lay bathed in a pool of blooddead the renegade fearing she might be rescued had murdered her and then fled from the cabin  almost blinded by horror and staggering with weakness joe turned to leave the cabin realizing that he was seriously perhaps dangerously wounded he wisely thought he must not leave the place without weapons he had marked the pegs where the renegades rifle hung and had been careful to keep between that and his enemies he took down the gun and horns which were attached to it and with one last shuddering glance at poor kate left the place  he was conscious of a queer lightness in his head but he suffered no pain his garments were dripping with blood he did not know how much of it was his or the indians instinct rather than sight was his guide he grew weaker and weaker his head began to whirl yet he kept on knowing that life and freedom were his if he found whispering winds he gained the top of the ridge his eyes were blurred his strength gone he called aloud and then plunged forward on his face he heard dimly as though the sound were afar off the whine of a dog he felt something soft and wet on his face then consciousness left him  when he regained his senses he was lying on a bed of ferns under a projecting rock he heard the gurgle of running water mingling with the song of birds near him lay mose and beyond rose a wall of green thicket neither whispering winds nor his horse was visible  he felt a dreamy lassitude he was tired but had no pain finding he could move without difficulty he concluded his weakness was more from loss of blood than a dangerous wound he put his hand on the place where he had been stabbed and felt a soft warm compress such as might have been made by a bunch of wet leaves some one had unlaced his huntingshirtfor he saw the strings were not as he usually tied themand had dressed the wound joe decided after some deliberation that whispering winds had found him made him as comfortable as possible and leaving mose on guard had gone out to hunt for food or perhaps back to the indian encampment the rifle and horns he had taken from girtys hut together with silvertips knife lay beside him  as joe lay there hoping for whispering winds return his reflections were not pleasant fortunate indeed he was to be alive but he had no hope he could continue to be favored by fortune odds were now against his escape girty would have the delawares on his trail like a pack of hungry wolves he could not understand the absence of whispering winds she would have died sooner than desert him girty had perhaps captured her and was now scouring the woods for him  ill get him next time or hell get me muttered joe in bitter wrath he could never forgive himself for his failure to kill the renegade  the recollection of how nearly he had forever ended girtys brutal career brought before joes mind the scene of the fight he saw again buzzard jims face revolting unlike anything human there stretched silvertips dark figure lying still and stark and there was kates white form in its winding crimson wreath of blood hauntingly her face returned sad stern in its cold rigidity  poor girl better for her to be dead he murmured not long will she be unavenged  his thoughts drifted to the future he had no fear of starvation for mose could catch a rabbit or woodchuck at any time when the strips of meat he had hidden in his coat were gone he could start a fire and roast more what concerned him most was pursuit his trail from the cabin had been a bloody one which would render it easily followed he dared not risk exertion until he had given his wound time to heal then if he did escape from girty and the delawares his future was not bright his experiences of the last few days had not only sobered but brought home to him this real border life with all his fire and daring he new he was no fool he had eagerly embraced a career which at the present stage of his training was beyond his scopenot that he did not know how to act in sudden crises but because he had not had the necessary practice to quickly and surely use his knowledge  bitter indeed was his selfscorn when he recalled that of the several critical positions he had been in since his acquaintance with wetzel he had failed in all but one the exception was the killing of silvertip here his fury had made him fight as wetzel fought with only his every day incentive he realized that the border was no place for any save the boldest and most experienced huntersmen who had become inured to hardship callous as to death keen as indians fear was not in joe nor lack of confidence but he had good sense and realized he would have done a wiser thing had he stayed at fort henry colonel zane was right the indians were tigers the renegades vultures the vast untrammeled forests and plains their covert ten years of war had rendered this wilderness a place where those few white men who had survived were hardened to the spilling of blood stern even in those few quiet hours which peril allowed them strong in their sacrifice of all for future generations  a low growl from mose broke into joes reflections the dog had raised his nose from his paws and sniffed suspiciously at the air the lad heard a slight rustling outside and in another moment was overjoyed at seeing whispering winds she came swiftly with a lithe graceful motion and flying to him like a rush of wind knelt beside him she kissed him and murmured words of endearment  winds where have you been he asked her in the mixed english and indian dialect in which they conversed  she told him the dog had led her to him two evenings before he was insensible she had bathed and bandaged his wound and remained with him all that night the next day finding he was ill and delirious she decided to risk returning to the village if any questions arose she could say he had left her then she would find a way to get back to him bringing healing herbs for his wound and a soothing drink as it turned out girty had returned to the camp he was battered and bruised and in a white heat of passion going at once to wingenund the renegade openly accused whispering winds of aiding her paleface lover to escape wingenund called his daughter before him and questioned her she confessed all to her father  why is the daughter of wingenund a traitor to her race demanded the chief  whispering winds is a christian  wingenund received this intelligence as a blow he dismissed girty and sent his braves from his lodge facing his daughter alone gloomy and stern he paced before her  wingenunds blood might change but would never betray wingenund is the delaware chief he said go darken no more the door of wingenunds wigwam let the flower of the delawares fade in alien pastures go whispering winds is free  tears shone brightly in the indian girls eyes while she told joe her story she loved her father and she would see him no more  winds is free she whispered when strength returns to her master she can follow him to the white villages winds will live her life for him  then we have no one to fear asked joe  no redman now that the shawnee chief is dead  will girty follow us he is a coward he will fear to come alone  the white savage is a snake in the grass  two long days followed during which the lovers lay quietly in hiding on the morning of the third day joe felt that he might risk the start for the village of peace whispering winds led the horse below a stone upon which the invalid stood thus enabling him to mount then she got on behind him  the sun was just gilding the horizon when they rode out of the woods into a wide plain no living thing could be seen along the edge of the forest the ground was level and the horse traveled easily several times during the morning joe dismounted beside a pile of stones or a fallen tree the miles were traversed without serious inconvenience to the invalid except that he grew tired toward the middle of the afternoon when they had ridden perhaps twentyfive miles they crossed a swift narrow brook the water was a beautiful clear brown joe made note of this as it was an unusual circumstance nearly all the streams when not flooded were green in color he remembered that during his wanderings with wetzel they had found one stream of this brown coppercolored water the lad knew he must take a roundabout way to the village so that he might avoid indian runners or scouts and he hoped this stream would prove to be the one he had once camped upon  as they were riding toward a gentle swell or knoll covered with trees and shrubbery whispering winds felt something warm on her hand and looking was horrified to find it covered with blood joes wound had opened she told him they must dismount here and remain until he was stronger the invalid himself thought this conclusion was wise they would be practically safe now since they must be out of the indian path and many miles from the encampment accordingly he got off the horse and sat down on a log while whispering winds searched for a suitable place in which to erect a temporary shelter  joes wandering gaze was arrested by a tree with a huge knotty formation near the ground it was like many trees but this peculiarity was not what struck joe he had seen it before he never forgot anything in the woods that once attracted his attention he looked around on all sides just behind him was an opening in the clump of trees within this was a perpendicular stone covered with moss and lichens above it a beech tree spread long graceful branches he thrilled with the remembrance these familiar marks brought this was beautiful spring the place where wetzel rescued nell where he had killed the indians in that night attack he would never forget    chapter xix  one evening a week or more after the disappearance of jim and the girls george young and david edwards the missionaries sat on the cabin steps gazing disconsolately upon the forest scenery hard as had been the ten years of their labor among the indians nothing had shaken them as the loss of their young friends  dave i tell you your theory about seeing them again is absurd asserted george ill never forget that wretch girty as he spoke to nell why she just wilted like a flower blasted by fire i cant understand why he let me go and kept jim unless the shawnee had something to do with it i never wished until now that i was a hunter id go after girty youve heard as well as i of his many atrocities id rather have seen kate and nell dead than have them fall into his power id rather have killed them myself  young had aged perceptibly in these last few days the blue veins showed at his temples his face had become thinner and paler his eyes had a look of pain the former expression of patience which had sat so well on him was gone  george i cant account for my fancies or feelings else perhaps id be easier in mind answered dave his face too showed the ravages of grief ive had queer thoughts lately and dreams such as i never had before perhaps its this trouble which has made me so nervous i dont seem able to pull myself together i can neither preach nor work  neither can i this trouble has hit you as hard as it has me but dave weve still our duty to endure to endurethat is our life because a beam of sunshine brightened for a brief time the gray of our lives and then faded away we must not shirk nor grow sour and discontented  but how cruel is this border life  nature itself is brutal  yes i know and we have elected to spend our lives here in the midst of this ceaseless strife to fare poorly to have no pleasure never to feel the comfort of a womans smiles nor the joy of a childs caress all because out in the woods are ten or twenty or a hundred savages we may convert  that is why and it is enough it is hard to give up the women you love to a blacksouled renegade but that is not for my thought what kills me is the horror for herfor her  i too suffer with that thought more than that i am morbid and depressed i feel as if some calamity awaited us here i have never been superstitious nor have i had presentiments but of late there are strange fears in my mind  at this juncture mr wells and heckewelder came out of the adjoining cabin  i had word from a trustworthy runner today girty and his captives have not been seen in the delaware towns said heckewelder  it is most unlikely that he will take them to the towns replied edwards what do you make of his capturing jim  for pipe perhaps the delaware wolf is snapping his teeth pipe is particularly opposed to christianity andwhats that  a low whistle from the bushes near the creek bank attracted the attention of all the younger men got up to investigate but heckewelder detained them  wait he added there is no telling what that signal may mean  they waited with breathless interest presently the whistle was repeated and an instant later the tall figure of a man stepped from behind a thicket he was a white man but not recognizable at that distance even if a friend the stranger waved his hand as if asking them to be cautious and come to him  they went toward the thicket and when within a few paces of the man mr wells exclaimed  its the man who guided my party to the village it is wetzel  the other missionaries had never seen the hunter though of course they were familiar with his name and looked at him with great curiosity the hunters buckskin garments were wet torn and covered with burrs dark spots evidently blood stains showed on his huntingshirt  wetzel interrogated heckewelder  the hunter nodded and took a step behind the bush bending over he lifted something from the ground it was a girl it was nell she was very whitebut alive a faint glad smile lighted up her features  not a word was spoken with an expression of tender compassion mr wells received her into his arms the four missionaries turned fearful questioning eyes upon the hunter but they could not speak  shes well an unharmed said wetzel reading their thoughts only worn out ive carried her these ten miles  god bless you wetzel exclaimed the old missionary nellie nellie can you speak  uncle dearimall right came the faint answer  kate whatof her whispered george young with lips as dry as corn husks  i did my best said the hunter with a simple dignity nothing but the agonized appeal in the young mans eyes could have made wetzel speak of his achievement  tell us broke in heckewelder seeing that fear had stricken george dumb  we trailed em an got away with the goldenhaired lass the last i saw of joe he was braced up agin a rock fightin like a wildcat i tried to cut jim loose as i was goin by i spect the wust fer the brothers an the other lass  can we do nothing asked mr wells  nothin  wetzel has the capturing of james downs any significance to you inquired heckewelder  i reckon so  what  pipe an his whiteredskin allies are agin christianity  do you think we are in danger  i reckon so  what do you advise  pack up a few of your traps take the lass an come with me ill see you back in fort henry  heckewelder nervously walked up to the tree and back again young and edwards looked blankly at one another they both remembered edwards presentiment mr wells uttered an angry exclamation  you ask us to fail in our duty no never to go back to the white settlements and acknowledge we were afraid to continue teaching the gospel to the indians you can not understand christianity if you advise that you have no religion you are a killer of indians  a shadow that might have been one of pain flitted over the hunters face  no i aint a christian an i am a killer of injuns said wetzel and his deep voice had a strange tremor i dont know nothin much cept the woods an fields an if theres a god fer me hes out thar under the trees an grass mr wells youre the first man as ever called me a coward an i overlook it because of your callin i advise you to go back to fort henry because if you dont go now the chances are aginst your ever goin christianity or no christianity such men as you hev no bisness in these woods  i thank you for your advice and bless you for your rescue of this child but i can not leave my work nor can i understand why all this good work we have done should be called useless we have converted indians saved their souls is that not being of some use of some good here  its accordin to how you look at it now i know the bark of an oak is different accordin to the side we see from ill allow hatin injuns as i do is no reason you oughtnt to try an convert em but youre bringin on a war these injuns wont allow this village of peace here with its big fields of corn an shops an workin redskins its agin their nature youre only sacrificin your christian injuns  what do you mean asked mr wells startled by wetzels words  enough im ready to guide you to fort henry  ill never go  wetzel looked at the other men no one would have doubted him no one could have failed to see he knew that some terrible anger hovered over the village of peace  i believe you wetzel but i can not go said heckewelder with white face  i will stay said george steadily  and i said dave  wetzel nodded and turned to depart when george grasped his arm the young missionarys face was drawn and haggard he fixed an intense gaze upon the hunter  wetzel listen his voice was low and shaken with deep feeling i am a teacher of gods word and i am as earnest in that purpose as you are in your lifework i shall die here i shall fill an unmarked grave but i shall have done the best i could this is the life destiny has marked out for me and i will live it as best i may but in this moment preacher as i am i would give all i have or hope to have all the little good i may have done all my life to be such a man as you for i would avenge the woman i loved to torture to kill girty i am only a poor weak fellow who would be lost a mile from this village and if not would fall before the youngest brave but you with your glorious strength your incomparable woodcraft you are the man to kill girty rid the frontier of this fiend kill him wetzel kill him i beseech you for the sake of some sweet girl who even now may be on her way to this terrible country and who may fall into girtys powerfor her sake wetzel kill him trail him like a bloodhound and when you find him remember my broken heart remember nell remember oh god remember poor kate  youngs voice broke into dry sobs he had completely exhausted himself so that he was forced to lean against the tree for support  wetzel spoke never a word he stretched out his long brawny arm and gripped the young missionarys shoulder his fingers clasped hard simple without words as the action was it could not have been more potent and then as he stood the softer look faded slowly from his face a ripple seemed to run over his features which froze as it subsided into a cold stone rigidity  his arm dropped he stepped past the tree and bounding lightly as a deer cleared the creek and disappeared in the bushes  mr wells carried nell to his cabin where she lay for hours with wan face and listless languor she swallowed the nourishing drink an old indian nurse forced between her teeth she even smiled weakly when the missionaries spoke to her but she said nothing nor seemed to rally from her terrible shock a dark shadow lay always before her conscious of nothing present living over again her frightful experience again she seemed sunk in dull apathy  dave were going to loose nell shes fading slowly said george one evening several days after the girls return wetzel said she was unharmed yet she seems to have received a hurt more fatal than a physical one its her mindher mind if we cannot brighten her up to make her forget shell die  weve done all within our power if she could only be brought out of this trance she lies there all day long with those staring eyes i cant look into them they are the eyes of a child who has seen murder  we must try in some way to get her out of this stupor and i have an idea have you noticed that mr wells has failed very much in the last few weeks  indeed i have and im afraid hes breaking down he has grown so thin eats very little and doesnt sleep he is old you know and despite his zeal this border life is telling on him  dave i believe he knows it poor earnest old man he never says a word about himself yet he must know he is going down hill well we all begin sooner or later that descent which ends in the grave i believe we might stir nellie by telling her mr wells health is breaking  let us try  a hurried knock on the door interrupted their conversation  come in said edwards  the door opened to admit a man who entered eagerly  jim jim exclaimed both missionaries throwing themselves upon the newcomer  it was indeed jim but no answering smile lighted his worn distressed face while he wrung his friends hands  youre not hurt asked dave  no im uninjured  tell us all did you escape did you see your brother did you know wetzel rescued nell  wingenund set me free in spite of many demands for my death he kept joe a prisoner and intends to kill him for the lad was wetzels companion i saw the hunter come into the glade where we camped break through the line of fighting indians and carry nell off  kate faltered young with ashen face  george i wish to god i could tell you she is dead answered jim nervously pacing the room but she was well when i last saw her she endured the hard journey better than either nell or i girty did not carry her into the encampment as silvertip did joe and me but the renegade left us on the outskirts of the delaware town there was a rocky ravine with dense undergrowth where he disappeared with his captive i suppose he has his den somewhere in that ravine  george sank down and buried his face in his arms neither movement nor sound betokened consciousness  has wetzel come in with nell joe said he had a cave where he might have taken her in case of illness or accident  yes he brought her back answered edwards slowly  i want to see her said jim his haggard face expressing a keen anxiety shes not wounded hurt ill  no nothing like that its a shock which she cant get over cant forget  i must see her cried jim moving toward the door  dont go replied dave detaining him wait we must see whats best to be done wait till heckewelder comes hell be here soon nell thinks youre dead and the surprise might be bad for her  heckewelder came in at that moment and shook hands warmly with jim  the delaware runner told me you were here i am overjoyed that wingenund freed you said the missionary it is a most favorable sign i have heard rumors from goshocking and sandusky that have worried me this good news more than offsets the bad i am sorry about your brother are you well  well but miserable i want to see nell dave tells me she is not exactly ill but something is wrong with her perhaps i ought not to see her just yet  itll be exactly the tonic for her replied heckewelder shell be surprised out of herself she is morbid apathetic and try as we may we cant interest her come at once  heckewelder had taken jims arm and started for the door when he caught sight of young sitting bowed and motionless turning to jim he whispered  kate  girty did not take her into the encampment answered jim in a low voice i hoped he would because the indians are kind but he didnt he took her to his den  just then young raised his face the despair in it would have melted a heart of stone it had become the face of an old man  if only youd told me she had died he said to jim id have been man enough to stand it butthisthis kills mei cant breathe  he staggered into the adjoining room where he flung himself upon a bed  its hard and he wont be able to stand up under it for hes not strong whispered jim  heckewelder was a mild pious man in whom no one would ever expect strong passion but now depths were stirred within his heart that had ever been tranquil he became livid and his face was distorted with rage  its bad enough to have these renegades plotting and working against our religion to have them sow discontent spread lies make the indians think we have axes to grind to plant the only obstacle in our pathall this is bad but to doom an innocent white woman to worse than death what can i call it  what can we do asked jim  do thats the worst of it we can do nothing nothing we dare not move  is there no hope of getting kate back  hope none that villain is surrounded by his savages hell lie low now for a while ive heard of such deeds many a time but it never before came so close home kate wells was a pure loving christian woman shell live an hour a day a week perhaps in that snakes clutches and then shell die thank god  wetzel has gone on girtys trail i know that from his manner when he left us said edwards  wetzel may avenge her but he can never save her its too late hello  the exclamation was called forth by the appearance of young who entered with a rifle in his hands  george where are you going with that gun asked edwards grasping his friend by the arm  im going after her answered george wildly he tottered as he spoke but wrenched himself free from dave  come george listen listen to reason interposed heckewelder laying hold of young you are frantic with grief now so are all of us but calm yourself why man youre a preacher not a hunter youd be lost youd starve in the woods before getting half way to the indian town this is terrible enough dont make it worse by throwing your life away think of us your friends think of your indian pupils who rely so much on you think of the village of peace we can pray but we cant prevent these border crimes with civilization with the spread of christianity they will pass away bear up under this blow for the sake of your work remember we alone can check such barbarity but we must not fight we must sacrifice all that men hold dear for the sake of the future  he took the rifle away from george and led him back into the little dark room closing the door he turned to jim and dave  he is in a bad way and we must carefully watch him for a few days  think of george starting out to kill girty exclaimed dave i never fired a gun but yet id go too  so would we all if we did as our hearts dictate retorted heckewelder turning fiercely upon dave as if stung man we have a village full of christians to look after what would become of them i tell you weve all we can do here to outwit these border ruffians simon girty is plotting our ruin i heard it today from the delaware runner who is my friend he is jealous of our influence when all we desire is to save these poor indians and jim girty has killed our happiness can we ever recover from the misery brought upon us by poor kates fate  the missionary raised his hand as if to exhort some power above  curse the girtys he exclaimed in a sudden burst of uncontrollable passion having conquered all other obstacles must we fail because of wicked men of our own race oh curse them  come he said presently in a voice which trembled with the effort he made to be calm well go in to nellie  the three men entered mr wells cabin the old missionary with bowed head and hands clasped behind his back was pacing to and fro he greeted jim with glad surprise  we want nellie to see him whispered heckewelder we think the surprise will do her good  i trust it may said mr wells  leave it to me  they followed heckewelder into an adjoining room a torch flickered over the rude mantleshelf lighting up the room with fitful flare it was a warm night and the soft breeze coming in the window alternately paled and brightened the flame  jim saw nell lying on the bed her eyes were closed and her long dark lashes seemed black against the marble paleness of her skin  stand behind me whispered heckewelder to jim  nellie he called softly but only a faint flickering of her lashes answered him  nellie nellie repeated heckewelder his deep strong voice thrilling  her eyes opened they gazed at mr wells on one side at edwards standing at the foot of the bed at heckewelder leaning over her but there was no recognition or interest in her look  nellie can you understand me asked heckewelder putting into his voice all the power and intensity of feeling of which he was capable  an almost imperceptible shadow of understanding shone in her eyes  listen you have had a terrible shock and it has affected your mind you are mistaken in what you think what you dream of all the time do you understand you are wrong  nells eyes quickened with a puzzled questioning doubt the ministers magnetic penetrating voice had pierced her dulled brain  see i have brought you jim  heckewelder stepped aside as jim fell on his knees by the bed he took her cold hands in his and bent over her for the moment his voice failed  the doubt in nells eyes changed to a wondrous gladness it was like the rekindling of a smoldering fire  jim she whispered  yes nellie its jim alive and well its jim come back to you  a soft flush stained her white face she slipped her arm tenderly around his neck and held her cheek close to his  jim she murmured  nellie dont you know me asked mr wells trembling excited this was the first word she had spoken in four days  uncle she exclaimed suddenly loosening her hold on jim and sitting up in bed then she gazed wildly at the others  was it all a horrible dream  mr wells took her hand soothingly but he did not attempt to answer her question he looked helplessly at heckewelder but that missionary was intently studying the expression on nells face  part of it was a dream he answeredimpressively  then that horrible man did take us away  yes  ohh but were free now this is my room oh tell me  yes nellie youre safe at home now  telltell me she cried shudderingly as she leaned close to jim and raised a white imploring face to his where is kateoh jimsay say she wasnt left with girty  kate is dead answered jim quickly he could not endure the horror in her eyes he deliberately intended to lie as had heckewelder  it was as if the tension of nells nerves was suddenly relaxed the relief from her worst fear was so great that her mind took in only the one impression then presently a choking cry escaped her to be followed by a paroxysm of sobs    chapter xx  early on the following day heckewelder astride his horse appeared at the door of edwards cabin  how is george he inquired of dave when the latter had opened the door  he had a bad night but is sleeping now i think hell be all right after a time answered dave  thats well nevertheless keep a watch on him for a few days  ill do so  dave i leave matters here to your good judgment im off to goshocking to join zeisberger affairs there demand our immediate attention and we must make haste  how long do you intend to be absent  a few days possibly a week in case of any unusual disturbance among the indians the appearance of pipe and his tribe or any of the opposing factions send a fleet runner at once to warn me most of my fears have been allayed by wingenunds attitude toward us his freeing jim in face of the opposition of his chiefs is a sure sign of friendliness more than once i have suspected that he was interested in christianity his daughter whispering winds exhibited the same intense fervor in religion as has been manifested by all our converts it may be that we have not appealed in vain to wingenund and his daughter but their high position in the delaware tribe makes it impolitic for them to reveal a change of heart if we could win over those two wed have every chance to convert the whole tribe well as it is we must be thankful for wingenunds friendship we have two powerful allies now tarhe the wyandot chieftain remains neutral to be sure but thats almost as helpful as his friendship  i too take a hopeful view of the situation replied edwards  well trust in providence and do our best said heckewelder as he turned his horse goodby  godspeed called edwards as his chief rode away  the missionary resumed his work of getting breakfast he remained in doors all that day except for the few moments when he ran over to mr wells cabin to inquire regarding nells condition he was relieved to learn she was so much better that she had declared her intention of moving about the house dave kept a close watch on young he himself was suffering from the same blow which had prostrated his friend but his physical strength and fortitude were such that he did not weaken he was overjoyed to see that george rallied and showed no further indications of breaking down  true it was perhaps that heckewelders earnest prayer on behalf of the converted indians had sunk deeply into georges heart and thus kept it from breaking no stronger plea could have been made than the allusion to those gentle dependent christians no one but a missionary could realize the sweetness the simplicity the faith the eager hope for a good true life which had been implanted in the hearts of these indians to bear it in mind to think of what he as a missionary and teacher was to them relieved him of half his burden and for strength to bear the remainder he went to god for all worry there is a sovereign cure for all suffering there is a healing balm it is religious faith happiness had suddenly flashed with a meteorlike radiance into youngs life only to be snuffed out like a candle in a windy gloom but his work his duty remained so in his trial he learned the necessity of resignation he chaffed no more at the mysterious seemingly brutal methods of nature he questioned no more he wondered no more at the apparent indifference of providence he had one hope which was to be true to his faith and teach it to the end  nell mastered her grief by an astonishing reserve of strength undoubtedly it was that marvelously merciful power which enables a person for the love of others to bear up under a cross or even to fight death himself as young had his brighteyed indian boys and girls who had learned christianity from him and whose future depended on him so nell had her aged and weakening uncle to care for and cherish  jims attentions to her before the deep affliction had not been slight but now they were so marked as to be unmistakable in some way jim seemed changed since he had returned from the delaware encampment although he went back to the work with his old aggressiveness he was not nearly so successful as he had been before whether or not this was his fault he took his failure deeply to heart there was that in his tenderness which caused nell to regard him in one sense as she did her uncle jim too leaned upon her and she accepted his devotion where once she had repelled it she had unconsciously betrayed a great deal when she had turned so tenderly to him in the first moments after her recognition and he remembered it he did not speak of love to her he let a thousand little acts of kindness a constant thoughtfulness of her plead his cause  the days succeeding heckewelders departure were remarkable for several reasons although the weather was enticing the number of visiting indians gradually decreased not a runner from any tribe came into the village and finally the day dawned when not a single indian from the outlying towns was present to hear the preaching  jim spoke as usual after several days had passed and none but converted indians made up the congregation the young man began to be uneasy in mind  young and edwards were unable to account for the unusual absence from worship yet they did not see in it anything to cause especial concern often there had been days without visitation to the village of peace  finally jim went to consult glickhican he found the delaware at work in the potato patch the old indian dropped his hoe and bowed to the missionary a reverential and stately courtesy always characterized the attitude of the indians toward the young white father  glickhican can you tell me why no indians have come here lately  the old chief shook his head  does their absence signify ill to the village of peace  glickhican saw a blackbird flitting in the shadow of the moon the bird hovered above the village of peace but sang no song  the old delaware vouchsafed no other than this strange reply  jim returned to his cabin decidedly worried he did not at all like glickhicans answer the purport of it seemed to be that a cloud was rising on the bright horizon of the christian village he confided his fears to young and edwards after discussing the situation the three missionaries decided to send for heckewelder he was the leader of the mission he knew more of indian craft than any of them and how to meet it if this calm in the heretofore busy life of the mission was the lull before a storm heckewelder should be there with his experience and influence  for nearly ten years heckewelder has anticipated trouble from hostile savages said edwards but so far he has always averted it as you know he has confined himself mostly to propitiating the indians and persuading them to be friendly and listen to us well send for him  accordingly they dispatched a runner to goshocking in due time the indian returned with the startling news that heckewelder had left the indian village days before as had in fact all the savages except the few converted ones the same held true in the case of sandusky the adjoining town moreover it had been impossible to obtain any news in regard to zeisberger  the missionaries were now thoroughly alarmed and knew not what to do they concealed the real state of affairs from nell and her uncle desiring to keep them from anxiety as long as possible that night the three teachers went to bed with heavy hearts  the following morning at daybreak jim was awakened from a sound sleep by some one calling at his window he got up to learn who it was and in the gray light saw edwards standing outside  whats the matter questioned jim hurriedly  matter enough hurry get into your clothes replied edwards  as soon as you are dressed quietly awaken mr wells and nellie but do not frighten them  but whats the trouble queried jim as he began to dress  the indians are pouring into the village as thickly as flying leaves in autumn  edwards exaggerated assertion proved to be almost literally true no sooner had the rising sun dispelled the mist than it shone on long lines of marching braves mounted warriors hundreds of packhorses approaching from the forests the orderly procession was proof of a concerted plan on the part of the invaders  from their windows the missionaries watched with bated breath with wonder and fear they saw the long lines of dusky forms when they were in the clearing the savages busied themselves with their packs long rows of teepees sprung up as if by magic the savages had come to stay the number of incoming visitors did not lessen until noon when a few straggling groups marked the end of the invading host most significant of all was the fact that neither child maiden nor squaw accompanied this army  jim appraised the number at six or seven hundred more than had ever before visited the village at one time they were mostly delawares with many shawnees and a few hurons among them it was soon evident however that for the present at least the indians did not intend any hostile demonstration they were quiet in manner and busy about their teepees and campfires but there was an absence of the curiosity that had characterized the former sojourns of indians at the peaceful village  after a brief consultation with his brother missionaries who all were opposed to his preaching that afternoon jim decided he would not deviate from his usual custom he held the afternoon service and spoke to the largest congregation that had ever sat before him he was surprised to find that the sermon which heretofore so strongly impressed the savages did not now arouse the slightest enthusiasm it was followed by a brooding silence of a boding ominous import  four white men dressed in indian garb had been the most attentive listeners to jims sermon he recognized three as simon girty elliott and deering the renegades and he learned from edwards that the other was the notorious mckee these men went through the village stalking into the shops and cabins and acting as do men who are on a tour of inspection  so intrusive was their curiosity that jim hurried back to mr wells cabin and remained there in seclusion of course by this time nell and her uncle knew of the presence of the hostile savages they were frightened and barely regained their composure when the young man assured them he was certain they had no real cause for fear  jim was sitting at the doorstep with mr wells and edwards when girty with his comrades came toward them the renegade leader was a tall athletic man with a dark strong face there was in it none of the brutality and ferocity which marked his brothers visage simon girty appeared keen forceful authoritative as indeed he must have been to have attained the power he held in the confederated tribes his companions presented wide contrasts elliott was a small spare man of cunning vindictive aspect mckee looked as might have been supposed from his reputation and deering was a fit mate for the absent girty simon appeared to be a man of some intelligence who had used all his power to make that position a great one the other renegades were desperadoes  wheres heckewelder asked girty curtly as he stopped before the missionaries  he started out for the indian towns on the muskingong answered edwards but we have had no word from either him or zeisberger  when dye expect him  i cant say perhaps tomorrow and then again maybe not for a week  he is in authority here aint he  yes but he left me in charge of the mission can i serve you in any way  i reckon not said the renegade turning to his companions they conversed in low tones for a moment presently mckee elliott and deering went toward the newly erected teepees  girty do you mean us any ill will earnestly asked edwards he had met the man on more than one occasion and had no hesitation about questioning him  i cant say as i do answered the renegade and those who heard him believed him but im agin this redskin preachin an hev been all along the injuns are mad clear through an i aint sayin ive tried to quiet em any this missionary work has got to be stopped one way or another now what i waited here to say is this i aint quite forgot i was white once an believe you fellars are honest im willin to go outer my way to help you git away from here  go away echoed edwards  thats it answered girty shouldering his rifle  but why we are perfectly harmless we are only doing good and hurt no one why should we go  cause theres liable to be trouble said the renegade significantly  edwards turned slowly to mr wells and jim the old missionary was trembling visibly jim was pale but more with anger than fear  thank you girty but well stay and jims voice rang clear    chapter xxi  jim come out here called edwards at the window of mr wells cabin  the young man arose from the breakfast table and when outside found edwards standing by the door with an indian brave he was a wyandot lightly built lithe and wiry easily recognizable as an indian runner when jim appeared the man handed him a small packet he unwound a few folds of some oily skin to find a square piece of birch bark upon which were scratched the following words  rev j downs greeting  your brother is alive and safe whispering winds rescued him by taking him as her husband leave the village of peace pipe and half king have been influenced by girty  zane  now what do you think of that exclaimed jim handing the message to edwards thank heaven joe was saved  zane that must be the zane who married tarhes daughter answered edwards when he had read the note im rejoiced to hear of your brother  joe married to that beautiful indian maiden well of all wonderful things mused jim what will nell say  were getting warnings enough do you appreciate that asked edwards pipe and half king have been influenced by girty evidently the writer deemed that brief sentence of sufficient meaning  edwards were preachers we cant understand such things i am learning at least something every day colonel zane advised us not to come here wetzel said go back to fort henry girty warned us and now comes this peremptory order from isaac zane  well  it means that these border men see what we will not admit we ministers have such hope and trust in god that we can not realize the dangers of this life i fear that our work has been in vain  never we have already saved many souls do not be discouraged  all this time the runner had stood near at hand straight as an arrow presently edwards suggested that the wyandot was waiting to be questioned and accordingly he asked the indian if he had anything further to communicate  hurongo bypaleface here he held up both hands and shut his fists several times evidently enumerating how many white men he had seen herewhenhighsun  with that he bounded lightly past them and loped off with an even swinging stride  what did he mean asked jim almost sure he had not heard the runner aright  he meant that a party of white men are approaching and will be here by noon i never knew an indian runner to carry unreliable information we have joyful news both in regard to your brother and the village of peace let us go in to tell the others  the huron runners report proved to be correct shortly before noon signals from indian scouts proclaimed the approach of a band of white men evidently girtys forces had knowledge beforehand of the proximity of this band for the signals created no excitement the indians expressed only a lazy curiosity soon several delaware scouts appeared escorting a large party of frontiersmen  these men turned out to be captain williamsons force which had been out on an expedition after a marauding tribe of chippewas this last named tribe had recently harried the remote settlers and committed depredations on the outskirts of the white settlements eastward the company was composed of men who had served in the garrison at fort pitt and hunters and backwoodsmen from yellow creek and fort henry the captain himself was a typical borderman rough and bluff hardened by long years of border life and like most pioneers having no more use for an indian than for a snake he had led his party after the marauders and surprised and slaughtered nearly all of them returning eastward he had passed through goshocking where he learned of the muttering storm rising over the village of peace and had come more out of curiosity than hope to avert misfortune  the advent of so many frontiersmen seemed a godsend to the perplexed and worried missionaries they welcomed the newcomers most heartily beds were made in several of the newly erected cabins the village was given over for the comfort of the frontiersmen edwards conducted captain williamson through the shops and schools and the old bordermans weatherbeaten face expressed a comical surprise  wal ill be durned if i ever expected to see a redskin work was his only comment on the industries  we are greatly alarmed by the presence of girty and his followers said edwards we have been warned to leave but have not been actually threatened what do you infer from the appearance here of these hostile savages  it hardly pears to me theyll bother you preachers theyre agin the christian redskins thats plain  why have we been warned to go  thats natural seein theyre agin the preachin  what will they do with the converted indians  mighty onsartin they might let them go back to the tribes but pears to me these good injuns wont go another thing girty is afeered of the spread of christianity  then you think our christians will be made prisoners  pears likely  and you also think wed do well to leave here  i do sartin were startin for fort henry soon youd better come along with us  captain williamson were going to stick it out girty or no girty  you cant do no good stayin here pipe and half king wont stand for the singin prayin redskins especially when theyve got all these cattle and fields of grain  wetzel said the same  hev you seen wetzel  yes he rescued a girl from jim girty and returned her to us  that so i met wetzel and jack zane back a few miles in the woods theyre layin for somebody because when i asked them to come along they refused sayin they had work as must be done they looked like it too i never hern tell of wetzel advisin any one before but ill say if he told me to do a thing by gosh id do it  as men we might very well take the advice given us but as preachers we must stay here to do all we can for these christian indians one thing more will you help us  i reckon ill stay here to see the thing out answered williamson edwards made a mental note of the frontiersmans evasive answer  jim had meanwhile made the acquaintance of a young minister john christy by name who had lost his sweetheart in one of the chippewa raids and had accompanied the williamson expedition in the hope he might rescue her  how long have you been out asked jim  about four weeks now answered christy my betrothed was captured five weeks ago yesterday i joined williamsons band which made up at short creek to take the trail of the flying chippewas in the hope i might find her but not a trace the expedition fell upon a band of redskins over on the walhonding and killed nearly all of them i learned from a wounded indian that a renegade had made off with a white girl about a week previous perhaps it was poor lucy  jim related the circumstances of his own capture by jim girty the rescue of nell and kates sad fate  could jim girty have gotten your girl inquired jim in conclusion  its fairly probable the description doesnt tally with girtys this renegade was short and heavy and noted especially for his strength of course an indian would first speak of some such distinguishing feature there are however ten or twelve renegades on the border and excepting jim girty ones as bad as another  then its a common occurrence this abducting girls from the settlements  yes and the strange thing is that one never hears of such doings until he gets out on the frontier  for that matter you dont hear much of anything except of the wonderful richness and promise of the western country  youre right rumors of fat fertile lands induce the colonist to become a pioneer he comes west with his family two out of every ten lose their scalps and in some places the average is much greater the wives daughters and children are carried off into captivity i have been on the border two years and know that the rescue of any captive as wetzel rescued your friend is a remarkable exception  if you have so little hope of recovering your sweetheart what then is your motive for accompanying this band of hunters  revenge  and you are a preacher jims voice did not disguise his astonishment  i was a preacher and now i am thirsting for vengeance answered christy his face clouding darkly wait until you learn what frontier life means you are young here yet you are flushed with the success of your teaching you have lived a short time in this quiet village where until the last few days all has been serene you know nothing of the strife of the necessity of fighting of the cruelty which makes up this border existence only two years have hardened me so that i actually pant for the blood of the renegade who has robbed me a frontiersman must take his choice of succumbing or cutting his way through flesh and bone blood will be spilled if not yours then your foes the pioneers run from the plow to the fight they halt in the cutting of corn to defend themselves and in winter must battle against cold and hardship which would be less cruel if there was time in summer to prepare for winter for the savages leave them hardly an opportunity to plant crops how many pioneers have given up and gone back east find me any who would not return home tomorrow if they could all that brings them out here is the chance for a home and all that keeps them out here is the poor hope of finally attaining their object always there is a possibility of future prosperity but this generation if it survives will never see prosperity and happiness what does this border life engender in a pioneer who holds his own in it of all things not christianity he becomes a fighter keen as the redskin who steals through the coverts                                  the serene days of the village of peace had passed into history soon that depraved vagabond the french trader with cheap trinkets and vile whisky made his appearance this was all that was needed to inflame the visitors where they had been only bold and impudent they became insulting and abusive they execrated the christian indians for their neutrality scorned them for worshiping this unknown god and denounced a religion which made women of strong men  the slaughtering of cattle commenced the despoiling of maize fields and robbing of corncribs began with the drunkenness  all this time it was seen that girty and elliott consulted often with pipe and half king the latter was the only huron chief opposed to neutrality toward the village of peace and he was if possible more fierce in his hatred than pipe the future of the christian settlement rested with these two chiefs girty and elliott evidently were the designing schemers and they worked diligently on the passions of these simpleminded but fierce warlike chiefs  greatly to the relief of the distracted missionaries heckewelder returned to the village jaded and haggard he presented a travelworn appearance he made the astonishing assertions that he had been thrice waylaid and assaulted on his way to goshocking then detained by a roving band of chippewas and soon after his arrival at their camping ground a renegade had run off with a white woman captive while the indians west of the village were in an uproar zeisberger however was safe in the moravian town of salem some miles west of goshocking heckewelder had expected to find the same condition of affairs as existed in the village of peace but he was bewildered by the great array of hostile indians chiefs who had once extended friendly hands to him now drew back coldly as they said  washington is dead the american armies are cut to pieces the few thousands who had escaped the british are collecting at fort pitt to steal the indians land  heckewelder vigorously denied all these assertions knowing they had been invented by girty and elliott he exhausted all his skill and patience in the vain endeavor to show pipe where he was wrong half king had been so well coached by the renegades that he refused to listen the other chiefs maintained a cold reserve that was baffling and exasperating wingenund took no active part in the councils but his presence apparently denoted that he had sided with the others the outlook was altogether discouraging  im completely fagged out declared heckewelder that night when he returned to edwards cabin he dropped into a chair as one whose strength is entirely spent whose indomitable spirit has at last been broken  lie down to rest said edwards  oh i cant matters look so black  youre tired out and discouraged youll feel better tomorrow the situation is not perhaps so hopeless the presence of these frontiersmen should encourage us  what will they do what can they do cried heckewelder bitterly i tell you never before have i encountered such gloomy stony indians it seems to me that they are in no vacillating state they act like men whose course is already decided upon and who are only waiting  for what asked jim after a long silence  god only knows perhaps for a time possibly for a final decision and it may be for a reason the very thought of which makes me faint  tell us said edwards speaking quietly for he had ever been the calmest of the missionaries  never mind perhaps its only my nerves im all unstrung and could suspect anything tonight  heckewelder tell us jim asked earnestly  my friends i pray i am wrong god help us if my fears are correct i believe the indians are waiting for jim girty    chapter xxii  simon girty lolled on a blanket in half kings teepee he was alone awaiting his allies rings of white smoke curled lazily from his lips as he puffed on a long indian pipe and gazed out over the clearing that contained the village of peace  still water has something in its placid surface significant of deep channels of hidden depths the dim outline of the forest is dark with meaning suggestive of its wild internal character so simon girtys hard bronzed face betrayed the man his degenerate brothers features were revolting but his own were striking and fell short of being handsome only because of their craggy hardness years of revolt of bitterness of consciousness of wasted life had graven their stern lines on that copper masklike face yet despite the cruelty there the forbidding shade on it as if a reflection from a dark soul it was not wholly a bad countenance traces still lingered faintly of a man in whom kindlier feelings had once predominated  in a moment of pique girty had deserted his military post at fort pitt and become an outlaw of his own volition previous to that time he had been an able soldier and a good fellow when he realized that his step was irrevocable that even his best friends condemned him he plunged with anger and despair in his heart into a war upon his own race both of his brothers had long been border ruffians whose only protection from the outraged pioneers lay in the faraway camps of hostile tribes george girty had so sunk his individuality into the savages that he was no longer a white man jim girty stalked over the borderland with a bloody tomahawk his long arm outstretched to clutch some unfortunate white woman and with his hideous smile of death both of these men were far lower than the worst savages and it was almost wholly to their deeds of darkness that simon girty owed his infamous name  today white chief as girty was called awaited his men a slight tremor of the ground caused him to turn his gaze the huron chief half king resplendent in his magnificent array had entered the teepee he squatted in a corner rested the bowl of his great pipe on his knee and smoked in silence the habitual frown of his black brow like a shaded overhanging cliff the fire flashing from his eyes as a shining light is reflected from a dark pool his closelyshut bulging jaw all bespoke a nature lofty in its indian pride and arrogance but more cruel than death  another chief stalked into the teepee and seated himself it was pipe his countenance denoted none of the intelligence that made wingenunds face so noble it was even coarser than half kings and his eyes resembling live coals in the dark the long cruel lines of his jaw the thin tightlyclosed lips which looked as if they could relax only to utter a savage command expressed fierce cunning and brutality  white chief is idle today said half king speaking in the indian tongue  king i am waiting girty is slow but sure answered the renegade  the eagle sails slowly round and round up and up replied half king with majestic gestures until his eye sees all until he knows his time then he folds his wings and swoops down from the blue sky like the forked fire so does white chief but half king is impatient  today decides the fate of the village of peace answered girty imperturbably  ugh grunted pipe  half king vented his approval in the same meaning exclamation  an hour passed the renegade smoked in silence the chiefs did likewise  a horseman rode up to the door of the teepee dismounted and came in it was elliott he had been absent twenty hours his buckskin suit showed the effect of hard riding through the thickets  hullo bill any sign of jim was girtys greeting to his lieutenant  nary hes not been seen near the delaware camp hes after that chap who married winds  i thought so jims roundin up a tenderfoot who will be a bad man to handle if he has half a chance i saw as much the day he took his horse away from silver he finally did fer the shawnee an almost put jim out my brother oughtnt to give rein to personal revenge at a time like this girtys face did not change but his tone was one of annoyance  jim said hed be here today didnt he  today is as long as we allowed to wait  hell come wheres jake and mac  theyre here somewhere drinkin like fish an raisin hell  two more renegades appeared at the door and entering the teepee squatted down in indian fashion the little wiry man with the wizened face was mckee the other was the latest acquisition to the renegade force jake deering deserter thief murderereverything that is bad in appearance he was of medium height but very heavily compactly built and evidently as strong as an ox he had a tangled shock of red hair a broad bloated face big dull eyes like the openings of empty furnaces and an expression of beastliness  deering and mckee were intoxicated  bad time fer drinkin said girty with disapproval in his glance  whats that ter you growled deering im here ter do your work an i reckon itll be done better if im drunk  dont git careless replied girty with that cool tone and dark look such as dangerous men use im only sayin its a bad time fer you because if this bunch of frontiersmen happen to git onto you bein the renegade that was with the chippewas an got thet young fellers girl theres liable to be trouble  they aint agoin ter find out  where is she  back there in the woods  mebbe its as well now dont git so drunk youll blab all you know weve lots of work to do without havin to clean up williamsons bunch rejoined girty bill tie up the tent flaps an well git to council  elliott arose to carry out the order and had pulled in the deerhide flaps when one of them was jerked outward to disclose the befrilled person of jim girty except for a discoloration over his eye he appeared as usual  ugh grunted pipe who was glad to see his renegade friend  half king evinced the same feeling  hullo was simon girtys greeting  pears im on time fer the picnic said jim girty with his ghastly leer  bill elliott closed the flaps after giving orders to the guard to prevent any indians from loitering near the teepee  listen said simon girty speaking low in the delaware language the time is ripe we have come here to break forever the influence of the white mans religion our councils have been held we shall drive away the missionaries and burn the village of peace  he paused leaning forward in his exceeding earnestness with his bronzed face lined by swelling veins his whole person made rigid by the murderous thought then he hissed between his teeth what shall we do with these christian indians  pipe raised his warclub struck it upon the ground then handed it to half king  half king took the club and repeated the action  both chiefs favored the death penalty  feed em to ther buzzards croaked jim girty  simon girty knitted his brow in thought the question of what to do with the converted indians had long perplexed him  no said he let us drive away the missionaries burn the village and take the indians back to camp well keep them there theyll soon forget  pipe does not want them declared the delaware  christian indians shall never sit round half kings fire cried the huron  simon girty knew the crisis had come that but few moments were left him to decide as to the disposition of the christians and he thought seriously certainly he did not want the christians murdered however cruel his life and great his misdeeds he was still a man if possible he desired to burn the village and ruin the religious influence but without shedding blood yet with all his power he was handicapped and that by the very chiefs most nearly under his control he could not subdue this growing christian influence without the help of pipe and half king to these savages a thing was either right or wrong he had sown the seed of unrest and jealousy in the savage breasts and the fruit was the decree of death as far as these indians were concerned this decision was unalterable  on the other hand if he did not spread ruin over the village of peace the missionaries would soon get such a grasp on the tribes that their hold would never be broken he could not allow that even if he was forced to sacrifice the missionaries along with their converts for he saw in the growth of this religion his own downfall the border must be hostile to the whites or it could no longer be his home to be sure he had aided the british in the revolution and could find a refuge among them but this did not suit him  he became an outcast because of failure to win the military promotion which he had so much coveted he had failed among his own people he had won a great position in an alien race and he loved his power to sway menindians if not othersto his will to avenge himself for the fancied wrong done him to be great had been his unrelenting purpose  he knew he must sacrifice the christians or eventually lose his own power he had no false ideas about the converted indians he knew they were innocent that they were a thousand times better off than the pagan indians that they had never harmed him nor would they ever do so but if he allowed them to spread their religion there was an end of simon girty  his decision was characteristic of the man he would sacrifice any one or all to retain his supremacy he knew the fulfillment of the decree as laid down by pipe and half king would be known as his work his name infamous now would have an additional horror and ever be remembered by posterity in unspeakable loathing in unsoftening wrath he knew this and deep down in his heart awoke a numbed chord of humanity that twinged with strange pain what awful work he must sanction to keep his vaunted power more bitter than all was the knowledge that to retain this hold over the indians he must commit a deed which so far as the whites were concerned would take away his great name and brand him a coward  he briefly reviewed his stirring life singularly fitted for a leader in a few years he had risen to the most powerful position on the border he wielded more influence than any chief he had been opposed to the invasion of the pioneers and this alone without his sagacity or his generalship would have given him control of many tribes but hatred for his own people coupled with unerring judgment a remarkable ability to lead expeditions and his invariable success had raised him higher and higher until he stood alone he was the most powerful man west of the alleghenies his fame was such that the british had importuned him to help them and had actually in more than one instance given him command over british subjects  all of which meant that he had a great even though an infamous name no matter what he was blamed for no matter how many dastardly deeds had been committed by his depraved brothers and laid to his door he knew he had never done a cowardly act that which he had committed while he was drunk he considered as having been done by the liquor and not by the man he loved his power and he loved his name  in all girtys eventful ignoble life neither the alienation from his people the horror they ascribed to his power nor the sacrifice of his life to stand high among the savage races nor any of the cruel deeds committed while at war hurt him a tithe as much as did this sanctioning the massacre of the christians  although he was a vengeful unscrupulous evil man he had never acted the coward  half king waited long for girty to speak since he remained silent the wily huron suggested they take a vote on the question  let us burn the village of peace drive away the missionaries and take the christians back to the delaware townsall without spilling blood said girty determined to carry his point if possible  i say the same added elliott refusing the warclub held out to him by half king  me too voted mckee not so drunk but that he understood the lightninglike glance girty shot at him  kill em all kill everybody cried deering in drunken glee he took the club and pounded with it on the ground  pipe repeated his former performance as also did half king after which he handed the black knotted symbol of death to jim girty  three had declared for saving the christians and three for the death penalty  six pairs of burning eyes were fastened on the deathshead  pipe and half king were coldly relentless deering awoke to a brutal earnestness mckee and elliott watched with bated breath these men had formed themselves into a tribunal to decide on the life or death of many and the situation if not the greatest in their lives certainly was one of vital importance  simon girty cursed all the fates he dared not openly oppose the voting and he could not before those cruel but just chiefs try to influence his brothers vote  as jim girty took the warclub simon read in his brothers face the doom of the converted indians and he muttered to himself  now tremble an shrink all you christians  jim was not in a hurry slowly he poised the warclub he was playing as a cat plays with a mouse he was glorying in his power the silence was that of death it signified the silence of death the warclub descended with violence  feed the christians to ther buzzards    chapter xxiii  i have been here before said joe to whispering winds i remember that vinecovered stone we crawled over it to get at girty and silvertip theres the little knoll heres the very spot where i was hit by a flying tomahawk yes and theres the spring let me see what did wetzel call this spot  beautiful spring answered the indian girl  thats it and its well named what a lovely place  nature had been lavish in the beautifying of this inclosed dell it was about fifty yards wide and nestled among little wooded knolls and walls of gray lichencovered stone though the sun shone brightly into the opening and the rain had free access to the mossy ground no stormy winds ever entered this well protected glade  joe reveled in the beauty of the scene even while he was too weak to stand erect he suffered no pain from his wound although he had gradually grown dizzy and felt as if the ground was rising before him he was glad to lie upon the mossy ground in the little cavern under the cliff  upon examination his wound was found to have opened and was bleeding his hunting coat was saturated with blood whispering winds washed the cut and dressed it with cooling leaves then she rebandaged it tightly with joes linsey handkerchiefs and while he rested comfortable she gathered bundles of ferns carrying them to the little cavern when she had a large quantity of these she sat down near joe and began to weave the long stems into a kind of screen the fern stalks were four feet long and half a foot wide these she deftly laced together making broad screens which would serve to ward off the night dews this done she next built a fireplace with flat stones she found wild apples plums and turnips on the knoll above the glade then she cooked strips of meat which had been brought with them lance grazed on the long grass just without the glade and mose caught two rabbits when darkness settled down whispering winds called the dog within the cavern and hung the screens before the opening  several days passed joe rested quietly and began to recover strength besides the work of preparing their meals whispering winds had nothing to do save sit near the invalid and amuse or interest him so that he would not fret or grow impatient while his wound was healing  they talked about their future prospects after visiting the village of peace they would go to fort henry where joe could find employment they dwelt upon the cabin they would build and passed many happy moments planning a new home joes love of the wilderness had in no wise diminished but a blow on his head from a heavy tomahawk and a vicious stab in the back had lessened his zeal so far that he understood it was not wise to sacrifice life for the pleasures of the pathless woods he could have the last without the danger of being shot at from behind every tree he reasoned that it would be best for him to take his wife to fort henry there find employment and devote his leisure time to roaming in the forest  will the palefaces be kind to an indian who has learned to love them whispering winds asked wistfully of joe  indeed they will answered joe and he told her the story of isaac zane how he took his indian bride home how her beauty and sweetness soon won all the white peoples love it will be so with you my wife  whispering winds knows so little she murmured  why you are learning every day and even if such was not the case you know enough for me  whispering winds will be afraid she fears a little to go  ill be glad when we can be on the move said joe with his old impatient desire for action how soon winds can we set off  as many days answered the indian girl holding up five fingers  so long i want to leave this place  leave beautiful spring  yes even this sweet place it has a horror for me ill never forget the night i first saw that spring shining in the moonlight it was right above the rock that i looked into the glade the moon was reflected in the dark pool and as i gazed into the shadowy depths of the dark water i suddenly felt an unaccountable terror but i oughtnt to have the same feeling now we are safe are we not  we are safe murmured whispering winds  yet i have the same chill of fear whenever i look at the beautiful spring and at night as i awake to hear the soft babble of running water i freeze until my heart feels like cold lead winds im not a coward but i cant help this feeling perhaps its only the memory of that awful night with wetzel  an indian feels so when he passes to his unmarked grave answered winds gazing solemnly at him whispering winds does not like this fancy of yours let us leave beautiful spring you are almost well ah if whispering winds should lose you i love you  and i love you my beautiful wild flower answered joe stroking the dark head so near his own  a tender smile shone on his face he heard a slight noise without the cave and looking up saw that which caused the smile to fade quickly  mose he called sharply the dog was away chasing rabbits  whispering winds glanced over her shoulder with a startled cry which ended in a scream  not two yards behind her stood jim girty  hideous was his face in its triumphant ferocity he held a long knife in his hand and snarling like a mad wolf he made a forward lunge  joe raised himself quickly but almost before he could lift his hand in defense the long blade was sheathed in his breast  slowly he sank back his gray eyes contracting with the old steely flash the will to do was there but the power was gone forever  remember girty murderer i am wetzels friend he cried gazing at his slayer with unutterable scorn  then the gray eyes softened and sought the blanched face of the stricken maiden  winds he whispered faintly  she was as one frozen with horror  the gray eyes gazed into hers with lingering tenderness then the film of death came upon them  the renegade raised his bloody knife and bent over the prostrate form  whispering winds threw herself upon girty with the blind fury of a maddened lioness cursing fiercely he stabbed her once twice three times she fell across the body of her lover and clasped it convulsively  girty gave one glance at his victims deliberately wiped the gory knife on winds leggins and with another glance hurried and fearful around the glade he plunged into the thicket  an hour passed a dark stream crept from the quiet figures toward the spring it dyed the moss and the green violet leaves slowly it wound its way to the clear water dripping between the pale blue flowers the little fall below the spring was no longer snowy white blood had tinged it red  a dog came bounding into the glade he leaped the brook hesitated on the bank and lowered his nose to sniff at the water he bounded up the bank to the cavern  a long mournful howl broke the wildernesss quiet  another hour passed the birds were silent the insects still the sun sank behind the trees and the shades of evening gathered  the ferns on the other side of the glade trembled a slight rustle of dead leaves disturbed the stillness the dog whined then barked the tall form of a hunter rose out of the thicket and stepped into the glade with his eyes bent upon moccasin tracks in the soft moss  the trail he had been following led him to this bloody spring  i might hev knowed it he muttered  wetzel for it was he leaned upon his long rifle while his keen eyes took in the details of the tragedy the whining dog the bloody water the motionless figures lying in a last embrace told the sad story  joe an winds he muttered  only a moment did he remain lost in sad reflection a familiar moccasinprint in the sand on the bank pointed westward he examined it carefully  two hours gone he muttered i might overtake him  then his motions became swift with two blows of his tomahawk he secured a long piece of grapevine he took a heavy stone from the bed of the brook he carried joe to the spring and returning for winds placed her beside her lover this done he tied one end of the grapevine around the stone and wound the other about the dead bodies  he pushed them off the bank into the spring as the lovers sank into the deep pool they turned exposing first winds sad face and then joes then they sank out of sight little waves splashed on the shore of the pool the ripple disappeared and the surface of the spring became tranquil  wetzel stood one moment over the watery grave of the maiden who had saved him and the boy who had loved him in the gathering gloom his stalwart form assumed gigantic proportions and when he raised his long arm and shook his clenched fist toward the west he resembled a magnificent statue of dark menace  with a single bound he cleared the pool and then sped out of the glade he urged the dog on girtys trail and followed the eager beast toward the west as he disappeared a long low sound like the sigh of the night wind swelled and moaned through the gloom    chapter xxiv  when the first ruddy rays of the rising sun crimsoned the eastern sky wetzel slowly wound his way down a rugged hill far west of beautiful spring a white dog weary and footsore limped by his side both man and beast showed evidence of severe exertion  the hunter stopped in a little cave under a projecting stone and laying aside his rifle began to gather twigs and sticks he was particular about selecting the wood and threw aside many pieces which would have burned well but when he did kindle a flame it blazed hotly yet made no smoke  he sharpened a green stick and taking some strips of meat from his pocket roasted them over the hot flame he fed the dog first mose had crouched close on the ground with his head on his paws and his brown eyes fastened upon the hunter  he had too big a start fer us said wetzel speaking as if the dog were human it seemed that wetzels words were a protest against the meaning in those large sad eyes  then the hunter put out the fire and searching for a more secluded spot finally found one on top of the ledge where he commanded a good view of his surroundings the weary dog was asleep wetzel settled himself to rest and was soon wrapped in slumber  about noon he awoke he arose stretched his limbs and then took an easy position on the front of the ledge where he could look below evidently the hunter was waiting for something the dog slept on it was the noonday hour when the stillness of the forest almost matched that of midnight the birds were more quiet than at any other time during daylight  wetzel reclined there with his head against the stone and his rifle resting across his knees  he listened now to the sounds of the forest the soft breeze fluttering among the leaves the raincall of the tree frog the caw of crows from distant hilltops the sweet songs of the thrush and oriole were blended together naturally harmoniously  but suddenly the hunter raised his head a note deeper than the others a little too strong came from far down the shaded hollow to wetzels trained ear it was a discord he manifested no more than this attention for the birdcall was the signal he had been awaiting he whistled a note in answer that was as deep and clear as the one which had roused him  moments passed there was no repetition of the sound the songs of the other birds had ceased besides wetzel there was another intruder in the woods  mose lifted his shaggy head and growled the hunter patted the dog in a few minutes the figure of a tall man appeared among the laurels down the slope he stopped while gazing up at the ledge then with noiseless step he ascended the ridge climbed the rocky ledge and turned the corner of the stone to face wetzel the newcomer was jonathan zane  jack i expected you afore this was wetzels greeting  i couldnt make it sooner answered zane after we left williamson and separated i got turned around by a band of several hundred redskins makin for the village of peace i went back again but couldnt find any sign of the trail were huntin then i makes for this meetin place ive been goin for some ten hours and am hungry  ive got some bar ready cooked said wetzel handing zane several strips of meat  what luck did you have  i found girtys trail an old one over here some eighteen or twenty miles an follered it until i went almost into the delaware town it led to a hut in a deep ravine i aint often surprised but i wus then i found the dead body of that girl kate wells we fetched over from fort henry thets sad but it aint the surprisin part i also found silvertip the shawnee ive been lookin fer he was all knocked an cut up deadern a stone thered been somethin of a scrap in the hut i calkilate girty murdered kate but i couldnt think then who did fer silver though i allowed the renegade might hev done thet too i watched round an seen girty come back to the hut he had ten injuns with him an presently they all made fer the west i trailed them but didnt calkilate itd be wise to tackle the bunch singlehanded so laid back a mile or so from the hut i came across hoss tracks minglin with the moccasinprints about fifteen mile or from the delaware town girty left his buckskins an they went west while he stuck to the hoss tracks i was onto his game in a minute i cut across country fer beautiful spring but i got there too late i found the warm bodies of joe and thet injun girl winds the snake hed murdered them  i allow joe won over winds got away from the delaware town with her tried to rescue kate and killed silver in the fight girty probably was surprised an run after he had knifed the girl  pears so to me joe had two knife cuts an one was an old wound  you say it was a bad fight  must hev been the hut was all knocked in an stuff scattered about wal joe could go some if he onct got started  ill bet he could he was the likeliest lad ive seen for many a day  if hed lasted hed been somethin of a hunter an fighter  too bad but lord you couldnt keep him down no more than you can lots of these wild young chaps that drift out here  ill allow he had the fever bad  did you hev time to bury them  i hednt time fer much i sunk them in the spring  its a pretty deep hole said zane reflectively then you and the dog took girtys trail but couldnt catch up with him hes now with the renegade cutthroats and hundreds of riled indians over there in the village of peace  i reckon youre right  a long silence ensued jonathan finished his simple repast drank from the little spring that trickled under the stone and sitting down by the dog smoothed out his long silken hair  lew were pretty good friends aint we he asked thoughtfully  jack you an the colonel are all the friends i ever hed ceptin that boy lyin quiet back there in the woods  i know you pretty well and aint sayin a word about your runnin off from me on many a hunt but i want to speak plain about this fellow girty  wal said wetzel as zane hesitated  twice in the last few years you and i have had it in for the same men both whitelivered traitors you remember first it was miller who tried to ruin my sister betty and next it was jim girty who murdered our old friend as good an old man as ever wore moccasins wal after miller ran off from the fort we trailed him down to the river and i points across and says you or me and you says me you was bettys friend and i knew shed be avenged miller is lyin quiet in the woods and violets have blossomed twice over his grave though you never said a word but i know its true because i know you  zane looked eagerly into the dark face of his friend hoping perhaps to get some verbal assurance there that his belief was true but wetzel did not speak and he continued  another day not so long ago we both looked down at an old friend and saw his white hair matted with blood hed been murdered for nothin again you and me trailed a coward and found him to be jim girty i knew youd been huntin him for years and so i says lew you or me and you says me i give in to you for i knew youre a better man than me and because i wanted you to have the satisfaction wal the months have gone by and jim girtys still livin and carryin on now hes over there after them poor preachers i aint sayin lew that you havent more agin him than me but i do say let me in on it with you he always has a gang of redskins with him hes afraid to travel alone else youd had him long ago two of usll have more chance to get him let me go with you when it comes to a finish ill stand aside while you give it to him id enjoy seein you cut him from shoulder to hip after he leaves the village of peace well hit his trail camp on it and stick to it until it ends in his grave  the earnest voice of the backwoodsman ceased both men rose and stood facing each other zanes bronzed face was hard and tense expressive of an indomitable will wetzels was coldly dark with fateful resolve as if his decree of vengeance once given was as immutable as destiny the big horny hands gripped in a viselike clasp born of fierce passion but no word was spoken  far to the west somewhere a befrilled and bedizened renegade pursued the wild tenor of his ways perhaps even now steeping his soul in more crime or staining his hands a deeper red but sleeping or waking he dreamed not of this deadly compact that meant his doom  the two hunters turned their stern faces toward the west and passed silently down the ridge into the depths of the forest darkness found them within rifleshot of the village of peace with the dog creeping between them they crawled to a position which would in daylight command a view of the clearing then while one stood guard the other slept  when morning dawned they shifted their position to the top of a low ferncovered cliff from which they could see every movement in the village all the morning they watched with that wonderful patience of men who knew how to wait the visiting savages were quiet the missionaries moved about in and out of the shops and cabins the christian indians worked industriously in the fields while the renegades lolled before a prominent teepee  this quiet looks bad whispered jonathan to wetzel no shouts were heard not a hostile indian was seen to move  theyve come to a decision whispered jonathan and wetzel answered him  if they hev the christians dont know it  an hour later the deep pealing of the church bell broke the silence the entire band of christian indians gathered near the large log structure and then marched in orderly form toward the maple grove where the service was always held in pleasant weather this movement brought the indians within several hundred yards of the cliff where zane and wetzel lay concealed  theres heckewelder walking with old man wells whispered jonathan theres young and edwards and yes theres the young missionary brother of joe pears to me theyre foolish to hold service in the face of all those riled injuns  wussn foolish answered wetzel  look by gum as im a livin sinner there comes the whole crowd of hostile redskins theyve got their guns andby gum theyre painted looks bad bad not much friendliness about that bunch  they aint intendin to be peaceable  by gum youre right there aint one of them settin down pears to me i know some of them redskins theres pipe sure enough and kotoxen by gum if there aint shingiss he was friendly once  none of thems friendly  look lew look right behind pipe see that long warbonnet as im a born sinner thats your old friend wingenund pears to me weve rounded up all our acquaintances  the two bordermen lay close under the tall ferns and watched the proceedings with sharp eyes they saw the converted indians seat themselves before the platform the crowd of hostile indians surrounded the glade on all sides except on which singularly enough was next to the woods  look thar exclaimed wetzel under his breath he pointed off to the right of the maple glade jonathan gazed in the direction indicated and saw two savages stealthily slipping through the bushes and behind trees presently these suspicious acting spies or scouts stopped on a little knoll perhaps an hundred yards from the glade  wetzel groaned  this aint comfortable growled zane in a low whisper them red devils are up to somethin bad theyd better not move round over here  the hunters satisfied that the two isolated savages meant mischief turned their gaze once more toward the maple grove  ah simon you white traitor see him lew comin with his precious gang said jonathan hes got the whole thing fixed you can plainly see that bill elliott mckee and whos that renegade with jim girty ill allow he must be the fellar we heard was with the chippewas tough lookin customer a good mate fer jim girty a fine lot of borderhawks  somethin comin off whispered wetzel as zanes low growl grew unintelligible  jonathan felt rather than saw wetzel tremble  the missionaries are consultin ah there comes one which i guess its edwards by gum whos that injun stalkin over from the hostile bunch big chief whoever he is blest if it aint half king  the watchers saw the chief wave his arm and speak with evident arrogance to edwards who however advanced to the platform and raised his hand to address the christians  crack  a shot rang out from the thicket clutching wildly at his breast the missionary reeled back staggered and fell  one of those skulkin redskins has killed edwards said zane but no hes not dead hes gettin up mebbe he aint hurt bad by gum theres young comin forward of all the fools  it was indeed true that young had faced the indians half king addressed him as he had the other but young raised his hand and began speaking  crack  another shot rang out young threw up his hands and fell heavily the missionaries rushed toward him mr wells ran round the group wringing his hands as if distracted  hes hard hit hissed zane between his teeth you can tell that by the way he fell  wetzel did not answer he lay silent and motionless his long body rigid and his face like marble  there comes the other young fellarjoes brother hell get plugged too continued zane whispering rather to himself than to his companion oh i hoped theyd show some sense its noble for them to die for christianity but it wont do no good by gum heckewelder has pulled him back now thats good judgment  half king stepped before the christians and addressed them he held in his hand a black warclub which he wielded as he spoke  jonathans attention was now directed from the maple grove to the hunter beside him he had heard a slight metallic click as wetzel cocked his rifle then he saw the black barrel slowly rise  listen lew mebbe it aint good sense were after girty you remember and its a long shot from herefull three hundred yards  youre right jack youre right answered wetzel breathing hard  lets wait and see what comes off  jack i cant do it itll make our job harder but i cant help it i can put a bullet just over the hurons left eye an im goin to do it  you cant do it lew you cant its too far for any gun wait wait whispered jonathan laying his hand on wetzels shoulder  wait man cant you see what the unnamable villain is doin  what asked zane turning his eyes again to the glade  the converted indians sat with bowed heads half king raised his warclub and threw it on the ground in front of them  hes announcin the death decree hissed wetzel  well if he aint  jonathan looked at wetzels face then he rose to his knees as had wetzel and tightened his belt he knew that in another instant they would be speeding away through the forest  lew my rifles no good fer that distance but mebbe yours is you ought to know its not sense because theres simon girty and theres jim the men were after if you can hit one you can another but go ahead lew plug that cowardly redskin  wetzel knelt on one knee and thrust the black rifle forward through the fern leaves slowly the fatal barrel rose to a level and became as motionless as the immovable stones  jonathan fixed his keen gaze on the haughty countenance of half king as he stood with folded arms and scornful mien in front of the christians he had just condemned  even as the short stinging crack of wetzels rifle broke the silence jonathan saw the fierce expression of half kings dark face change to one of vacant wildness his arms never relaxed from their folded position he fell as falls a monarch of the forest trees a dead weight    chapter xxv  please do not preach today said nell raising her eyes imploringly to jims face  nellie i must conduct the services as usual i can not shirk my duty nor let these renegades see i fear to face them  i have such a queer feeling i am afraid i dont want to be left alone please do not leave me  jim strode nervously up and down the length of the room nells worn face her beseeching eyes and trembling hands touched his heart rather than almost anything else he desired to please her to strengthen her yet how could he shirk his duty  nellie what is it you fear he asked holding her hands tightly  oh i dont know whateverything uncle is growing weaker every day look at mr young he is only a shadow of his former self and this anxiety is wearing mr heckewelder out he is more concerned than he dares admit you neednt shake your head for i know it then those indians who are waiting waitingfor god only knows what worse than all to me i saw that renegade that fearful beast who made way with poor dear kate  nell burst into tears and leaned sobbing on jims shoulder  nell ive kept my courage only because of you replied jim his voice trembling slightly  she looked up quickly something in the pale face which was bent over her told that now if ever was the time for a woman to forget herself and to cheer to inspire those around her  i am a silly baby and selfish she cried freeing herself from his hold always thinking of myself she turned away and wiped the tears from her eyes go jim do you duty ill stand by and help you all a woman can                                  the missionaries were consulting in heckewelders cabin zeisberger had returned that morning and his aggressive dominating spirit was just what they needed in an hour like this he raised the downcast spirits of the ministers  hold the service i should say we will he declared waving his hands what have we to be afraid of  i do not know answered heckewelder shaking his head doubtfully i do not know what to fear girty himself told me he bore us no ill will but i hardly believe him all this silence this ominous waiting perplexes bewilders me  gentlemen our duty at least is plain said jim impressively the faith of these christian indians in us is so absolute that they have no fear they believe in god and in us these threatening savages have failed signally to impress our christians if we do not hold the service they will think we fear girty and that might have a bad influence  i am in favor of postponing the preaching for a few days i tell you i am afraid of girtys indians not for myself but for these christians whom we love so well i am afraid heckewelders face bore testimony to his anxious dread  you are our leader we have but to obey said edwards yet i think we owe it to our converts to stick to our work until we are forced by violence to desist  ah what form will that violence take cried heckewelder his face white you cannot tell what these savages mean i fear i fear  listen heckewelder you must remember we had this to go through once before put in zeisberger earnestly in 78 girty came down on us like a wolf on the fold he had not so many indians at his beck and call as now but he harangued for days trying to scare us and our handful of christians he set his drunken fiends to frighten us and he failed we stuck it out and won hes trying the same game let us stand against him and hold our services as usual we should trust in god  never give up cried jim  gentlemen you are right you shame me even though i feel that i understand the situation and its dread possibilities better than any one of you whatever befalls well stick to our post i thank you for reviving the spirit in my cowardly heart we will hold the service today as usual and to make it more impressive each shall address the congregation in turn  and if need be we will give our lives for our christians said young raising his pale face                                  the deep mellow peals of the church bell awoke the slumbering echoes scarcely had its melody died away in the forest when a line of indians issued from the church and marched toward the maple grove men women youths maidens and children  glickhican the old delaware chief headed the line his step was firm his head erect his face calm in its noble austerity his followers likewise expressed in their countenances the steadfastness of their belief the maidens heads were bowed but with shyness not fear the children were happy their bright faces expressive of the joy they felt in the anticipation of listening to their beloved teachers  this procession passed between rows of painted savages standing immovable with folded arms and somber eyes  no sooner had the christians reached the maple grove when from all over the clearing appeared hostile indians who took positions near the knoll where the missionaries stood  heckewelders faithful little band awaited him on the platform the converted indians seated themselves as usual at the foot of the knoll the other savages crowded closely on both sides they carried their weapons and maintained the same silence that had so singularly marked their mood of the last twentyfour hours no human skill could have divined their intention this coldness might be only habitual reserve and it might be anything else  heckewelder approached at the same time that simon girty and his band of renegades appeared with the renegades were pipe and half king these two came slowly across the clearing passed through the opening in the crowd and stopped close to the platform  heckewelder went hurriedly up to his missionaries he seemed beside himself with excitement and spoke with difficulty  do not preach today i have been warned again he said in a low voice  do you forbid it inquired edwards  no no i have not that authority but i implore it wait wait until the indians are in a better mood  edwards left the group and stepping upon the platform faced the christians  at the same moment half king stalked majestically from before his party he carried no weapon save a black knotted warclub a surging forward of the crowd of savages behind him showed the intense interest which his action had aroused he walked forward until he stood half way between the platform and the converts he ran his evil glance slowly over the christians and then rested it upon edwards  half kings orders are to be obeyed let the paleface keep his mouth closed he cried in the indian tongue the imperious command came as a thunderbolt from a clear sky the missionaries behind edwards stood bewildered awaiting the outcome  but edwards without a moments hesitation calmly lifted his hand and spoke  beloved christians we meet today as we have met before as we hope to meet in  spang  the whistling of a bullet over the heads of the christians accompanied the loud report of a rifle all presently plainly heard the leaden missile strike edwards wheeled clutching his side breathed hard and then fell heavily without uttering a cry he had been shot by an indian concealed in the thicket  for a moment no one moved nor spoke the missionaries were stricken with horror the converts seemed turned to stone and the hostile throng waited silently as they had for hours  hes shot hes shot oh i feared this cried heckewelder running forward the missionaries followed him edwards was lying on his back with a bloody hand pressed to his side  dave dave how is it with you asked heckewelder in a voice low with fear  not bad its too far out to be bad but it knocked me over answered edwards weakly give mewater  they carried him from the platform and laid him on the grass under a tree  young pressed edwards hand he murmured something that sounded like a prayer and then walked straight upon the platform as he raised his face which was sublime with a white light  paleface back roared half king as he waved his warclub  you indian dog be silent  youngs clear voice rolled out on the quiet air so imperiously so powerful in its wonderful scorn and passion that the hostile savages were overcome by awe and the christians thrilled anew with reverential love  young spoke again in a voice which had lost its passion and was singularly sweet in its richness  beloved christians if it is gods will that we must die to prove our faith then as we have taught you how to live so we can show you how to die  spang  again a whistling sound came with the bellow of an overcharged rifle again the sickening thud of a bullet striking flesh  young fell backwards from the platform  the missionaries laid him beside edwards and then stood in shuddering silence a smile shone on youngs pale face a stream of dark blood welled from his breast his lips moved he whispered  i ask no moregods will  jim looked down once at his brother missionaries then with blanched face but resolute and stern he marched toward the platform  heckewelder ran after him and dragged him back  no no no my god would you be killed oh i tried to prevent this cried heckewelder wringing his hands  one long fierce exultant yell pealed throughout the grove it came from those silent breasts in which was pent up hatred it greeted this action which proclaimed victory over the missionaries  all eyes turned on half king with measured stride he paced to and fro before the christian indians  neither cowering nor shrinking marked their manner to a man to a child they rose with proud mien heads erect and eyes flashing this mighty chief with his bloodthirsty crew could burn the village of peace could annihilate the christians but he could never change their hope and trust in god  blinded fools cried half king the huron is wise he tells no lies many moons ago he told the christians they were sitting half way between two angry gods who stood with mouths open wide and looking ferociously at each other if they did not move back out of the road they would be ground to powder by the teeth of one or the other or both half king urged them to leave the peaceful village to forget the paleface god to take their horses and flocks and return to their homes the christians scorned the huron kings counsel the sun has set for the village of peace the time has come pipe and the huron are powerful they will not listen to the paleface god they will burn the village of peace death to the christians  half king threw the black warclub with a passionate energy on the grass before the indians  they heard this decree of death with unflinching front even the children were quiet not a face paled not an eye was lowered  half king cast their doom in their teeth the christians eyed him with unspoken scorn  my god my god it is worse than i thought moaned heckewelder utter ruin murder murder  in the momentary silence which followed his outburst a tiny cloud of bluewhite smoke came from the ferns overhanging a cliff  crack  all heard the shot of a rifle all noticed the difference between its clear ringing intonation and the loud reports of the other two all distinctly heard the zip of a bullet as it whistled over their heads  all no not all one did not hear that speeding bullet he who was the central figure in this tragic scene he who had doomed the christians might have seen that tiny puff of smoke which heralded his own doom but before the ringing report could reach his ears a small blue hole appeared as if by magic over his left eye and pulse and sense and life had fled forever  half king great cruel chieftain stood still for an instant as if he had been an image of stone his haughty head lost its erect poise the fierceness seemed to fade from his dark face his proud plume waved gracefully as he swayed to and fro and then fell before the christians inert and lifeless  no one moved it was as if no one breathed the superstitious savages awaited fearfully another rifle shot another lightning stroke another visitation from the palefaces god  but jim girty with a cunning born of his terrible fear had recognized the ring of that rifle he had felt the zip of a bullet which could just as readily have found his brain as half kings he had stood there as fair a mark as the cruel huron yet the avenger had not chosen him was he reserved for a different fate was not such a death too merciful for the frontier deathshead he yelled in his craven fear  le vent de la mort  the well known dreaded appellation aroused the savages from a fearful stupor into a fierce manifestation of hatred a tremendous yell rent the air instantly the scene changed    chapter xxvi  in the confusion the missionaries carried young and edwards into mr wells cabin nells calm white face showed that she had expected some such catastrophe as this but she of all was the least excited heckewelder left them at the cabin and hurried away to consult captain williamson while zeisberger who was skilled in surgery attended to the wounded men jim barred the heavy door shut the rude swinging windows and made the cabin temporarily a refuge from prowling savages  outside the clamor increased shrill yells rent the air long rolling warcries sounded above all the din the measured stamp of moccasined feet the rush of indians past the cabin the dull thud of hatchets struck hard into the treesall attested to the excitement of the savages and the imminence of terrible danger  in the front room of mr wells cabin edwards lay on a bed his face turned to the wall and his side exposed there was a bloody hole in his white skin zeisberger was probing for the bullet he had no instruments save those of his own manufacture and they were darning needles with bent points and a long knifeblade ground thin  there i have it said zeisberger hold still dave there as edwards moaned zeisberger drew forth the bloody bullet jim wash and dress this wound it isnt bad dave will be all right in a couple of days now ill look at george  zeisberger hurried into the other room young lay with quiet face and closed eyes breathing faintly zeisberger opened the wounded mans shirt and exposed the wound which was on the right side rather high up nell who had followed zeisberger that she might be of some assistance if needed saw him look at the wound and then turn a pale face away for a second that hurried shuddering movement of the sober practical missionary was most significant then he bent over young and inserted on of the probes into the wound he pushed the steel an inch two three four inches into youngs breast but the latter neither moved nor moaned zeisberger shook his head and finally removed the instrument he raised the sufferers shoulder to find the bed saturated with blood the bullet wound extended completely through the missionarys body and was bleeding from the back zeisberger folded strips of linsey cloth into small pads and bound them tightly over both apertures of the wound  how is he asked jim when the amateur surgeon returned to the other room and proceeded to wash the blood from his hands  zeisberger shook his head gloomily  how is george whispered edwards who had heard jims question  shot through the right lung human skill can not aid him only god can save  didnt i hear a third shot whispered dave gazing round with sad questioning eyes heckewelder  is safe he has gone to see williamson you did hear a third shot half king fell dead with a bullet over his left eye he had just folded his arms in a grand pose after his death decree to the christians  a judgment of god  it does seem so but it came in the form of leaden death from wetzels unerring rifle do you hear all that yelling half kings death has set the indians wild  there was a gentle knock at the door and then the word open in heckewelders voice  jim unbarred the door heckewelder came in carrying over his shoulder what apparently was a sack of meal he was accompanied by young christy heckewelder put the bag down opened it and lifted out a little indian boy the child gazed round with fearful eyes  save benny save benny he cried running to nell and she clasped him closely in her arms  heckewelders face was like marble as he asked concerning edwards condition  im not badly off said the missionary with a smile  hows george whispered heckewelder  no one answered him zeisberger raised his hands all followed heckewelder into the other room where young lay in the same position as when first brought in heckewelder stood gazing down into the wan face with its terribly significant smile  i brought him out here i persuaded him to come whispered heckewelder oh almighty god he cried his voice broke and his prayer ended with the mute eloquence of clasped hands and uplifted appealing face  come out said zeisberger leading him into the larger room the others followed and jim closed the door  whats to be done said zeisberger with his practical common sense what did williamson say tell us what you learned  waitdirectly answered heckewelder sitting down and covering his face with his hands there was a long silence at length he raised his white face and spoke calmly  gentlemen the village of peace is doomed i entreated captain williamson to help us but he refused said he dared not interfere i prayed that he would speak at least a word to girty but he denied my request  where are the converts  imprisoned in the church every one of them except benny mr christy and i hid the child in the meal sack and were thus able to get him here we must save him  save him asked nell looking from heckewelder to the trembling indian boy  nellie the savages have driven all our christians into the church and shut them up there until girty and his men shall give the word to complete their fiendish design the converts asked but one favoran hour in which to pray it was granted the savages intend to murder them all  oh horrible monstrous cried nell how can they be so inhuman she lifted benny up in her arms theyll never get you my boy well save youill save you the child moaned and clung to her neck  they are scouring the clearing now for christians and will search all the cabins im positive  will they come here asked nell turning her blazing eyes on heckewelder  undoubtedly we must try to hide benny let me think where would be a good place well try a dark corner of the loft  no no cried nell  put benny in youngs bed suggested jim  no no cried nell  put him in a bucket and let him down in the well whispered edwards who had listened intently to the conversation  thats a capital place said heckewelder but might he not fall out and drown  tie him in the bucket said jim  no no no cried nell  but nellie we must decide upon a hiding place and in a hurry  ill save benny  you will you stay here to face those men jim girty and deering are searching the cabins could you bear it to see them you couldnt  oh no i believe it would kill me that man that beast will he come here nell grew ghastly pale and looked as if about to faint she shrunk in horror at the thought of again facing girty for gods sake heckewelder dont let him see me dont let him come in dont  even as the imploring voice ceased a heavy thump sounded on the door  whos there demanded heckewelder  thump thump  the heavy blows shook the cabin the pans rattled on the shelves no answer came from without  quick hide benny its as much as our lives are worth to have him found here cried heckewelder in a fierce whisper as he darted toward the door  all right all right in a moment he called out fumbling over the bar  he opened the door a moment later and when jim girty and deering entered he turned to his friends with a dread uncertainty in his haggard face  edwards lay on the bed with wideopen eyes staring at the intruders mr wells sat with bowed head zeisberger calmly whittled a stick and jim stood bolt upright with a hard light in his eyes  nell leaned against the side of a heavy table wonderful was the change that had transformed her from a timid appealing fearagonized girl to a woman whose only evidence of unusual excitement were the flame in her eyes and the peculiar whiteness of her face  benny was gone  heckewelders glance returned to the visitors he thought he had never seen such brutal hideous men  wal i reckon a preacher aint agoin to lie hev you seen any injun christians round here asked girty waving a heavy sledgehammer  girty we have hidden no indians here answered heckewelder calmly  wal well hev a look anyway answered the renegade  girty surveyed the room with wolfish eyes deering was so drunk that he staggered both men in fact reeked with the vile fumes of rum without another word they proceeded to examine the room by looking into every box behind a stone oven and in the cupboard they drew the bedclothes from the bed and with a kick demolished a pile of stove wood then the ruffians passed into the other apartments where they could be heard making thorough search at length both returned to the large room when girty directed deering to climb a ladder leading to the loft but because deering was too much under the influence of liquor to do so he had to go himself he rummaged around up there for a few minutes and then came down  wal i reckon you wasnt lyin about it said girty with his ghastly leer  he and his companion started to go out deering had stood with bloodshot eyes fixed on nell while girty searched the loft and as they passed the girl on their way to the open air the renegade looked at girty as he motioned with his head toward her his besotted face expressed some terrible meaning  girty had looked at nell when he first entered but had not glanced twice at her as he turned now before going out of the door he fixed on her his baleful glance his aspect was more full of meaning than could have been any words a horrible power of which he was boastfully conscious shone from his little pointed eyes his mere presence was deadly plainly as if he had spoken was the significance of his long gaze any one could have translated that look  once before nell had faced it and fainted when its dread meaning grew clear to her but now she returned his gaze with one in which flashed lightning scorn and repulsion in which glowed a wonderful defiance  the cruel face of this man the boastful barbarity of his manner the long dark bloody history which his presence recalled was indeed terrifying without the added horror of his intent toward her but now the selfforgetfulness of a true woman sustained her  girty and deering backed out of the door heckewelder closed it and dropped the bar in place  nell fell over the table with a long low gasp then with one hand she lifted her skirt benny walked from under it his big eyes were bright the young woman clasped him again in her arms then she released him and laboring under intense excitement ran to the window  there he goes oh the horrible beast if i only had a gun and could shoot oh if only i were a man id kill him to think of poor kate ah he intends the same for me  suddenly she fell upon the floor in a faint mr wells and jim lifted her on the bed beside edwards where they endeavored to revive her it was some moments before she opened her eyes  jim sat holding nells hand mr wells again bowed his head zeisberger continued to whittle a stick and heckewelder paced the floor christy stood by with every evidence of sympathy for this distracted group outside the clamor increased  just listen cried heckewelder did you ever hear the like all drunk crazy fiendish they drank every drop of liquor the french traders had curses on the vagabond dealers rum has made these renegades and savages wild oh my poor innocent christians  heckewelder leaned his head against the mantleshelf he had broken down at last racking sobs shook his frame  are you all right again asked jim of nell  yes  i am going out first to see williamson and then the christians he said rising very pale but calm  dont go cried heckewelder i have tried everything it was all of no use  i will go answered jim  yes jim go whispered nell looking up into his eyes it was an earnest gaze in which a faint hope shone  jim unbarred the door and went out  wait ill go along cried zeisberger suddenly dropping his knife and stick  as the two men went out a fearful spectacle met their eyes the clearing was alive with indians but such indians they were painted demons maddened by rum yesterday they had been silent if they moved at all it had been with deliberation and dignity today they were a yelling running bloodseeking mob  awful did you ever see human beings like these asked zeisberger  no no  i saw such a frenzy once before but of course only in a small band of savages many times have i seen indians preparing for the warpath in search of both white men and redskins they were fierce then but nothing like this every one of these frenzied fiends is honest think of that every man feels it his duty to murder these christians girty has led up to this by cunning and now the time is come to let them loose  it means death for all  i have given up any thought of escaping said zeisberger with the calmness that had characterized his manner since he returned to the village i shall try to get into the church  ill join you there as soon as i see williamson  jim walked rapidly across the clearing to the cabin where captain williamson had quarters the frontiersmen stood in groups watching the savages with an interest which showed little or no concern  i want to see captain williamson said jim to a frontiersman on guard at the cabin door  wal hes inside drawled the man  jim thought the voice familiar and he turned sharply to see the sunburnt features of jeff lynn the old riverman who had taken mr wells party to fort henry  why lynn im glad to see you exclaimed jim  purty fair to middlin answered jeff extending his big hand say hows the other one your brother as wus called joe  i dont know he ran off with wetzel was captured by indians and when i last heard of him he had married wingenunds daughter  wal ill be doggoned jeff shook his grizzled head and slapped his leg i jest knowed hed raise somethin  im in a hurry do you think captain williamson will stand still and let all this go on  im afeerd so  evidently the captain heard the conversation for he appeared at the cabin door smoking a long pipe  captain williamson i have come to entreat you to save the christians from this impending massacre  i cant do nuthin answered williamson removing his pipe to puff forth a great cloud of smoke  you have eighty men here  if we interfered pipe would eat us alive in three minutes you preacher fellows dont understand this thing youve got pipe and girty to deal with if you dont know them youll be better acquainted by sundown  i dont care who they are drunken ruffians and savages thats enough will you help us we are men of your own race and we come to you for help can you withhold it  i wont hev nuthin to do with this bizness the chiefs hev condemned the village an itll hev to go if you fellars hed been careful no white blood would hev been spilled i advise you all to lay low till its over  will you let me speak to your men to try and get them to follow me  heckewelder asked that same thing he was persistent and i took a vote fer him just to show how my men stood eighteen of them said theyd follow him the rest wouldnt interfere  eighteen my god cried jim voicing the passion which consumed him you are white men yet you will stand by and see these innocent people murdered man wheres your humanity your manhood these converted indians are savages no longer they are christians their children are as good pure innocent as your own can you remain idle and see these little ones murdered  williamson made no answer the men who had crowded round were equally silent not one lowered his head many looked at the impassioned missionary others gazed at the savages who were circling around the trees brandishing their weapons if any pitied the unfortunate christians none showed it they were indifferent with the indifference of men hardened to cruel scenes  jim understood at last as he turned from face to face to find everywhere that same imperturbability these bordermen were like wetzel and jonathan zane the only good indian was a dead indian years of war and bloodshed of merciless cruelty at the hands of redmen of the hard border life had rendered these frontiersmen incapable of compassion for any savage  jim no longer restrained himself  bordermen you may be but from my standpoint from any mans from gods you are a lot of coldly indifferent cowards exclaimed jim with white quivering lips i understand now few of you will risk anything for indians you will not believe a savage can be a christian you dont care if they are all murdered any man among youany man i saywould step out before those howling fiends and boldly demand that there be no bloodshed a courageous leader with a band of determined followers could avert this tragedy you might readily intimidate yonder horde of drunken demons captain williamson i am only a minister far removed from a man of war and leader as you claim to be but sir i curse you as a miserable coward if i ever get back to civilization ill brand this inhuman coldness of yours as the most infamous and dastardly cowardice that ever disgraced a white man you are worse than girty  williamson turned a sickly yellow he fumbled a second with the handle of his tomahawk but made no answer the other bordermen maintained the same careless composure what to them was the raving of a mad preacher  jim saw it and turned baffled fiercely angry and hopeless as he walked away jeff lynn took his arm and after they were clear of the crowd of frontiersmen he said  young feller you give him pepper an no mistake an mebbe youre right from your side the fence but you cant see the injuns from our side we hunters hevnt much humanityi reckon thats what you called itbut weve lost so many friends an relatives an hearn of so many murders by the reddys that we look on all of em as wild varmints that should be killed on sight now mebbe itll interest you to know i was the feller who took the vote williamson told you about an i did it cause i had an interest in you i wus watchin you when edwards and the other missionary got shot i like grit in a man an i seen you had it clear through so when heckewelder comes over i talked to the fellers an all i could git interested was eighteen but they wanted to fight simply fer fightin sake now ole jeff lynn is your friend you just lay low until this is over  jim thanked the old riverman and left him he hardly knew which way to turn he would make one more effort he crossed the clearing to where the renegades teepee stood mckee and elliott were sitting on a log simon girty stood beside them his hard keen roving eyes on the scene the missionary was impressed by the white leader there was a difference in his aspect a wilder look than the others wore as if the man had suddenly awakened to the fury of his indians nevertheless the young man went straight toward him  girty i come  git out you meddlin preacher yelled the renegade shaking his fist at jim  simon girty was drunk  jim turned from the white fiends he knew his life to them was not worth a pinch of powder  lost lost all lost he exclaimed in despair  as he went toward the church he saw hundreds of savages bounding over the grass brandishing weapons and whooping fiendishly they were concentrating around girtys teepee where already a great throng had congregated of all the indians to be seen not one walked they leaped by jim and ran over the grass nimble as deer  he saw the eager fire in their dusky eyes and the cruelly clenched teeth like those of wolves when they snarl he felt the hissing breath of many savages as they raced by him more than one whirled a tomahawk close to jims head and uttered horrible yells in his ear they were like tigers lusting for blood  jim hurried to the church not an indian was visible near the log structure even the savage guards had gone he entered the open door to be instantly struck with reverence and awe  the christians were singing  miserable and full of sickening dread though jim was he could not but realize that the scene before him was one of extraordinary beauty and pathos the doomed indians lifted up their voices in song never had they sung so feelingly so harmoniously  when the song ended zeisberger who stood upon a platform opened his bible and read  in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy redeemer  in a voice low and tremulous the venerable missionary began his sermon  the shadow of death hovered over these christian martyrs it was reflected in their somber eyes yet not one was sullen or sad the children who were too young to understand but instinctively feeling the tragedy soon to be enacted there cowered close to their mothers  zeisberger preached a touching and impressive though short sermon at its conclusion the whole congregation rose and surrounded the missionary the men shook his hands the women kissed them the children clung to his legs it was a wonderful manifestation of affection  suddenly glickhican the old delaware chief stepped on the platform raised his hand and shouted one indian word  a long low wail went up from the children and youths the women slowly meekly bowed their heads the men due to the stoicism of their nature and the christianity they had learned stood proudly erect awaiting the death that had been decreed  glickhican pulled the bell rope  a deep mellow tone pealed out  the sound transfixed all the christians no one moved  glickhican had given the signal which told the murderers the christians were ready  come man my god we cant stay here cried jim to zeisberger  as they went out both men turned to look their last on the martyrs the death knell which had rung in the ears of the christians was to them the voice of god stern dark visages of men and the sweet submissive faces of women were uplifted with rapt attention a light seemed to shine from these faces as if the contemplation of god had illumined them  as zeisberger and jim left the church and hurried toward the cabins they saw the crowd of savages in a black mass round girtys teepee the yelling and leaping had ceased  heckewelder opened the door evidently he had watched for them  jim jim cried nell when he entered the cabin ohh i was afraid oh i am glad youre back safe see this noble indian has come to help us  wingenund stood calm and erect by the door  chief what will you do  wingenund will show you the way to the big river answered the chieftain in his deep bass  run away no never that would be cowardly heckewelder you would not go nor you zeisberger we may yet be of use we may yet save some of the christians  save the yellowhair sternly said wingenund  oh jim you dont understand the chief has come to warn me of girty he intends to take me as he has others as he did poor kate did you not see the meaning in his eyes today how they scorched me ho jim take me away save me do not leave me here to that horrible fate oh jim take me away  nell i will take you cried jim grasping her hands  hurry theres a blanket full of things i packed for you said heckewelder lose no time ah hear that my heavens what a yell heckewelder rushed to the door and looked out there they go a black mob of imps a pack of hungry wolves jim girty is in the lead how he leaps how he waves his sledge he leads the savages toward the church oh its the end  benny wheres benny cried jim hurriedly lacing the hunting coat he had flung about him  bennys safe ive hidden him ill get him away from here answered young christy go nows your time godspeed you  im ready declared mr wells ihavefinished  there goes wingenund hes running follow him quick goodby goodby god be with you cried heckewelder  goodby goodby  jim hurried nell toward the bushes where wingenunds tall form could dimly be seen mr wells followed them on the edge of the clearing jim and nell turned to look back  they saw a black mass of yelling struggling fighting savages crowding around the church  oh jim look back look back cried nell holding hard to his hand look back see if girty is coming    chapter xxvii  at last the fugitives breathed free under the gold and red cover of the woods never speaking never looking back the guide hurried eastward with long strides his followers were almost forced to run in order to keep him in sight he had waited at the edge of the clearing for them and relieving jim of the heavy pack which he swung slightly over his shoulder he set a pace that was most difficult to maintain the young missionary half led half carried nell over the stones and rough places mr wells labored in the rear  oh jim look back look back see if we are pursued cried nell frequently with many a earful glance into the dense thickets  the indian took a straight course through the woods he leaped the brooks climbed the rough ridges and swiftly trod the glades that were free of windfalls his hurry and utter disregard for the plain trail left behind proved his belief in the necessity of placing many miles between the fugitives and the village of peace evidently they would be followed and it would be a waste of valuable time to try to conceal their trail gradually the ground began to rise the way become more difficult but wingenund never slackened his pace nell was strong supple and light of foot she held her own with jim but time and time again they were obliged to wait for her uncle once he was far behind wingenund halted for them at the height of a ridge where the forest was open  ugh exclaimed the chieftain as they finished the ascent he stretched a long arm toward the sun his falcon eye gleamed  far in the west a great black and yellow cloud of smoke rolled heavenward it seemed to rise from out the forest and to hang low over the trees then it soared aloft and grew thinner until it lost its distinct line far in the clouds the setting sun stood yet an hour high over a distant hill and burned dark red through the great pall of smoke  is it a forest fire asked nell fearfully  fire of course but jim did not voice his fear he looked closely at wingenund  the chieftain stood silent a moment as was his wont when addressed the dull glow of the sun was reflected in the dark eyes that gazed far away over forest and field  fire said wingenund and it seemed that as he spoke a sterner shadow flitted across his bronzed face the sun sets tonight over the ashes of the village of peace  he resumed his rapid march eastward with never a backward glance the saddened party followed nell kept close beside jim and the old man tramped after them with bowed head the sun set but wingenund never slackened his stride twilight deepened yet he kept on  indian we can go no further tonight we must rest cried jim as nell stumbled against him and mr wells panted wearily in the rear  rest soon replied the chief and kept on  darkness had settled down when wingenund at last halted the fugitives could see little in the gloom but they heard the music of running water and felt soft moss beneath their feet  they sank wearily down upon a projecting stone the moss was restful to their tired limbs opening the pack they found food with which to satisfy the demands of hunger then close under the stone the fugitives sank into slumber while the watchful indian stood silent and motionless  jim thought he had but just closed his eyes when he felt a gentle pressure on his arm  day is here said the indian  jim opened his eyes to see the bright red sun crimsoning the eastern hills and streaming gloriously over the colored forests he raised himself on his elbow to look around nell was still asleep the blanket was tucked close to her chin her chestnut hair was tumbled like a schoolgirls she looked as fresh and sweet as the morning  nell nell wake up said jim thinking the while how he would love to kiss those white eyelids  nells eyes opened wide a smile lay deep in their hazel shadows  where a i oh i remember she cried sitting up oh jim i had such a sweet dream i was at home with mother and kate oh to wake and find it all a dream i am fleeing for life but jim we are safe are we not  another day and well be safe  let us fly she cried leaping up and shaking out her crumpled skirt uncle come  mr wells lay quietly with his mild blue eyes smiling up at her he neither moved nor spoke  eat drink said the chief opening the pack  what a beautiful place exclaimed nell taking the bread and meat handed to her this is a lovely little glade look at those golden flowers the red and purple leaves the brown shining moss and those lichencovered stones why some one has camped here see the little cave the screens of plaited ferns and the stone fireplace  it seems to me this dark spring and those gracefully spreading branches are familiar said jim  beautiful spring interposed wingenund  yes i know this place cried nell excitedly i remember this glade though it was moonlight when i saw it here wetzel rescued me from girty  nell youre right replied jim how strange we should run across this place again  strange fate indeed which had brought them again to beautiful spring it was destined that the great scenes of their lives were to be enacted in this mossy glade  come uncle you are lazy cried nell a touch of her old roguishness making playful her voice  mr wells lay still and smiled up at them  you are not ill cried nell seeing for the first time how pallid was his face  dear nellie i am not ill i do not suffer but i am dying he answered again with that strange sweet smile  ohhh breathed nell falling on her knees  no no mr wells you are only weak you will be all right again soon cried jim  jim nellie i have known all night i have lain here wakeful my heart never was strong it gave out yesterday and now it is slowly growing weaker put your hand on my breast feel ah you see my life is flickering gods will be done i am content my work is finished my only regret is that i brought you out to this terrible borderland but i did not know if only i could see you safe from the peril of this wilderness at home happy married  nell bent over him blinded by her tears unable to see or speak crushed by this last overwhelming blow jim sat on the other side of the old missionary holding his hand for many moments neither spoke they glanced at the pale face watching with eager wistful eyes for a smile or listening for a word  come said the indian  nell silently pointed toward her uncle  he is dying whispered jim to the indian  go leave me murmured mr wells you are still in danger  well not leave you cried jim  no no no sobbed nell bending over to kiss him  nellie may i marry you to jim whispered mr wells into her ear he has told me how it is with him he loves you nellie id die happier knowing id left you with him  even at that moment with her heart almost breaking nells fair face flushed  nell will you marry me asked jim softly low though it was he had heard mr wells whisper  nell stretched a little trembling hand over her uncle to jim who inclosed it in his own her eyes met his through her tears shone faintly a light which but for the agony that made it dim would have beamed radiant  find the place said mr wells handing jim a bible it was the one he always carried in his pocket  with trembling hand jim turned the leaves at last he found the lines and handed the book back to the old man  simple sweet and sad was that marriage service nell and jim knelt with hands clasped over mr wells the old missionarys voice was faint nells responses were low and jim answered with deep and tender feeling beside them stood wingenund a dark magnificent figure  there may god bless you murmured mr wells with a happy smile closing the bible  nell my wife whispered jim kissing her hand  come broke in wingenunds voice deep strong like that of a bell  not one of them had observed the chief as he stood erect motionless poised like a stag scenting the air his dark eyes seemed to pierce the purplegolden forest his keen ear seemed to drink in the singing of the birds and the gentle rustling of leaves native to these haunts as were the wild creatures they were no quicker than the indian to feel the approach of foes the breeze had borne faint suspicious sounds  keepthebible said mr wells rememberitsword his hand closely clasped nells and then suddenly loosened his pallid face was lighted by a meaning tender smile which slowly fadedfaded and was gone the venerable head fell back the old missionary was dead  nell kissed the pale cold brow and then rose half dazed and shuddering jim was vainly trying to close the dead mans eyes she could no longer look on rising she found herself near the indian chief he took her fingers in his great hand and held them with a strong warm pressure strangely thrilled she looked up at wingenund his somber eyes fixed piercingly on the forest and his dark stern face were as always inscrutable no compassion shone there no emotion unbefitting a chieftain would ever find expression in that cold face but nell felt a certain tenderness in this indian a response in his great heart felt it so surely so powerfully that she leaned her head against him she knew he was her friend  come said the chief once more he gently put nell aside before jim arose from his sad task  we can not leave him unburied expostulated jim  wingenund dragged aside a large stone which formed one wall of the cavern then he grasped a log which was half covered by dirt and exerting his great strength pulled it from its place there was a crash a rumble the jar of a heavy weight striking the earth then the rattling of gravel and before nell and jim realized what had happened the great rock forming the roof of the cavern slipped down the bank followed by a small avalanche the cavern was completely covered mr wells was buried a mossy stone marked the old missionarys grave  nell and jim were lost in wonder and awe  ugh cried the chief looking toward the opening in the glade  fearfully nell and jim turned to be appalled by four naked painted savages standing with leveled rifles behind them stood deering and jim girty  oh god we are lost lost lost exclaimed jim unable to command himself hope died in his heart  no cry issued from nells white lips she was dazed by this final blow having endured so much this last misfortune apparently the ruin of her life brought no added suffering only a strange numb feeling  ahhuh thought youd give me the slip eh croaked girty striding forward and as he looked at wingenund his little yellow eyes flared like flint does a wolf befriend girtys captives chief you hev led me a hard chase  wingenund deigned no reply he stood as he did so often still and silent with folded arms and a look that was haughty unresponsive  the indians came forward into the glade and one of them quickly bound jims hands behind his back the savages wore a wild brutish look a feverish ferocity very near akin to insanity possessed them they were not quiet a moment but ran here and there for no apparent reason except possibly to keep in action with the raging fire in their hearts the cleanliness which characterized the normal indian was absent in them their scant buckskin dress was bedraggled and stained they were still drunk with rum and the lust for blood murder gleamed from the glance of their eyes  jake come over here said girty to his renegade friend aint she a prize  girty and deering stood before the poor stricken girl and gloated over her fair beauty she stood as when first transfixed by the horror from which she had been fleeing her pale face was lowered her hands clenched tightly in the folds of her skirt  never before had two such coarse cruel fiends as deering and girty encumbered the earth even on the border where the best men were bad they were the worst deering was yet drunk but girty had recovered somewhat from the effects of the rum he had absorbed the former rolled his big eyes and nodded his shaggy head he was passing judgment from his point of view on the fine points of the girl  she ceraintly is he declared with a grin shes a little beauty beats any i ever seen  jim girty stroked his sharp chin with dirty fingers his yellow eyes his burnt saffron skin his hooked nose his thin lipsall his evil face seemed to shine with an evil triumph to look at him was painful to have him gaze at her was enough to drive any woman mad  dark stains spotted the bright frills of his gaudy dress his buckskin coat and leggins and dotted his white eagle plumes dark stains horribly suggestive covered him from head to foot blood stains the innocent blood of christians crimsoned his renegades body and every dark red blotch cried murder  girl i burned the village of peace to git you growled girty come here  with a rude grasp that tore open her dress exposing her beautiful white shoulder and bosom the ruffian pulled her toward him his face was transfixed with a fierce joy a brutal passion  deering looked on with a drunken grin while his renegade friend hugged the almost dying girl the indians paced the glade with short strides like leashed tigers the young missionary lay on the moss with closed eyes he could not endure the sight of nell in girtys arms  no one noticed wingenund he stood back a little half screened by drooping branches once again the chiefs dark eyes gleamed his head turned a trifle aside and standing in the statuesque position habitual with him when resting he listened as one who hears mysterious sounds suddenly his keen glance was riveted on the ferns above the low cliff he had seen their graceful heads quivering then two blinding sheets of flame burst from the ferns  spang spang  the two rifle reports thundered through the glade two indians staggered and fell in their tracksdead without a cry  a huge yellow body spread out like a panther in his spring descended with a crash upon deering and girty the girl fell away from the renegade as he went down with a shrill screech dragging deering with him instantly began a terrific whirling wrestling struggle  a few feet farther down the cliff another yellow body came crashing down to alight with a thud to bound erect to rush forward swift as a leaping deer the two remaining indians had only time to draw their weapons before this lithe threatening form whirled upon them shrill cries hoarse yells the clash of steel and dull blows mingled together one savage went down twisted over writhed and lay still the other staggered warded off lightninglike blows until one passed under his guard and crashed dully on his head then he reeled rose again but only to have his skull cloven by a bloody tomahawk  the victor darted toward the whirling mass  lew shake him loose let him go yelled jonathan zane swinging his bloody weapon  high above zanes cry deerings shouts and curses girtys shrieks of fear and fury above the noise of wrestling bodies and dull blows rose a deep booming roar  it was wetzels awful cry of vengeance  shake him loose yelled jonathan  baffled he ran wildly around the wrestlers time and time again his gory tomahawk was raised only to be lowered he found no opportunity to strike girtys ghastly countenance gleamed at him from the whirl of legs and arms and bodies then wetzels dark face lighted by merciless eyes took its place and that gave way to deerings broad features the men being clad alike in buckskin and their motions so rapid prevented zane from lending a helping hand  suddenly deering was propelled from the mass as if by a catapult his body straightened as it came down with a heavy thud zane pounced upon it with catlike quickness once more he swung aloft the bloody hatchet then once more he lowered it for there was no need to strike the renegades side was torn open from shoulder to hip a deluge of blood poured out upon the moss deering choked a bloody froth formed on his lips his fingers clutched at nothing his eyes rolled violently and then were fixed in an awful stare  the girl lying so quiet in the woods near the old hut was avenged  jonathan turned again to wetzel and girty not with any intention to aid the hunter but simply to witness the end of the struggle  without the help of the powerful deering how pitifully weak was the deathshead of the frontier in the hands of the avenger  jim girtys tomahawk was thrown in one direction and his knife in another he struggled vainly in the iron grip that held him  wetzel rose to his feet clutching the renegade with his left arm which had been bared in the fight he held girty by the front of his buckskin shirt and dragged him to that tree which stood alone in the glade he pushed him against it and held him there  the white dog leaped and snarled around the prisoner  girtys hands pulled and tore at the powerful arm which forced him hard against the beech it was a brown arm and huge with its bulging knotted rigid muscles a mighty arm strong as the justice which ruled it  girty thy race is run wetzels voice cut the silence like a steel whip  the terrible ruthless smile the glittering eyes of doom seemed literally to petrify the renegade  the hunters right arm rose slowly the knife in his hand quivered as if with eagerness the long blade dripping with deerings blood pointed toward the hilltop  look thar see em thars yer friends cried wetzel  on the dead branches of trees standing far above the hilltop were many great dark birds they sat motionless as if waiting  buzzards buzzards hissed wetzel  girtys ghastly face became an awful thing to look upon no living countenance ever before expressed such fear such horror such agony he foamed at the mouth he struggled he writhed with a terrible fascination he watched that quivering dripping blade now poised high  wetzels arm swung with the speed of a shooting star he drove the blade into girtys groin through flesh and bone hard and fast into the tree he nailed the renegade to the beech there to await his lingering doom  ahh ahh ahh shrieked girty in cries of agony he fumbled and pulled at the haft of the knife but could not loosen it he beat his breast he tore his hair his screams were echoed from the hilltop as if in mockery  the white dog stood near his hair bristling his teeth snapping  the dark birds sat on the dead branches above the hilltop as if waiting for their feast    chapter xxviii  zane turned and cut the young missionarys bonds jim ran to where nell was lying on the ground and tenderly raised her head calling to her that they were saved zane bathed the girls pale face presently she sighed and opened her eyes  then zane looked from the statuelike form of wingenund to the motionless figure of wetzel the chief stood erect with his eyes on the distant hills wetzel remained with folded arms his cold eyes fixed upon the writhing moaning renegade  lew look here said zane unhesitatingly and pointed toward the chief  wetzel quivered as if sharply stung the cold glitter in his eyes changed to lurid fire with upraised tomahawk he bounded across the brook  lew wait a minute yelled zane  wetzel wait wait cried jim grasping the hunters arm but the latter flung him off as the wind tosses a straw  wetzel wait for gods sake wait screamed nell she had risen at zanes call and now saw the deadly resolve in the hunters eyes fearlessly she flung herself in front of him bravely she risked her life before his mad rush frantically she threw her arms around him and clung to his hands desperately  wetzel halted frenzied as he was at the sight of his foe he could not hurt a woman  girl let go he panted and his broad breast heaved  no no no listen wetzel you must not kill the chief he is a friend  he is my great foe  listen oh please listen pleaded nell he warned me to flee from girty he offered to guide us to fort henry he has saved my life for my sake wetzel do not kill him dont let me be the cause of his murder wetzel wetzel lower your arm drop your hatchet for pitys sake do not spill more blood wingenund is a christian  wetzel stepped back breathing heavily his white face resembled chiseled marble with those little hands at his breast he hesitated in front of the chief he had hunted for so many long years  would you kill a christian pleaded nell her voice sweet and earnest  i reckon not but this injun aint one replied wetzel slowly  put away your hatchet let me have it listen and i will tell you after thanking you for this rescue do you know of my marriage come please listen forget for a moment your enmity oh you must be merciful brave men are always merciful  injun are you a christian hissed wetzel  oh i know he is i know he is cried nell still standing between wetzel and the chief  wingenund spoke no word he did not move his falcon eyes gazed tranquilly at his white foe christian or pagan he would not speak one word to save his life  oh tell him you are a christian cried nell running to the chief  yellowhair the delaware is true to his race  as he spoke gently to nell a noble dignity shone upon his dark face  injun my back bears the scars of your braves whips hissed wetzel once more advancing  deathwind your scars are deep but the delawares are deeper came the calm reply wingenunds heart bears two scars his son lies under the moss and ferns deathwind killed him deathwind alone knows his grave wingenunds daughter the delight of his waning years freed the delawares great foe and betrayed her father can the christian god tell wingenund of his child  wetzel shook like a tree in a storm justice cried out in the indians deep voice wetzel fought for mastery of himself  delaware your daughter lays there with her lover said wetzel firmly and pointed into the spring  ugh exclaimed the indian bending over the dark pool he looked long into its murky depths then he thrust his arm down into the brown water  deathwind tells no lie said the chief calmly and pointed toward girty the renegade had ceased struggling his head was bowed upon his breast the white serpent has stung the delaware  what does it mean cried jim  your brother joe and whispering winds lie in the spring answered jonathan zane girty murdered them and wetzel buried the two there  oh is it true cried nell  true lass whispered jim brokenly holding out his arms to her indeed he needed her strength as much as she needed his the girl gave one shuddering glance at the spring and then hid her face on her husbands shoulder  delaware we are sworn foes cried wetzel  wingenund asks no mercy  are you a christian  wingenund is true to his race  delaware begone take these weapons an go when your shadow falls shortest on the ground deathwind starts on your trail  deathwind is the great white chief he is the great indian foe he is as sure as the panther in his leap as swift as the wild goose in his northern flight wingenund never felt fear the chieftains sonorous reply rolled through the quiet glade if deathwind thirsts for wingenunds blood let him spill it now for when the delaware goes into the forest his trail will fade  begone roared wetzel the fever for blood was once more rising within him  the chief picked up some weapons of the dead indians and with haughty stride stalked from the glade  oh wetzel thank you i knew nells voice broke as she faced the hunter she recoiled from this changed man  come well go said jonathan zane ill guide you to fort henry he lifted the pack and led nell and jim out of the glade  they looked back once to picture forever in their minds the lovely spot with its ghastly quiet bodies the dark haunting spring the renegade nailed to the tree and the tall figure of wetzel as he watched his shadow on the ground                                  when wetzel also had gone only two living creatures remained in the gladethe doomed renegade and the white dog the gaunt beast watched the man with hungry mad eyes  a long moan wailed through the forest it swelled mournfully on the air and died away the doomed man heard it he raised his ghastly face his dulled senses seemed to revive he gazed at the stiffening bodies of the indians at the gory corpse of deering at the savage eyes of the dog  suddenly life seemed to surge strong within him  hells fire im not done fer yet he gasped this damned knife cant kill me ill pull it out  he worked at the heavy knife hilt awful curses passed his lips but the blade did not move retribution had spoken his doom  suddenly he saw a dark shadow moving along the sunlit ground it swept past him he looked up to see a great bird with wide wings sailing far above he saw another still higher and then a third he looked at the hilltop the quiet black birds had taken wing they were floating slowly majestically upward he watched their graceful flight how easily they swooped in wide circles he remembered that they had fascinated him when a boy long long ago when he had a home where was that home he had one once ah the long cruel years have rolled back a youth blotted out by evil returned he saw a little cottage he saw the old virginia homestead he saw his brothers and his mother  ahh a cruel agony tore his heart he leaned hard against the knife with the pain the present returned but the past remained all his youth all his manhood flashed before him the long bloody merciless years faced him and his crimes crushed upon him with awful might  suddenly a rushing sound startled him he saw a great bird swoop down and graze the tree tops another followed and another and then a flock of them he saw their gray spotted breasts and hooked beaks  buzzards he muttered darkly eyeing the dead savages the carrion birds were swooping to their feast  by god hes nailed me fast for buzzards he screamed in sudden awful frenzy nailed fast ahh ahh ahh eaten alive by buzzards ahh ahh ahh  he shrieked until his voice failed and then he gasped  again the buzzards swooped overhead this time brushing the leaves one a great grizzled bird settled upon a limb of the giant oak and stretched its long neck another alighted beside him others sailed round and round the dead tree top  the leader arched his wings and with a dive swooped into the glade he alighted near deerings dead body he was a dark uncanny bird with long scraggy bare neck a wreath of white grizzled feathers a cruel hooked beak and cold eyes  the carrion bird looked around the glade and put a great claw on the dead mans breast  ahh ahh shrieked girty his agonized yell of terror and horror echoed mockingly from the wooded bluff  the huge buzzard flapped his wings and flew away but soon returned to his gruesome feast his followers made bold by their leader floated down into the glade their black feathers shone in the sun they hopped over the moss they stretched their grizzled necks and turned their heads sideways  girty was sweating blood it trickled from his ghastly face all the suffering and horror he had caused in all his long career was as nothing to that which then rended him he the renegade the white indian the deathshead of the frontier panted and prayed for a merciful breath he was exquisitely alive he was human  presently the huge buzzard the leader raised his hoary head he saw the man nailed to the tree the bird bent his head wisely to one side and then lightly lifted himself into the air he sailed round the glade over the fighting buzzards over the spring and over the doomed renegade he flew out of the glade and in again he swooped close to girty his broad wings scarcely moved as he sailed along  girty tried to strike the buzzard as he sailed close by but his arm fell useless he tried to scream but his voice failed  slowly the buzzard king sailed by and returned every time he swooped a little nearer and bent his long scraggy neck  suddenly he swooped down light and swift as a hawk his wide wings fanned the air he poised under the tree and then fastened sharp talons in the doomed mans breast    chapter xxix  the fleeting human instinct of wetzel had given way to the habit of years his merciless quest for many days had been to kill the frontier fiend now that it had been accomplished he turned his vengeance into its accustomed channel and once more became the ruthless indianslayer  a fierce tingling joy surged through him as he struck the delawares trail wingenund had made little or no effort to conceal his tracks he had gone northwest straight as a crow flies toward the indian encampment he had a start of sixty minutes and it would require six hours of rapid traveling to gain the delaware town  reckon hell make fer home muttered wetzel following the trail with all possible speed  the hunters method of trailing an indian was singular intuition played as great a part as sight he seemed always to divine his victims intention once on the trail he was as hard to shake off as a bloodhound yet he did not by any means always stick to the indians footsteps with wetzel the direction was of the greatest importance  for half a mile he closely followed the delawares plainly marked trail then he stopped to take a quick survey of the forest before him he abruptly left the trail and breaking into a run went through the woods as fleetly and noiselessly as a deer running for a quarter of a mile when he stopped to listen all seemed well for he lowered his head and walked slowly along examining the moss and leaves presently he came upon a little open space where the soil was a sandy loam he bent over then rose quickly he had come upon the indians trail cautiously he moved forward stopping every moment to listen in all the close pursuits of his maturer years he had never been a victim of that most cunning of indian tricks an ambush he relied solely on his ear to learn if foes were close by the wild creatures of the forest were his informants as soon as he heard any change in their twittering humming or playingwhichever way they manifested their joy or fear of lifehe became as hard to see as difficult to hear as a creeping snake  the delawares trail led to a rocky ridge and there disappeared wetzel made no effort to find the chiefs footprints on the flinty ground but halted a moment and studied the ridge the lay of the land around a ravine on one side and a dark impenetrable forest on the other he was calculating his chances of finding the delawares trail far on the other side indian woodcraft subtle wonderful as it may be is limited to each indians ability savages as well as other men were born unequal one might leave a faint trail through the forest while another could be readily traced and a third more cunning and skillful than his fellows have flown under the shady trees for all the trail he left but redmen followed the same methods of woodcraft from tradition as wetzel had learned after long years of study and experience  and now satisfied that he had divined the delawares intention he slipped down the bank of the ravine and once more broke into a run he leaped lightly surefooted as a goat from stone to stone over fallen logs and the brawling brook at every turn of the ravine at every open place he stopped to listen  arriving on the other side of the ridge he left the ravine and passed along the edge of the rising ground he listened to the birds and searched the grass and leaves he found not the slightest indication of a trail where he had expected to find one he retraced his steps patiently carefully scrutinizing every inch of the ground but it was all in vain wingenund had begun to show his savage cunning in his warrior days for long years no chief could rival him his boast had always been that when wingenund sought to elude his pursuers his trail faded among the moss and the ferns  wetzel calm patient resourceful deliberated a moment the delaware had not crossed this rocky ridge he had been cunning enough to make his pursuer think such was his intention the hunter hurried to the eastern end of the ridge for no other reason than apparently that course was the one the savage had the least reason to take he advanced hurriedly because every moment was precious not a crushed blade of grass a brushed leaf an overturned pebble nor a snapped twig did he find he saw that he was getting near to the side of the ridge where the delawares trail had abruptly ended ah what was there a twisted bit of fern with the drops of dew brushed off bending beside the fern wetzel examined the grass it was not crushed a small plant with triangular leaves of dark green lay under the fern breaking off one of these leaves he exposed its lower side to the light the fine silvery hair of fuzz that grew upon the leaf had been crushed wetzel knew that an indian could tread so softly as not to break the springy grass blades but the under side of one of these leaves if a man steps on it always betrays his passage through the woods to keen eyes this leaf showed that it had been bruised by a soft moccasin wetzel had located the trail but was still ignorant of its direction slowly he traced the shaken ferns and bruised leaves down over the side of the ridge and at last near a stone he found a moccasinprint in the moss it pointed east the delaware was traveling in exactly the opposite direction to that which he should be going he was moreover exercising wonderful sagacity in hiding his trail this however did not trouble wetzel for if it took him a long time to find the trail certainly the delaware had expended as much or more in choosing hard ground logs or rocks on which to tread  wetzel soon realized that his own cunning was matched he trusted no more to his intuitive knowledge but stuck close to the trail as a hungry wolf holds to the scent of his quarry  the delaware trail led over logs stones and hardbaked ground up stony ravines and over cliffs the wily chief used all of his old skill he walked backward over moss and sand where his footprints showed plainly he leaped wide fissures in stony ravines and then jumped back again he let himself down over ledges by branches he crossed creeks and gorges by swinging himself into trees and climbing from one to another he waded brooks where he found hard bottom and avoided swampy soft ground  with dogged persistence and tenacity of purpose wetzel stuck to this gradually fading trail every additional rod he was forced to go more slowly and take more time in order to find any sign of his enemys passage through the forests one thing struck him forcibly wingenund was gradually circling to the southwest a course that took him farther and farther from the delaware encampment  slowly it dawned upon wetzel that the chief could hardly have any reason for taking this circling course save that of pride and savage joy in misleading in fooling the foe of the delawares in deliberately showing deathwind that there was one indian who could laugh at and loose him in the forests to wetzel this was bitter as gall to be led a wild goose chase his fierce heart boiled with fury his dark keen eyes sought the grass and moss with terrible earnestness yet in spite of the anger that increased to the white heat of passion he became aware of some strange sensation creeping upon him he remembered that the delawares had offered his life slowly like a shadow wetzel passed up and down the ridges through the brown and yellow aisles of the forest over the babbling brooks out upon the goldenflecked fieldsalways close on the trail  at last in an open part of the forest where a fire had once swept away the brush and smaller timber wetzel came upon the spot where the delawares trail ended  there in the soft black ground was a moccasinprint the forest was not dense there was plenty of light no logs stones or trees were near and yet over all that glade no further evidence of the indians trail was visible  it faded there as the great chief had boasted it would  wetzel searched the burnt ground he crawled on his hands and knees again and again he went over the surroundings the fact that one moccasinprint pointed west and the other east showed that the delaware had turned in his tracks was the most baffling thing that had ever crossed the hunter in all his wild wanderings  for the first time in many years he had failed he took his defeat hard because he had been successful for so long he thought himself almost infallible and because the failure lost him the opportunity to kill his great foe in his passion he cursed himself for being so weak as to let the prayer of a woman turn him from his lifes purpose  with bowed head and slow dragging steps he made his way westward the land was strange to him but he knew he was going toward familiar ground for a time he walked quietly all the time the fierce fever in his veins slowly abating calm he always was except when that unnatural lust for indians blood overcame him  on the summit of a high ridge he looked around to ascertain his bearings he was surprised to find he had traveled in a circle a mile or so below him arose the great oak tree which he recognized as the landmark of beautiful spring he found himself standing on the hill under the very dead tree to which he had directed girtys attention a few hours previous  with the idea that he would return to the spring to scalp the dead indians he went directly toward the big oak tree once out of the forest a wide plain lay between him and the wooded knoll which marked the glade of beautiful spring he crossed this stretch of verdant meadowland and entered the copse  suddenly he halted his keen sense of the usual harmony of the forest with its innumerable quiet sounds had received a severe shock he sank into the tall weeds and listened then he crawled a little farther doubt became certainty a single note of an oriole warned him and it needed not the quick notes of a catbird to tell him that near at hand somewhere was human life  once more wetzel became a tiger the hot blood leaped from his heart firing all his veins and nerves but calmly noiseless certain cold deadly as a snake he began the familiar crawling method of stalking his game  on on under the briars and thickets across the hollows full of yellow leaves up over stony patches of ground to the ferncovered cliff overhanging the glade he glidedlithe sinuous a tiger in movement and in heart  he parted the long graceful ferns and gazed with glittering eyes down into the beautiful glade  he saw not the shining spring nor the purple moss nor the ghastly white bonesall that the buzzards had left of the deadnor anything save a solitary indian standing erect in the glade  there within range of his rifle was his great indian foe wingenund  wetzel sank back into the ferns to still the furious exultations which almost consumed him during the moment when he marked his victim he lay there breathing hard gripping tightly his rifle slowly mastering the passion that alone of all things might render his aim futile  for him it was the third great moment of his life the last of three moments in which the indians life had belonged to him once before he had seen that dark powerful face over the sights of his rifle and he could not shoot because his one shot must be for another again had that lofty haughty figure stood before him calm disdainful arrogant and he yielded to a womans prayer  the delawares life was his to take and he swore he would have it he trembled in the ecstasy of his triumphant passion his great muscles rippled and quivered for the moment was entirely beyond his control then his passion calmed such power for vengeance had he that he could almost still the very beats of his heart to make sure and deadly his fatal aim slowly he raised himself his eyes of cold fire glittered slowly he raised the black rifle  wingenund stood erect in his old grand pose with folded arms but his eyes instead of being fixed on the distant hills were lowered to the ground  an indian girl cold as marble lay at his feet her garments were wet and clung to her slender form her sad face was frozen into an eternal rigidity  by her side was a newly dug grave  the bead on the front sight of the rifle had hardly covered the chiefs dark face when wetzels eye took in these other details he had been so absorbed in his purpose that he did not dream of the delawares reason for returning to the beautiful spring  slowly wetzels forefinger stiffened slowly he lowered the black rifle  wingenund had returned to bury whispering winds  wetzels teethe clenched an awful struggle tore his heart slowly the rifle rose wavered and fell it rose again wavered and fell something terrible was wrong with him something awful was awakening in his soul  wingenund had not made a fool of him the delaware had led him a long chase had given him the slip in the forest not to boast of it but to hurry back to give his daughter christian burial  wingenund was a christian  had he not been once having cast his daughter from him he would never have looked upon her face again  wingenund was true to his race but he was a christian  suddenly wetzels terrible temptation his heartracking struggle ceased he lowered the long black rifle he took one last look at the chieftains dark powerful face  then the avenger fled like a shadow through the forest    chapter xxx  it was late afternoon at fort henry the ruddy sun had already sunk behind the wooded hill and the long shadows of the trees lengthened on the green square in front of the fort  colonel zane stood in his doorway watching the river with eager eyes a few minutes before a man had appeared on the bank of the island and hailed the colonel had sent his brother jonathan to learn what was wanted the latter had already reached the other shore in his flatboat and presently the little boat put out again with the stranger seated at the stern  i thought perhaps it might be wetzel mused the colonel though i never knew of lews wanting a boat  jonathan brought the man across the river and up the winding path to where colonel zane was waiting  hello its young christy exclaimed the colonel jumping off the steps and cordially extending his hand glad to see you wheres williamson how did you happen over here  captain williamson and his men will make the river eight or ten miles above answered christy i came across to inquire about the young people who left the village of peace was glad to learn from jonathan they got out all right  yes indeed were all glad come and sit down of course youll stay over night you look tired and worn well no wonder when you saw that moravian massacre you must tell me about it i saw sam brady yesterday and he spoke of seeing you over there sam told me a good deal ah heres jim now  the young missionary came out of the open door and the two young men greeted each other warmly  how is she asked christy when the first greetings had been exchanged  nells just beginning to get over the shock shell be glad to see you  jonathan tells me you got married just before girty came up with you at beautiful spring  yes it is true in fact the whole wonderful story is true yet i cannot believe as yet you look thin and haggard when we last met you were well  that awful time pulled me down i was an unwilling spectator of all that horrible massacre and shall never get over it i can still see the fiendish savages running about with the reeking scalps of their own people i actually counted the bodies of fortynine grown christians and twentyseven children an hour after you left us the church was in ashes and the next day i saw the burned bodies oh the sickening horror of the scene it haunts me that monster jim girty killed fourteen christians with his sledgehammer  did you hear of his death asked colonel zane  yes and a fitting end it was to the frontier skull and crossbones  it was like wetzel to think of such a vengeance  has wetzel come in since  no jonathan says he went after wingenund and theres no telling when hell return  i hoped he would spare the delaware  wetzel spare an indian  but the chief was a friend he surely saved the girl  i am sorry too because wingenund was a fine indian but wetzel is implacable  heres nell and mrs clarke too come out both of you cried jim  nell appeared in the doorway with colonel zanes sister the two girls came down the steps and greeted the young man the brides sweet face was white and thin and there was a shadow in her eyes  i am so glad you got safely away fromfrom there said christy earnestly  tell me of benny asked nell speaking softly  oh yes i forgot why benny is safe and well he was the only christian indian to escape the christian massacre heckewelder hid him until it was all over he is going to have the lad educated  thank heaven murmured nell  and the missionaries inquired jim earnestly  were all well when i left except of course young he was dying the others will remain out there and try to get another hold but i fear its impossible  it is impossible not because the indian does not want christianity but because such white men as the girtys rule the beautiful village of peace owes its ruin to the renegades said colonel zane impressively  captain williamson could have prevented the massacre remarked jim  possibly it was a bad place for him and i think he was wrong not to try declared the colonel  hullo cried jonathan zane getting up from the steps where he sat listening to the conversation  a familiar softmoccasined footfall sounded on the path all turned to see wetzel come slowly toward them his buckskin hunting costume was ragged and worn he looked tired and weary but the dark eyes were calm  it was the wetzel whom they all loved  they greeted him warmly nell gave him her hands and smiled up at him  im so glad youve come home safe she said  safe an sound lass an glad to find you well answered the hunter as he leaned on his long rifle looking from nell to colonel zanes sister betty i allus gave you first place among border lasses but heres one as could run you most any kind of a race he said with the rare smile which so warmly lighted his dark stern face  lew wetzel making compliments well of all things exclaimed the colonels sister  jonathan zane stood closely scanning wetzels features colonel zane observing his brothers close scrutiny of the hunter guessed the cause and said  lew tell us did you see wingenund over the sights of your rifle  yes answered the hunter simply  a chill seemed to strike the hearts of the listeners that simple answer coming from wetzel meant so much nell bowed her head sadly jim turned away biting his lip christy looked across the valley colonel zane bent over and picked up some pebbles which he threw hard at the cabin wall jonathan zane abruptly left the group and went into the house  but the colonels sister fixed her large black eyes on wetzels face  well she asked and her voice rang  wetzel was silent for a moment he met her eyes with that old inscrutable smile in his own a slight shade flitted across his face  betty i missed him he said calmly and shouldering his long rifle he strode away                                  nell and jim walked along the bluff above the river twilight was deepening the red glow in the west was slowly darkening behind the boldly defined hills  so its all settled jim that we stay here said nell  yes dear colonel zane has offered me work and a church besides we are very fortunate and should be contented i am happy because youre my wife and yet i am sad when i think ofhim poor joe  dont you ever think wewe wronged him whispered nell  no he wished it i think he knew how he would end no we did not wrong him we loved him  yes i loved himi loved you both said nell softly  then let us always think of him as he would have wished  think of him think of joe i shall never forget in winter spring and summer i shall remember him but always most in autumn for i shall see that beautiful glade with its gorgeous color and the dark shaded spring where he lies asleep                                  the years rolled by with their changing seasons every autumn the golden flowers bloomed richly and the colored leaves fell softly upon the amber moss in the glade of beautiful spring  the indians camped there no more they shunned the glade and called it the haunted spring they said the spirit of a white dog ran there at night and the windofdeath mourned over the lonely spot  at long intervals an indian chief of lofty frame and dark powerful face stalked into the glade to stand for many moments silent and motionless  and sometimes at twilight when the red glow of the sun had faded to gray a stalwart hunter slipped like a shadow out of the thicket and leaned upon a long black rifle while he gazed sadly into the dark spring and listened to the sad murmur of the waterfall the twilight deepened while he stood motionless the leaves fell into the water with a soft splash a whippoorwill caroled his melancholy song  from the gloom of the forest came a low sigh which swelled thrillingly upon the quiet air and then died away like the wailing of the night wind  quiet reigned once more over the dark murky grave of the boy who gave his love and his life to the wilderness
