46101711	somebodys luggage   chapter ihis leaving it till called for   the writer of these humble lines being a waiter and having come of a family of waiters and owning at the present time five brothers who are all waiters and likewise an only sister who is a waitress would wish to offer a few words respecting his calling first having the pleasure of hereby in a friendly manner offering the dedication of the same unto joseph much respected head waiter at the slamjam coffeehouse london ec than which a individual more eminently deserving of the name of man or a more amenable honour to his own head and heart whether considered in the light of a waiter or regarded as a human being do not exist  in case confusion should arise in the public mind which it is open to confusion on many subjects respecting what is meant or implied by the term waiter the present humble lines would wish to offer an explanation it may not be generally known that the person as goes out to wait is not a waiter  it may not be generally known that the hand as is called in extra at the freemasons tavern or the london or the albion or otherwise is not a waiter  such hands may be took on for public dinners by the bushel and you may know them by their breathing with difficulty when in attendance and taking away the bottle ere yet it is half out but such are not waiters  for you cannot lay down the tailoring or the shoemaking or the brokering or the greengrocering or the pictorialperiodicalling or the secondhand wardrobe or the small fancy businessesyou cannot lay down those lines of life at your will and pleasure by the halfday or evening and take up waitering  you may suppose you can but you cannot or you may go so far as to say you do but you do not  nor yet can you lay down the gentlemansservice when stimulated by prolonged incompatibility on the part of cooks and here it may be remarked that cooking and incompatibility will be mostly found united and take up waitering  it has been ascertained that what a gentleman will sit meek under at home he will not bear out of doors at the slamjam or any similar establishment  then what is the inference to be drawn respecting true waitering  you must be bred to it  you must be born to it  would you know how born to it fair readerif of the adorable female sex  then learn from the biographical experience of one that is a waiter in the sixtyfirst year of his age  you were conveyedere yet your dawning powers were otherwise developed than to harbour vacancy in your insideyou were conveyed by surreptitious means into a pantry adjoining the admiral nelson civic and general diningrooms there to receive by stealth that healthful sustenance which is the pride and boast of the british female constitution  your mother was married to your father himself a distant waiter in the profoundest secrecy for a waitress known to be married would ruin the best of businessesit is the same as on the stage  hence your being smuggled into the pantry and thatto add to the inflictionby an unwilling grandmother  under the combined influence of the smells of roast and boiled and soup and gas and malt liquors you partook of your earliest nourishment your unwilling grandmother sitting prepared to catch you when your mother was called and dropped you your grandmothers shawl ever ready to stifle your natural complainings your innocent mind surrounded by uncongenial cruets dirty plates dishcovers and cold gravy your mother calling down the pipe for veals and porks instead of soothing you with nursery rhymes  under these untoward circumstances you were early weaned  your unwilling grandmother ever growing more unwilling as your food assimilated less then contracted habits of shaking you till your system curdled and your food would not assimilate at all  at length she was no longer spared and could have been thankfully spared much sooner  when your brothers began to appear in succession your mother retired left off her smart dressing she had previously been a smart dresser and her dark ringlets which had previously been flowing and haunted your father late of nights lying in wait for him through all weathers up the shabby court which led to the back door of the royal old dustbin said to have been so named by george the fourth where your father was head  but the dust bin was going down then and your father took but littleexcepting from a liquid point of view  your mothers object in those visits was of a housekeeping character and you was set on to whistle your father out sometimes he came out but generally not  come or not come however all that part of his existence which was unconnected with open waitering was kept a close secret and was acknowledged by your mother to be a close secret and you and your mother flitted about the court close secrets both of you and would scarcely have confessed under torture that you know your father or that your father had any name than dick which wasnt his name though he was never known by any other or that he had kith or kin or chick or child  perhaps the attraction of this mystery combined with your fathers having a damp compartment to himself behind a leaky cistern at the dustbina sort of a cellar compartment with a sink in it and a smell and a platerack and a bottlerack and three windows that didnt match each other or anything else and no daylightcaused your young mind to feel convinced that you must grow up to be a waiter too but you did feel convinced of it and so did all your brothers down to your sister  every one of you felt convinced that you was born to the waitering  at this stage of your career what was your feelings one day when your father came home to your mother in open broad daylightof itself an act of madness on the part of a waiterand took to his bed leastwise your mother and familys bed with the statement that his eyes were devilled kidneys  physicians being in vain your father expired after repeating at intervals for a day and a night when gleams of reason and old business fitfully illuminated his being two and two is five  and three is sixpence  interred in the parochial department of the neighbouring churchyard and accompanied to the grave by as many waiters of long standing as could spare the morning time from their soiled glasses namely one your bereaved form was attired in a white neckankecher and you was took on from motives of benevolence at the george and gridiron theatrical and supper  here supporting nature on what you found in the plates which was as it happened and but too often thoughtlessly immersed in mustard and on what you found in the glasses which rarely went beyond driblets and lemon by night you dropped asleep standing till you was cuffed awake and by day was set to polishing every individual article in the coffeeroom  your couch being sawdust your counterpane being ashes of cigars  here frequently hiding a heavy heart under the smart tie of your white neckankecher or correctly speaking lower down and more to the left you picked up the rudiments of knowledge from an extra by the name of bishops and by calling platewasher and gradually elevating your mind with chalk on the back of the cornerbox partition until such time as you used the inkstand when it was out of hand attained to manhood and to be the waiter that you find yourself  i could wish here to offer a few respectful words on behalf of the calling so long the calling of myself and family and the public interest in which is but too often very limited  we are not generally understood no we are not  allowance enough is not made for us  for say that we ever show a little drooping listlessness of spirits or what might be termed indifference or apathy  put it to yourself what would your own state of mind be if you was one of an enormous family every member of which except you was always greedy and in a hurry  put it to yourself that you was regularly replete with animal food at the slack hours of one in the day and again at nine pm and that the repleter you was the more voracious all your fellowcreatures came in  put it to yourself that it was your business when your digestion was well on to take a personal interest and sympathy in a hundred gentlemen fresh and fresh say for the sake of argument only a hundred whose imaginations was given up to grease and fat and gravy and melted butter and abandoned to questioning you about cuts of this and dishes of thateach of em going on as if him and you and the bill of fare was alone in the world then look what you are expected to know  you are never out but they seem to think you regularly attend everywhere  whats this christopher that i hear about the smashed excursion train  how are they doing at the italian opera christopher  christopher what are the real particulars of this business at the yorkshire bank  similarly a ministry gives me more trouble than it gives the queen  as to lord palmerston the constant and wearing connection into which i have been brought with his lordship during the last few years is deserving of a pension  then look at the hypocrites we are made and the lies white i hope that are forced upon us  why must a sedentarypursuited waiter be considered to be a judge of horseflesh and to have a most tremendous interest in horsetraining and racing  yet it would be half our little incomes out of our pockets if we didnt take on to have those sporting tastes  it is the same inconceivable why with farming  shooting equally so  i am sure that so regular as the months of august september and october come round i am ashamed of myself in my own private bosom for the way in which i make believe to care whether or not the grouse is strong on the wing much their wings or drumsticks either signifies to me uncooked and whether the partridges is plentiful among the turnips and whether the pheasants is shy or bold or anything else you please to mention  yet you may see me or any other waiter of my standing holding on by the back of the box and leaning over a gentleman with his purse out and his bill before him discussing these points in a confidential tone of voice as if my happiness in life entirely depended on em  i have mentioned our little incomes  look at the most unreasonable point of all and the point on which the greatest injustice is done us  whether it is owing to our always carrying so much change in our righthand trouserspocket and so many halfpence in our coattails or whether it is human nature which i were loth to believe what is meant by the everlasting fable that head waiters is rich  how did that fable get into circulation  who first put it about and what are the facts to establish the unblushing statement  come forth thou slanderer and refer the public to the waiters will in doctors commons supporting thy malignant hiss  yet this is so commonly dwelt uponespecially by the screws who give waiters the leastthat denial is vain and we are obliged for our credits sake to carry our heads as if we were going into a business when of the two we are much more likely to go into a union  there was formerly a screw as frequented the slamjam ere yet the present writer had quitted that establishment on a question of teaing his assistant staff out of his own pocket which screw carried the taunt to its bitterest height  never soaring above threepence and as often as not grovelling on the earth a penny lower he yet represented the present writer as a large holder of consols a lender of money on mortgage a capitalist  he has been overheard to dilate to other customers on the allegation that the present writer put out thousands of pounds at interest in distilleries and breweries  well christopher he would say having grovelled his lowest on the earth half a moment before looking out for a house to open eh  cant find a business to be disposed of on a scale as is up to your resources humph  to such a dizzy precipice of falsehood has this misrepresentation taken wing that the wellknown and highlyrespected old charles long eminent at the west country hotel and by some considered the father of the waitering found himself under the obligation to fall into it through so many years that his own wife for he had an unbeknown old lady in that capacity towards himself believed it  and what was the consequence  when he was borne to his grave on the shoulders of six picked waiters with six more for change six more acting as pallbearers all keeping step in a pouring shower without a dry eye visible and a concourse only inferior to royalty his pantry and lodgings was equally ransacked high and low for property and none was found  how could it be found when beyond his last monthly collection of walkingsticks umbrellas and pockethandkerchiefs which happened to have been not yet disposed of though he had ever been through life punctual in clearing off his collections by the month there was no property existing  such however is the force of this universal libel that the widow of old charles at the present hour an inmate of the almshouses of the corkcutters company in blue anchor road identified sitting at the door of one of em in a clean cap and a windsor armchair only last monday expects johns hoarded wealth to be found hourly  nay ere yet he had succumbed to the grisly dart and when his portrait was painted in oils lifesize by subscription of the frequenters of the west country to hang over the coffeeroom chimney piece there were not wanting those who contended that what is termed the accessories of such a portrait ought to be the bank of england out of window and a strongbox on the table  and but for betterregulated minds contending for a bottle and screw and the attitude of drawingand carrying their pointit would have been so handed down to posterity  i am now brought to the title of the present remarks  having i hope without offence to any quarter offered such observations as i felt it my duty to offer in a free country which has ever dominated the seas on the general subject i will now proceed to wait on the particular question  at a momentous period of my life when i was off so far as concerned notice given with a house that shall be namelessfor the question on which i took my departing stand was a fixed charge for waiters and no house as commits itself to that eminently unenglish act of more than foolishness and baseness shall be advertised by mei repeat at a momentous crisis when i was off with a house too mean for mention and not yet on with that to which i have ever since had the honour of being attached in the capacity of head 1 i was casting about what to do next  then it were that proposals were made to me on behalf of my present establishment  stipulations were necessary on my part emendations were necessary on my part in the end ratifications ensued on both sides and i entered on a new career  we are a bed business and a coffeeroom business  we are not a general dining business nor do we wish it  in consequence when diners drop in we know what to give em as will keep em away another time  we are a private room or family business also but coffeeroom principal  me and the directory and the writing materials and cetrer occupy a place to ourselvesa place fended of up a step or two at the end of the coffee room in what i call the good oldfashioned style  the good oldfashioned style is that whatever you want down to a wafer you must be olely and solely dependent on the head waiter for  you must put yourself a newborn child into his hands  there is no other way in which a business untinged with continental vice can be conducted  it were bootless to add that if languages is required to be jabbered and english is not good enough both families and gentlemen had better go somewhere else  when i began to settle down in this rightprincipled and wellconducted house i noticed under the bed in no 24 b which it is up a angle off the staircase and usually put off upon the lowlyminded a heap of things in a corner  i asked our head chambermaid in the course of the day  what are them things in 24 b  to which she answered with a careless air somebodys luggage  regarding her with a eye not free from severity i says whose luggage  evading my eye she replied  lor  how should i know  being it may be right to mention a female of some pertness though acquainted with her business  a head waiter must be either head or tail  he must be at one extremity or the other of the social scale  he cannot be at the waist of it or anywhere else but the extremities  it is for him to decide which of the extremities  on the eventful occasion under consideration i give mrs pratchett so distinctly to understand my decision that i broke her spirit as towards myself then and there and for good  let not inconsistency be suspected on account of my mentioning mrs pratchett as mrs and having formerly remarked that a waitress must not be married  readers are respectfully requested to notice that mrs pratchett was not a waitress but a chambermaid  now a chambermaid may be married if head generally is marriedor says so  it comes to the same thing as expressing what is customary  nb mr pratchett is in australia and his address there is the bush  having took mrs pratchett down as many pegs as was essential to the future happiness of all parties i requested her to explain herself  for instance i says to give her a little encouragement who is somebody  i give you my sacred honour mr christopher answers pratchett that i havent the faintest notion  but for the manner in which she settled her capstrings i should have doubted this but in respect of positiveness it was hardly to be discriminated from an affidavit  then you never saw him i followed her up with  nor yet said mrs pratchett shutting her eyes and making as if she had just took a pill of unusual circumferencewhich gave a remarkable force to her denialnor yet any servant in this house  all have been changed mr christopher within five year and somebody left his luggage here before then  inquiry of miss martin yielded in the language of the bard of a1 confirmation strong  so it had really and truly happened  miss martin is the young lady at the bar as makes out our bills and though higher than i could wish considering her station is perfectly wellbehaved  farther investigations led to the disclosure that there was a bill against this luggage to the amount of two sixteen six  the luggage had been lying under the bedstead of 24 b over six year  the bedstead is a fourposter with a deal of old hanging and valance and is as i once said probably connected with more than 24 bswhich i remember my hearers was pleased to laugh at at the time  i dont know whywhen do we know whybut this luggage laid heavy on my mind  i fell a wondering about somebody and what he had got and been up to  i couldnt satisfy my thoughts why he should leave so much luggage against so small a bill  for i had the luggage out within a day or two and turned it over and the following were the itemsa black portmanteau a black bag a desk a dressingcase a brownpaper parcel a hatbox and an umbrella strapped to a walkingstick  it was all very dusty and fluey  i had our porter up to get under the bed and fetch it out and though he habitually wallows in dustswims in it from morning to night and wears a closefitting waistcoat with black calimanco sleeves for the purposeit made him sneeze again and his throat was that hot with it that it was obliged to be cooled with a drink of allsopps draft  the luggage so got the better of me that instead of having it put back when it was well dusted and washed with a wet clothprevious to which it was so covered with feathers that you might have thought it was turning into poultry and would byandby begin to layi say instead of having it put back i had it carried into one of my places downstairs  there from time to time i stared at it and stared at it till it seemed to grow big and grow little and come forward at me and retreat again and go through all manner of performances resembling intoxication  when this had lasted weeksi may say months and not be far outi one day thought of asking miss martin for the particulars of the two sixteen six total  she was so obliging as to extract it from the booksit

mem january 1st 1857  he went out after dinner directing luggage to be ready when he called for it  never called        so far from throwing a light upon the subject this bill appeared to me if i may so express my doubts to involve it in a yet more lurid halo speculating it over with the mistress she informed me that the luggage had been advertised in the masters time as being to be sold after such and such a day to pay expenses but no farther steps had been taken  i may here remark that the mistress is a widow in her fourth year  the master was possessed of one of those unfortunate constitutions in which spirits turns to water and rises in the illstarred victim  my speculating it over not then only but repeatedly sometimes with the mistress sometimes with one sometimes with another led up to the mistresss saying to mewhether at first in joke or in earnest or half joke and half earnest it matters not  christopher i am going to make you a handsome offer  if this should meet her eyea lovely bluemay she not take it ill my mentioning that if i had been eight or ten year younger i would have done as much by her  that is i would have made her a offer  it is for others than me to denominate it a handsome one  christopher i am going to make you a handsome offer  put a name to it maam  look here christopher  run over the articles of somebodys luggage youve got it all by heart i know  a black portmanteau maam a black bag a desk a dressingcase a brownpaper parcel a hatbox and an umbrella strapped to a walkingstick  all just as they were left  nothing opened nothing tampered with  you are right maam  all locked but the brownpaper parcel and that sealed  the mistress was leaning on miss martins desk at the barwindow and she taps the open book that lays upon the deskshe has a prettymade hand to be sureand bobs her head over it and laughs  come says she christopher  pay me somebodys bill and you shall have somebodys luggage  i rather took to the idea from the first moment but  it maynt be worth the money i objected seeming to hold back  thats a lottery says the mistress folding her arms upon the bookit aint her hands alone thats pretty made the observation extends right up her arms  wont you venture two pound sixteen shillings and sixpence in the lottery  why theres no blanks says the mistress laughing and bobbing her head again you must win  if you lose you must win  all prizes in this lottery  draw a blank and remember gentlemensportsmen youll still be entitled to a black portmanteau a black bag a desk a dressingcase a sheet of brown paper a hatbox and an umbrella strapped to a walkingstick  to make short of it miss martin come round me and mrs pratchett come round me and the mistress she was completely round me already and all the women in the house come round me and if it had been sixteen two instead of two sixteen i should have thought myself well out of it  for what can you do when they do come round you  so i paid the moneydownand such a laughing as there was among em but i turned the tables on em regularly when i said  my familyname is bluebeard  im going to open somebodys luggage all alone in the secret chamber and not a female eye catches sight of the contents  whether i thought proper to have the firmness to keep to this dont signify or whether any female eye and if any how many was really present when the opening of the luggage came off  somebodys luggage is the question at present nobodys eyes nor yet noses  what i still look at most in connection with that luggage is the extraordinary quantity of writingpaper and all written on  and not our paper neithernot the paper charged in the bill for we know our paperso he must have been always at it  and he had crumpled up this writing of his everywhere in every part and parcel of his luggage there was writing in his dressingcase writing in his boots writing among his shavingtackle writing in his hatbox writing folded away down among the very whalebones of his umbrella  his clothes wasnt bad what there was of em  his dressingcase was poornot a particle of silver stopperbottle apertures with nothing in em like empty little dogkennelsand a most searching description of toothpowder diffusing itself around as under a deluded mistake that all the chinks in the fittings was divisions in teeth  his clothes i parted with well enough to a secondhand dealer not far from st clements danes in the strandhim as the officers in the army mostly dispose of their uniforms to when hard pressed with debts of honour if i may judge from their coats and epaulets diversifying the window with their backs towards the public  the same party bought in one lot the portmanteau the bag the desk the dressingcase the hatbox the umbrella strap and walkingstick  on my remarking that i should have thought those articles not quite in his line he said no more ith a manth grandmother mithter chrithtopher but if any man will bring hith grandmother here and offer her at a fair trifle below what thell feth with good luck when theth thcoured and turnedill buy her  these transactions brought me home and indeed more than home for they left a goodish profit on the original investment  and now there remained the writings and the writings i particular wish to bring under the candid attention of the reader  i wish to do so without postponement for this reason  that is to say namely viz ie as follows thusbefore i proceed to recount the mental sufferings of which i became the prey in consequence of the writings and before following up that harrowing tale with a statement of the wonderful and impressive catastrophe as thrilling in its nature as unlooked for in any other capacity which crowned the ole and filled the cup of unexpectedness to overflowing the writings themselves ought to stand forth to view  therefore it is that they now come next  one word to introduce them and i lay down my pen i hope my unassuming pen until i take it up to trace the gloomy sequel of a mind with something on it  he was a smeary writer and wrote a dreadful bad hand  utterly regardless of ink he lavished it on every undeserving objecton his clothes his desk his hat the handle of his toothbrush his umbrella ink was found freely on the coffeeroom carpet by no 4 table and two blots was on his restless couch  a reference to the document i have given entire will show that on the morning of the third of february eighteen fiftysix he procured his no less than fifth pen and paper  to whatever deplorable act of ungovernable composition he immolated those materials obtained from the bar there is no doubt that the fatal deed was committed in bed and that it left its evidences but too plainly long afterwards upon the pillowcase  he had put no heading to any of his writings  alas  was he likely to have a heading without a head and where was his head when he took such things into it  in some cases such as his boots he would appear to have hid the writings thereby involving his style in greater obscurity but his boots was at least pairsand no two of his writings can put in any claim to be so regarded  here follows not to give more specimens what was found in     chapter iihis boots   eh well then monsieur mutuel  what do i know what can i say  i assure you that he calls himself monsieur the englishman  pardon  but i think it is impossible said monsieur mutuela spectacled snuffy stooping old gentleman in carpet shoes and a cloth cap with a peaked shade a loose blue frockcoat reaching to his heels a large limp white shirtfrill and cravat to correspondthat is to say white was the natural colour of his linen on sundays but it toned down with the week  it is repeated monsieur mutuel his amiable old walnutshell countenance very walnutshelly indeed as he smiled and blinked in the bright morning sunlightit is my cherished madame bouclet i think impossible  hey with a little vexed cry and a great many tosses of her head but it is not impossible that you are a pig retorted madame bouclet a compact little woman of thirtyfive or so  see thenlook thereread on the second floor monsieur langlais  is it not so  it is so said monsieur mutuel  good  continue your morning walk  get out madame bouclet dismissed him with a lively snap of her fingers  the morning walk of monsieur mutuel was in the brightest patch that the sun made in the grande place of a dull old fortified french town  the manner of his morning walk was with his hands crossed behind him an umbrella in figure the express image of himself always in one hand a snuffbox in the other  thus with the shuffling gait of the elephant who really does deal with the very worst trousersmaker employed by the zoological world and who appeared to have recommended him to monsieur mutuel the old gentleman sunned himself daily when sun was to be hadof course at the same time sunning a red ribbon at his buttonhole for was he not an ancient frenchman  being told by one of the angelic sex to continue his morning walk and get out monsieur mutuel laughed a walnutshell laugh pulled off his cap at arms length with the hand that contained his snuffbox kept it off for a considerable period after he had parted from madame bouclet and continued his morning walk and got out like a man of gallantry as he was  the documentary evidence to which madame bouclet had referred monsieur mutuel was the list of her lodgers sweetly written forth by her own nephew and bookkeeper who held the pen of an angel and posted up at the side of her gateway for the information of the police au second m langlais proprietaire  on the second floor mr the englishman man of property  so it stood nothing could be plainer  madame bouclet now traced the line with her forefinger as it were to confirm and settle herself in her parting snap at monsieur mutuel and so placing her right hand on her hip with a defiant air as if nothing should ever tempt her to unsnap that snap strolled out into the place to glance up at the windows of mr the englishman  that worthy happening to be looking out of window at the moment madame bouclet gave him a graceful salutation with her head looked to the right and looked to the left to account to him for her being there considered for a moment like one who accounted to herself for somebody she had expected not being there and reentered her own gateway  madame bouclet let all her house giving on the place in furnished flats or floors and lived up the yard behind in company with monsieur bouclet her husband great at billiards an inherited brewing business several fowls two carts a nephew a little dog in a big kennel a grapevine a countinghouse four horses a married sister with a share in the brewing business the husband and two children of the married sister a parrot a drum performed on by the little boy of the married sister two billeted soldiers a quantity of pigeons a fife played by the nephew in a ravishing manner several domestics and supernumeraries a perpetual flavour of coffee and soup a terrific range of artificial rocks and wooden precipices at least four feet high a small fountain and halfadozen large sunflowers  now the englishman in taking his appartementor as one might say on our side of the channel his set of chambershad given his name correct to the letter langley  but as he had a british way of not opening his mouth very wide on foreign soil except at meals the brewery had been able to make nothing of it but langlais  so mr the englishman he had become and he remained  never saw such a people muttered mr the englishman as he now looked out of window  never did in my life  this was true enough for he had never before been out of his own countrya right little island a tight little island a bright little island a showfight little island and full of merit of all sorts but not the whole round world  these chaps said mr the englishman to himself as his eye rolled over the place sprinkled with military here and there are no more like soldiers  nothing being sufficiently strong for the end of his sentence he left it unended  this again from the point of view of his experience was strictly correct for though there was a great agglomeration of soldiers in the town and neighbouring country you might have held a grand review and fieldday of them every one and looked in vain among them all for a soldier choking behind his foolish stock or a soldier lamed by his ill fitting shoes or a soldier deprived of the use of his limbs by straps and buttons or a soldier elaborately forced to be selfhelpless in all the small affairs of life  a swarm of brisk bright active bustling handy odd skirmishing fellows able to turn cleverly at anything from a siege to soup from great guns to needles and thread from the broadsword exercise to slicing an onion from making war to making omelets was all you would have found  what a swarm  from the great place under the eye of mr the englishman where a few awkward squads from the last conscription were doing the goosestepsome members of those squads still as to their bodies in the chrysalis peasantstate of blouse and only military butterflies as to their regimentallyclothed legsfrom the great place away outside the fortifications and away for miles along the dusty roads soldiers swarmed  all day long upon the grassgrown ramparts of the town practising soldiers trumpeted and bugled all day long down in angles of dry trenches practising soldiers drummed and drummed  every forenoon soldiers burst out of the great barracks into the sandy gymnasiumground hard by and flew over the wooden horse and hung on to flying ropes and dangled upsidedown between parallel bars and shot themselves off wooden platformssplashes sparks coruscations showers of soldiers  at every corner of the townwall every guardhouse every gateway every sentrybox every drawbridge every reedy ditch and rushy dike soldiers soldiers soldiers  and the town being pretty well all wall guardhouse gateway sentrybox drawbridge reedy ditch and rushy dike the town was pretty well all soldiers  what would the sleepy old town have been without the soldiers seeing that even with them it had so overslept itself as to have slept its echoes hoarse its defensive bars and locks and bolts and chains all rusty and its ditches stagnant  from the days when vauban engineered it to that perplexing extent that to look at it was like being knocked on the head with it the stranger becoming stunned and stertorous under the shock of its incomprehensibilityfrom the days when vauban made it the express incorporation of every substantive and adjective in the art of military engineering and not only twisted you into it and twisted you out of it to the right to the left opposite under here over there in the dark in the dirt by the gateway archway covered way dry way wet way fosse portcullis drawbridge sluice squat tower pierced wall and heavy battery but likewise took a fortifying dive under the neighbouring country and came to the surface three or four miles off blowing out incomprehensible mounds and batteries among the quiet crops of chicory and beetrootfrom those days to these the town had been asleep and dust and rust and must had settled on its drowsy arsenals and magazines and grass had grown up in its silent streets  on marketdays alone its great place suddenly leaped out of bed  on marketdays some friendly enchanter struck his staff upon the stones of the great place and instantly arose the liveliest booths and stalls and sittings and standings and a pleasant hum of chaffering and huckstering from many hundreds of tongues and a pleasant though peculiar blending of colourswhite caps blue blouses and green vegetablesand at last the knight destined for the adventure seemed to have come in earnest and all the vaubanois sprang up awake  and now by long lowlying avenues of trees jolting in whitehooded donkeycart and on donkeyback and in tumbril and wagon and cart and cabriolet and afoot with barrow and burdenand along the dikes and ditches and canals in little peakprowed country boatscame peasantmen and women in flocks and crowds bringing articles for sale  and here you had boots and shoes and sweetmeats and stuffs to wear and here in the cool shade of the townhall you had milk and cream and butter and cheese and here you had fruits and onions and carrots and all things needful for your soup and here you had poultry and flowers and protesting pigs and here new shovels axes spades and billhooks for your farming work and here huge mounds of bread and here your unground grain in sacks and here your childrens dolls and here the cakeseller announcing his wares by beat and roll of drum  and hark fanfaronade of trumpets and here into the great place resplendent in an open carriage with four gorgeously attired servitors up behind playing horns drums and cymbals rolled the daughter of a physician in massive golden chains and earrings and bluefeathered hat shaded from the admiring sun by two immense umbrellas of artificial roses to dispense from motives of philanthropy that small and pleasant dose which had cured so many thousands  toothache earache headache heartache stomachache debility nervousness fits fainting fever ague all equally cured by the small and pleasant dose of the great physicians great daughter  the process was thisshe the daughter of a physician proprietress of the superb equipage you now admired with its confirmatory blasts of trumpet drum and cymbal told you so on the first day after taking the small and pleasant dose you would feel no particular influence beyond a most harmonious sensation of indescribable and irresistible joy on the second day you would be so astonishingly better that you would think yourself changed into somebody else on the third day you would be entirely free from disorder whatever its nature and however long you had had it and would seek out the physicians daughter to throw yourself at her feet kiss the hem of her garment and buy as many more of the small and pleasant doses as by the sale of all your few effects you could obtain but she would be inaccessiblegone for herbs to the pyramids of egyptand you would be though cured reduced to despair  thus would the physicians daughter drive her trade and briskly too and thus would the buying and selling and mingling of tongues and colours continue until the changing sunlight leaving the physicians daughter in the shadow of high roofs admonished her to jolt out westward with a departing effect of gleam and glitter on the splendid equipage and brazen blast  and now the enchanter struck his staff upon the stones of the great place once more and down went the booths the sittings and standings and vanished the merchandise and with it the barrows donkeys donkeycarts and tumbrils and all other things on wheels and feet except the slow scavengers with unwieldy carts and meagre horses clearing up the rubbish assisted by the sleek town pigeons better plumped out than on nonmarket days  while there was yet an hour or two to wane before the autumn sunset the loiterer outside towngate and drawbridge and postern and doubleditch would see the last whitehooded cart lessening in the avenue of lengthening shadows of trees or the last country boat paddled by the last marketwoman on her way home showing black upon the reddening long low narrow dike between him and the mill and as the paddleparted scum and weed closed over the boats track he might be comfortably sure that its sluggish rest would be troubled no more until next marketday  as it was not one of the great places days for getting out of bed when mr the englishman looked down at the young soldiers practising the goose step there his mind was left at liberty to take a military turn  these fellows are billeted everywhere about said he and to see them lighting the peoples fires boiling the peoples pots minding the peoples babies rocking the peoples cradles washing the peoples greens and making themselves generally useful in every sort of unmilitary way is most ridiculous  never saw such a set of fellowsnever did in my life  all perfectly true again  was there not private valentine in that very house acting as sole housemaid valet cook steward and nurse in the family of his captain monsieur le capitaine de la courcleaning the floors making the beds doing the marketing dressing the captain dressing the dinners dressing the salads and dressing the baby all with equal readiness  or to put him aside he being in loyal attendance on his chief was there not private hyppolite billeted at the perfumers two hundred yards off who when not on duty volunteered to keep shop while the fair perfumeress stepped out to speak to a neighbour or so and laughingly sold soap with his warsword girded on him  was there not emile billeted at the clockmakers perpetually turning to of an evening with his coat off winding up the stock  was there not eugene billeted at the tinmans cultivating pipe in mouth a garden four feet square for the tinman in the little court behind the shop and extorting the fruits of the earth from the same on his knees with the sweat of his brow  not to multiply examples was there not baptiste billeted on the poor watercarrier at that very instant sitting on the pavement in the sunlight with his martial legs asunder and one of the watercarriers spare pails between them which to the delight and glory of the heart of the watercarrier coming across the place from the fountain yoked and burdened he was painting brightgreen outside and brightred within  or to go no farther than the barbers at the very next door was there not corporal theophile  no said mr the englishman glancing down at the barbers he is not there at present  theres the child though  a mere mite of a girl stood on the steps of the barbers shop looking across the place  a mere baby one might call her dressed in the close white linen cap which small french country children wear like the children in dutch pictures and in a frock of homespun blue that had no shape except where it was tied round her little fat throat  so that being naturally short and round all over she looked behind as if she had been cut off at her natural waist and had had her head neatly fitted on it  theres the child though  to judge from the way in which the dimpled hand was rubbing the eyes the eyes had been closed in a nap and were newly opened  but they seemed to be looking so intently across the place that the englishman looked in the same direction  o said he presently  i thought as much  the corporals there  the corporal a smart figure of a man of thirty perhaps a thought under the middle size but very neatly madea sunburnt corporal with a brown peaked beardfaced about at the moment addressing voluble words of instruction to the squad in hand  nothing was amiss or awry about the corporal  a lithe and nimble corporal quite complete from the sparkling dark eyes under his knowing uniform cap to his sparkling white gaiters  the very image and presentment of a corporal of his countrys army in the line of his shoulders the line of his waist the broadest line of his bloomer trousers and their narrowest line at the calf of his leg  mr the englishman looked on and the child looked on and the corporal looked on but the lastnamed at his men until the drill ended a few minutes afterwards and the military sprinkling dried up directly and was gone  then said mr the englishman to himself look here  by george  and the corporal dancing towards the barbers with his arms wide open caught up the child held her over his head in a flying attitude caught her down again kissed her and made off with her into the barbers house  now mr the englishman had had a quarrel with his erring and disobedient and disowned daughter and there was a child in that case too  had not his daughter been a child and had she not taken angelflights above his head as this child had flown above the corporals  hes a national participledfool said the englishman and shut his window  but the windows of the house of memory and the windows of the house of mercy are not so easily closed as windows of glass and wood  they fly open unexpectedly they rattle in the night they must be nailed up  mr the englishman had tried nailing them but had not driven the nails quite home  so he passed but a disturbed evening and a worse night  by nature a goodtempered man  no very little gentleness confounding the quality with weakness  fierce and wrathful when crossed  very and stupendously unreasonable  moody  exceedingly so  vindictive  well he had had scowling thoughts that he would formally curse his daughter as he had seen it done on the stage  but remembering that the real heaven is some paces removed from the mock one in the great chandelier of the theatre he had given that up  and he had come abroad to be rid of his repudiated daughter for the rest of his life  and here he was  at bottom it was for this reason more than for any other that mr the englishman took it extremely ill that corporal theophile should be so devoted to little bebelle the child at the barbers shop  in an unlucky moment he had chanced to say to himself why confound the fellow he is not her father  there was a sharp sting in the speech which ran into him suddenly and put him in a worse mood  so he had national participled the unconscious corporal with most hearty emphasis and had made up his mind to think no more about such a mountebank  but it came to pass that the corporal was not to be dismissed  if he had known the most delicate fibres of the englishmans mind instead of knowing nothing on earth about him and if he had been the most obstinate corporal in the grand army of france instead of being the most obliging he could not have planted himself with more determined immovability plump in the midst of all the englishmans thoughts  not only so but he seemed to be always in his view  mr the englishman had but to look out of window to look upon the corporal with little bebelle  he had but to go for a walk and there was the corporal walking with bebelle  he had but to come home again disgusted and the corporal and bebelle were at home before him  if he looked out at his back windows early in the morning the corporal was in the barbers back yard washing and dressing and brushing bebelle  if he took refuge at his front windows the corporal brought his breakfast out into the place and shared it there with bebelle  always corporal and always bebelle  never corporal without bebelle  never bebelle without corporal  mr the englishman was not particularly strong in the french language as a means of oral communication though he read it very well  it is with languages as with peoplewhen you only know them by sight you are apt to mistake them you must be on speaking terms before you can be said to have established an acquaintance  for this reason mr the englishman had to gird up his loins considerably before he could bring himself to the point of exchanging ideas with madame bouclet on the subject of this corporal and this bebelle  but madame bouclet looking in apologetically one morning to remark that o heaven she was in a state of desolation because the lampmaker had not sent home that lamp confided to him to repair but that truly he was a lampmaker against whom the whole world shrieked out mr the englishman seized the occasion  madame that baby  pardon monsieur  that lamp  no no that little girl  but pardon said madame bonclet angling for a clew one cannot light a little girl or send her to be repaired  the little girlat the house of the barber  ahhh cried madame bouclet suddenly catching the idea with her delicate little line and rod  little bebelle  yes yes yes  and her friend the corporal  yes yes yes yes  so genteel of himis it not  he is not  not at all not at all  he is not one of her relations  not at all  why then he  perfectly cried madame bouclet you are right monsieur  it is so genteel of him  the less relation the more genteel  as you say  is she  the child of the barber madame bouclet whisked up her skilful little line and rod again  not at all not at all  she is the child ofin a word of no one  the wife of the barber then  indubitably  as you say  the wife of the barber receives a small stipend to take care of her  so much by the month  eh then  it is without doubt very little for we are all poor here  you are not poor madame  as to my lodgers replied madame bouclet with a smiling and a gracious bend of her head no  as to all things else soso  you flatter me madame  monsieur it is you who flatter me in living here  certain fishy gasps on mr the englishmans part denoting that he was about to resume his subject under difficulties madame bouclet observed him closely and whisked up her delicate line and rod again with triumphant success  o no monsieur certainly not  the wife of the barber is not cruel to the poor child but she is careless  her health is delicate and she sits all day looking out at window  consequently when the corporal first came the poor little bebelle was much neglected  it is a curious began mr the englishman  name  that bebelle  again you are right monsieur  but it is a playful name for gabrielle  and so the child is a mere fancy of the corporals said mr the englishman in a gruffly disparaging tone of voice  eh well returned madame bouclet with a pleading shrug one must love something  human nature is weak  devilish weak muttered the englishman in his own language  and the corporal pursued madame bouclet being billeted at the barberswhere he will probably remain a long time for he is attached to the generaland finding the poor unowned child in need of being loved and finding himself in need of lovingwhy there you have it all you see  mr the englishman accepted this interpretation of the matter with an indifferent grace and observed to himself in an injured manner when he was again alone i shouldnt mind it so much if these people were not such anational participledsentimental people  there was a cemetery outside the town and it happened ill for the reputation of the vaubanois in this sentimental connection that he took a walk there that same afternoon  to be sure there were some wonderful things in it from the englishmans point of view and of a certainty in all britain you would have found nothing like it  not to mention the fanciful flourishes of hearts and crosses in wood and iron that were planted all over the place making it look very like a fireworkground where a most splendid pyrotechnic display might be expected after dark there were so many wreaths upon the graves embroidered as it might be to my mother to my daughter to my father to my brother to my sister to my friend and those many wreaths were in so many stages of elaboration and decay from the wreath of yesterday all fresh colour and bright beads to the wreath of last year a poor mouldering wisp of straw  there were so many little gardens and grottos made upon graves in so many tastes with plants and shells and plaster figures and porcelain pitchers and so many odds and ends  there were so many tributes of remembrance hanging up not to be discriminated by the closest inspection from little round waiters whereon were depicted in glowing lines either a lady or a gentleman with a white pockethandkerchief out of all proportion leaning in a state of the most faultless mourning and most profound affliction on the most architectural and gorgeous urn  there were so many surviving wives who had put their names on the tombs of their deceased husbands with a blank for the date of their own departure from this weary world and there were so many surviving husbands who had rendered the same homage to their deceased wives and out of the number there must have been so many who had long ago married again  in fine there was so much in the place that would have seemed more frippery to a stranger save for the consideration that the lightest paper flower that lay upon the poorest heap of earth was never touched by a rude hand but perished there a sacred thing  nothing of the solemnity of death here mr the englishman had been going to say when this last consideration touched him with a mild appeal and on the whole he walked out without saying it  but these people are he insisted by way of compensation when he was well outside the gate they are soparticipledsentimental  his way back lay by the military gymnasiumground  and there he passed the corporal glibly instructing young soldiers how to swing themselves over rapid and deep watercourses on their way to glory by means of a rope and himself deftly plunging off a platform and flying a hundred feet or two as an encouragement to them to begin  and there he also passed perched on a crowning eminence probably the corporals careful hands the small bebelle with her round eyes wide open surveying the proceeding like a wondering sort of blue and white bird  if that child was to die this was his reflection as he turned his back and went his wayand it would almost serve the fellow right for making such a fool of himselfi suppose we should have him sticking up a wreath and a waiter in that fantastic buryingground  nevertheless after another early morning or two of looking out of window he strolled down into the place when the corporal and bebelle were walking there and touching his hat to the corporal an immense achievement wished him goodday  goodday monsieur  this is a rather pretty child you have here said mr the englishman taking her chin in his hand and looking down into her astonished blue eyes  monsieur she is a very pretty child returned the corporal with a stress on his polite correction of the phrase  and good said the englishman  and very good  poor little thing  hah  the englishman stooped down and patted her cheek not without awkwardness as if he were going too far in his conciliation  and what is this medal round your neck my little one  bebelle having no other reply on her lips than her chubby right fist the corporal offered his services as interpreter  monsieur demands what is this bebelle  it is the holy virgin said bebelle  and who gave it you asked the englishman  theophile  and who is theophile  bebelle broke into a laugh laughed merrily and heartily clapped her chubby hands and beat her little feet on the stone pavement of the place  he doesnt know theophile  why he doesnt know any one  he doesnt know anything  then sensible of a small solecism in her manners bebelle twisted her right hand in a leg of the corporals bloomer trousers and laying her cheek against the place kissed it  monsieur theophile i believe said the englishman to the corporal  it is i monsieur  permit me  mr the englishman shook him heartily by the hand and turned away  but he took it mighty ill that old monsieur mutuel in his patch of sunlight upon whom he came as he turned should pull off his cap to him with a look of pleased approval  and he muttered in his own tongue as he returned the salutation well walnutshell  and what business is it of yours  mr the englishman went on for many weeks passing but disturbed evenings and worse nights and constantly experiencing that those aforesaid windows in the houses of memory and mercy rattled after dark and that he had very imperfectly nailed them up  likewise he went on for many weeks daily improving the acquaintance of the corporal and bebelle  that is to say he took bebelle by the chin and the corporal by the hand and offered bebelle sous and the corporal cigars and even got the length of changing pipes with the corporal and kissing bebelle  but he did it all in a shamefaced way and always took it extremely ill that monsieur mutuel in his patch of sunlight should note what he did  whenever that seemed to be the case he always growled in his own tongue there you are again walnutshell  what business is it of yours  in a word it had become the occupation of mr the englishmans life to look after the corporal and little bebelle and to resent old monsieur mutuels looking after him  an occupation only varied by a fire in the town one windy night and much passing of waterbuckets from hand to hand in which the englishman rendered good service and much beating of drumswhen all of a sudden the corporal disappeared  next all of a sudden bebelle disappeared  she had been visible a few days later than the corporalsadly deteriorated as to washing and brushingbut she had not spoken when addressed by mr the englishman and had looked scared and had run away and now it would seem that she had run away for good  and there lay the great place under the windows bare and barren  in his shamefaced and constrained way mr the englishman asked no question of any one but watched from his front windows and watched from his back windows and lingered about the place and peeped in at the barbers shop and did all this and much more with a whistling and tune humming pretence of not missing anything until one afternoon when monsieur mutuels patch of sunlight was in shadow and when according to all rule and precedent he had no right whatever to bring his red ribbon out of doors behold here he was advancing with his cap already in his hand twelve paces off  mr the englishman had got as far into his usual objurgation as what bu si when he checked himself  ah it is sad it is sad  helas it is unhappy it is sad  thus old monsieur mutuel shaking his gray head  what businat least i would say what do you mean monsieur mutuel  our corporal  helas our dear corporal  what has happened to him  you have not heard  no  at the fire  but he was so brave so ready  ah too brave too ready  may the devil carry you away the englishman broke in impatiently i beg your pardoni mean mei am not accustomed to speak frenchgo on will you  and a falling beam  good god exclaimed the englishman  it was a private soldier who was killed  no  a corporal the same corporal our dear corporal  beloved by all his comrades  the funeral ceremony was touchingpenetrating  monsieur the englishman your eyes fill with tears  what busi  monsieur the englishman i honour those emotions  i salute you with profound respect  i will not obtrude myself upon your noble heart  monsieur mutuela gentleman in every thread of his cloudy linen under whose wrinkled hand every grain in the quarter of an ounce of poor snuff in his poor little tin box became a gentlemans propertymonsieur mutuel passed on with his cap in his hand  i little thought said the englishman after walking for several minutes and more than once blowing his nose when i was looking round that cemeteryill go there  straight he went there and when he came within the gate he paused considering whether he should ask at the lodge for some direction to the grave  but he was less than ever in a mood for asking questions and he thought i shall see something on it to know it by  in search of the corporals grave he went softly on up this walk and down that peering in among the crosses and hearts and columns and obelisks and tombstones for a recently disturbed spot  it troubled him now to think how many dead there were in the cemeteryhe had not thought them a tenth part so numerous beforeand after he had walked and sought for some time he said to himself as he struck down a new vista of tombs i might suppose that every one was dead but i  not every one  a live child was lying on the ground asleep  truly he had found something on the corporals grave to know it by and the something was bebelle  with such a loving will had the dead soldiers comrades worked at his restingplace that it was already a neat garden  on the green turf of the garden bebelle lay sleeping with her cheek touching it  a plain unpainted little wooden cross was planted in the turf and her short arm embraced this little cross as it had many a time embraced the corporals neck  they had put a tiny flag the flag of france at his head and a laurel garland  mr the englishman took off his hat and stood for a while silent  then covering his head again he bent down on one knee and softly roused the child  bebelle  my little one  opening her eyes on which the tears were still wet bebelle was at first frightened but seeing who it was she suffered him to take her in his arms looking steadfastly at him  you must not lie here my little one  you must come with me  no no  i cant leave theophile  i want the good dear theophile  we will go and seek him bebelle  we will go and look for him in england  we will go and look for him at my daughters bebelle  shall we find him there  we shall find the best part of him there  come with me poor forlorn little one  heaven is my witness said the englishman in a low voice as before he rose he touched the turf above the gentle corporals breast that i thankfully accept this trust  it was a long way for the child to have come unaided  she was soon asleep again with her embrace transferred to the englishmans neck  he looked at her worn shoes and her galled feet and her tired face and believed that she had come there every day  he was leaving the grave with the slumbering bebelle in his arms when he stopped looked wistfully down at it and looked wistfully at the other graves around  it is the innocent custom of the people said mr the englishman with hesitation  i think i should like to do it  no one sees  careful not to wake bebelle as he went he repaired to the lodge where such little tokens of remembrance were sold and bought two wreaths  one blue and white and glistening silver to my friend one of a soberer red and black and yellow to my friend  with these he went back to the grave and so down on one knee again  touching the childs lips with the brighter wreath he guided her hand to hang it on the cross then hung his own wreath there  after all the wreaths were not far out of keeping with the little garden  to my friend  to my friend  mr the englishman took it very ill when he looked round a street corner into the great place carrying bebelle in his arms that old mutuel should be there airing his red ribbon  he took a world of pains to dodge the worthy mutuel and devoted a surprising amount of time and trouble to skulking into his own lodging like a man pursued by justice  safely arrived there at last he made bebelles toilet with as accurate a remembrance as he could bring to bear upon that work of the way in which he had often seen the poor corporal make it and having given her to eat and drink laid her down on his own bed  then he slipped out into the barbers shop and after a brief interview with the barbers wife and a brief recourse to his purse and cardcase came back again with the whole of bebelles personal property in such a very little bundle that it was quite lost under his arm  as it was irreconcilable with his whole course and character that he should carry bebelle off in state or receive any compliments or congratulations on that feat he devoted the next day to getting his two portmanteaus out of the house by artfulness and stealth and to comporting himself in every particular as if he were going to run awayexcept indeed that he paid his few debts in the town and prepared a letter to leave for madame bouclet enclosing a sufficient sum of money in lieu of notice  a railway train would come through at midnight and by that train he would take away bebelle to look for theophile in england and at his forgiven daughters  at midnight on a moonlight night mr the englishman came creeping forth like a harmless assassin with bebelle on his breast instead of a dagger quiet the great place and quiet the neverstirring streets closed the cafes huddled together motionless their billiardballs drowsy the guard or sentinel on duty here and there lulled for the time by sleep even the insatiate appetite of the office of towndues  mr the englishman left the place behind and left the streets behind and left the civilianinhabited town behind and descended down among the military works of vauban hemming all in  as the shadow of the first heavy arch and postern fell upon him and was left behind as the shadow of the second heavy arch and postern fell upon him and was left behind as his hollow tramp over the first drawbridge was succeeded by a gentler sound as his hollow tramp over the second drawbridge was succeeded by a gentler sound as he overcame the stagnant ditches one by one and passed out where the flowing waters were and where the moonlight so the dark shades and the hollow sounds and the unwholesomely locked currents of his soul were vanquished and set free  see to it vaubans of your own hearts who gird them in with triple walls and ditches and with bolt and chain and bar and lifted bridgeraze those fortifications and lay them level with the allabsorbing dust before the night cometh when no hand can work  all went prosperously and he got into an empty carriage in the train where he could lay bebelle on the seat over against him as on a couch and cover her from head to foot with his mantle  he had just drawn himself up from perfecting this arrangement and had just leaned back in his own seat contemplating it with great satisfaction when he became aware of a curious appearance at the open carriage windowa ghostly little tin box floating up in the moonlight and hovering there  he leaned forward and put out his head  down among the rails and wheels and ashes monsieur mutuel red ribbon and all  excuse me monsieur the englishman said monsieur mutuel holding up his box at arms length the carriage being so high and he so low but i shall reverence the little box for ever if your so generous hand will take a pinch from it at parting  mr the englishman reached out of the window before complying andwithout asking the old fellow what business it was of hisshook hands and said adieu  god bless you  and mr the englishman god bless you cried madame bouclet who was also there among the rails and wheels and ashes  and god will bless you in the happiness of the protected child now with you  and god will bless you in your own child at home  and god will bless you in your own remembrances  and this from me  he had barely time to catch a bouquet from her hand when the train was flying through the night  round the paper that enfolded it was bravely written doubtless by the nephew who held the pen of an angel homage to the friend of the friendless  not bad people bebelle said mr the englishman softly drawing the mantle a little from her sleeping face that he might kiss it though they are so  too sentimental himself at the moment to be able to get out that word he added nothing but a sob and travelled for some miles through the moonlight with his hand before his eyes     chapter iiihis brownpaper parcel   my works are well known  i am a young man in the art line  you have seen my works many a time though its fifty thousand to one if you have seen me  you say you dont want to see me  you say your interest is in my works and not in me  dont be too sure about that  stop a bit  let us have it down in black and white at the first go off so that there may be no unpleasantness or wrangling afterwards  and this is looked over by a friend of mine a ticket writer that is up to literature  i am a young man in the art linein the fineart line  you have seen my works over and over again and you have been curious about me and you think you have seen me  now as a safe rule you never have seen me and you never do see me and you never will see me  i think thats plainly putand its what knocks me over  if theres a blighted public character going i am the party  it has been remarked by a certain or an uncertain philosopher that the world knows nothing of its greatest men  he might have put it plainer if he had thrown his eye in my direction  he might have put it that while the world knows something of them that apparently go in and win it knows nothing of them that really go in and dont win  there it is again in another formand thats what knocks me over  not that its only myself that suffers from injustice but that i am more alive to my own injuries than to any other mans  being as i have mentioned in the fineart line and not the philanthropic line i openly admit it  as to company in injury i have company enough  who are you passing every day at your competitive excruciations  the fortunate candidates whose heads and livers you have turned upside down for life not you  you are really passing the crammers and coaches  if your principle is right why dont you turn out tomorrow morning with the keys of your cities on velvet cushions your musicians playing and your flags flying and read addresses to the crammers and coaches on your bended knees beseeching them to come out and govern you  then again as to your public business of all sorts your financial statements and your budgets the public knows much truly about the real doers of all that  your nobles and right honourables are firstrate men  yes and so is a goose a firstrate bird  but ill tell you this about the gooseyoull find his natural flavour disappointing without stuffing  perhaps i am soured by not being popular  but suppose i am popular suppose my works never fail to attract  suppose that whether they are exhibited by natural light or by artificial they invariably draw the public  then no doubt they are preserved in some collection  no they are not they are not preserved in any collection  copyright  no nor yet copyright  anyhow they must be somewhere  wrong again for they are often nowhere  says you at all events you are in a moody state of mind my friend my answer is i have described myself as a public character with a blight upon himwhich fully accounts for the curdling of the milk in that cocoanut  those that are acquainted with london are aware of a locality on the surrey side of the river thames called the obelisk or more generally the obstacle  those that are not acquainted with london will also be aware of it now that i have named it  my lodging is not far from that locality  i am a young man of that easy disposition that i lie abed till its absolutely necessary to get up and earn something and then i lie abed again till i have spent it  it was on an occasion when i had had to turn to with a view to victuals that i found myself walking along the waterloo road one evening after dark accompanied by an acquaintance and fellowlodger in the gasfitting way of life  he is very good company having worked at the theatres and indeed he has a theatrical turn himself and wishes to be brought out in the character of othello but whether on account of his regular work always blacking his face and hands more or less i cannot say  tom he says what a mystery hangs over you  yes mr clickthe rest of the house generally give him his name as being first front carpeted all over his own furniture and if not mahogany an outandout imitationyes mr click a mystery does hang over me  makes you low you see dont it says he eyeing me sideways  why yes mr click there are circumstances connected with it that have i yielded to a sigh a lowering effect  gives you a touch of the misanthrope too dont it says he  well ill tell you what  if i was you id shake it of  if i was you i would mr click but if you was me you wouldnt  ah says he theres something in that  when we had walked a little further he took it up again by touching me on the chest  you see tom it seems to me as if in the words of the poet who wrote the domestic drama of the stranger you had a silent sorrow there  i have mr click  i hope tom lowering his voice in a friendly way it isnt coining or smashing  no mr click  dont be uneasy  nor yet forg  mr click checked himself and added counterfeiting anything for instance  no mr click  i am lawfully in the art linefineart linebut i can say no more  ah  under a species of star  a kind of malignant spell  a sort of a gloomy destiny  a cankerworm pegging away at your vitals in secret as well as i make it out said mr click eyeing me with some admiration  i told mr click that was about it if we came to particulars and i thought he appeared rather proud of me  our conversation had brought us to a crowd of people the greater part struggling for a front place from which to see something on the pavement which proved to be various designs executed in coloured chalks on the pavement stones lighted by two candles stuck in mud sconces  the subjects consisted of a fine fresh salmons head and shoulders supposed to have been recently sent home from the fishmongers a moonlight night at sea in a circle dead game scrollwork the head of a hoary hermit engaged in devout contemplation the head of a pointer smoking a pipe and a cherubim his flesh creased as in infancy going on a horizontal errand against the wind  all these subjects appeared to me to be exquisitely done  on his knees on one side of this gallery a shabby person of modest appearance who shivered dreadfully though it wasnt at all cold was engaged in blowing the chalkdust off the moon toning the outline of the back of the hermits head with a bit of leather and fattening the down stroke of a letter or two in the writing  i have forgotten to mention that writing formed a part of the composition and that it alsoas it appeared to mewas exquisitely done  it ran as follows in fine round characters an honest man is the noblest work of god  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0  pounds s d  employment in an office is humbly requested  honour the queen  hunger is a 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 sharp thorn  chip chop cherry chop fol de rol de ri do  astronomy and mathematics  i do this to support my family  murmurs of admiration at the exceeding beauty of this performance went about among the crowd  the artist having finished his touching and having spoilt those places took his seat on the pavement with his knees crouched up very nigh his chin and halfpence began to rattle in  a pity to see a man of that talent brought so low aint it said one of the crowd to me  what he might have done in the coachpainting or housedecorating said another man who took up the first speaker because i did not  why he writesalonelike the lord chancellor said another man  better said another  i know his writing  he couldnt support his family this way  then a woman noticed the natural fluffiness of the hermits hair and another woman her friend mentioned of the salmons gills that you could almost see him gasp  then an elderly country gentleman stepped forward and asked the modest man how he executed his work  and the modest man took some scraps of brown paper with colours in em out of his pockets and showed them  then a faircomplexioned donkey with sandy hair and spectacles asked if the hermit was a portrait  to which the modest man casting a sorrowful glance upon it replied that it was to a certain extent a recollection of his father  this caused a boy to yelp out is the pinter a smoking the pipe your mother who was immediately shoved out of view by a sympathetic carpenter with his basket of tools at his back  at every fresh question or remark the crowd leaned forward more eagerly and dropped the halfpence more freely and the modest man gathered them up more meekly  at last another elderly gentleman came to the front and gave the artist his card to come to his office tomorrow and get some copying to do  the card was accompanied by sixpence and the artist was profoundly grateful and before he put the card in his hat read it several times by the light of his candles to fix the address well in his mind in case he should lose it  the crowd was deeply interested by this last incident and a man in the second row with a gruff voice growled to the artist youve got a chance in life now aint you  the artist answered sniffing in a very lowspirited way however im thankful to hope so  upon which there was a general chorus of you are all right and the halfpence slackened very decidedly  i felt myself pulled away by the arm and mr click and i stood alone at the corner of the next crossing  why tom said mr click what a horrid expression of face youve got  have i says i  have you says mr click  why you looked as if you would have his blood  whose blood  the artists  the artists i repeated  and i laughed frantically wildly gloomily incoherently disagreeably  i am sensible that i did  i know i did  mr click stared at me in a scared sort of a way but said nothing until we had walked a streets length  he then stopped short and said with excitement on the part of his forefinger  thomas i find it necessary to be plain with you  i dont like the envious man  i have identified the cankerworm thats pegging away at your vitals and its envy thomas  is it says i  yes it is says be  thomas beware of envy  it is the greeneyed monster which never did and never will improve each shining hour but quite the reverse  i dread the envious man thomas  i confess that i am afraid of the envious man when he is so envious as you are  whilst you contemplated the works of a gifted rival and whilst you heard that rivals praises and especially whilst you met his humble glance as he put that card away your countenance was so malevolent as to be terrific thomas i have heard of the envy of them that follows the fineart line but i never believed it could be what yours is  i wish you well but i take my leave of you  and if you should ever got into trouble through knifeingor say garottinga brother artist as i believe you will dont call me to character thomas or i shall be forced to injure your case  mr click parted from me with those words and we broke off our acquaintance  i became enamoured  her name was henrietta  contending with my easy disposition i frequently got up to go after her  she also dwelt in the neighbourhood of the obstacle and i did fondly hope that no other would interpose in the way of our union  to say that henrietta was volatile is but to say that she was woman  to say that she was in the bonnettrimming is feebly to express the taste which reigned predominant in her own  she consented to walk with me  let me do her the justice to say that she did so upon trial  i am not said henrietta as yet prepared to regard you thomas in any other light than as a friend but as a friend i am willing to walk with you on the understanding that softer sentiments may flow  we walked  under the influence of henriettas beguilements i now got out of bed daily  i pursued my calling with an industry before unknown and it cannot fail to have been observed at that period by those most familiar with the streets of london that there was a larger supply  but hold the time is not yet come  one evening in october i was walking with henrietta enjoying the cool breezes wafted over vauxhall bridge  after several slow turns henrietta gaped frequently so inseparable from woman is the love of excitement and said lets go home by grosvenor place piccadilly and waterloolocalities i may state for the information of the stranger and the foreigner well known in london and the last a bridge  no  not by piccadilly henrietta said i  and why not piccadilly for goodness sake said henrietta  could i tell her  could i confess to the gloomy presentiment that overshadowed me  could i make myself intelligible to her  no  i dont like piccadilly henrietta  but i do said she  its dark now and the long rows of lamps in piccadilly after dark are beautiful  i will go to piccadilly  of course we went  it was a pleasant night and there were numbers of people in the streets  it was a brisk night but not too cold and not damp  let me darkly observe it was the best of all nightsfor the purpose  as we passed the garden wall of the royal palace going up grosvenor place henrietta murmured  i wish i was a queen  why so henrietta  i would make you something said she and crossed her two hands on my arm and turned away her head  judging from this that the softer sentiments alluded to above had begun to flow i adapted my conduct to that belief  thus happily we passed on into the detested thoroughfare of piccadilly  on the right of that thoroughfare is a row of trees the railing of the green park and a fine broad eligible piece of pavement  oh my cried henrietta presently  theres been an accident  i looked to the left and said where henrietta  not there stupid said she  over by the park railings  where the crowd is  oh no its not an accident its something else to look at whats them lights  she referred to two lights twinkling low amongst the legs of the assemblage two candles on the pavement  oh do come along cried henrietta skipping across the road with me  i hung back but in vain  do lets look  again designs upon the pavement  centre compartment mount vesuvius going it in a circle supported by four oval compartments severally representing a ship in heavy weather a shoulder of mutton attended by two cucumbers a golden harvest with distant cottage of proprietor and a knife and fork after nature above the centre compartment a bunch of grapes and over the whole a rainbow  the whole as it appeared to me exquisitely done  the person in attendance on these works of art was in all respects shabbiness excepted unlike the former personage  his whole appearance and manner denoted briskness  though threadbare he expressed to the crowd that poverty had not subdued his spirit or tinged with any sense of shame this honest effort to turn his talents to some account  the writing which formed a part of his composition was conceived in a similarly cheerful tone  it breathed the following sentiments the writer is poor but not despondent  to a british 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 public he pounds s d appeals  honour to our brave army  and also 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 to our gallant navy  britons strike the a b c d e f g writer in common chalks would be grateful for any suitable employment home  hurrah  the whole of this writing appeared to me to be exquisitely done  but this man in one respect like the last though seemingly hard at it with a great show of brown paper and rubbers was only really fattening the downstroke of a letter here and there or blowing the loose chalk off the rainbow or toning the outside edge of the shoulder of mutton though he did this with the greatest confidence he did it as it struck me in so ignorant a manner and so spoilt everything he touched that when he began upon the purple smoke from the chimney of the distant cottage of the proprietor of the golden harvest which smoke was beautifully soft i found myself saying aloud without considering of it  let that alone will you  halloa said the man next me in the crowd jerking me roughly from him with his elbow why didnt you send a telegram  if we had known you was coming wed have provided something better for you  you understand the mans work better than he does himself dont you  have you made your will  youre too clever to live long  dont be hard upon the gentleman sir said the person in attendance on the works of art with a twinkle in his eye as he looked at me he may chance to be an artist himself  if so sir he will have a fellowfeeling with me sir when ihe adapted his action to his words as he went on and gave a smart slap of his hands between each touch working himself all the time about and about the compositionwhen i lighten the bloom of my grapesshade off the orange in my rainbowdot the i of my britonsthrow a yellow light into my cowcumberinsinuate another morsel of fat into my shoulder of muttondart another zigzag flash of lightning at my ship in distress  he seemed to do this so neatly and was so nimble about it that the halfpence came flying in  thanks generous public thanks said the professor  you will stimulate me to further exertions  my name will be found in the list of british painters yet  i shall do better than this with encouragement  i shall indeed  you never can do better than that bunch of grapes said henrietta  oh thomas them grapes  not better than that lady  i hope for the time when i shall paint anything but your own bright eyes and lips equal to life  thomas did you ever  but it must take a long time sir said henrietta blushing to paint equal to that  i was prenticed to it miss said the young man smartly touching up the compositionprenticed to it in the caves of spain and portingale ever so long and two year over  there was a laugh from the crowd and a new man who had worked himself in next me said hes a smart chap too aint he  and what a eye exclaimed henrietta softly  ah  he need have a eye said the man  ah  he just need was murmured among the crowd  he couldnt come that ere burning mountain without a eye said the man  he had got himself accepted as an authority somehow and everybody looked at his finger as it pointed out vesuvius  to come that effect in a general illumination would require a eye but to come it with two dipswhy its enough to blind him  that impostor pretending not to have heard what was said now winked to any extent with both eyes at once as if the strain upon his sight was too much and threw back his long hairit was very longas if to cool his fevered brow  i was watching him doing it when henrietta suddenly whispered oh thomas how horrid you look and pulled me out by the arm  remembering mr clicks words i was confused when i retorted what do you mean by horrid  oh gracious  why you looked said henrietta as if you would have his blood  i was going to answer so i would for twopencefrom his nose when i checked myself and remained silent  we returned home in silence  every step of the way the softer sentiments that had flowed ebbed twenty mile an hour  adapting my conduct to the ebbing as i had done to the flowing i let my arm drop limp so as she could scarcely keep hold of it and i wished her such a cold goodnight at parting that i keep within the bounds of truth when i characterise it as a rasper  in the course of the next day i received the following document     henrietta informs thomas that my eyes are open to you  i must ever    wish you well but walking and us is separated by an unfarmable abyss    one so malignant to superiorityoh that look at himcan never never    conduct     henrietta     psto the altar  yielding to the easiness of my disposition i went to bed for a week after receiving this letter  during the whole of such time london was bereft of the usual fruits of my labour  when i resumed it i found that henrietta was married to the artist of piccadilly  did i say to the artist  what fell words were those expressive of what a galling hollowness of what a bitter mockery  iiiam the artist i was the real artist of piccadilly i was the real artist of the waterloo road i am the only artist of all those pavementsubjects which daily and nightly arouse your admiration  i do em and i let em out the man you behold with the papers of chalks and the rubbers touching up the downstrokes of the writing and shading off the salmon the man you give the credit to the man you give the money to hiresyes and i live to tell ithires those works of art of me and brings nothing to em but the candles  such is genius in a commercial country  i am not up to the shivering i am not up to the liveliness i am not up to the wantingemploymentinan office move i am only up to originating and executing the work  in consequence of which you never see me you think you see me when you see somebody else and that somebody else is a mere commercial character  the one seen by self and mr click in the waterloo road can only write a single word and that i taught him and its multiplicationwhich you may see him execute upside down because he cant do it the natural way the one seen by self and henrietta by the green park railings can just smear into existence the two ends of a rainbow with his cuff and a rubberif very hard put upon making a showbut he could no more come the arch of the rainbow to save his life than he could come the moonlight fish volcano shipwreck mutton hermit or any of my most celebrated effects  to conclude as i began if theres a blighted public character going i am the party  and often as you have seen do see and will see my works its fifty thousand to one if youll ever see me unless when the candles are burnt down and the commercial character is gone you should happen to notice a neglected young man perseveringly rubbing out the last traces of the pictures so that nobody can renew the same  thats me     chapter ivhis wonderful end   it will have been ere now perceived that i sold the foregoing writings from the fact of their being printed in these pages the inference will ere now have been drawn by the reader may i add the gentle reader that i sold them to one who never yet2  having parted with the writings on most satisfactory termsfor in opening negotiations with the present journal was i not placing myself in the hands of one of whom it may be said in the words of another 2resumed my usual functions  but i too soon discovered that peace of mind had fled from a brow which up to that time time had merely took the hair off leaving an unruffled expanse within  it were superfluous to veil itthe brow to which i allude is my own  yes over that brow uneasiness gathered like the sable wing of the fabled bird asas no doubt will be easily identified by all rightminded individuals  if not i am unable on the spur of the moment to enter into particulars of him  the reflection that the writings must now inevitably get into print and that he might yet live and meet with them sat like the hag of night upon my jaded form  the elasticity of my spirits departed  fruitless was the bottle whether wine or medicine  i had recourse to both and the effect of both upon my system was witheringly lowering  in this state of depression into which i subsided when i first began to revolve what could i ever say if hethe unknownwas to appear in the coffeeroom and demand reparation i one forenoon in this last november received a turn that appeared to be given me by the finger of fate and conscience hand in hand  i was alone in the coffeeroom and had just poked the fire into a blaze and was standing with my back to it trying whether heat would penetrate with soothing influence to the voice within when a young man in a cap of an intelligent countenance though requiring his hair cut stood before me  mr christopher the head waiter  the same  the young man shook his hair out of his visionwhich it impededto a packet from his breast and handing it over to me said with his eye or did i dream fixed with a lambent meaning on me the proofs  although i smelt my coattails singeing at the fire i had not the power to withdraw them  the young man put the packet in my faltering grasp and repeatedlet me do him the justice to add with civility  the proofs  a y r  with those words he departed  a y r  and you remember  was that his meaning  at your risk  were the letters short for that reminder  anticipate your retribution  did they stand for that warning  outdacious youth repent  but no for that a o was happily wanting and the vowel here was a a  i opened the packet and found that its contents were the foregoing writings printed just as the reader may i add the discerning reader peruses them  in vain was the reassuring whisperayr all the year roundit could not cancel the proofs  too appropriate name  the proofs of my having sold the writings  my wretchedness daily increased  i had not thought of the risk i ran and the defying publicity i put my head into until all was done and all was in print  give up the money to be off the bargain and prevent the publication i could not  my family was down in the world christmas was coming on a brother in the hospital and a sister in the rheumatics could not be entirely neglected  and it was not only ins in the family that had told on the resources of one unaided waitering outs were not wanting  a brother out of a situation and another brother out of money to meet an acceptance and another brother out of his mind and another brother out at new york not the same though it might appear so had really and truly brought me to a stand till i could turn myself round  i got worse and worse in my meditations constantly reflecting the proofs and reflecting that when christmas drew nearer and the proofs were published there could be no safety from hour to hour but that he might confront me in the coffeeroom and in the face of day and his country demand his rights  the impressive and unlookedfor catastrophe towards which i dimly pointed the reader shall i add the highly intellectual reader in my first remarks now rapidly approaches  it was november still but the last echoes of the guy foxes had long ceased to reverberate  we was slackseveral joints under our average mark and wine of course proportionate  so slack had we become at last that beds nos 26 27 28 and 31 having took their six oclock dinners and dozed over their respective pints had drove away in their respective hansoms for their respective night mailtrains and left us empty  i had took the evening paper to no 6 tablewhich is warm and most to be preferredand lost in the allabsorbing topics of the day had dropped into a slumber  i was recalled to consciousness by the wellknown intimation waiter and replying sir found a gentleman standing at no 4 table  the reader shall i add the observant reader will please to notice the locality of the gentlemanat no 4 table  he had one of the newfangled uncollapsable bags in his hand which i am against for i dont see why you shouldnt collapse while you are about it as your fathers collapsed before you and he said  i want to dine waiter  i shall sleep here tonight  very good sir  what will you take for dinner sir  soup bit of codfish oyster sauce and the joint  thank you sir  i rang the chambermaids bell and mrs pratchett marched in according to custom demurely carrying a lighted flat candle before her as if she was one of a long public procession all the other members of which was invisible  in the meanwhile the gentleman had gone up to the mantelpiece right in front of the fire and had laid his forehead against the mantelpiece which it is a low one and brought him into the attitude of leapfrog and had heaved a tremenjous sigh  his hair was long and lightish and when he laid his forehead against the mantelpiece his hair all fell in a dusty fluff together over his eyes and when he now turned round and lifted up his head again it all fell in a dusty fluff together over his ears  this give him a wild appearance similar to a blasted heath  o  the chambermaid  ah  he was turning something in his mind  to be sure  yes  i wont go upstairs now if you will take my bag  it will be enough for the present to know my numbercan you give me 24 b  o conscience what a adder art thou  mrs pratchett allotted him the room and took his bag to it  he then went back before the fire and fell a biting his nails  waiter biting between the words give me bite pen and paper and in five minutes bite let me have if you please bite a bite messenger  unmindful of his waning soup he wrote and sent off six notes before he touched his dinner  three were city three westend  the city letters were to cornhill ludgatehill and farringdon street  the westend letters were to great marlborough street new burlington street and piccadilly  everybody was systematically denied at every one of the six places and there was not a vestige of any answer  our light porter whispered to me when he came back with that report all booksellers  but before then he had cleared off his dinner and his bottle of wine  he nowmark the concurrence with the document formerly given in fullknocked a plate of biscuits off the table with his agitated elber but without breakage and demanded boiling brandyandwater  now fully convinced that it was himself i perspired with the utmost freedom  when he became flushed with the heated stimulant referred to he again demanded pen and paper and passed the succeeding two hours in producing a manuscript which he put in the fire when completed  he then went up to bed attended by mrs pratchett  mrs pratchett who was aware of my emotions told me on coming down that she had noticed his eye rolling into every corner of the passages and staircase as if in search of his luggage and that looking back as she shut the door of 24 b she perceived him with his coat already thrown off immersing himself bodily under the bedstead like a chimleysweep before the application of machinery  the next dayi forbear the horrors of that nightwas a very foggy day in our part of london insomuch that it was necessary to light the coffee room gas  we was still alone and no feverish words of mine can do justice to the fitfulness of his appearance as he sat at no 4 table increased by there being something wrong with the meter  having again ordered his dinner he went out and was out for the best part of two hours  inquiring on his return whether any of the answers had arrived and receiving an unqualified negative his instant call was for mulligatawny the cayenne pepper and orange brandy  feeling that the mortal struggle was now at hand i also felt that i must be equal to him and with that view resolved that whatever he took i would take  behind my partition but keeping my eye on him over the curtain i therefore operated on mulligatawny cayenne pepper and orange brandy  and at a later period of the day when he again said orange brandy i said so too in a lower tone to george my second lieutenant my first was absent on leave who acts between me and the bar  throughout that awful day he walked about the coffeeroom continually often he came close up to my partition and then his eye rolled within too evidently in search of any signs of his luggage  halfpast six came and i laid his cloth  he ordered a bottle of old brown  i likewise ordered a bottle of old brown  he drank his  i drank mine as nearly as my duties would permit glass for glass against his  he topped with coffee and a small glass  i topped with coffee and a small glass  he dozed  i dozed  at last waiterand he ordered his bill  the moment was now at hand when we two must be locked in the deadly grapple  swift as the arrow from the bow i had formed my resolution in other words i had hammered it out between nine and nine  it was that i would be the first to open up the subject with a full acknowledgment and would offer any gradual settlement within my power  he paid his bill doing what was right by attendance with his eye rolling about him to the last for any tokens of his luggage  one only time our gaze then met with the lustrous fixedness i believe i am correct in imputing that character to it of the wellknown basilisk  the decisive moment had arrived  with a tolerable steady hand though with humility i laid the proofs before him  gracious heavens he cries out leaping up and catching hold of his hair  whats this  print  sir i replied in a calming voice and bending forward i humbly acknowledge to being the unfortunate cause of it  but i hope sir that when you have heard the circumstances explained and the innocence of my intentions  to my amazement i was stopped short by his catching me in both his arms and pressing me to his breastbone where i must confess to my face and particular nose having undergone some temporary vexation from his wearing his coat buttoned high up and his buttons being uncommon hard  ha ha ha he cries releasing me with a wild laugh and grasping my hand  what is your name my benefactor  my name sir i was crumpled and puzzled to make him out is christopher and i hope sir that as such when youve heard my ex  in print he exclaims again dashing the proofs over and over as if he was bathing in themin print  o christopher  philanthropist nothing can recompense youbut what sum of money would be acceptable to you  i had drawn a step back from him or i should have suffered from his buttons again  sir i assure you i have been already well paid and  no no christopher  dont talk like that  what sum of money would be acceptable to you christopher  would you find twenty pounds acceptable christopher  however great my surprise i naturally found words to say sir i am not aware that the man was ever yet born without more than the average amount of water on the brain as would not find twenty pounds acceptable butextremely obliged to you sir im sure for he had tumbled it out of his purse and crammed it in my hand in two banknotes but i could wish to know sir if not intruding how i have merited this liberality  know then my christopher he says that from boyhoods hour i have unremittingly and unavailingly endeavoured to get into print  know christopher that all the booksellers aliveand several deadhave refused to put me into print  know christopher that i have written unprinted reams  but they shall be read to you my friend and brother you sometimes have a holiday  seeing the great danger i was in i had the presence of mind to answer never  to make it more final i added never  not from the cradle to the grave  well says he thinking no more about that and chuckling at his proofs again  but i am in print  the first flight of ambition emanating from my fathers lowly cot is realised at length  the golden bowhe was getting onstruck by the magic hand has emitted a complete and perfect sound  when did this happen my christopher  which happen sir  this he held it out at arms length to admire itthis perrint  when i had given him my detailed account of it he grasped me by the hand again and said  dear christopher it should be gratifying to you to know that you are an instrument in the hands of destiny  because you are  a passing something of a melancholy cast put it into my head to shake it and to say perhaps we all are  i dont mean that he answered i dont take that wide range i confine myself to the special case  observe me well my christopher hopeless of getting rid through any effort of my own of any of the manuscripts among my luggageall of which send them where i would were always coming back to meit is now some seven years since i left that luggage here on the desperate chance either that the too too faithful manuscripts would come back to me no more or that some one less accursed than i might give them to the world  you follow me my christopher  pretty well sir  i followed him so far as to judge that he had a weak head and that the orange the boiling and old brown combined was beginning to tell  the old brown being heady is best adapted to seasoned cases  years elapsed and those compositions slumbered in dust  at length destiny choosing her agent from all mankind sent you here christopher and lo the casket was burst asunder and the giant was free  he made hay of his hair after he said this and he stood atiptoe  but he reminded himself in a state of excitement we must sit up all night my christopher  i must correct these proofs for the press  fill all the inkstands and bring me several new pens  he smeared himself and he smeared the proofs the night through to that degree that when sol gave him warning to depart in a fourwheeler few could have said which was them and which was him and which was blots his last instructions was that i should instantly run and take his corrections to the office of the present journal  i did so  they most likely will not appear in print for i noticed a message being brought round from beauford printing house while i was a throwing this concluding statement on paper that the ole resources of that establishment was unable to make out what they meant  upon which a certain
