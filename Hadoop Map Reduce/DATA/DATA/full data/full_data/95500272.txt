thurwell court by thurwellonthesea lay bathed in the quiet freshness of an early morning the dewdrops were still sparkling upon the terraced lawns like little globules of flashing silver and the tumult of noisy songsters from the thick shrubberies alone broke the sweet silence the peacocks strutting about the grey stone balcony and perched upon the worn balustrade were in deshabille not being accustomed to display their splendors to an empty paradise and the few fat blackbirds who were hopping about on the lawn did so in a desultory manner as though they were only half awake and had turned out under protest stillness reigned everywhere but it was the sweet hush of slowly awakening day rather than the drowsy languorous quiet of exhausted afternoon with ones eyes shut one could tell that the pulse of day was only just beginning to beat the pure atmosphere was buoyant with the vigorous promise of morning and gently laden with the mingled perfumes of slowly opening flowers there was life in the breathless air  the sunlight was everywhere in the distance it lay upon the dark hillside played upon the deep yellow gorse and purple heather of the moorland and further away still flashed upon a long silver streak of the german ocean in the oldfashioned gardens of the court it shone upon luscious peaches hanging on the timemellowed redbrick walls lit up the face and gleamed upon the hands of the stable clock and warmed the ancient heart of the stooping greyhaired old gardeners help who with blinking eyes and hands tucked in his trousers pockets was smoking a matutinal pipe seated on the wheelbarrow outside the tool shed  around the mansion itself it was very busy casting a thousand sunbeams upon its long line of oriel windows and many quaint shadows of its begabled roof upon the lawns and bright flowerbeds below on one of the terraces a breakfasttable was laid for two and here its splendour was absolutely dazzling it gleamed upon the sparkling silver and the snowwhite tablecloth shone with a delicate softness upon the freshlygathered fruit and brilliant flowers and seemed to hover with a gentle burnished light upon the ruddy golden hair of a girl who sat there waiting with her arm resting lightly upon the stone balustrade and her eyes straying over the quaint wellkept gardens to the open moorland and dark patches of wooded country beyond  good morning helen first as usual  she turned round with a somewhat languid greeting a tall wellmade man a little past middleage in gaiters and light tweed coat had stepped out on to the balcony from one of the open windows in his right hand he was swinging carelessly backwards and forwards by a long strap a wellworn letterbag  is breakfast ready he inquired  waiting for you father she answered touching a small handbell by her side try one of those peaches burdett says they are the finest he ever raised  he stretched out his hand for one and sinking into a low basket chair commenced lazily to peel it with his eyes wandering over the sunny landscape a footman brought out the tea equipage and some silvercovered dishes and after silently arranging them upon the table withdrew  what an exquisite morning mr thurwell remarked looking up at the blue cloudless sky and pulling his cap a little closer over his eyes to protect them from the sun we might be in italy again  indeed we might she answered i am going to imagine that we are and make my breakfast of peaches and cream and chocolate shall i give you some  he shook his head with a little grimace  no thanks im philistine enough to prefer devilled kidneys and tea i wonder if there is anything in the letters  he drew a key from his waistcoat pocket and unlocking the bag shook its contents upon the tablecloth his daughter looked at the pile with a faint show of interest there were one or two invitations which he tossed over to her a few business letters which he put on one side for more leisurely perusal later on and a little packet from his agent which he opened at once and the contents of which brought a slight frown into his handsome face  helen thurwell glanced through her share without finding anything interesting tennis parties archery meetings a bazaar fête absolutely nothing fresh she was so tired of all that sort of thingtired of eternally meeting the same little set of people and joining in the same round of socalled amusements there was nothing in northshire society which attracted her it was all very stupid and she was very much bored  some news here that will interest you helen her father remarked suddenly who do you think is coming home  she shook her head she was not in the least curious  i dont remember any one going away lately she remarked how warm it is  sir geoffrey kynaston is coming back  after all she was a little interested she looked away from the sunny gardens and into her fathers face  really  it is a fact he declared douglas says that he will be here today or tomorrow let me see it must be nearly fifteen years since he was in england time he settled down if he means to at all  was he very wild then she asked  the squire nodded  rather he answered dryly i dare say people will have forgotten all about it by now though forty thousand a year covers a multitude of sins especially in a tenth baronet  she asked no more questions but leaned back in her chair and looked thoughtfully across the open country towards the grey turrets of kynaston towers from which a flag was flying mr thurwell reread his agents letter with a slight frown upon his forehead  i dont know what to do here he remarked  what is it she asked absently she was watching the flag slowly unfurling itself in the breeze and fluttering languidly above the treetops it was odd to think that a master was coming to rule there  its about falcons nest i wish id never thought of letting it  why it would be a great deal better occupied surely  if i could let it to a decent tenant of course it would but you know that fellow chapman of mallory he wants it  she looked up at him quickly  you surely would not let it to a man like that  certainly not but on the other hand i dont want to offend him if i were to decide to stand for the county at the next election he would be my most useful man in mallory or my worst enemy hes just the sort of fellow to take offencequickly too  cant you tell him its let  not unless i do let it to some one of course not  but are there no other applications  yes there is one other he answered but the most awkward part of it is that its from a complete stranger fellow who calls himself brown  let me see the letter she said  he passed it over the table to her it was written on plain notepaper in a peculiar cramped handwriting       london may 30       dear siri understand from an advertisement in this weeks      field that you are willing to let falcons nest situated on      your estate i shall be happy to take it at the rent you quote if      not already disposed of my solicitors are messrs cuthbert of      lincolns inn and my bankers gregsons i may add that i am a      bachelor living alone the favor of your immediate reply will much      oblige       yours faithfully       bernard brown  she folded the letter up and returned it to her father without remark  you see mr thurwell said my only chance of escaping from chapman without offending him is to say that it is already let and to accept this fellows offer straight off but its an awful risk how do i know that brown isnt a retired tallowchandler or something of that sort  why not telegraph to his solicitors she suggested they would know who he was i suppose  thats not a bad idea he declared morton shall ride over to mallory at once im glad you thought of it helen  having come to this decision mr thurwell turned round and made an excellent breakfast after which he and his daughter spent the day very much in the same manner as any other english country gentleman and young lady are in the habit of doing he made a pretense of writing some letters and arranging some business affairs with his agent in the library for an hour and later on in the morning he drove over to mallory and took his seat on the magistrates bench during the hearing of a poaching case after lunch he rode to an outlying farm to inspect a new system of drainage and when he returned about an hour before dinnertime he considered that he had done a good days work  helen spent the early part of the morning in the garden and arranging freshly cut flowers about the house then she practised for an hour solely out of a sense of duty for she was no musician directly the time was up she closed the piano with a sigh of relief and spent the rest of the time before two oclock reading a rather stupid novel after luncheon she made a call several miles off driving herself in a lightbrown cart and played several sets of tennis having for her partner a very mild and brainless young curate at dinnertime she and her father met again and when he entered the room he had two slips of orangecolored paper in his hand  well what news she inquired  he handed the telegrams to her without a word and she glanced them through the first was from the bankers       to guy davenant thurwell esq      thurwell court northshire       we consider mr brown a desirable tenant for you from a pecuniary      point of view we know nothing of his family  the other one was from his lawyers       to guy d thurwell esq      thurwell court northshire       mr brown is a gentleman of means and quite in a position to rent      falcons nest we are not at liberty to say anything as to his      antecedents or family  what am i to do asked mr thurwell undecidedly i dont like the end of this last telegram a solicitor ought to be able to say a little more about a client than that  helen considered for a moment she was so little interested in the matter that she found it difficult to make up her mind either way afterwards she scarcely dared think of that moments indecision  perhaps so she said all the same i detest mr chapman i should vote for mr brown  mr brown it shall be then he answered douglas shall write him tomorrow  a fortnight later mr bernard brown took up his quarters at falcons nest     chapter ii  the murder near the falcons nest   i call it perfectly dreadful of those men helen thurwell exclaimed suddenly theyre more than an hour late and im desperately hungry  it is rank ingratitude rachel kynaston sighed i positively cannot sit still and look at that luncheon any longer groves give me a biscuit  they were both seated on low foldingchairs out on the open moorland only a few yards away from the edge of the rugged line of cliffs against which many hundreds of feet below the sea was breaking with a low monotonous murmur close behind them on a level stretch of springy turf a roughly improvised table covered with a cloth of dazzling whiteness was laden with deep bowls of lobster salad pâtes de foie gras chickens truffled turkeys piles of hothouse fruit and many other delicacies peculiarly appreciated at al fresco symposia and a little further away still under the shade of a huge yellow gorse bush were several icepails in which were reposing many rows of goldfoiled bottles the warm sun was just sufficiently tempered by a mild heatherscented breeze and though it flashed gayly upon the glass and silver and danced across the bosom of the blue water below its heat was more pleasant than oppressive the two women who sat there looked delightfully cool helen thurwell especially in her white holland gown with a great bunch of heather stuck in her belt and a faint healthy glow in her cheeks looked as only an english country girl of good birth can lookthe very personification of dainty freshness  there go the guns again she exclaimed listen to the echoes they cant be far away now  there was a little murmur of satisfaction every allowance is to be made for such a keen sportsman as mr thurwell on the glorious twelfth but the time fixed for the rendezvous had been exceeded by more than an hour  i have reached the limit of my endurance rachel kynaston declared getting up from her seat i must either lunch or faint as a matter of choice i prefer the former  they will be here directly miss groves remarked as he completed the finishing touches which he had been putting to the table and stepped back a little to view the effect so far as he was concerned they might come any time now for once his subordinates had not failed him nothing had been forgotten and on the whole he felt that he had reason to be proud of his handiwork  he glanced away inland again shading his eyes with his hand  theyll be coming round the black copse in five minutes he said half to himself james get the other chairs out of the wagon  rachel kynaston was still standing up looking around her suddenly her eyes fell upon a quaintly built cottage perched upon the edge of the cliff about a mile away  i meant to ask you before helen she exclaimed who lives in that extraordinarylooking buildingfalcons nest i think you call it  she moved her parasol in its direction and looked at it curiously a strangelooking abode it certainly was built of yellow stone with a background of stunted fir trees which stretched half way down the cliff side  helen thurwell looked across at it indifferently  i can tell you his name and that is all she answered he calls himself mr brownmr bernard brown  well who is he what does he do  helen shook her head  really i havent the least idea she declared i do not even know what he is like he has been there for two months and we havent seen him yet papa called upon him but he was out he has not returned the call heoh bother mr brown here they come im so glad  they both got up and looked rounding the corner of a long plantation about half a mile away were several men in broken line with their guns under their arms and a little way behind came three keepers carrying bags  rachel kynaston looked at them fixedly  one two three four five she counted one short i dont see geoffrey  helen moved to her side and shaded her eyes with her hand on the fourth finger a half hoop of diamonds which had not been there three months ago was flashing in the sunlight  neither do i she said i wonder where he is  her tone was a little indifferent considering that it was her fiancé who was missing but no one ever looked for much display of feeling from helen thurwell not even the man who called himself her lover indeed her unresponsiveness to his advancesa sort of delicate composure which he was powerless in any way to break throughhad been her strongest attraction to sir geoffrey kynaston who was quite unused to anything of the sort  the men quickened their pace and emptying their guns into the air soon came within hailing distance on that particular day of the year there was only one possible greeting and helen and her companion contented themselves with a monosyllable  well  mr thurwell was in the front rank and evidently in the best of spirits it was he who answered them  capital sport he declared heartily birds a little wild but strong and plenty of them weve made a big bag for only three guns sir geoffrey was in capital form groves open a bottle of heidseck  where is geoffrey asked rachelhis sister  mr thurwell looked round and discovered his absence for the first time  i really dont know he answered a little bewildered he was with us a few minutes ago whats become of sir geoffrey kynaston heggs he asked turning round to one of the gamekeepers  he left us at the top of the black copse sir the man answered he was coming round by the other sideshot a woodcock there once sir he said  they glanced across the moor toward falcons nest there was no one in sight  hes had plenty of time to get round remarked lord lathon throwing down his gun perhaps hes resting  mr thurwell shook his head  no he wouldnt do that he said he was as keen about getting here as any of us hark what was that  a faint sound was borne across the moor on the lazily stirring breeze helen whose hearing was very keen started and the little party exchanged uneasy glances  it must have been a seagull remarked lord lathon who wanted his luncheon very badly indeed wed better not wait for him hell turn up all right geoffrey always does come  he broke off suddenly in his speech and listened there was another sound and this time there was no mistake about it it was the low prolonged howl of a spaniela mournful sound which struck a strange note in the afternoon stillness there was breathless silence for a moment amongst the little group and the becoming glow died out of helens cheek  rachel kynaston was the first to recover herself  had sir geoffrey a dog with him heggs she asked quickly  yes miss the man answered his favorite spaniel had got unchained somehow and found us on the moor i saw her at heel when he left us she was very quiet and sir geoffrey wouldnt have her sent back  then something has happened to him she cried that was fidos howl  has anyone heard his gun mr thurwell asked  there was no one left to answer him they had all started across the moor toward the black patch of spinneys around which sir geoffrey should have come mr thurwell forgetting his fatigue hurried after them and helen after a moments hesitation followed too some distance behind  she ran swiftly but her dress caught often in the prickly gorse and she had to pause each time to release herself soon she found herself alone for the others had all turned the corner of the plantation before she reached it there was a strong sickly sense of coming disaster swelling in her heart and her knees were tottering still she held on her way bravely a few yards before she reached the corner of the plantation she almost ran into the arms of lord lathon who was hurrying back to meet her there was a ghastly shade in his pale face and his voice trembled  miss thurwell he exclaimed in an agitated tone you must not come let me take you back somethinghas happened i am going to rachel come with me  she drew away from him and threw off his restraining arm  no i must see for myself let me pass pleaseat once  he tried again to prevent her but she eluded him a few rapid steps and she had gained the corner there they all were in a little group scarcely a dozen yards away a mist floated before her eyes but she would see she was determined that she would see this thing for herself she struggled on a few steps nearer there was something lying on the grass around which they were all gathered something very much like a human shape ah she could see more plainly now it was sir geoffreysir geoffrey kynaston he was lying half on the grass and half in the dry ditch his white face was upturned to the cloudless sky by his side and discoloring his brown tweed shooting coat was a dark wet stain in the midst of it something bright was flashing in the sunlight  she stood still rooted to the spot with a great horror her pulses had ceased to beat the warm summer day seemed suddenly to have closed in around her there was a singing in her ears and she found herself battling hard with a deadly faintness yet she found words  has heshot himself she cried is it an accident  her father turned round with a little cry and hastened to her side  helen he gasped you should not be here come away child i sent lathon  i will knowwhat it is is it an accident is hedead  he shook his head the healthy sunburnt tan had left his face and he was white to the lips  he has been murdered he faltered foully brutally murdered     chapter iii  mr bernard brown   murder is generally associated in ones mind with darkness the still hours of night and bestiality it is the outcome of the fierce animal lust for blood provoked by low passions working in low minds de quinceys brilliant attempt to elevate it to a place among the fine arts has only enriched its horrors as an abstract idea even detached from its usual environment of darkness and ignorance and vice it is an ugly thing  but here was something quite different such a tragedy as this which had just occurred was possessed of a peculiar hideousness of its own it seemed to have completely laid hold of the little group of men gathered round the body of sir geoffrey kynaston to have bereft them of all reasoning power and thought to have numbed even their limbs and physical instincts it was only a few minutes ago since they had left him careless and debonair with his thoughts intent upon the business or rather the sport of the hour his laugh had been the loudest his enjoyment the keenest and his gun the most deadly of them all but now he lay there cold and lifeless with his hearts blood staining the green turf and his sightless eyes dull and glazed it was an awful thing  physically he had been the very model of an english country gentleman tall and powerful with great broad shoulders and strikingly upright carriage full of vigorous animal life with the slight restlessness of the constant traveler banished by his sudden passion for the girl who had so lately promised to be his wife  she drew a little nearerthey were all too much overcome by the shock of this thing to prevent herand stood with glazed eyes looking down upon him everything even the minutest article of his dress seemed to appeal to her with a strange vividness she found herself even studying the large check of his shootingcoat and the stockings which she had once laughingly admired and which he had ever since worn her eyes rested upon the sprig of heliotrope which with her own fingers she had arranged in his button hole as they had strolled down the garden together just before the start and the faint perfume which reached her where she stood helped her to realize that she was in the thrall of no nightmare but that this thing had really happened she had never loved him she had never even pretended to love him and it was less any sense of personal loss than the hideous sin of it which swept in upon her as she stood there looking down upon him she recognized as she could never have done had he been personally dear to her the ethical horror of the thing the faintness which had almost numbed her senses passed away in that swift battle of many sensations it was anger which survived  her voice first broke the deep awed stillness  who has done this she cried pointing downward  her words were like a sudden awakening to them all they had been standing like figures in a silent tableau stricken dumb and motionless now there was a stir the fire in her tone had dissolved their torpor she was standing on rising ground a little above the rest of them and her attitude together with the gesture by which she enforced her words was full of intense dramatic force the slim undulating beauty of her form was enhanced by the slight disorder of her dress and her redgold hairshe had lost her hatshone and glistened in the sunlight till every thread was shining like burnished gold they themselves were in the shade of the dark pine trees and she standing upon the margin of the moor with the warm sunlight glowing around her seemed like a being of another world afterwards when they recalled that sceneand there was no one there who ever forgot itthey could scarcely tell which seemed the most terrible part to themthe lifeless body of the murdered man with the terrible writing of death in his white face or the tragic figure of helen thurwell the squires cold graceful daughter with her placid features and whole being suddenly transformed with this wave of passion  mr thurwell drew a few steps backward and his keen gray eyes swept the open country round  there was no one in sight when we got here but the blackguard cant be far away he said heggs and you smith and you cook go through the spinney as fast as you can one in the middle and one on each side mind i will go up falcons hill and look round jem run to mallory as fast as you can for dr holmes and on to the police station quick all of you theres not a moment to lose  the desire for action was as strong in them now as had been their former torpor mr thurwell and his daughter were alone in less than a minute  helen i forgot you he exclaimed i cant leave you alone and some one must stay here where is lathon  he has gone on to take rachel home she answered i will stay here i am not afraid quick you can see for miles from the top of the hill and you have your field glass oh do go go  he hesitated but she was evidently very much in earnest  i will just climb the hill and hurry down again he said i cannot leave you here for more than a few minutes if only we had more men with us  he turned away and walked swiftly across the moor toward the hill for a minute or two she stood watching his departing figure then she turned round with a shudder and buried her face in her clasped hands her appearance was less hard now and more natural for a sickly sense of horror at the sight of his body was commencing to assert itself over that first strange instinct of passionate anger it was none the less dreadful to her because in a certain way his removal was a release she had promised to marry this man but there had been scarcely a moment since when she had not found herself regretting it now the sense of freedom which she could not altogether evade was like torture to her she dropped on her knees by his side and took his cold hand in hers a few hours ago she dared not have done this knowing very well that at the caressing touch of her fingers she would have felt his strong arms around her in a passionate and distasteful embrace but there was no fear of this now she would never have to shrink away from him again he was dead  the warm sunlight was glancing among the thickly growing pine trees in the plantation by her side casting quaint shadows on the conestrewn ground across the little piece of broken paling in the bottom of the dry ditch and upon the mossy bank where his head was resting upon a sweetsmelling tuft of heather most of all it flashed and glittered upon the inch or two of steel which still lay buried in his sidea curiously shaped little dagger which although she strove to keep her eyes away from it seemed to have a sort of fascination for her every time her eyes fell upon it she turned away quickly with a little shudder but nevertheless she looked at it more than onceand she remembered it  the deep stillness of the autumn afternoon presently became almost oppressive to her there was the faroff sweet low murmur of a placid sea rolling in upon the base of the cliffs the constant chirping of ground insects and the occasional scurrying of a rabbit through the undergrowth once a great lean rat stole up from the ditch andhorribleran across his body but at the sound of her startled movement it paused sat for a moment quite still with its wideopen black eyes blinking at her and then to her inexpressible relief scampered away she was used to the country with its intense unbroken silence but she had never felt it so hard to bear as on that afternoon time became purely relative to her as a matter of fact she knew afterwards that she could not have been alone more than five minutes it was like an eternity she listened in vain for any human sound even for the faroff sweep of the scythe in the bracken or the call of the laborer to his horses the tension of those moments was horrible  she plucked a handful of bay leaves from the ditch and strove by pressing them against her temple to cool the fever in her blood then she took up once more her position by his side for horrible though the sight of it was his body seemed to have a sort of fascination for her and she could not wander far away from it once or twice she had looked round but there had been no human figure in sight nor any sign of any but as she knelt there on the short turf pressing the cool leaves to her aching forehead she was suddenly conscious of a new sensation without hearing or seeing anything she knew that some one was approaching and stranger still she was conscious of a distinct reluctance to turn her head and see who it was she heard no footsteps the soft stillness was broken by the sound of no human voice she wished to turn round and yet she shrank from it something fresh was going to happensomething was at hand to trouble her she made a great effort and rose to her feet then breaking through her conscious reluctance she turned round  a single figure at that moment on a slightly elevated ridge of the bare moor stood out against the sky he was walking swiftly toward her and yet without any appearance of hurry and from the direction in which he was coming it was evident that he had just left falcons nest this fact and his being unknown to her sufficiently established his identity it was her fathers tenant mr bernard brown     chapter iv  an evil end to an evil life   they say that as a rule the most grotesquely unimportant trifles flash into the mind and engage the last thoughts of a drowning man regarding this in the light of an analogy something of the same sort was now happening to helen thurwell  with her mind steeped in the horror of the last few hours she yet found that she was able afterwards to recall every slight particular with regard to this mans appearance and even his dress she remembered the firm evenness of his movements swift yet free from all ungraceful haste the extreme shabbiness of his coat his illarranged necktie escaped from all restraint of collar and waistcoat and flying loosely behind him his trousers very much turned up and very much frayed and the almost singular height of his loose angular figure his face tooshe remembered that better than anythingwith its pale hollow cheeks and delicate outline deepset dark blue eyes black eyebrows and long unkempt hair which would have looked very much the better for a little trimming a man utterly regardless of his appearance untidy almost slovenly in his attire yet with something about him different from other men  he was within a few yards of her when she saw a sudden change flash into his face as their eyes met he hesitated and a faint color came into his cheeks only to fade away again immediately leaving them whiter than ever there was something in his intense gaze which at that time she had no means of understanding but it was over in a moment he advanced rapidly and stood by her side  she still watched him she could see that his whole frame was vibrating with strong internal emotion as he looked downward on the glazed eyes and motionless form of the murdered man his lips were pallid and his hands were tightly clasped together there was one thing which seemed to her very strange he had not started or exhibited the least sign of surprise at the dreadful sight it was almost as though he had known all about it  this is a terrible thing she said in a low tone breaking the silence between them for the first time you have heard of it i suppose  he dropped down on one knee and bent close over the dead man feeling his heart and pulse in that position his face was hidden from her  no i knew nothing he has been killedlike this  yes  did anyone see it is the man caught  we know nothing she answered we found him like this there was no one in sight  he rose deliberately to his feet her heart was beating fast now and she looked searchingly into his face it told her little he was grave but perfectly composed  how is it that you are alone here he asked does no one else know of this  she moved her head in assent  yes but they have all gone to hunt for the murderer if only you had been looking from your window you would have seen it all  he did not look as though he shared her regret he was standing on the other side of the dead man with his arms folded and his eyes fixed steadily upon the cold white face he seemed to have forgotten her presence  an evil end to an evil life he said slowly to himself and then he added something which she did not hear  you knew him then  he looked at her for a moment fixedly and then down again into the dead mans face  i have heard of him abroad he said sir geoffrey kynaston was a man with a reputation  you will remember that he is dead she said slowly for the scorn in his words troubled her  he bowed his head and was silent watching him closely she could see that he was far more deeply moved than appeared on the surface his teeth were set together and there was a curious faint flush of color in his livid cheeks she followed his eyes wondering they were fixed not upon the dead mans face but on the dagger which lay buried in his heart and the handle of which was still visible  that should be a clue he remarked breaking a short silence  yes i hope to god that they will find the wretch she answered passionately  she looked up at him as she spoke his eyes were traveling over the moor and his hand was shading them  there is some one coming he said we shall know very soon  she followed his rapt gaze and saw three men coming toward them one was her father another the underkeeper and the third was a stranger     chapter v  the inner room at the falcons nest   together they watched the approaching figures helen standing a little apart had the better view  there is my father and heggs and some one whom i do not know she announced quietly i wonder if it is a doctor  he did not answer her she glanced toward him wondering at his silence and rigid attitude his eyes were still bent upon the three men and there was a hard strained look in his white face while she was watching him she saw a spasm of what seemed almost like physical pain pass across his countenance certainly this was no unfeeling man in his way he seemed as deeply moved as she herself was  they were quite close now and she had a good view of the stranger he did not look by any means a person to be afraid of in all her life she thought she had never seen such a handsome old gentlemanand gentleman he most assuredly was his hair was quite white and his beardcarefully trimmed and pointed after the fashion of one of velasquez pictureswas of the same color yet his walk was upright and vigorous and he carried himself with dignity his high forehead and rather long oval face with its delicate clearly cut features had at once the stamp of intellect and benevolence and as though preserved by careful and refined living had still much of the freshness of youth he was dressed in a rough tweed walkingsuit with gaiters and thick boots and carried under his arm a somewhat ponderous book and a botanical specimen case helen felt a womans instinctive liking for him before she had even heard him speak  have you thought us long helen her father exclaimed anxiously we havent seen anything of the scoundrel but heggs was fortunate enough to meet sir allan beaumerville on the moor and he very kindly offered to return  sir allan was on his knees by the body before mr thurwell had finished his sentence they all watched his brief examination  poor fellow poor fellow he exclaimed in a shocked tone that wretched thinglightly touching the handle of the daggeris clean through his heart it was a strong cruel arm that drove that home nothing can be done of course he must have died within a few seconds he rose from his knees and looked around what is to be done with the body he asked it must be removed somewhere sir geoffrey kynaston did you say it was dear me dear me i knew his sister quite well  she is not far away mr thurwell said she and my daughter were awaiting luncheon for us on the cliffs yonder when this horrible thing occurred lathon went back to look for her we were afraid that she might follow us here she was very fond of her brother and he had only just returned home after many years traveling  poor fellow sir allan said softly but about moving him who lives in that queerlooking place yonder  mr thurwell who knew his tenant by sight although they had never spoken looked at him and hesitated sir allan did the same  that is where i live mr brown said slowly if mr thurwell thinks well let him be taken there  he spoke without looking round or addressing any one in particular his back was turned upon the celebrated physician  the nearest place would be best in a case like this sir allan remarked have you sent for any help  some of my men are coming across the moor there mr thurwell said pointing them out they can take a gate off the hinges to carry him on  a little troop of awed servants whom lord lathon had sent down from the court together with some farm laborers whom they had picked up on the way were soon on the spot  mr thurwell gave some brief directions and in a few minutes the high fivebarred gate with private painted across it in white letters was taken from its hinges and the body carefully laid upon it then mr thurwell turned resolutely to his daughter  helen you must go home now he said firmly jackson will take you we can spare him easily  she shook her head  i would rather stay she said quietly i shall not faint or do anything stupid i promise you  sir allan beaumerville looked at her curiously it was a strange thing to him notwithstanding his wide experience to find a girl of her years so little outwardly moved by so terrible a tragedy mr thurwell too was surprised he knew that she had never loved sir geoffrey kynaston but nevertheless he had expected her to show more emotion than this if only for the horror of it all and yet looking at her more closely he began to understandto realize that her calmness was only attained by a strenuous repression of feeling and that underneath it all was something very different though her voice was firm her cheeks were deadly pale and there was a peculiar tightening of the lips and light in her eyes which puzzled him her expression seemed to speak less of passive grief than of some active determinationsome strong desire she had all the appearance of a woman who was bracing herself up for some ordeal nerving herself with all the stimulus of a firm will to triumph over her natural feelings and follow out a difficult purpose mr thurwell scarcely recognized his own daughter she was no longer a somewhat languid beautiful girl looking out upon the world with a sort of petulant indifferencepetulant because with all the high aspirations of a somewhat romantic disposition she could see nothing in it to interest her all that had passed away the warm breath of some awakening force in her nature seemed to have swept before it all her languor and all her petulance they were gone and in their place was a certain air of reserve and thoughtful strength which seems always to cling to those men and women who face the world with a definite purpose before them mr thurwell knitted his brows and had nothing to say  a sad little procession was formed and started slowly for the cottage on the cliff side the four stalwart men stooping beneath their heavy burden and somehow falling into the measured steady tramp common to corpse bearers none of them ever forgot that walk slowly they wound their way around many brilliant patches of deep yellow gorse and purple heather and the warm sunlight glancing across the moor and glittering away over the water threw a strange glow upon the still cold face of their ghastly burden a soft breeze sprung from the sea herald of the advancing eventide following the drowsy languor of the perfect autumnal day the faintly stirred air was full of its quickening exhilaration but it found no human response in their heavy hearts solemn thoughts and silence came over all of them scarcely a word was spoken on the way to their destination  by some chance or at least it seemed like chance helen found herself a few steps behind the others with mr brown by her side they too walked along in unbroken silence his eyes were steadily fixed upon the ground hers were wandering idly across the sparkling blue sea with its foamcrested furrows to the horizon whatever her thoughts were they had changed her expression for the time to a certain extent its late definiteness was gone and a dreamy refined abstraction had taken its place  if i had to die she said half to herself i would choose to die on such a day as this  he raised his dark eyes and looked at her  why  i scarcely know she said hesitatingly and yet in my own mind i do it is so beautiful it seems to give one a sense of peace and hopei cannot explain it it is the sort of thing one feels and feels only  he looked down again  i know what you mean you would fear annihilation less  annihilation is that your creed  sometimes if it were not for scenes like this i might believe it possible he answered slowly as it is i do not the exquisite beauty of the earth denies it i pin my faith to a great analogy the natural world is a reflex of the spiritual and in the natural world there is no annihilation nothing can ever die nor can our souls ever die  she looked at him keenly the dreamy speculation had gone from her eyes the fire of her former purpose had returned  it is well to feel like that you would rather be sir geoffrey kynaston then than his murderer even now  he raised his hand quickly to his forehead as though in pain it was gone in an instant but she had been watching  yes i would he answered fervently sir geoffrey was a wicked man but he may have repented he had his opportunities  how do you know that he was wicked she asked quickly  i heard of him abroadmany years ago will you excuse me miss thurwell i must hurry on and open the door for them  he walked swiftly on leaving her alone when they reached their destination he was there waiting for them  it was a strangely situated and strangely built abode a long low building of deep yellow stone half hidden by various creepers and inaccessible on the side from which they approached it save to foot passengers from the bottom of the winding path which they had to climb it seemed to hang almost sheer over the cliff side a thickly growing patch of stunted pine trees rising abruptly in the background literally overtopped the tiled roof from the summit of this plantation to the sea was one abrupt precipice thickly overgrown for the first hundred feet or so by pine trees growing out from the side of the cliff in strange huddled fashion the haunt of sea birds and a few daring rabbits  they passed in at the handgate and toiled up the steep path threading their way among a wilderness of overgrown box shrubs long dank grass and strange weeds helen with her eyes fixed upon an open window on the right wing of the cottage fell a little behind the others came to a halt before the open door  mr brown met them and preceded them along the passage  i think he had better be carried in here he said motioning toward the room on the lefthand side the side remote from the sea i have brought a sofa  they stood on the threshold and looked in the room was absolutely unfurnished and the shutters had only just been thrown back letting in long level gleams of sunlight which fell upon the bare floor and damp walls from which the discolored paper was commencing to peel off long cobwebs hung from the ceiling waving slowly backward and forward in the unaccustomed draught helen thurwell who had just joined the little group with a curious light in her eyes and a deep spot of color in her pale cheeks looked around and shivered mr thurwell with a landlords instinct began to wonder who was at fault his agent or his tenant  the four men tramped in their footsteps sounding dreary and mournful on the uncarpeted floor and awakening strange rumbling echoes helen looked at them for a moment all clustered round the single sofa which stood in the middle of the apartment and then stepped softly back again into the hall she looked around her eagerly yet with no idle curiosity  the whole interior of the place appeared bare and comfortless there were no rugs in the hall no carpet on the stairs nor a single sign of habitation nor was there any servant about she looked again into the room out of which she had just stepped they were preparing to lift the body from the gate which they had laid upon the floor on to the sofa she stepped back into the hall and listened there was no sound from any other part of the house they were all too deeply engrossed to think of her it was her chance  she was very pale and very resolute the look which had come into her face for so short a time ago had had its meaning the time for action had come it was sooner than she had expected but she was ready  with swift noiseless step she crossed the hall and softly turned the handle of the door on the opposite side it opened at once and she stepped inside she listened again as yet she was undetected she drew a little breath and glanced searchingly around her  this room too was unfurnished save that the floor was covered with cases full of books straight in front of her was another door leading as she knew into a smaller apartment dare she go forward she listened for a moment there was no sound save the low muffled voices of the men who were lifting sir geoffrey on to the couch supposing she were discovered here at the most she would be suspected of a vulgar curiosity it all flashed through her mind in a moment and her decision was taken gathering her skirts in her hand lest they should catch against the edges of the cases she threaded her way through them and stood before the door of the inner room she tried the handle it yielded easily to her touch she had gone too far to draw back now in a moment she had passed the threshold and the whole contents of the little room were disclosed to her  of all the senses the eyes seem to carry the most lasting impression to the brain one eager glance around and the whole seemed photographed into her memory a little strip of faded carpet only half covering the floor piles upon piles of books and a small table littered all over with foolscap a few fine prints and etchings roughly hung upon the walls a group of exquisite statuettes all huddled together and an oak cabinet strongly bound with brass claspsthey were the things she chiefly remembered the whole room was in the wildest disorder as though the contents had been just shot inside and left to arrange themselves  after that single cursory glance helen looked no more around her her whole attention was riveted upon the window exactly opposite as she had seen from the outside it was wide open and several branches of a shrub growing up against it were broken off from the leaves of the same shrub several drops of water were hanging and on the ground below was a wet patch she looked back into the room again in one corner was an empty basin and by its side rolled up tightly was a rough towel  before she could make any movement in that direction another thing struck her on a certain spot close by the side of the basin a pile of books was arranged in disorderly fashion enough but with some little method an idea flashed in upon her they were arranged in that manner to hide something upon the floor  she made a quick motion forward then she stopped short and lifted her eyes to the door her cheeks burned and her heart beat fast sir allan beaumerville was standing on the threshold looking at her in mute amazement and over his shoulder was the pale stern face of mr brown     chapter vi  a terrible enemy   afterwards helen looked back upon those few moments as the most uncomfortable of her life she was caught in the very act of a most unwarrantable and even immodest intrusion which in the eyes of these two men could only appear like the attempted gratification of a reprehensible and vulgar curiosity she made one spasmodic attempt to kindle her suspicions into a definite accusation to stand upon her dignity and demand an explanation of what she had seen but she failed utterly directly she tried to clothe the shreds of this idea of hers with words and to express them she seemed to vividly realize the almost ludicrous improbability of the whole thing one glance into the pale dignified face which was bent upon her full of unconcerned surpriseand hateful to her with a gentle shade of pity at her confusion already creeping into itand her attempt collapsed she felt her cheeks burn with shame and her eyes drooped before his steady gaze she began to long feverishly for something to dissolve the situation the silence was dreadful to her but she could think of nothing to say it was mr brown at last who spoke  i was afraid you would not be able to find your way miss thurwell he said quietly i must apologize for asking you to come into such a den the small engraving on the wall is the proof bartolozzi i spoke to you about the head is perfect is it not some day i should like to show you my guido i am afraid just now i could not expect you to appreciate them  she murmured somethingwhat she scarcely knew and he did not appear to hear the cold surprise disappeared from sir allans face evidently he believed in mr browns mercifully offered explanation of her presence here  what are you an enthusiast miss thurwell he exclaimed well well i was worse myself once in my younger days before my profession made a slave of me surely that is a genuine velasquez mr brown upon my word fancy coming across such a treasure here  he picked his way across the disorderly chamber and adjusting his eyeglass stood looking at the picture helen made a hasty movement towards the door and mr brown followed her into the adjoining room  if i had known that i was to be honored by a visit from a lady he said i would have endeavored  she turned suddenly round upon him with flaming cheeks  dont she interrupted almost beseechingly mr brown you were very good to me just then thank you i was most abominably rude to go into that room without your permission  her eyes were fixed upon the floor and her distress was evident it was clear that she felt her position acutely  pray say no more about it he begged earnestly it isnt worth a second thought  she stopped with her back to one of the great cases filled with books and hesitated should she confess to him frankly why she had gone there and ask his pardon for such a wild thought she raised her eyes slowly and looked at him of course it was absurd she has been out of her mind she knew that now and yet  she looked at him more closely still he had not seemed in any way disturbed when they had found her in that roomonly a little surprised and bewildered and yet after all supposing his composed demeanor had been only assumed he was certainly very pale very pale indeed and there was a slight twitching of his hands which was out of character with his absolute impassiveness supposing it should be a forced composure he looked like a man capable of exercising a strong control over his feelings supposing it should be so was there not after all just a chance that her former suspicions were correct  the action of the mind is instantaneous all these thoughts and doubts merely flashed through it and they left her very confused and undecided her sense of gratitude towards him for shielding her before sir allan beaumerville and the intuitive sympathy of her nature with the delicacy and tact which he had shown in his manner of doing so were on the whole stronger than her shadowy suspicions and yet these latter had just sufficient strength to check the impulse of generosity which prompted her to confess everything to him she did not tell him why she had started on the quest which had come to such an ignominious conclusion she offered him no explanation whatever  it was very good of you she repeated i did not deserve it at all and now i must go and look for my father  mr thurwell was waiting in the hall somewhat surprised at her absence but he asked no questions his thoughts were too full of the terrible thing which had happened to his friend and neighborand withal his daughters betrothed  they walked back across the moor together saying very little for there was only one possible subject for conversation and both of them shrank a little from speaking about it but when they were more than halfway to their destination she asked a question  nothing has been discovered i suppose of the murderer  her father shook his head  nothing the dagger is our only clue as yetexcept this  he drew a folded piece of paper from his pocket and touched it lightly with his finger  what is it may i see  he handed it to her at once  it was in his pocket he said i am keeping it to hand over to the proper authorities mr brown offered to take care of it but i felt that as a magistrate i was in a measure responsible for everything in the shape of a clue so i brought it away with me read it  she opened the half sheet of notepaper and glanced down it it was written in a queer cramped handwritingevidently disguised  sir geoffrey kynaston you are doing a very rash and foolish thing in coming back to your own country and thereby publishing your whereabouts to the world have you forgotten what hangs over youor can you be so mad as to think that he has forgiven read this as a warning and if life is in any way dear to you go back to that hiding which alone has kept you safe for so many years do not hesitate or delay for one halfhourone minute may be too long if after reading this you linger in england and disregard my warning take care that you look into your life and hold yourself prepared to die  she gave it back to him there was some one then whom he had injured very deeply it was like an echo from that stormy past of which many people had spoken  he had an enemy she murmured passing her arm through her fathers  it seems so he answered a terrible enemy     chapter vii  helen thurwells suspicions   on a certain september day about six weeks after the funeral of sir geoffrey kynaston mr brown was spending what appeared to be a very pleasant afternoon he was lying stretched out at full length on a dry mossy bank with a volume of shelley in his hand and a case of thick egyptian cigarettes by his side in his ears was the whispering of the faint breeze amongst the pines and the soft murmuring of the sea hundreds of feet below seen like a brilliant piece of patchwork through the fluttering leaves and dark treetrunks which surrounded him there was nothing to disturb the sweet silence of the drowsy afternoon it was a charming spot which he had chosen and he was quite alone people amongst whom for the last few weeks his name had become a fruitful source of conversation were already beginning to fancy him flying across the country in an express train or loitering on the docks at liverpool waiting for an atlantic liner or sitting at home trembling and fearful struggling to hide his guilt beneath a calm exterior but as a matter of fact he was doing none of these things the harsh excitement of the busy gossips and their stern judgment troubled him nothing for he was unconscious of them he was away in thoughtland dreaming of a fair proud young face seen first on the rude pavement of an old italian town where its sweet composed freshness amongst a pile of magnificent ruins had captivated his artists sense almost before it had touched his mans heart he thought of the narrow street shutting in the sky till looking upwards it seemed like one deep band of glorious blueof the ruined grey palace with still some traces left of its former stately grace and of the fountain playing in the mossencrusted courtyard gleaming like silver in the sunlight as it rose and fell into the worn stone basin here where the very air seemed full of the records of a magnificent decay everything seemed to form a fitting framework in his memory for that one face it had been an artists dreamor had it been the mans never the latter he told himself sadly such were not for him it had been better far that he had never seen her again before the memory had been a very sweet one stored away in his mind amongst all the great and beautiful things he had seen in his wanderings always with a dainty freshness clinging to it as though it had lain carefully preserved in perfume and spices was this new joy of having seen and spoken to her a better thing this vague unsettlement of his being which played havoc with his thoughts and stirred up a whole host of strange new feelings in his heart surely not it seemed to him like the breathing of warm new life into what had been a crystallized emotionthe humanizing of something spiritual surely for him it had better have remained in that first stage  there was the sound of a light footstep on the springy turf he started to his feet a girl tall and slim was coming swiftly along the winding path through the plantation towards him he knew at once that it was helen thurwell  they were both equally surprised as she looked up and saw him standing upright in the narrow path tall thin and unnaturally pale with the cigarette still burning between his fingers and his book in his other hand she felt strangely stirred neither was he unmoved by her sudden appearance for though not a feature twitched not a single gleam of color relieved the still pallor of his face there was a new light in his dry brilliant eyes but there was a vast difference between the thoughts which flashed into his mind and those which filled hers to him there had stolen a sweetness into the summers day surpassing the soft sunlight and a presence which moved every pulse in his being and crept like maddening fire through every sense and to her the sight of him was simply a signal to brace up all her powers of perception to watch with suspicion every change of his features and every tone of his voice had he shown any emotion at the sight of her she would have attributed it to a guilty conscience and would have made note of it in her mind against him and as he showed nonenone at least that she could detectshe put it down to the exercise of a strong will and was a little disappointed for she had gone with the tide and womanlike having embraced an idea it had already become as truth to her mr brown was the man who had murdered sir geoffrey kynaston it was a murderer with whom she was standing side by side among the glancing shadows of the rustling pine groves it must be so  yet she did not shrink from him after her first hesitation at the sight of a mans figure standing up amongst the dark treetrunks she had walked steadily on until she had reached him and he without any change of countenance had simply stood and watched her god how beautiful she was the sunlight gleaming through the tops of the trees in long slanting rays played like fire upon her redgold hair and the plain black gown which yielded easily to her graceful movements seemed to show every line of her supple yet delicate figure she came nearer still so near that he could trace the faint blue veins in her forehead and once more recall the peculiar color of her eyes then he spoke to her raising his hand with a suddenly returning instinct of conventionality for his cap but he had risen without it and was standing before her bareheaded  i am a trespasser i fear he said hesitatingly  she came to a standstill by his side and shook her head slowly  no this is common land there is a footpath you see although it is seldom used it leads nowhere but to the court  it is a favorite walk of mine he said  yes it is pleasant you bring a companion with you she remarked pointing to his book  he glanced down at it and then up at her again  yes a faithful friend too we spend a good deal of time out of doors together  she read the title and glanced up at him with a shade of interest in her face  shelley was a great poet i suppose she said but i do not understand him  for the first time his expression changed a sudden light swept across his face and in a moment it was glowing with sensibility and enthusiasm she looked at him astonished he stood before her revealed in a new light and although unwillingly she saw him with different eyes  not understand shelley ah but that is because you have not tried then if you had you would not only understand but you would love him  she shook her head in reality she felt that he was right that her languid attempts to read him by a drawingroom fire with the queen beside her and her mind very full of very little things had not been the spirit in which to approach a great poet but partly out of womanly perversity and partly out of curiosity to hear what he would say she chose to dissent from him  i find him too mystical she said too incomprehensible  he looked down at her from his superior height with kindling eyes it was odd how greatly she was surprised in him she had imagined him to be a cynic  mystical he repeated yes in a certain sense he is so and it is his greatest charm but incomprehensibleno the essence of all artistic poetry is in the perfect blending of matter and form so that the meaning creeps in upon us but with a certain vagueness a certain indefiniteness which reaches us more in the shade of a dreamy consciousness than through the understanding may i give you an illustration we stand upon a low plain and gaze upon a faroff range of hills from the sides of which thick clouds of white mist are hanging gradually as the sun rises higher in the heavens they float away and we begin dimly to see through a clearer atmosphere the yellow corn waving on the brown hillside the smoke rising from the lonely farmhouse and if we have patience and wait still byandby we can even distinguish the brilliant patches of wild flowers the poppies and the cornflowers in the golden fields and the marsh marigolds in the meadows at the foot of the hill it is a question of waiting long enough so it is with what people call mysticism in poetry  for the first time for many months a faint color had found its way into his wan cheeks his face was alight with interest and his dark eyes shone from their deep hollows with a new soft fire from that moment he assumed a new place in her thoughts she was loath to grant it to him but she had no alternative guilty or innocent this man had something in him which placed him high above other men in her estimation she felt stirred in a manner peculiarly grateful to her it was as though every chord of her being had been tuned into fresh harmony as though the hand of a magician had lifted the curtain which had enclosed her too narrow life and had shown her a new world glowing with beauty and promise she too wanted to feel like that to taste the pleasures which this man tasted and to feel the enthusiasm which had lit up his pale scholarly face  at that moment her mind was too full to harbor those dark suspicions with a sudden effort she threw them overboard trampled on them scouted them was this the face and the tongue of a murderer surely not  thank you she said softly i shall like to think over what you have said now i must go  her words seemed to bring him back to his old self he stooped down and picked up his cap  you are going back to the court he asked let me walk to the end of the plantation with you  she assented silently and they turned along the narrow path side by side below them a brackencovered cliff studded with dwarfed trees ran down to the sea and on their left hand the black firs larger and growing more thickly together shut out completely the open moorland beyond he had walked there before beneath a sky of darker blue and when there had been only stray gleams of moonlight shining through the coneladen boughs to show him the rough path and he had been there when the treetops had bent beneath the shrieking wind when the black clouds had been flying over his head and the roar of the angry sea had filled the air with thunder and these things had stirred himone of natures sonsin many ways yet none of them had sent the warm blood coursing through his veins like quicksilver or had stolen through his senses with such sweet heartstirring impetuosity as did the presence of this tall fair girl walking serenely by his side in thoughtful silence once when too near the edge of the cliff she put her foot on a fircone and stumbled and the touch of her hand as he caught hold of it to steady her sent a thrill of keen exquisite pleasure through his whole frame he held it perhaps a little longer than necessary and she let him for the moment she had lost the sense of physical touch and the firm grasp of his fingers upon hers seemed to her in a certain sense only an analogy to the sudden sympathy which had sprung up between them even when realization came she drew her hand away gently without anger without undue haste even one glance into his face at that moment would have told her everything the whole horror of the situation would have flashed in upon her and she would have been overwhelmed but she did not look and long before they had come to the end of the path the passionate light had died out from his eyes and had left no trace behind once more he was only a plain sadlooking man holloweyed and hollowcheeked with bent head and stooping frame     chapter viii  did you kill sir geoffrey kynaston   at the extremity of the plantation they came to a small wicketgate opening out on to the cliff top from here there was a path inland to the court whilst falcons nest was straight in front of them at the parting of the ways they hesitated for it seemed necessary that they should part  and whilst they looked around a little dazzled having just emerged from the darkness of the plantation they were conscious of a new glory in the heavens far away across the moorland the autumn sun had shot its last rays over the level plain and sea and had sunk quietly to rest it was not one of turners wild sunsets there were no banks of angry clouds full of lurid coloring flashing their glory all over the western sky but in a different fashion it was equally beautiful long level streaks of transparent light emerging from an ethereal green to a deep orange lay stretched across the heavens and a faint golden haze rising from the land seemed to mingle with them and form one harmonious mass of coloring and the air too was differentpurer and rarer than the enervating atmosphere of the drowsy afternoon together they stood and became subject to the subtle charm of their environment it seemed to helen thurwell then that a change was creeping into her life impersonal thought had attained a new strength and a new sweetness but at that time she had no knowledge of what it meant  see he exclaimed softly pointly westward there is what coleridge made dear to us for ever and byron vainly scoffed atthe green light that lingers in the west  he repeated the stanza absently and half to himself with a sudden oblivion of her presence      it were a vain endeavor      though i should gaze for ever      on that green light that lingers in the west      i may not hope from outward forms to win      the passion and the life whose fountains are within  she watched him as his voice sank lower and lower and though his eyes were dry and bright she saw a look of intense sadness sweep across his face almost she felt inclined to let her natural sympathy escape herto let loose the kind and tender words which had leapt up from her heart and even trembled upon her lips but a rush of consciousness came and she choked them back thus much she could do but no more she could not at that moment look upon him as the man already suspected in many quarters of a most brutal murder for the instant all was blotted out had she tried she could not at that moment have revived her own suspicions they seemed to her like some grotesque fungi of the mindpoisonous weeds to be crushed and destroyed but the seed was there  those are the saddest lines i ever read she said quietly it is a true ode to dejection  and therefore they are very precious he answered it is always sweet to find your own emotions so exquisitely expressed it is like a spiritual narcotic  and yetyet such poems encourage sadness and that is morbid  he shook his head  to be sad is not necessarily to be unhappy he answered that sounds like a paradox but it isnt you remember the gentle melancholy which milton loved there is something sweet in that is there not  but it is not like that with you she said quickly  he threw his arms up into the air with a sudden wild gesture of absolute despair she had touched a chord in his nature too roughly and it had not stood the strain for a moment he had thrown off his mask his white face was ghastly and his eyes were burning with a hopeless passion  my god no he cried i am in the depths of hell with never a gleam of hope to lead me on and the sinthe sin  he stopped suddenly and his hands fell to his side slowly he turned round and looked at her half doubtfully half fearfully what had he said what had she heard what did that look in her face meanthat look of anguish of fear of horror why did she not speak even though it were to accuse him anything rather than that awful silence  twice she moved her white lips but no sound came the power of articulation seemed gone then she caught him by the arm and turned him slowly round so that he faced his cottage only a few yards below them was the spot where she and her sisterinlaw that was to have been had lolled in their low chairs by the luncheontable and had begun to feel impatient for the coming of one who had never come further away still across the moor was that dark circular patch of plantation behind which sir geoffrey kynaston had been found and away upon the cliffs overlooking the scene of the murder was falcons nest  the grasp on his arm tightened then she stretched out her other hand and with shaking fingers pointed downwardspointed to the very spot where the deed had been done the memory of it all came back to her and hardened her set white face she looked him straight in the eyes without a quiver and clenched her teeth  did youdo that she asked in a firm hard tone  a curious mind slumber seemed to have crept over him his eyes followed her outstretched hand and his lips idly repeated her words  did you kill sir geoffrey kynaston  her words fell sharp and clear upon the still air a tremor passed through his whole frame and the light of a sudden understanding flashed across his face he was his old self again and more than his old self  you are joking of course miss thurwell he said quietly you do not mean that seriously  she caught her breath and looked at him after all it is only a step from tragedy to commonplace he was deathly pale but calm and composed he had conquered himself just in time another moment and she felt assured that she would have known all never mind it should come she told herself the end was not yet  no of course i did not mean it seriously she repeated slowly who are those men coming up the hill can you see  he moved a little nearer to her and looked downward on the slope of the hill were three men she had recognized them already and she watched him steadily  your father is one he said quietly the other two are strangers to me  perhaps i can tell you something about them she said still watching him intently one is the constable from mallory and the other is a detective  there was a slight hardening of his face and she fancied that she saw his under lip quiver for a moment had he shown any guilty fear had he shrunk back or uttered a single moan her sympathy would never have been aroused but as it was she was a woman and her face softened and the tears stood in her eyes there was something almost grand in the composure with which he was waiting for what seemed inevitablesomething of the magnificent resignation with which the noblemen of france one by one took their place at the block and the simile was heightened by the slightly contemptuous slightly defiant poise of his finely shaped head she saw him cast one lingering glance around at the still sea with its faroff motionless sails at the clear sky from which the brilliancy of coloring was fading away and at the long sweep of moorland with its brilliant patches of heather and gorse now slightly blurred by the mists rising from the earth it was as though he were saying a last farewell to things which he had loved and which he would see no moreand it had a strange effect upon her the memory of that hideous crime left her she could think only of the abstract pathos of the present situation and she felt very miserable it was wrong unnatural of her but at that moment if she could have helped him to escape she would have done her best in the face of them all  they were almost at hand now and she lifted her eyes in which the tears were fast gathering she thought nothing of her own situationof their finding her alone with the murderer with characteristic unselfishness she thought only of him  she met her fathers surprised gaze with indifference she had a sort of feeling that nothing mattered much what was going to happen eclipsed everything else  and so it did her apathy changed in a moment to amazement and her heart stood still her father had raised his hat to mr brown with even more than the usual courtesy of his salute and the two officials had saluted in the most correct fashion  mr brown he said we have all come in search of you to tender our most sincere apologies for an unfortunate mistake police constable chopping here is mostly to blame and next to him i am  she glanced at the man by her side his face was absolutely impenetrable it showed no signs of the relief which was creeping into hers his composure was simply wonderful  the fact is her father continued chopping came to see me with a long tale and a certain request which under the circumstanceswhich i will explain to you afterwardsi could not as a magistrate refuse i was compelled to sign a search warrant for him to go over falcons nest it was against my inclination and a most unpleasant duty for me to perform but i considered it my duty and i attended there myself in order that it might not be abused i hope to have your forgiveness for the liberty which we were compelled to take  there was still no change in mr browns face but standing close to him she heard him take a quick deep breath curiously enough it was a relief to her to hear it such great selfrestraint was almost unnatural  you only did your duty mr thurwell he answered quietly you owe me no apology  i am very glad that you see it in that light mr thurwell said very glad indeed but i have a further confession to make  he drew mr brown a little on one side out of hearing of the others but nearer to her than any of them and commenced talking earnestly to him this time she could tell that he was disturbed and uneasy but she could not follow connectedly all her father said only a few stray words reached her  very sorry indeed quite accidental will preserve  discovery  then i may rely upon you to keep this absolutely to yourself she heard mr brown say earnestly  i give you my word sir her father answered then they turned round and she saw that mr brown looked distinctly annoyed  however did you come here helen her father asked suddenly remembering her presence  i came for a walk and met mr brown in the plantation she explained  well since you are here he remarked good humoredly you must help me to induce mr brown to come back to the court so far we have been wretched neighbors we shall insist upon his dining with us just to show that theres no illfeeling he added smiling now no excuses  thank you but i never go out mr brown answered i have not even any clothes here so  please come mr brown she said softly  he flashed a sudden glance at her from his dark eyes which brought the color streaming into her cheeks fortunately twilight was commencing to fall and she was standing a little back in the shadow of the plantation  if miss thurwell wishes it he said in a tone of a man who offers himself to lead a forlorn hope it is settled i will come     chapter ix  mr brown dines at the court   both to him and to her there was something strangely unreal in the little banquet to which they threemr thurwell his daughter and his tenantsat down that evening for many months afterwards until indeed after the culmination of the tragedy in which she was the principal moving figure helen thurwell looked back upon that night with strangely mingled feelings it was the dawn of a new era in her existence a fact which she never doubted although she struggled vainly against it and to him it was like a sudden transition into fairyland the long years of lonely life and rigorous asceticism through which he had passed had been a period of no ordinary selfdenial instinctively and with his whole nature the man was an artist his homely fare illcooked and illserved among dreary surroundings had for long been a horror to him whatever his reasons for such absolute isolation had been they had sprung from no actual delight in rough living or nonappreciation of the refinements of civilized society he realized to the full extent the sybaritic pleasures which now surrounded him the white tablecloth flaming with daintily modeled plate and cut glass the brilliant coloring of the scarlet and yellow flowers the aromatic perfume of the chrysanthemums mingling with the faint scent of exotics the luscious fruits and the softly shaded table lights which threw a rich glow over the lovely face opposite to himall these things had their own peculiar effect in the shape of a certain subtle exhilaration which was not slow to show itself with scarcely an effort he threw off the old mask of reserve with all the little awkwardnesses and gaucheries which it had entailed and appeared as the shadow of the self of former daysa cultured polished man of the world even mr thurwells good breeding was scarcely sufficient to conceal his surprise at the metamorphosis never before at his table had there been such a brilliant flow of conversationconversation which had all the rare art of appearing general whereas it was indeed nothing less than a monologue on the part of this strange guest he had traveled far he had seen great things in many countries and he had known great men and he talked lightly about them all with the keen appreciation of the artist and the graceful diction of the scholar he was a man who had lived in the worldevery little action and turn of speech denoted it the french dishesmr thurwell was proud of his chefwere no secret to him and he knew all about the vintages of the wines he was drinking in the whole course of his experience mr thurwell had never entertained such a guest as this and it was a sore trial to his good manners to abstain from any astonished comment on the lonely life his tenant had been lately leading  and helen sat listening to it all with a sort of dreamy content stealing over her out of which she was stirred every now and then into enthusiasm by some brilliant criticism or fresh turn to the conversation at such times her gray luminous eyes with their strange dash of foreign color would light up and flash their sympathetic approval across the few feet of tablecloth blazing with manycolored flowers and fruits and glittering silver and he grew to look for this and to receive it with an answering glance from his own dark eyes full of a strange light and power she watching him more keenly than her father could was conscious of something that altogether escaped him a sort of undercurrent of suppressed excitement which never rose to the surface and revealed itself in none of his mannerisms or his tone but it was there and she felt itfelt it more than ever when their eyes met and hers were forced to droop before the steady fire in his which more than once brought the faint color into her cheeks and sent a new sensation quivering through her being  dinner came to an end at last but when she rose to go her father protested she generally sat with him while he smoked a cigarette and drank his coffee why should she go away now they were making no stranger of mr brown and so she stayed  presently she found herself strolling round the room by his side showing him the pictures which hung lightly upon the high oak panels and the foreign bricàbrac and italian vases ranged along the wide black ledge a little below her father had been obliged to go out and speak to the head gamekeeper about some suspected poaching and they were alone  this is where i like to sit after dinner when we are alone she said and lifting some heavy drooping curtains she led him into a quaint recess almost as large as an ordinary room a shaded lamp was burning on a small burmese table and the faint fragrance of burning pine logs stole up from the open hearth and floated about on the air already slightly perfumed with the odor of chrysanthemums clustered together in quaint blue china bowls little patches of goldandwhite coloring where everything else was somber and subdued she sank into a low basket chair before the fire and obeying her gesture he seated himself opposite to her  now talk to me please she said half hiding her face with a feather screen to protect it from the fire no commonplacisms mind i have heard nothing else all my life and i am weary of them and first please to light a cigarette you will find some in the silver box by your side i like the perfume  he did as he was bidden in silence for a moment he watched the faint blue smoke curl upward stole a glance around him and drew a long breath as though he were drinking in to the full the artistic content of the exquisite harmony and coloring of his surroundings then he threw a sudden swift look upon the beautiful girl who was leaning back in her low chair with her fair head resting upon a cushion of deep olive green and her eyes fixed expectantly upon him she was so near that by stretching out his hand he could have seized her small shapely fingers so near that he could even detect the delicate scent of lavender from the lace of her black dinner gown he took in every detail of her dainty toilette from the single diamond which sparkled in the black velvet around her throat to the exquisitely slippered feet resting lightly upon a tiny sagegreen footstool and just visible through the gossamerlike draperies which bordered her skirts in the world of her sex she had become an era to him     chapter x  the tragedy of rachel kynaston   i wonder whether you know that we have met before miss thurwell he asked her suddenly  she moved her screen and looked at him  surely not where  in a few words he reminded her of that quaint street in the old italian town and of the halfruined palazzo di vechi he had seen her only for a few minutes but her face had never been forgotten the way in which he told her so although he did not dwell upon it told her also that it had been no ordinary memorythat it had held a separate place in his thoughts as was indeed the case something in the manner of his allusion to it showed her too as though he had laid his whole mind bare with what interest almost reverence he had guarded it and all that it had meant to him and as she listened a faint color stole into her cheeks with which the fire had nothing to do she held her screen the closer and bent her head lest he should see it  but there was no fear of that indeed he had no thought of the kind leaving the dangerous ground behind him he glided easily and naturally into impersonal subjects from italy he began to talk of florence of pico della mirandola and the painters of the renaissance he strove his utmost to interest her and with his vast stock of acquired knowledge and his wonderfully artistic felicity of expression he talked on and on wandering from country to country and age to age till it all seemed to her like a strangely beautiful poem full of yellow light and gleaming shadow sometimes passionate and intense at others fantastic and almost ethereal now and then she half closed her eyes and his words and their meaning the form and the substance seemed to come to her like richly blended music stirring all her senses and quickening all her dormant faculties then she opened them again and looked steadily upon the dark wan face with its sharp thin outline and strange poetic abstraction by chance he spoke for a moment of de quincey and a shudder passed through all her being could such a face as that be a murderers face the utter morbidness of such a thought oppressed her only for a moment if tomorrow it was to be her duty to loathe this man then it should be so but those few minutes were too precious to be disturbed by such thoughts a new life was stirring within her and its first breath was too sweet to be crushed on the threshold after tonightanything but tonight she would have for her own  and so the time passed on and the evening slipped away mr thurwell had looked in but seeing them so engrossed he had quietly retreated and indulged in his usual nap a dainty tea equipage had been brought in and she had roused herself to prepare it with her own hands and it seemed to him that this little touch of domesticity had been the one thing wanted to make the picture perfect there had been a momentary silence then and she had found herself asking him questions  do you never feel that you would like to be back in the world again she asked yours is a very lonely life  i do not often find it so he answered with his eyes fixed upon the fire ones books and the thoughts one gets from them are sufficient companions  but they are not human ones and man is human do you think a lonely life quite healthymentally healthy i mean  it should be the healthiest of all lives it is only in theory that solitude is morbid if you knew more of the world miss thurwell you would understand something of its cramping influence upon all independent thought i am not a pessimistat least i try not to be i do not wish to say that there is more badness than goodness in the world but there is certainly more littleness than greatness to live in any manner of society without imbibing a certain form of selfishness is difficult to do so and to taste the full sweetness of the life that never dies is impossible  but there must be some exceptions she said hesitatingly if people care for one another and care for the same things  he shook his head  people never do care for one another life is so full nowadays there are so many things to care about that any concentration of the affections is impossible love is the derision of the modern world it has not even the respect one pays to the antique  for several minutes there was deep silence a piece of burning wood tumbled off from the log and fell upon the tiles where it lay with its delicate blue smoke curling upward into the room laden with the pungent odor of the pine she moved her feet and there was the slight rustling of her skirts no other sound broke the stillness which they both remembered for long afterwardsthe stillness before the storm  suddenly it came to an end there was a sound of doors being quickly opened and shut voices in the hall and then a light firm tread crossing the main portion of the room they both glanced toward the curtains and there was a seconds expectancy then they were thrown on one side with a hasty movement and a tall dark woman in a long traveling cloak swept through them  she paused for a moment on the threshold and her flashing black eyes seemed to take in every detail of the little scene she saw helen fair and comely with an added beauty in her soft animated expression and she saw her companion his face alight with intelligence and sensibility and with the glow of a new life in his brilliant eyes the perfume of the egyptian tobacco which hung about the room the tea tray their two chairs drawn up before the firenothing escaped her it all seemed to increase her wrath  for she was very angry her form was dilated with passion and her voice when she spoke shook with it but it was not her anger nor her threatening gestures before which they both shrank back for a moment appalled it was her awful likeness to the murdered sir geoffrey kynaston  helen she cried they told me of this but if i had not seen it with my own eyes i would never have believed it  helen rose to her feet pale but with a kindling light in her eyes and a haughty poise of her fair shapely head  you speak in riddles rachel she said quietly i do not understand you  a very storm of hysterical passion seemed to shake the woman who had approached a little further into the room  not understand me listen and i will make it plain you were engaged to marry my brother i come here almost from his funeral and i find you thuswith his murderer girl i wonder that you do not die of shame  his murderer for a moment the color fled from cheeks and lips and the room seemed whirling around her but one glance at him brought back her drooping courage he was standing close to her side erect and firm as a statue with his head thrown back and his eyes fixed upon rachel kynaston blanched and colorless as his face was there was no flinching in it  it is false she said proudly ask him yourself  ask him she turned upon him like a tigress her eyes blazing with fury let him hear what i have to say and deny it is it not you who followed him from city to city all over the world seeking always his life is it not you who kept him for many years from his native land for fear of bloodshedyours or his is it not you who have fought with him and been worsted and sworn to carry your enmity with you through life and bury it only in his grave look at me man if you dare look me in the face and tell me whether you did not seek his life in vienna and whether you did not fight with him on the sands at boulogne oh i know you it is you it is you and then you come down here and live alone waiting your chance he is found foully murdered and you are the only man who could have done it ask you whether you be guilty there is no need no need can anyone in their senses knowing the story of your past hate doubt it for one moment and yet answer me if you can look me in the face and let me hear you lie if you dare tell me that you know nothing of my brothers death  he had stood like marble with never a change in his face while she had poured out her passionate accusation but when silence came and she waited for him to speak he could not a seal seemed set upon his lips he could not open them he was silent  a fearful glare of triumph blazed up in her eyes she staggered back a little and leaned upon the table with her hand clasped to her side  see helen she cried is that innocence o god give me strength to go on i will see mr thurwell i will tell him everything he shall sign a warrant ah  a terrible scream rang through the room and echoed through the house mr thurwell and several of the servants came hurrying in in the middle of the floor rachel kynaston lay prostrate her fingers grasping convulsively at the empty air and an awful look in her face helen was on her knees by her side and mr brown stood in the background irresolute whether to stay or leave  they crowded round her but she waved them off and grasping helens wrist dragged her down till their heads nearly touched  helen she moaned i am dying swear to me that you will avenge geoffreys murder that man did it his namehis name  suddenly her grasp relaxed and helen reeled back fainting into her fathers arms  it is a fit some one murmured  but it was death     chapter xi  levy  son private agents   anything in the letters guvnor  nothing so far ben my boy answered a little old gentleman who was methodically opening a pile of envelopes and carefully scrutinizing the contents of each before arranging them in separate heaps nothing much yet a letter from a despairing mother entreating us to find her lost son description given paymenttick wont do heres a note from mr wallis about his wifes being at the theater the other night and a line from jack simpson about that woman down st johns wood way seems hes found her so thats off  humph business is slack remarked a younger edition of the old gentleman who was standing on the hearth rug with his silk hat on the back of his head in an attitude of unstudied grace  say guvnor you couldnt let me have a fiver could you must keep up the credit of the firm dont you know and im awfully hard up pon my word i am  i couldnt do anything of the sort exclaimed the old gentleman testily certainly not the way you spend money is grievous to me benjamin positively grievous  he turned round in his chair and with his spectacles on the top of his head surveyed his son and heir with a sorrowful interest  oh hang it all some one must spend the money if were to keep the business at all retorted mr benjamin testily i cant live as i do without it you know and how are we to get the information we want look at the company i keep too  the old gentleman seemed mollified  theres something in that ben he remarked slowly wagging his head theres something in that of course bless me your mother was telling me you was with a lord the other day  mr benjamin expanded a little with the recollection and smiled gently  that was quite true dad he remarked with a grandiloquent air i was just going into the crilet me see on tuesday night it waswhen whom should i run up against but little tommy soampton with a pal and we all had drinks together he was a quietlooking chap not dressed half so well aser  as you ben interposed his father proudly  well i wasnt thinking of myself particularly mr benjamin continued twirling an incipient mustache and looking pleased but when tommy introduced him as lord mossford i was that surprised i nearly dropped my glass  what did you say to him ben asked the little old gentleman in an awed tone  ben drew himself up and smiled  i asked him how his lordship was and whether his lordshipd take anything  and did he ben asked his father eagerly  rather he was just as affable as you like i got on with him no end  the little old gentleman turned away to his letters again to hide a gratified smile  well well ben i suppose you must have

grinned  no fear dad i dont forget the biz  well well just wait till ive gone through the letters and well see what we can do well see ha this reads well i like this ben were in luck this morning in luck my boy  mr benjamin abandoned his negligent attitude and drawing close to his father peered over his shoulder the letter which lay upon the desk was not a long one but it was to the point       thurwell court      thursday       dear sirs       i am recommended to consult your firm on a matter which requires      the services of a skilled detective and the utmost secrecy i am      coming to london tomorrow and will call at your office at about      halfpast ten please arrange to be in at that time      yours truly     helen thurwell      to messrs levy  son     private agents      street strand london  mr levy senior drew his hand meditatively down the lower part of his face once or twice and looked up at his son  something in it i think benjamin eh thurwell court coat of arms lady signs herself miss thurwell money there eh  mr benjamin was looking thoughtfully down at the signature  thurwell thurwell where the mischief have i heard that name lately holy moses i know he suddenly exclaimed starting up with glistening eyes dad our fortunes made our chance has come at last  in the exuberance of his spirits he forgot the infirmities of age and brought his hand down upon his fathers back with such vehemence that the tears started into the little old gentlemans eyes and his spectacles rattled upon his nose  dont do that again benjamin he exclaimed nervously i dont like it i dont like it at all you nearly dislocated my shoulder and if you had id have stopped the doctors bill out of your allowance i would indeed and now what have you got to say  mr benjamin had been walking up and down the office with his hands in his trousers pockets whistling softly to himself at the conclusion of his fathers complaint he came to a standstill  all right guvnor sorry i hurt you i was a bit excited dont you remember having heard that name thurwell lately  mr levy senior shook his head doubtfully  im afraid my memory isnt what it used to be benjamin the name sounds a bit familiar and yetno i cant remember he wound up suddenly tell me about it my boy  why the kynaston murder of course that was at thurwell court sir geoffrey kynaston was engaged to miss thurwell you know and she was one of the first to find him  dear me dear me i remember all about it now to be sure mr levy exclaimed the murderer was never found was he got clean off  thats so assented mr benjamin dad its a rum thing but i was interested in that case there was something queer about it i read it every bit i could stand a crossexamination in it now dad its a lucky thing shes coming here to consult us about it as sure as my name is ben levy and by jabers here she is  there was the sound of a cab stopping at the door and through a chink in the blinds mr benjamin had seen a lady descend from it in a moment his hat was off and on the peg and he commenced writing a letter at the desk  dad he said quickly without looking up leave this matter to me will you im up in the case a lady did you say morrisonturning toward the door very good show her in at once     chapter xii  a jewel of a son   for the first time in her life helen was taking a definite and important step without her fathers knowledge the matter was one which had caused her infinite thought and many heart searchings the burden of rachel kynastons dying words had fallen upon her alone there seemed to be no escape from it she must act and must act for herself any sort of appeal to her father for help was out of the question she knew beforehand exactly what his view of the matter would be in all things concerning her sex he was of that ancient school which reckoned helplessness and inaction the chief and necessary qualities of women outside the domestic circle he might himself have made some move in the matter but it would have been half hearted and under protest she knew exactly what his point of view would be rachel kynaston had been excited by a fancied wrongher last words were uttered in a veritable delirium she could not part with the responsibility the shadow of it lay upon her and her alone she must act herself or not at all she must act herself and without her fathers knowledge or be false to the charge laid upon her by a dying woman so with a heavy heart she had accepted what seemed to her to be the inevitable  she was shown at once into the inner sanctuary of messrs levy  son her first glance around nervous though she was was comprehensive she saw a plainly but not illfurnished office the chief feature of which was its gloom seated in an easy chair was a little old gentleman with white hair who rose to receive her and a little farther away was a younger man who was writing busily and who did not even glance up at her entrance although it was not a particularly dark morning the narrowness of the street and the small dusty windows seemed effectually to keep out the light and a jet of gas was burning  mr levy bowed to his visitor and offered her a chair  miss thurwell i presume he said in his best manner  the lady bowed without lifting her veil which though short was a thick one  we received a letter from you this morning he continued  yes i have called about it  she hesitated the commencement was very difficult after all had she done wisely in coming here was it not all a mistake had she not better leave the thing to the proper authorities and content herself with offering a reward she had half a mind to declare that her visit was an error and make her escape  it was at this point that the tact of the junior member of the firm asserted itself quietly laying down his pen he turned toward her and spoke for the first time  we gathered from your letter miss thurwell that you desired to consult us concerning the murder of sir geoffrey kynaston  helen was surprised into assenting and before she could qualify her words mr benjamin had taken the case in hand  exactly now miss thurwell we have had some very delicate and very difficult business confided to us at different times and i may say without boasting that we have been remarkably successful i may so father may i not  most decidedly benjamin there was mr morriss jewels you know  and mr hadsons son  and that little affair with captain trescott and bella b  mr benjamin dropped the ruler which he had been idly balancing on his forefinger with a crash and shot a warning glance across at his father  miss thurwell will not be interested in the details of our business he remarked our reputation is doubtless known to her  considering what the reputation of messrs levy  son really was this last remark was a magnificent piece of cool impudence even mr levy could not refrain from casting a quick glance of admiration at his junior who remained perfectly unmoved  what i was about to remark miss thurwell was simply this the chief cause of our success has been that we have induced our clients at the outset to give us their whole confidence we lay great stress on this everything that we are told in the way of business we consider absolutely secret but we like to know everything  i shall keep nothing back from you she said quietly i have nothing to conceal  mr benjamin nodded approval  then in order that the confidence between us may be complete let me ask you this question why have you brought this matter to us instead of leaving it to the ordinary authorities  helen thurwell lifted her veil for the first time and looked at the young man who was questioning her mr benjamin levy as a young man of fashion was an ape and a fool mr benjamin levy taking the lead in a piece of business after his own heart was as shrewd a young man as you could meet with looking him steadily in the face and noticing his keen dark eyes and closely drawn lips she began for the first time to think that after all she might have done a wise thing in coming here  the ordinary authorities have had the matter in hand two months and they have done nothing she answered i am very anxious that it should be cleared up and i am naturally beginning to lose faith in them they have so many other things to attend to now if i paid you well i suppose you would give your whole time to the matter  undoubtedly assented mr levy senior gravely  undoubtedly echoed his son i am quite satisfied miss thurwell and i thank you for your candor  i suppose you will want me to tell you all about it she said with a faint shudder  not unless you know something fresh i have every particular in my head that has been published  helen looked surprised  you read all about it i suppose she asked  yes such things interest us naturally this one did me particularly because from the first i saw that the police were on the wrong tack  what is your idea about it then she asked  simply this he answered turning round and facing her for the first time all the time and trouble spent in scouring the country and watching the ports and railway stations was completely wasted the murder was not committed by an outsider at all the first thing i shall want when we begin to work this is the name and address of all the people living within a mile or two of the scene of the murder and then every possible particular concerning mr bernard brown of falcons nest  she could not help a slight start and from his looking at her now for the first time so fixedly and from the abrupt manner in which he had brought out the latter part of his sentence she knew that he was trying her  there is one more question too miss thurwell which i must ask you and it is a very important one he continued still looking at her do you suspect any one  she answered him without hesitation  i do  mr levy senior stirred in his chair and leaned forward eagerly mr benjamin remained perfectly unmoved  and who is it he asked  mr brown  mr benjamin looked away and made a note if she could have seen it helen would certainly have been surprised for though her voice was low she had schooled herself to go through her task without agitation yet here was the note  query connection between mr brown and miss t showed great agitation in announcing suspicion  do you mind telling us your reasons he went on  she repeated them after the manner of one who has learned a lesson  mr brown came to our part of the country just at the time that sir geoffrey came from abroad they had met before and there was some cause of enmity between them  stop how do you know that mr benjamin interrupted quickly  she told him of mr browns admission to her and of the tragedy of rachel kynastons last words he seemed to know something of this too  any other reason  he seemed agitated when he came out from the cottage after the crime was discovered from its situation he could easily have committed the murder and regained it unseen it would have been infinitely easier for him to have done it than anyone else  mr benjamin looked at his father and his father looked at him  can you tell me anything at all of his antecedents he continued  she shook her head  we knew nothing about him when he came he never talked about himself  but he was your fathers tenant was he not  yes  then he gave you some references i suppose  only his bankers and his lawyers  do you remember those  yes the bankers were gregsons and the lawyers name was cuthbert  mr benjamin made a note of both  there is nothing more which it occurs to you to tell us miss thurwell he asked  there is one circumstance which seemed to me at the time suspicious she said slowly it was after the body had been carried to mr browns house and i was waiting for my father there i think i must have suspected mr brown then in a lesser degree for i took the opportunity of being alone to look into his sitting room it was rather a mean thing to do she added hurriedly but i was a little excited at the notion of his guilt and i felt that i would do anything to help to bring the truth to light  it was very natural interposed mr levy senior who had been watching for some time for the opportunity of getting a word in very natural indeed  his son took no notice of the interruption and helen continued  what i saw may be of no consequence but i will just tell you what it was and what it suggested to me the window was open and the leaves of a laurel shrub just outside were dripping with wet a little way in the room was an empty basin and on the floor by the side was a pile of books they might have been there by accident but it seemed to me as if they had been purposely placed there to hide somethingpossibly a stain on the floor before i could move any of them to see i was disturbed  by mr brown  by mr brown and sir allan beaumerville  did you gather from his appearance that he was alarmed at finding you there  helen shook her head  no he was surprised certainly but that was natural i cannot say that he looked alarmed  mr benjamin put away his notes and turned round on his stool  a word or two with regard to the business part of this matter miss thurwell are you prepared to spend a good deal of money  if it is necessary yes  very good then i will give you a sketch of my plans we have agents in paris vienna venice and other towns whom i shall at once employ in tracing out sir geoffrey kynastons life abroad concerning which i already have some useful information during the rest of the day i shall make inquiries about mr brown in london tomorrow i shall be prepared to come down to thurwell in any capacity you suggest  if you know anything of auditing she said you can come down and go through the books of the estate at the court i can arrange that  it will do admirably these are my plans then we shall require from you miss thurwell two hundred guineas to send abroad and forty guineas a week for the services of my father and myself and our staff if in twelve months we have not succeeded we will engage to return you twentyfive per cent of this amount if on the other hand we have brought home the crime to the murderer we shall ask you for a further five hundred will you agree to these terms  yes  mr benjamin stretched out his hand for a piece of writing paper and made a memorandum  perhaps you would be so good as to sign this then he said passing it to her  she took the pen and wrote her name at the bottom then she rose to go  there is nothing more she said  nothing except your london address he reminded her  i am staying with my aunt lady thurwell at no 8 cadogan square  can i call and see you tomorrow morning there  she hesitated after all why not she had put her hand to the plow and she must go on with it  yes she answered as the auditor who is going to thurwell court  he bowed and held the door open for her  that is understood of course good morning miss thurwell  she was standing quite still on the threshold as if lost in thought for a moment suddenly she looked up at him with a bright spot of color glowing in her cheeks  let me ask you a question mr levy  certainly  you have read the account of thisterrible thing and you have heard all i can tell you doubtless you have formed some idea concerning it would you mind telling it to me  mr benjamin kept his keen black eyes fixed steadily upon her while he answered the question as though he were curious to see what effect it would have on her  certainly miss thurwell i think that the gentleman calling himself mr brown will find himself in the murderers dock before a month is out  she shuddered slightly and turned away  thank you good morning  good morning miss thurwell  she was gone and as the sound of her departing cab became lost in the din of the traffic outside a remarkable change took place in the demeanor of mr benjamin levy his constrained almost polished manner disappeared his small deepset eyes sparkled with exultation and all his natural vulgarity reasserted itself  what do you think of that guvnor eh he cried patting him gently on the shoulder good biz eh  benjamin my son returned the old man with emotion our fortune is made you are a jewel of a son     chapter xiii  a strange meeting   grayness reigned everywherein the sky on the hillside and on the bare moor no longer made resplendent by the gleaming beauty of the purple heather and fainter flashes of yellow gorse the dry springy turf had become a swamp and phantomlike wreaths of mist blurred and saddened the landscape the sweet stirring of the summer wind amongst the pine trees had given place to the melancholy drip of raindrops falling from their heavy drooping branches on to the soddened ground every vestige of coloring had died out of the landscapefrom the sea the clouds and the heath it was the earths mourning season when the air has neither the keen freshness of winter the buoyancy of spring the sweet drowsy languor of summer or the bracing exhilaration of autumn it was november  daylight was fast fading away but the reign of twilight had not yet commenced after a blustering morning a sudden stillness had fallen upon the earth the wild north wind had ceased its moaning in the pine trees and no longer came booming across the level moorland the dull gray clouds which all day long had been driven across the leaden sky in flying haste hung low down upon the sad earth and from over the water a sea fog rose to meet them nature had nothing more cheerful to offer than silence a dim light and indescribable desolation  a solitary man with his figure carved out in sharp relief against the vaporous sky stood on the highest point of the cliff everything in his attitude betokened the deepest dejectionin which at least he was in sympathy with his surroundings his head drooped upon his bent shoulders and his dark weary eyes were fixed upon the rising sea fog in a vacant gaze warmly clad as he was he seemed chilled through his whole being by the raw lifelessness of the air yet he did not move  the utter silence was suddenly broken by the rising of a little flock of gulls from among the stunted firs hanging down over the cliff almost immediately afterwards there came another sound denoting the advance of a human being the little hand gate leading out of the plantation was opened and shut and light footsteps began to ascend the ridge of the cliffs on which he was standing hesitating now and then but always advancing as soon as he became sure of this he turned his head in the direction from which they came and found himself face to face with helen thurwell  it was the first time they had come together since the terrible night at thurwell court when their eyes had met for an awful moment over the dead body of rachel kynaston the memory of that scene flashed into the minds of both of them from hers indeed it had seldom been absent she stood face to face with the man whom she had been charged by the passionate prayers of a dying woman to hunt down and denounce as a murderer they looked at one another with the same thoughts in the minds of both the first step she had already taken henceforth he would be watched and dogged his past life raked up and his every action recorded and she it was who had set the underhand machinery at work she it was whom he guilty or innocent would think of as the woman who had hunted him down if he should be innocent and the time should come when he discovered all what would he think of her if he could have seen her a few days back in the office of messrs levy  son would he look at her as he was doing now the thought sent a shiver through her at that moment she hated herself  it was no ordinary meeting this for him or for her had she been able to look him steadily in the face she might have seen something of her own nervousness reflected there but that was just what at first she was unable to do one rapid glance into his pale features which suffering and intellectual labor seemed in some measure to have etherealized was sufficient she had all the poignant sense of a culprit before an injured but merciful judge and at that moment the memory of those dying words was faint within her and so though it is not usually the case it was he who appeared the least disturbed and he it was who broke that strange silence which had lasted several moments after she had come to a standstill before him  you do not mind speaking to me miss thurwell  no i do not mind she answered in a low hesitating tone  then may i take it that miss kynastons words have notdamaged me in your esteem he went on his voice quivering a little with suppressed anxiety you do notbelievethat  i neither believe nor disbelieve she interrupted remember that you had an opportunity of denying it which you did not accept  that is true he answered slowly let it remain like that then it is best  she had turned a little away as though to watch a screaming curlew fly low down and vanish in the fog from where he stood on slightly higher ground he looked down at her curiously for in more than one sense she was a puzzle to him there was a certain indefiniteness in her manner toward him which he felt a passionate desire to construe she seemed at once merciful and merciless sympathetic and hard then as he looked at her he almost forgot all this wilderness of suffering and doubt all his intense love for physical beauty ministered to by the whole manner of his life seemed rekindled in her presence the tragedy of the present seemed to pass away into the background from the moment when he had first caught a glimpse of her in the courtyard of the palazzo vechi he had chosen her face and presence with which to endow his artists idealand since that time what change there had been in her had been for the better the animal spirits of lighthearted girlhood had become toned down into the more refined and delicate softness of thoughtful womanhood in her thin supple figure there was still just the suspicion of incomplete development which is in itself a fascination and her country attire the wellcut brown tweed ulster the cloth cap from beneath which many little waves of fair silky hair had escaped the trim gloves and short skirtsthe most insignificant article of her attireall seemed to bespeak that peculiar and subtle daintiness which is at the same time the sweetest and the hardest to define of natures gifts to women  even in the most acute crisis womans care for the physical welfare of man seems almost an instinct with her suddenly turning round she saw how illprotected he was against the weather and a look of concern stole into her face  how ridiculous of you to come out without an overcoat or anything on such a day as this she exclaimed why you must be wet throughand how cold you look  he smiled grimly that she should think of such a thing just at that moment seemed to him to be a peculiar satire upon what had been passing through his mind concerning her then a sudden thrill shook every limb in his bodyhis very pulses quickened she had laid her gloved hand upon his arm and having withdrawn it was regarding it ruefully it was stained with wet  you must go home at once she said with a decision in her tone which was almost suggestive of authority you must change all your things and get before a warm fire come i will walk with you as far as falcons nest i am going round that way and home by the footpath  they started off side by side the first emotion of their meeting having passed away he found it easier to talk to her and he did so in an odd monosyllabic way which she yet found interesting all her life she had been somewhat peculiarly situated with regard to companionship her father having once taken her abroad and once to london for the season considered that he had done his duty to her and having himself long ago settled down to the life of a country squire had expected her to be content with her position as his daughter and the mistress of his establishment there was nothing particularly revolting to her in the prospect she was not by any means emancipated the new woman would have been a horror to her but unfortunately although she was content to accept a comparatively narrow view of life she was slightly epicurean in her tastes she would have been quite willing to give up her life to a round of such pleasures as society and wealth can procure but the society must be good and entertaining and its pleasures must be refined and free from monotony in some parts of england she might have found what would have satisfied her and under the influence of a pleasureseeking life she would in due course have become the woman of a type as she grew older the horizon of her life would have become more limited and her ideas narrower she would have lived without tasting either the full sweetness or the full bitterness of life she would have filled her place in society admirably and there would have been nothing to distinguish her either for better or worse from other women in a similar position but it happened that round thurwell court the people were singularly uninteresting the girls were dull and the men bucolic before she had spent two years in the country helen was intensely bored a sort of chronic languor seemed to creep over her and in a fit of desperation she had permitted herself to become engaged to sir geoffrey kynaston for the simple reason that he was different from the other men then just as she was beginning to tremble at the idea of marriage with a man for whom she had never felt a single spark of love there had come this tragedy and following close upon it the vague consciousness of an utter change hovering over her life what that change meant she was slow to discover she was still unconscious of it as she walked over the cliffs with the grey mists hanging around them side by side with her fathers tenant she knew that life had somehow become a fairer thing to her and that for many years she had been living in darkness and it was her companion this mysterious stranger with his wan young face and sad thoughtful eyes who had brought the light she could see it flashing across the whole landscape of her future revealing the promise of a larger life than any she had ever dreamed of full of brilliant possibilities and more perfect happiness than any she had ever imagined she told herself that he was the columbus who had shown her the new land of culture with all its fair places intellectual and artistic this was the whole meaning of the change in her there could be nothing else     chapter xiv  helen thurwell asks a direct question   at the summit of the little spur of cliff they paused close on one side were the windows of falcons nest and on the other the batch of black firs which formed the background to it ran down the steep cliff side to the sea the path which they were following curved round the cottage and crossed the moor within a few yards of the spot where sir geoffrey had been found as they stood together for a moment before parting she noticed with a sudden cold dismay that thick shutters had recently been fitted to the windows of the little room into which she had stolen on the day of sir geoffreys murder  are you afraid of being robbed she asked one would imagine that your room there held a secret  she was watching him and she told herself the shot had gone to its mark  he followed her finger with his eyes and kept his face turned away from her  yes that is so he answered quietly that little room holds its secret and its ghost for me would to god he cried with a sudden passion trembling in his tones that i had never seen itthat i had never come here  her heart beat fast could it be that he was going to confess to her then he turned suddenly round and in the twilight his white face and dark luminous eyes seemed to her like mute emblems of an anguish which moved her womans heart to pity there was none of the cowardice of guilt there nothing of the criminal in the deep melancholy which seemed to have set its mark upon his whole being and yet he must be very guiltyvery much a criminal  her eyes strayed from his face back to the window again there was no light anywhere in the house it had a cold desolate look which chilled her  is that the room where you sit she asked pointing to it  yes there is no other furnished except my housekeepers and she is away now  away then who is with you in the house  at present no one he answered she was taken ill and went home this morning she is generally ill  she looked at him perplexed  but who does your cooking for you and light the fires and that sort of thing  i havent thought about it yet he answered i did try to light the fire this afternoon but i couldnt quite manage it ii think the sticks must have been damp he added hesitatingly  she looked at him wet through and almost blue with cold and at the dull cheerlesslooking cottage again the woman in her triumphed and her eyes filled with tears  i never heard anything so preposterous she exclaimed almost angrily you must be out of your senses mr brown now be so good as to obey me at once go into the house and get a thick overcoat the thickest you have and then come home with me and i will give you some tea  he hesitated and stood quite still for a moment with his face turned steadily away from her all the subtle sweetness of that last visit of his to her home had come back to him and his heart was sick with a great longing was he not a fool to refuse to enter into paradise when the gates stood open for him no words could describe the craving which he felt to escape just for a brief while from the lashings of his thoughts and the icy misery of his great loneliness what though he were courting another sorrow could his state be worse than it was could any agony be keener than that which he had already tasted were there lower depths still in the hell of remorse if so he would sound them though he died for it he would not deny himself this one taste of heaven he turned suddenly round with a glow in his eyes which had a strange effect upon her  you are very good to me miss thurwell he said i will come  that is sensible of you she answered get your coat and you can catch me up i think we had better go back the same way as it is getting late  she walked slowly down the path and he hurried into the cottage in a few minutes he overtook her wrapped in a long inverness cape from head to foot and they walked on side by side  the grey afternoon had suddenly faded into twilight overhead several stars were already visible dimly shining through a gauzelike veil of mist stretched all over the sky and from behind a black line of firs on the top of a distant hill the moon had slowly risen and was casting a soft weird light upon the saddened landscape grey wreaths of phantomlike mist were floating away across the moor and a faint breeze had sprung up and was moaning in the pine plantation when they reached the handgate they paused for a moment to listen and the dull roar of the sea from below mingled with it in their ears she turned away with a shudder  come she said that sound makes me melancholy  i like it he answered nature is an exquisite musician i never yet heard the sea speak in a tone which i did not love to hear listen to that slow mournful rise of sound reaching almost to intensity and then dying away so sadlywith the sadness that thrills ah did you hear that the shrieking of those pebbles dragged down to the sea and crying out in almost human agony i love the sea  is that why you came to this desolate part of the world she asked  partly  tell me the whole reason she said abruptly was there anything special which made you fix on this neighborhood you may think me curious if you likebut i want to know  i had a vow to keep he answered hoarsely you must ask me no more i cannot tell you  her heart sank like lead a vow to keep there was something ominous in the sound of those words she stole a glance at him as they walked on in silence and again her judgments seemed put to confusion and her hopes revived his face dimly seen in the shadows of the plantation was suddenly illuminated by a pale quivering moonbeam as they passed through a slight opening could these be the features of a murderer her whole heart rebelled against her understanding and cried out no for the first time she realized the æsthetic beauty of his face scarred and wasted though it was by the deep lines of intellectual toil and consuming sorrow there was not a line out of place save where his cheekbones projected slightly owing to his extreme thinness and left deep hollows under his eyes nor was his expression the expression of a guilty man for notwithstanding the intense melancholy which dwelt always in his dark eyes and seemed written into every feature there was blended with it a strange pride the slight yet wholesome contempt of a man conscious of a certain superiority in himself neither physical nor in any way connected with material circumstances over the majority of his fellows and as the realization of this swept in upon her and her faith in him suddenly leaped up with a newborn strength there came with it a passionate desire to hear him proclaim his innocence with his own lips and having heard it to banish for ever doubts and suspicions and give herself up to this new sweetness which was hovering around her life she caught hold of his hand but dropped it almost at once for the fire which flashed into his face at the touch of her fingers half frightened her he had come to a sudden standstill and before his eyes she felt hers droop and the hot color burn her cheeks what had come to her she could not tell she was nervous almost faint with the dawning promise of a bewildering happiness yet her desire still clung to her and she found words to express it  i cannot bear this any longer she cried i must ask you a question and you must answer it the thought of it all is driving me mad  for gods sake ask me nothing he said in a deep hollow tone let me go back i should not be here with you  you shall not go she answered stand there where the light falls upon your face and answer me was it you who killed sir geoffrey kynaston tell me for i will know  there was a dead silence which seemed to her fevered nerves intolerable from all around them came the quiet drip drip of the rain from the bending boughs on to the damp soaked ground and at that moment a slight breeze from over the moorland stirred amongst the branches and the moisture which hung upon them descended in little showers from below the dull roar of the sea came up to them in a muffled undertone like a melancholy background to the slighter sound there was an indescribable dreariness about it all which quickened the acute agony of those few moments  more awful than anything to her was the struggle which she saw in that white strained face half hidden in his clasped hands what could hesitation mean but guilt what need was there for it her feet seemed turned to stone upon the cold ground and her heart almost stopped beating there was a film before her eyes and yet she saw his face still though dimly and as if it were far off she saw his hands withdrawn and she saw his ashen lips part slowly  i did not kill sir geoffrey kynaston he said in a low constrained voice if my life could have saved his i would have given it  a warm golden light seemed suddenly to banish the misty gloom of the damp plantation the color rushed into her cheeks and her heart leaped for joy she heard and she believed  thank god she cried holding out both her hands to him with a sudden impulsive gesture come let us go now  she was smiling softly up at him and her eyes were wet with tears he took one quick passionate step towards her seizing her hands and drawing her unresistingly towards him in a moment she would have been in his armsalready a great trembling had seized her and her will had fled but that moment was not yet  something seemed to have turned him to stone he dropped her fingers as though they were burning him a vacant light eclipsed the passion which had shone a moment before in his eyes suddenly he raised his hands to the sky in a despairing gesture  god forgive me he cried god forgive me  for very shame at his touch and her ready yielding to it her eyes had fallen to the ground when she raised them he was gone there was the sound of his retreating footsteps the quick opening and closing of the handgate and through the trees she saw him walking swiftly over the cliffs then she turned away with her face half hidden in her hands and the hot tears streaming down her cheeks  again there was silence only broken by the louder roar of the incoming tide and the faint rustling of the leaves suddenly it was broken by a human voice and a human figure slowly arose from a cramped posture behind a clump of shrubs  holy moses if this aint a queer start remarked mr benjamin levy shaking the wet from his clothes and slowly filling a pipe wants him copped for murder and yet tries to get him to make up to her shes a deep un she is i wonder if she was in earnest if only she was i think i see my way to a real good thinga real good thing he repeated meditatively     chapter xv  a literary celebrity   it was tuesday afternoon and the countess of meltoun was at home to the worldthat is to say her world the usual throng of men of fashion guardsmen literary men and budding politicians were bending over the chairs of their feminine acquaintances or standing about in little groups talking amongst themselves the clatter of teacups was mingled with the soft hum of voices the pleasantly shaded room was heavy with the perfume of many flowers people said that lady meltoun was the only woman in london who knew how to keep her rooms cool it was hard to believe that outside the streets and pavements were hot with the afternoon sun  helen thurwell who had come late with her aunt was sitting on a low couch near one of the windows by her side was sir allan beaumerville and directly in front of her the earl of meltoun with a teacup in his hand was telling her stories of his college days with her father there had been a great change in her during the last six months looking closely into her face it seemed as though she had felt the touch of a deep sorrowa sorrow which had left all its refining influences upon her without any of the ravages of acute grief those few minutes in the pine grove by the sea had left their indelible mark upon her life and it was only the stimulating memory of his own words to her concerning the weakness of idle yielding to regret and the abstract beauty of sorrow which had been her salvation they had come back to her in the time of her suffering fresh and glowing with truth she had found a peculiar comfort in them and they had become her religion thus she had set herself to conquer grief in the highest possible mannernot by steeping herself in false excitement or rushing away for a change of scene but by a deliberate series of intellectual and artistic abstractions out of which she had come still in a manner sorrowful but with all her higher perceptions quickened and strengthened until the consciousness of their evolution gradually growing within her gave a new power and a new sweetness to her life  and of this victory she showed some traces in her face which had indeed lost none of its physical beauty but which had now gained a new strength and a new sweetness she was more admired than ever but there were men who called her difficulteven a little fastidious and others who found her very hard to get on with the great artist who had just taken sir allan beaumervilles place by her side was not one of these  i am so glad that you are here today miss thurwell he said holding her greygloved hand in his for a moment i have been looking for you everywhere  that is very nice of you she answered smiling up at him  ah but i didnt mean only for my own sake i know that you like meeting interesting people and today there is an opportunity for you  really and who is it mr carlyon how good of you to think of me  you remember telling me how much you admire maddisons work  why yes but he is not here surely she exclaimed it cannot be he  mr carlyon smiled at her sudden enthusiasm after all this woman had fire she was too much of the artist to be without it  he is not here now but he will be i could not believe it myself at first for i know that he is a perfect recluse but i have just asked lady meltoun and there is no doubt about it it seems that they came across him in a lonely part of spain and he saved the life of lady meltouns only childa little boy it is quite a romantic story he promised to come and seem them directly he returned to england and he is expected here today  i shall like to see him very much she said thoughtfully lately i have been reading him a great deal it is strange but the tone of his writings seems always to remind me of some one i once knew  there is no one of today who writes such prose the artist answered to me his work seems to have reached that exquisite blending of matter and form which is the essence of all true art  all his ideas of culture and the inner life are so simple and yet so beautiful  and the language with which he clothes them is divine his work appeals everywhere to the purest and most artistic side of our emotional natures and it is always on the same level it has only one faultthere is so little of it  do you know him she asked deeply interested  i do i met him in pisa some years ago and although he is a strangely reserved man we became almost intimate i am looking forward to introducing him to you  i shall like it very much she answered simply  who is the fortunate individual to be so highly favored asked a pleasant voice close to her side  you have returned then sir allan she said looking up at him with a smile have you heard the news do you know who is expected  he shook his head  i have heard nothing he said if i am to have a sensation it will be you who will impart it to me dont tell me all at once i like expectancy  she laughed  what an epicure you are sir allan come prepare for something very delightful and i will tell you  is it the prince he asked  she shook her head  the mikado in disguise the khedive incognito mr gladstone  she shook her head again  the sensation will be more delightful than you imagine evidently there have been many khedives and many mikados but there can never be another bernard maddison  a disturbed shade seemed to fall upon the baronets face she followed his eyes riveted upon the door the hum of conversation had suddenly ceased and every one was looking in the same direction on the threshold stood a tall gaunt man gazing in upon the scene before him with an expression of distinct aversion mingled with indifference he was dressed just like the other men in a long frock coat and he had a white gardenia in his buttonhole but there was something about him distinct and noticeablesomething in the quiet easy manner with which he at last moved forward to greet his hostess which seemed to thrill her through and through with a sense of sweet familiarity and then she caught a turn of his head as he stooped down over lady meltouns hand and a great wave of bewilderment mingled with an acute throbbing joy swept in upon her this man whom every one was gazing at with such eager interest was her fathers tenant mr bernard brown     chapter xvi  a snub for a baronet   those few moments were full of a strange intense interest to the three persons who side by side had watched the entrance of mr bernard maddison to helen thurwell whose whole being was throbbing with a great quickening joy they were passed in a strenuous effort to struggle against the faintness which the shock of this great tumult of feeling had brought with it to the artist who loved her they brought their own peculiar despair as he watched the light playing upon her features and the new glow of happiness which shone in those sweet sad eyes and to sir allan beaumerville who had reasons of his own for surprise at this meeting they brought a distinct sensation of annoyance  the artist was the first to recover himself he knew that the battle was over for him that this woman already loved and that his cause was hopeless and with little of mans ordinary selfishness on such occasions his first thought was for her  you would like to change your seat he whispered come with me into the recess yonder i will show you some engravings  she flashed a grateful look up at him and saw that he knew her secret  i should like it she said walk that side of me please  they rose and made their way to one of the little screened recesses which peopleespecially young peoplesaid made lady meltouns rooms so delightful he placed a chair for her and taking up a book of engravings buried himself in it  dont speak to me for five minutes please he said i am looking for a design  at the end of that time he closed the book and looked up at her there was no fear of her fainting now she was very pale but she seemed quite calm  i am going to speak to maddison he said quietly do youmay i bring him and introduce him to you  she looked up at him with luminous eyes  if you please dont tell him my name though  it shall be as you wish he answered  by moving her chair a few inches she could see into the room he was still standing by lady meltouns side listening with an absent smile to her chatter and every now and then bowing gravely to the people whom she introduced to him the hum of conversation had been renewed but many curious glances were cast in his direction of which he seemed altogether unconscious even had there not been his great fame as a critic and a writer and the romance of his strange manner of life to interest people his personal appearance alone was sufficient to attract attention he was taller by several inches than any man in the room and his thin oval face refined yet strong and full of a subtle artistic sensibility was in itself a deeply interesting study how different he appeared here in his wellfitting fashionable clothes and calm distinctive manner and with just that essence of wearied languor in his dark eyes which men of the world can only imitate he had changed and yet he had not changed she thought he was the same and yet there was a difference presently she saw mr carlyon reach his side and the greeting which passed between the two men was marked with a certain quiet cordiality which bore out mr carlyons words that they had once been fellowworkers watching his opportunity the artist drew him a little on one side and made his request helen drew back trembling with expectancy but a few minutes later mr carlyon came back to her alone  i am sorry he said simply but even to oblige me maddison wont come i had no idea he was such a misogynist he is here he says to keep a promise but he wishes for no acquaintances and he absolutely declines to be introduced to any woman unless it is forced upon him what shall i do shall i tell him your name  she hesitated  no dont tell him that she said do you remember a few lines of poetry of his at the end of his last volume of criticisms there is a little clump of firs on the top of a bare windswept hill with the moon shining faintly through a veil of mist and a man and woman standing together like carved figures against the sky listening to the faroff murmur of the sea  yes i remember it he said slowly  then will you tell him that some onesome one who has seen such a place as he describes is  i will tell him mr carlyon answered i think that he will come now  he left her again and went back towards mr maddison just as he got within speaking distance he saw a slight quiver pass across the white face as though he had recognized some one in the crowd mr carlyon hesitated and decided to wait for a moment  they were standing face to face sir allan beaumerville the distinguished baronet who had added to the dignity of an ancient family and vast wealth a great reputation as a savant and a dilettante physician and mr bernard maddison whose name alone was sufficient to bespeak his greatness in sir allans quiet courteous look there was a slightly puzzled air as though there were something in the others face which he only half remembered in mr maddisons fixed gaze there was a far greater intensitysomething even of anxiety  surely we have met before mr maddison the baronet said easily your face seems quite familiar to me ah i remember now it was near that place of lord lathons mallory grange upon the coast a terrible affair that  yes a terrible affair mr maddison repeated  and have you just come from shire sir allan asked  no i have been abroad for several months mr maddison answered  abroad sir allan appeared a little more interested in what part he asked civilly  i have been in spain and the south of france across the hartz mountains and through the black forest  not in italy sir allan inquired  there was a short silence and sir allan seemed really anxious for the reply it came at last  no not in italy  sir allan seemed positively pleased to think that mr maddison had not extended his travels to italy there was a quiet gleam in his eyes which seemed almost like relief doubtless he had his reasons but they were a little obscure  ah shall you call upon me while you are in town mr maddison he asked in a tone from which all invitation was curiously lacking  i think not mr maddison answered my stay here will be brief i dislike london  sir allan laughed gently  it is the only place in the world fit to live in he answered  my work and my tastes demand a quieter life mr maddison remarked  you will go into the country then i suppose  that is my intention was the quiet reply  back to the same neighborhood  it is possible  sir allan looked searchingly into the others calm expressionless face  i should have thought that the associations  mr maddison was evidently not used to society several people said so who saw him suddenly turn his back on that charming old gentleman sir allan beaumerville and leave him in the middle of a sentence lady meltoun who happened to notice it was quite distressed at seeing an old friend treated in such a manner but sir allan took it very nicely everybody said there had been a flush in his face just for a moment but it soon died away it was his own fault he declared he had certainly made an unfortunate remark and these artists and literary men were all so sensitive he hoped that lady meltoun would think no more of it and accordingly lady meltoun promised not to but though of course she and every one else who had seen it sympathized with sir allan there were one or two with whom sir allan was not quite such a favorite who could not help remarking upon the grand air with which mr maddison had turned his back upon the baronet and the dignity with which he had left him  mr carlyon who had been watching for his opportunity buttonholed maddison and led him into a corner  ive got you now he said triumphantly my dear fellow whatever made you snub poor sir allan like that  never mind come and make your adieux to lady meltoun and let us go i should not have come here  one moment first maddison the artist said seriously do you remember those lines of yours in which a man and woman stand on a bare hill by a clump of pines and watch the misty moonlight cast weird shadows upon the hillside and over the quivering sea a farewell you called it i think  yes i remember them  maddison the woman to whom i wished to introduce you bids you to go to her by the memory of those lines  there was very little change in his face it only grew a little more rigid and a strange light gleamed in his eyes but the hand which he had laid on carlyons arm to draw him towards lady meltoun suddenly tightened like a band of iron till the artist nearly cried out with pain  let go my arm for gods sake man he said in a low tone and i will take you to her  i am ready mr maddison answered quietly ah i see where she is you need not come  he crossed the room absolutely heedless of more than one attempt to stop him mr carlyon watched him and then with a sore heart bade his hostess farewell and hurried away he was generous enough to help another man to his happiness but he could not stay and watch it     chapter xvii  bernard maddison and helen thurwell   and so it was in lady meltouns drawingroom that they met again after those few minutes in the pine plantation which had given color and passion to her life and which had formed an epoch in his neither were unmindful of the fact that if they were not exactly the centre of observation they were still liable to it in some degree and their greeting was as conventional as it well could have been after all she thought why should it be otherwise there had never a word of love passed between themonly those few fateful moments of tragic intensity when all words and thoughts had been merged in a deep reciprocal consciousness which nothing could have expressed  he stood before her holding her hand in his for a moment longer than was absolutely necessary and looking at her intently it was a gaze from which she did not shrink more critical than passionate and when he withdrew his eyes he looked away from her with a sigh  you have been living he said tell me all about it  she moved her skirts to make room for him by her side  sit down she said and i will try  he obeyed but when she tried to commence and tell him all that she had felt and thought she could not until that moment she scarcely realized how completely her life had been moulded by his influence it was he who had first given her a glimpse of that new world of thought and art and almost epicurean culture into which she had made some slight advance during his absence and it was certain vague but sweet recollections of him which had lived with her and flowed through her lifea deep undercurrent of passion and poetry throwing a golden halo over all those new sensationswhich had raised her existence and her ideals of existence on to a higher level how could she tell him this the time might come when she could do so and if ever it did come she knew that it would be the happiest moment of her life but it was not yet  tell me a little of yourself she said evasively you have been traveling have you not  yes i have been traveling a little he answered in spain i was taken ill and lady meltoun was kind to me that is why i am here  but you do not say how it was that you were taken ill she said her cheeks suddenly glowing you saved her sons life we saw all about it in the papers but of course we did not know that it was you it was splendid  if you saw it in the papers at all depend upon it it was very much exaggerated he answered quietly your father received my letter i suppose  yes the cottage has been shut up just as you desired are you ever coming to take possession again  i hope sosome dayand yet i do not know there are strange things in my life miss thurwell which every now and then rise up and drive me away into aimless wanderings life has no goal for meit cannot have i stand for ever on the brink of a precipice  there was a sadness in his voice which almost brought the tears into her eyesmostly for his sake partly for her own for though he might never know it were not his sorrows her sorrows  are they sorrows which you can tell to no one she asked softly can no one help you  he shook his head  no one  and yet no sorrow can last for ever that has not guilt at its root she said  mine will last while life lasts he answered and there isno guilt at the root  you have taken up anothers burden she said is it well do you owe nothing to yourself and your own genius sorrow may shorten your life and the world can ill spare your work  there are others who can do my work he said no other canbut forgive me i wish to talk of this no more tell me of your life since i left you something in your face tells me that it has been well spent let me hear of it  and gathering up all her courage she told him piece by piece she took up the disconnected thoughts and ideas which had come to her and wove them together after the pattern of her lifeto which he listened with a calm approval in which was sometimes mingled a deeper enthusiasm as she touched a chord which in his own being had often been struck to deep tremulous music and as she went on he grew sad with such a companion as this woman whose sensibilities were his sensibilities and whose instincts so naturally cultured so capable of the deeper coloring and emotional passion which his influence could speedily developwith such a woman as thiswhom already he loved what might not life mean for him well it must pass another of those bright butterfly visions of his fancy gorgeous with hope and brilliancyanother one to be crushed by the iron hand of necessity he had gone away wounded and he had come back to find the wound still bleeding  gradually the rooms were thinning and at last lady thurwell impatient of her nieces long absence came to fetch her when she found her têteàtête with the lion of the day however her manner was most gracious  i hope you have been able to persuade mr maddison to come and see us she said to her niece we are at home on thursdays at cadogan square and we lunch every day at two she added turning towards him come whenever you like  you are very good lady thurwell he said accepting her offered hand i am only passing through london but if i have the opportunity i shall avail myself of your kindness  she left them together for a moment while she made her adieux to her hostess in that moment helen found courage to yield to a sudden impulse  please come she said softly  he had no time to answer for lady meltoun had come up to them  miss thurwell she said goodnaturedly i dont know when i shall forgive you for monopolizing mr maddison in this shameful manner why there were quite a crowd of people came this afternoon only to catch a glimpse of him and there was nothing to be seen but his boots behind that screen i am in terrible disgrace i can assure you  the fault was mine he interposed altogether mine in an ungovernable fit of shyness i took refuge with the only person except yourself lady meltoun whom i was fortunate enough to know i simply refused to come away  well i suppose i must forgive you or you wont come again lady meltoun said but now you are here you must really stop and see edgar when every one has gone we will go up to the nursery and in the meantime you may make yourself useful by taking lady thurwell out to her carriage im afraid theres rather a crush  so they all three went out together and while they stood waiting for lady thurwells victoria he managed to say a word to her alone  i will come and see you he whispered  she looked up at him a little shyly for in handing her into the carriage he had assumed a certain air of proprietorship which had brought a faint color into her cheeks  come soon she whispered goodbye  she nodded brightly and lady thurwell smiled as the horses started forward and the carriage drove away  i wonder who mr maddison really is she said half to herself just as they reached home  lady thurwell shrugged her shoulders  do you mean who his family are she asked my dear it isnt of the slightest consequence bernard maddison is bernard maddison and his position would be just what it is even though his father were a coal heaver  which remark showed that lady thurwell as well as being a woman of society was also a woman of sense but helen was not thinking of his family     chapter xviii  a cheque for £1000   it was ten oclock in the morning and the usual routine of business had commenced in the office of messrs levy  son mr levy senior was sitting at his desk opening his letters and mr benjamin who had only just returned from a long journey on business of the firm and did not feel inclined for office work was leaning back in the clients chair with his feet up against the mantelpiece and a partly smoked cigar in his mouth he had just finished a long account of his adventures and was by no means inclined to quit the subject  altogether dad he was saying its about the prettiest piece of business we ever struck but one thing is very certain we must get some more tin from miss thurwell why ive been at it five months now and the expenses at some of those foreign hotels were positively awful not knowing the confounded lingo you see i was forced to stump up without trying the knockingoff game  yes benjamin yes my son we must certainly have some more of the rhino your expenses have been positively enormous enormous declared the old man with uplifted hands and eyes some of your drafts have brought tears into my eyes positively tears he echoed mournfully  couldnt be helped guvnor the thing had to be done  and you have got it nearly all in order now benjamin eh youve got him under your thumb eh he cant escape  not he mark my words dad the ropes already woven thatll go round his neck  the old man looked doubtful  if hes such a learned clever man as you saywrites books and such liketheyll never hang him my son theyll reprieve him thats what theyll do  i dont care a blooming fig which it is so long as it comes off do you remember what i told you when miss thurwell first came here dad  perfectly my son perfectly you said that our fortune was made those were your very words he added with glistening eyes our fortune is made  and what i said ill stick to mr benjamin declared when this case comes off itll be the biggest thundering sensation of the day and wholl get the credit of it all who tracked him down for all his false name and sly ways hunted him all over europe found out who he really was and why he hated sir geoffrey kynaston so much that he murdered him why i did dadbenjamin levy of levy  son carle street strand aint it glorious guvnor aint it proud  mr benjamins enthusiasm was catching it was reflected in his fathers face and something glistened in his eyes he removed his spectacles and carefully wiped them after all he was a father and he had a fathers feelings  when will the time come benjamin he inquired  a month today i hope was the prompt reply i have one more journey to take and it will be all square  where to how far inquired the old gentleman uneasily  mr benjamin looked at him and shook his head come dad i know what you are thinking of he said its the expense aint it  it is benjamin his father groaned i hate parting with hardearned money for exorbitant bills and these long journeys couldnt it be done without it ben he inquired in a wheedling tone theres piles of money gone already in expenses piles and piles  and if there is aint it miss thurwells you old stupid remarked mr benjamin taint likely that we should find the money ourselves  of course of course but benjamin my son the money is thrown away for all that we could charge it you knowcharge it always we must have a marginwe must positively have a margin to work with  dad dad what an old sinner you are exclaimed his hopeful son leaning back in his chair and laughing a margin to work with ha ha ha  mr levy looked uncertain whether to regard his sons merriment as a compliment or to resent it eventually the former appeared to him the wisest course and he smiled feebly  dad just you leave this matter with me mr benjamin said at last i know what im doing and unless im very much mistaken i see my way to make this a bigger thing even as regards the cash than you and i ever dreamed of leave it to me hullo whos that  he peered up over the office blind and sat down again at once in a moment his cigar was behind the grate and his expression completely changed  ah miss thurwell dad he said coolly and ill bet ten to one i know what she wants mind you leave it all to me ive no time to explain but youll spoil it if you interfere come in why miss thurwell we were this moment talking of you he continued springing to his feet and offering her a chair please come in  helen advanced into the room and lifted her veil one swift glance into her flushed face confirmed mr benjamins idea as to the reason of her visit and he commenced talking rapidly  im glad youve come this morning miss thurwell i only got back from spain yesterday and im thankful to tell you our case is nearly complete thankful for your sake because you will have the satisfaction of seeing the murderer of sir geoffrey kynaston brought to book and thankful for ours because we shall at one stroke establish our reputation i need not tell you that that is far more to us than the reward will be for our expenses have been enormous  enormous groaned mr levy senior  however we have decided not to take another penny of money from you miss thurwell he continued casting a warning glance at his father after all the money is not so much to us as our reputation and this will be made for ever now  mr benjamin paused a little out of breath but quite satisfied with himself opposite his father was purple with anger and almost choking at his sons folly take no more money from miss thurwell was the boy mad  im afraid from what you say mr levy helen said hesitatingly that you will be rather disappointed when i tell you the reason of my visit  mr benjamin who knew perfectly well what she was going to say assumed an expression of deep concern  i find she continued that we must have been making a mistake all along and you have evidently been misled this mr brown who appeared such a mysterious personage to us and whom we therefore suspected is no other than bernard maddison  yes i knew that mr benjamin remarked quietly i found that out very soon of course author and all that sort of thing isnt he well go on miss thurwell please i am anxious  she looked surprised  dont you see that this does away with our theory at once it is quite impossible that a man like bernard maddison could have committed a horrible crime like this  mr benjamin looked ingenuously perplexed  i cant say that i follow you miss thurwell he said shaking his head all i know is that i can prove this mr bernard brown or bernard maddison or whatever else he chooses to call himself guilty of that murder thats what we want isnt it  a cold chill passed over her and she was compelled to sink into the chair which stood by her side like a flash she suddenly realized the impossibility of convincing such men as these of his innocence yet even then the worst side of the situation did not occur to her  perhaps we had better put it in this way mr levy she said i gave you certain instructions to follow out which i now rescind i wish nothing further done in the matter  mr benjamins face was a study he had contrived to conjure up an expression which combined the blankest surprise with the keenest disappointment helen began to feel still more uncomfortable  under the circumstances she said and as you seem rather disappointed i will pay you the reward just as though the thing had gone on  mr benjamin shook his head slowly  do you know miss thurwell that you are proposing a conspiracy to me  a conspiracy she repeated i dont understand  its very simple he went on gravely i have in my possession or shortly shall have every particular of this mr maddisons life i can show the connection between him and sir geoffrey kynaston and in short i can prove him guilty of murder what you ask me to do is to suppress this that is the moral side of the question then with regard to the practical side if this thing is gone on with we shall get the reward you promised and what is far more important to us a reputation which we have looked forward to as a certain foundation for a great extension of our business if on the other hand we drop it we get simply the reward which pardon my saying so would be a miserable return for all our labor that is how the matter stands from our point of view i think ive expressed it fairly father  mr levy who had assumed a far more contented expression solemnly assented what a son this was of his he thought bless him  helen was very pale and her heart was beating fast why had she come to this place and put herself in the power of these men it was too dreadful  i do not desire to hear a word of mr maddisons history she said this thing must be stopped i have my cheque book with me cannot you take money to withdraw from it  mr benjamin looked at his father gravely and mr levy shook his head  my dear young lady he said this is a very serious thing a very serious thing  the fact is said mr benjamin i was going to scotland yard for a warrant this morning  helen looked from one to the other appealingly with tears in her eyes mr benjamin appeared to be somewhat moved thereby  look here dad he said suppose we go into the other room and talk this thing over for a few minutes miss thurwell will not mind excusing us  oh no only dont be long she pleaded  they left her for barely five minutes although to her waiting in an agony of impatience it seemed much longer when they returned they both looked very solemn  we have talked this matter over thoroughly miss thurwell said mr benjamin taking up his old position at the desk and we cannot help seeing that it is a great risk for us to run to suppress our information and a great disappointment  quite so quite so interrupted mr levy a great risk and a great disappointment  still we are willing and anxious to help you mr benjamin continued and if you like we will do so on these terms if you like to give us a cheque for a thousand pounds we will agree to let the matter stand over for the present we cannot give you any undertaking to absolutely destroy or suppress any evidence we may have against mr maddison as that would be a distinct conspiracy but we will agree to suspend our present action and to do nothing without communicating with you  she moved to the desk and drew out her cheque book  i will do it she said give me a pen please  there was not the slightest sign of emotion on either of their faces they received the cheque bowed her out and watched her disappear into the street without making any sign then mr benjamins exultation broke out  dad i told you that our fortune was made didnt i was i right or wrong  mr levy was so overcome with parental affection that he could scarcely command his voice but he did so with an effort  you were right my son he exclaimed you were right benjamin we will go together and cash the cheque     chapter xix  an unpleasant discovery for bernard brown   a march wind was roaring over the open moorland driving huge masses of black clouds across the angry sky and whistling amongst the dark patches of pine trees until it seemed as though their slender stems must snap before the strain all around falcons nest the country not yet released from the iron grip of a late winter lay wasted and desolate and the heath which had lost all the glowing touch of autumn faded into the horizon bare and colorless nowhere was there any relief of outline save where the white front of thurwell court stretched plainly visible through a park of leafless trees  and of all the hours of the day it was at such a season the most depressing faint gleams of the lingering day still hung over the country struggling with the stormy twilight and a pale wan glare varied with long black shadows moved swiftly across the sea and the moorthe reflection of the flying clouds overhead  a single human being the figure of a tall man clad in an ulster buttoned up to the throat was making his way across the open country he walked rapidlyand indeed there was nothing to tempt any one to lingerand his destination was obvious he was on his way to falcons nest  a drearier abode than it appeared that afternoon never raised its four walls to the sky the grounds which surrounded it had been swept bare by the storms of winter and nothing had been done to repair the destruction which they had accomplished uprooted shrubs lay dead and dying upon the long dank grass and the creepers torn from the walls hung down in pitiful confusion every window reflected back the same blank uninviting gloom there was no light no single sign of habitation mr thurwell had evidently respected his tenants wish to the letter the place had not been touched or entered during his absence  the pedestrian mr bernard brown himself leaned over the gate for a moment silently contemplating the uninviting scene with a grim smile he had reasons of his own for being satisfied that the place had not been interfered with and it certainly seemed as though such were the case  after a few minutes hesitation he drew a key from his pocket and fitted it in the lock there was a resistance when he tried to turn it that he did not understand stooping down he suddenly tried the handle it opened smoothly the gate was unlocked he withdrew the key with trembling fingers all his relief at the dismantled appearance of the cottage had disappeared a strange unquiet look shone in his eyes and his manner suddenly became nervous and hurried he had locked the gate on his departure he was sure and mr thurwells steward had told him that there was no duplicate set of keys how could it have been opened save with a skeleton key  he walked quickly up the path to the front door here a greater shock still awaited him the latchkey which he held ready in his hand was not needed he tried the handle and the door opened  mr brown grew white to the lips and he shrank back as though afraid or reluctant to enter the house the door stood ajar he pushed it open with his stick and peered in upon the darkness everything was silent as the grave he listened for a moment and then his natural courage returning he stepped inside and closed the door after him the shutting out of the few gleams of daylight which lingered in the sky left him in utter darkness fumbling in his pocket he produced a wax candle wrapped in a piece of newspaper and a box of matches one of which he carefully struck  at first the gloom seemed too profound to be dispersed by the feeble flickering light but gradually as his eyes became accustomed to it he began to distinguish the more familiar objects half fearfully he glanced towards the door on the righthand side it stood half open there was no longer room for any doubt the house had been opened during his absence  the full realization of any disaster often brings with it a calm which to all outward appearance contrasts favorably with the prior state of anxiety this appeared to be the case with mr bernard brown his entrance to the house had been hesitating and anxious but as soon as he was convinced that what he dreamed had really come to pass his nervousness seemed to fall away from him and he was his old self again calm and resolute holding the flickering candle high above his head he moved steadily forward into the room on the righthand side of the entrance  everything here was exactly as he had left it the cases filled with books some half emptied some untouched still lay about the floor with the dust thick upon them he cast one swift glance around and then walked across and opened the door of the small inner room the sudden draught extinguished his candle and he found himself suddenly in total darkness the closely barred shutters which protected the low window were securely fastened and effectually shut out the lingering remnants of daylight stooping down he relit the candle which he was still carrying and holding it high over his head looked anxiously around one glance was sufficient in the corner of the room opposite to him was a small table where he always kept a basin of cold water and some clean towels round here the carpet had been torn up and rearranged with little pretence at concealment nearer the window stood a large oak cabinet the most important piece of furniture in the room and this he saw again in a moment had been tampered with it had been moved a little out of its position and one of the lower drawers stood partly open  like a man in a dream he slowly walked across to it and drew out a bunch of keys from his pocket the final test had yet to be applied and the final blow to fall  he unlocked the topmost partition and revealed a number of small drawers eagerly he drew out the topmost one and looked inside then he knew the worst it was empty there was no longer any doubt whatever his cottage had been entered by no ordinary housebreaker for the purpose of plunder but with a set of false keys and with a far more serious object the secret on which more than his life depended was gone     chapter xx  god that i may die   for a certain space of time which seemed to him indefinite but which was indeed of no great length he stood there stunned gazing at the rifled cabinet then as consciousness returned to him the roar of the storm without fell upon his ears and struck some strange note of accord with the tumult in his brain turning round he unbarred the shutters and opening the window stepped outside with slow uncertain steps he made his way through the dense black plantation of shrieking fir trees and out on to the cliffs here he paused and stood quite still looking across the sea there was no light in the sky but the veil of absolute darkness had not yet fallen upon the earth far away on the horizon was a lurid patch of deep yellow stormclouds casting a faint glimmer upon the foaming sea which seemed to leap up in a weird monotonous joy to catch the unearthly light from inland rolling across the moorland came phantomlike masses of vaporous cloud driven on by the fierce wind which boomed across the open country and shrieked and yelled amongst the pine plantations as though mad with a sudden hellish joy on the verge of the cliff he stretched out his arms as though to welcome the wild din of the night the thunder of the ocean seething and leaping against the rocks below shook the air around him the salt spray leaped up into his white face and the winds blew against him and the passionate cry of saddened nature rang in his deafened ears at that moment those things were a joy to him  and there came to him then something of that strange sweet calm which lays its soothing hand for a moment upon those who stand face to face with death or any other mighty crisis looking steadfastly far away beyond the foaming waste of waters to where one faint streak of stormlight shone on the horizon pictures of the past began to rise up before his eyes he saw himself again a happy lighthearted child riding gaily upon his fathers shoulder and laughing up into the beautiful face of his youthful mother the memories of that time and of his first home came back to him with a peculiar freshness and fragrance like a painting by one of the old masters perfect in design and with its deep rich coloring softened and mellowed by age he remembered the bright beauty of those sunny southern gardens where he had passed long hours listening to the gentle splashing of the water in the worn grey fountain bowl and breathing in the soft springlike air faint with the sweetness of roman violets and half unconsciously his thoughts travelled on to the time when all the pure beauty of his surroundingsfor his had been an artists homehad begun to have a distinct meaning for him and in the fervor of an esthetic and unusually thoughtful youth he had dreamed and felt and tasted deep of pleasures which the world yields only to those who stoop to listen to her secrets with the quickened sensibilities and glowing imagination of the artistone of her own children he had read her in such a way that he found himself struggling even in early boyhood for some means of expressionbut at that time none had come to him the fruits of his later life had been the result of his early experience but how embittered how saddened by the unchanging gloom which at one period had seemed as though it must dry up for ever all enthusiasm from his boyish heart what a fire of passions had blazed up and died away within him and as he thought of that sudden dying away he thought of the moment when they had been quenched for ever and of the voice which had quenched them again he crouched on his knees by the side of the sofa drawn up close to the high open windows of the italian villa and felt that thin white hand laid gently upon his trembling lips checking in a moment the flood of angry words which in his heart had been but the prelude to a curse the calm of that deathwhite face with its marble passionless pallor and saintlike beauty lingered still faithfully treasured up in the rich storehouse of his memory death alone would wipe it out it was one of the experiences of his life written alike into his undying recollection and into his heart  and then had come that period of severe struggle with himself out of which he had emerged not only a conqueror but with all the spoils of conquest for he had found himself after the battle was fought out and won possessed of a more triumphant selfcontrol and a complete mastery over those fierce earthly passions which had they held sway for long would in time most surely have weakened that higher and purer part of his nature from which all the good of his life had come it was indeed in some measure owing to the wholesome discipline of this struggle that he had found at last the longsoughtfor gift of expression and taking up the pen had sent forth golden words and thoughts into an age where such metal was rare indeed always there had been this dark cloud of anxiety looming over him and leading him into many countries and constantly denying him the peace for which he longed then had come the climax of it all the tragedy which had thrown over him the lowering cloud of a hideous danger failure was his the moment of trial had come and he had been unequal to it and day and night there rang ever in his ears the faint faroff whisper of those tremulous lips and the pleading light in those burning eyes seemed ever before him again he felt the touch of that icy cold hand and again he remembered the words of the oath which alas he had not kept oh it was horrible  once more his thoughts moved on a stage and this time they reached their climax before his fixed eyes there floated the image of a sweet wistful face glowing with healthy physical life and yet with all that delicate refinement of coloring and feature which had made her face linger in his artists memory for years before she had dwelt in his mans heart it was a torture of hell this that the fairest and sweetest part of a mans lifehis loveshould come to him at such a time and then for one brief moment all memory of his misery passed away from him and his whole being became absorbed in a luxury of recollection he thought of the change which his love had wrought in him what had life been before a long series of artistic and philosophical abstractions bringing their own peculiar content but a content never free from disquieting thought and restless doubts how could it be otherwise was he not human like other men asceticism and intellect and a certain purity of life which an almost epicurean refinement had rendered beautiful to him these easily keeping in sway his passionate temperament through all the long years of his life now only served to fan the flame of that great pure love which had suddenly leaped up within him a blazing unquenchable fire human emotion once aroused had thrilled through all his being with a sweet heartstirring music and his whole nature was shaking from its very foundation to him such a love seemed like the rounding of his life the panacea for all that vague disquiet which even in the moments of most perfect intellectual serenity had sometimes disturbed him the love of such a man was no light thing it had mingled with his hearts blood with the very essence of all his being no death no annihilation was possible for it it was a part of himself woven unchangeably into his life in a glowing skein the brilliant colors of which could never fade he looked into the future golden with the light of such a love and he saw a vision of perfect happiness of joy beyond all expression of deep calm content surpassing anything which he had known hand in hand he saw two figures himself and her gliding through the years with a sort of effortless energy tasting together of everything in life that was sweet and pure and beautiful scattering all trouble and worldly vexation to the winds by the touchstone of their undying love there was intoxicationethereal intoxication in such a vision the winds blew against him and the torrents of driven rain cold and stinging dashed themselves against his pale steadfast face down on the beach below the mad sea was thundering upon the cliffs flinging its white spray so high that it glittered like specks of luminous white light against the black waters yet he noticed none of it until the brilliancy of that vision which glowed before him faded nothing external could withdraw his thoughts  and fade away it did at last and neither the cold rain nor the howling wind had given him such a chill as crept through all his body when memory and realization drove forth this sweet flower of his imagination all the cruel hopelessness the horror of his position rushed in upon him like a foul nightmare he saw himself shunned and despised the faces of all men averted from him all that had gone to make his life worthy and even famous forgotten in the stigma of an awful crime he saw her eager beautiful face white and convulsed with horror shrinking away from him as from some loathsome object god it was madness to think of it let this thought go from him fade away from his reeling brain or he would surely go mad  heedless of the fury of the winds that roared over the moorland and sobbed and shrieked in the pine grove he threw himself upon his knees close to the very verge of the cliff and stretched out his hands to the darkened heavens in a passionate gesture of despair it was the first time during all the fierce troubles of a stormy life that he had shrunk down beaten for the moment by the utter hopelessness of the struggle which seemed to him now fast drawing toward its end  god that i may die he moaned that i may die  and as though in answer to his prayer life for him suddenly became a doubtful thing a wild gust of wind had uprooted a young fir tree from the plantation and bearing it with a savage glee toward the cliff side dashed it against the kneeling man there was no chance for him against it over they went man and tree together to all appearance bound for inevitable destruction  even in that second when he felt himself being hurled over the cliff by what force he knew not the consciousness of the sudden granting of his prayer flashed across his mind and strange though it may seem brought with it a deep content it was as he would have it be death sudden and unfelt but following close upon it came another thought so swiftly works the brain in the time of a great crisis he would be found dead and everyone in the light of what would soon be made known would surely call it suicide she would think so too death on such terms he would not willingly have  effort followed swiftly upon thought he clutched wildly at the cliff side during the first second of that flying descent and the wind bending it almost double brought a stunted fir tree sapling within his reach he grasped it and he was saved only a yard or two away the cliff side was black with them growing so closely together that he pulled himself with ease from one to another till he climbed over the cliff top and stood again upright on the ground  his hands were bleeding and his clothes were hanging round him in rags yet in a certain sense his narrow escape had done him good for it had brought very vividly before him the impiety of his prayer he had given way too long to maddening thoughts and they had unnerved him with the consciousness of his escape all the manliness of his nature reasserted itself he had faced this thing so long that he would face it now to the end let it come when it would he would summon up all his strength and meet it like a man after death was peace for everlasting god keep him in that faith  he turned away from the cliff and walked quickly back to the cottage making his plans as he went first he changed all his clothes and then opening again his rifled cabinet he transferred the remaining papers to a small handbag these were all his preparations but when he stepped out again and walked down the path of his garden a change had fallen upon the earth faint gleams of dawn were breaking through the eastern sky and though the sea was still troubled and crested with whitefoamed breakers the wind had gone down compared with the violence of the storm a few hours back the stillness of the gray twilight was full of a peculiar impressiveness peace after the storm rest after trouble  and something of this saddened peace crept into the heart of the solitary figure crossing the moorlandon his way back to face a doom which seemed closing in fast around him     chapter xxi  sir allan beaumerville has a caller   sir allan beaumerville bart dilettante physician and man of fashion was on the whole one of the most popular men in london society he was rich of distinguished appearance had charming manners and was a bachelor which combination might possibly account in some measure for the high esteem in which he was held amongst the opposite sex he had made his début in society quite late in life for he had succeeded to the baronetcy which was one of the oldest and richest in the country unexpectedly and as a young man londonfashionable london at any ratehad seen or known nothing of him nor indeed had he at any time had much to say to anyone about the earlier period of his life it was generally understood that he had lived abroad and that he had been in some sort of practice or how else could he have acquired his knowledge of the technical part of his profession beyond this nothing was known and although he was evidently a traveled man having much to say at times about all the interesting parts of southern europe no one ever remembered meeting him anywhere for the rest he had passed through none of the curriculum of english youth no public school had had his name upon its books nor had he even graduated in his own country but he had taken a very high degree indeed at heidelberg which had won him considerable respect among those who knew anything about such matters and his diplomas included half the letters of the alphabet and were undeniable and so when he had suddenly appeared in london on the death of his uncle and cousin a middleaged distinguished gentleman with manners a little foreign but in their way perfect society had voted him a great improvement on the former baronet and had taken him by the hand at once that was a good many years ago and very soon after his first introduction to the london world he had become a notable figure in it he had never missed a town season and at all its chief functions was a wellknown and popular figure always among the best and most exclusive set and always welcome there he had a yacht at cowes a share in a scotch moor a dozen or so hunters at his little place near melton a shooting box in derbyshire and a fine old mansion and estate in kent where everyone liked to be asked and where he had more than once had the honor of entertaining royalty there was only one thing in the world wanted to make sir allan beaumerville perfect women declared and that one thing was a wife but although no one appeared to appreciate more highly the charms of feminine societyas he showed in more ways than one both in st johns wood and in belgraviahe had never shown the least inclination to perform his duty to society in this respect how he managed to steer clear of the many snares and pitfalls laid for him in the course of his career puzzled a good many men but he did it and what was more remarkable still he made no enemies he had friendships among the other sex such as no man save he dared have indulged in to a like extent but with infinite skill he always seemed to be able to drop some delicate insinuation as to the utter absence of any matrimonial intention on his part which left no room for doubt or hope he was in short possessed of admirable powers of diplomacy which never failed him  of course his impregnability gave rise to all manner of stories he had been jilted in his youth he had a wife alive or he had had one and she was dead none of which rumors met any large amount of credence as to the first the idea of anyone jilting sir allan beaumerville even before his coming into the baronetcy found no favor in the feminine world no woman could have shown such ill judgment as that and besides he had very little of the melancholy which is generally supposed to attend upon such a disappointment as to the second it was never seriously entertained for if any woman had once claimed sir allan beaumerville as a husband she was scarcely likely to keep away from him especially now that he was occupying such a distinguished position the third was quite out of the question for even had he ever been marriedwhich nobody believedhe was scarcely the sort of man to wear the willow all his life and indeed it was very evident that he was not doing anything of the sort everyone knew of a certain little establishment beyond kensington way where sir allans brougham was often seen but of course no one thought the worse of him for that and without a doubt if sir allan had yielded to that gentle wish so often expressed and commenced domestic life in a more conventional manner in the great house at grosvenor square he would have forfeited at once a great deal of his popularity at any rate among the feminine part of his acquaintance as it was there was always a faint hope of winning him to add a zest to his delightful companionship and sir allan who was a very shrewd man was perfectly aware of this he was a sybarite of refined taste with an exquisite appreciation of the finer and more artistic pleasures of life and the society of educated and wellbred women was one of the chief of them rather than run any risk of deterioration in its quality he preferred to let things remain as they were and that he might enjoy it the more thoroughly without the restraint placed upon other men was the sole reason that he had not altogether abandoned his profession he never took any fee nor did he ever accept any casual patient but on certain days of the week at certain hours he was at home as a physician to certain of his lady acquaintances to whom he had already offered his services the number was always few for the invitations were rarely given and the patients generally remained upon the sick list for an indefinite period but there were few invitations more sought after somethingperhaps the very slight spice of impropriety which certain prudes who had not been asked affected to see in such an arrangementhad made them the fashion and then sir allan was undeniably clever altogether the idea was a great success for him  it had been one of sir allans afternoon receptions and as usual every patient on his list had paid him a visit having seen the last and most favored to her carriage sir allan returned to his study with a slight smile on his handsome face and the recollection of some delightfully confidential little speeches still tingling in his ears for a moment he stood on the hearth rug recalling them then he looked round the room and rang the bell a servant appeared almost immediately  clear these things away morton sir allan said pointing to some dainty marvels of china and a japanese teapot which stood on a little round table between two chairs and bring me a loose jacket from my room i am dining in downing street tonight and shall not want to dress before eight  the man obeyed and sir allan lighting a thick egyptian cigarette took up a french novel and stretched himself out in his easy chair  you are not at home to anyone else this afternoon sir the servant inquired before quitting the room  certainly not sir allan answered yawning has anyone been inquiring for me  yes sir  lady or gentleman  gentleman sirat least i think so he looks like one  any name  i didnt inquire sir i said that you were not at home but as he seemed very pressing i promised to try and ascertain when you would be at liberty  ask him his name sir allan directed  the man withdrew and returned in a moment or two looking a little puzzled  his name is brown sirmr bernard brown  sir allan was seldom clumsy in little things but at that moment he dropped the book which he had been reading upon the floor the servant hastened toward it but sir allan waved him away he preferred to pick it up himself  im afraid ive lost my place he remarked turning over the leaves you can show mr brown in here morton he added i may as well see what he wants  the man withdrew and sir allan recommenced the chapter then the door was opened again and the visitor was admitted sir allan laid the paper knife carefully in his place and shutting the book rose from his chair  mr brown he said i am very pleased to see you come and take a seat here  he stood up in an easy attitude upon the hearthrug and pointed with a smile to the chair which his last visitor had occupied but he did not offer his hand to mr brown nor did mr brown appear to expect it  the apartment was in the semigloom of twilight for the silver lamp burning on the bracket by sir allans side was covered with a rosecolored shade and threw all its light downward the art treasures with which the room was crowded and the almost voluptuous grace of its adornment and coloring were more suggested than seen mr brown who had advanced only a few steps from the closed door covered his eyes with his hand and looked a little dazed  do you live in darkness he said in a low tone i want to see your face  sir allan shrugged his shoulders and turned up the lamp a little higher than it was the faces of the two men were now distinctly visible to each other and the contrast between them was rather startling sir allans was placid courteous and inquiring mr browns was white almost to ghastliness and his eyes were burning with a strange light  i wish youd sit down my dear fellow sir allan remarked in a tone of goodnatured remonstrance it worries me to see you standing there and im sure you look tired enough  mr brown took no notice whatever of the invitation  i have come to see you sir allan beaumerville he said slowly to lay certain facts before you and to ask your advice concerning themas a disinterested party  very happy im sure to do the best i can sir allan murmured lighting a fresh cigarette i wish youd sit down to it though i suppose its about that murder we were mixed up in horrid affair it was  yes it was a very horrid affair mr brown repeated slowly  they havent caught the man yet i suppose  they have notyet  sir allan shrugged his fine shoulders  i fancy their chance is a poor one now then he remarked emitting a little cloud of smoke from his lips and watching it curl upward in a faint blue wreath to the ceiling how differently they manage affairs on the continent such a crime would not go undetected a day there  it will not be undetected here many more days mr brown said my own belief is that a warrant is already issued for the apprehension of the supposed murderer and i should not be surprised to hear that at this very moment the police were watching this house  sir allan looked hard at his guest and elevated his eyebrows  this is a very serious matter mr brown he said looking at him steadily in the face do i understand  i will explain mr brown interrupted quietly on my return to falcons nest yesterday i find that during my absence the cottage has been entered apparently by some one in authority for keys have been used my cabinet has been forced open and a number of my private letters and papers have been taken away certain other investigations have also been made obviously with the same object  sir allan maintained his attitude of polite attention but he had stopped smoking and his cigarette was burning unnoticed between his fingers  i scarcely see the connection yet he said suavely no doubt i am a little dense you speak about a number of private papers having been abstracted from your cabinet do i understandis it possible that anything in those papers could lead people to fix upon you as the murderer of sir geoffrey kynaston  the two men looked steadily into each others faces there was nothing in sir allans expression beyond a slightly shocked surprise in mr browns there was a very curious mixture indeed  most certainly was the quiet reply those letters plainly point out a motive for my having committed the crime  they are from  stop  sir allan started the word had burst from mr browns lips with a passion which his former quietude rendered the more remarkable there was a dead silence between them for fully a minute then mr brown having resumed his former manner spoke again  those letters he said tell the story of a certain episode in the life of sir geoffrey kynaston no other person is mentioned or alluded to in them yet the fact of their having been found in my possession makes them strong evidence against me  sir allan nodded  i dont know why on earth youve come to me for advice he remarked im not a lawyer  neither do i quite know still i have come and as i am here give it me  in a word thenbolt said sir allan laconically  that is your advice is it  i dont see anything else to do i dont ask you whether you are guilty or not and i do ask myself whether i am doing my duty in giving you any advice calculated to defeat the ends of justice i simply consider the facts and tell you what i should do if i were in your unfortunate position i should bolt  thank you sir allan for your advice so far mr brown said quietly there is just one little complication however which i wish to tell you of  yes might i trouble you to put the matter in as short a form as possible then sir allan remarked looking at his watch i am dining with the prime minister tonight and it is time i commenced to dress  i will not detain you much longer mr brown said the complication i fear will scarcely interest you for it is a sentimental one if i fled from england tonight i should leave behind me the woman i love  then why the devil dont you take her with you asked sir allan with a shrug of the shoulders shell go right enough if you ask her women like a little mystery  the woman whom i love appears to be of a different class to those from whom you have drawn your experience mr brown answered quietly i am not married to her  sir allan shrugged his shoulders lightly  well if shes a prude and wont go and you havent pluck enough to run away with her i dont know how to advise you he remarked  mr brown looked steadily into the others face sir allan met his gaze blandly  your speech sir allan betrays a cynicism which i believe is greatly in fashion just now mr brown said slowly sometimes it is altogether assumed sometimes it is only a thin veneer adopted in obedience to the decree of fashion believing that so far as you are concerned the latter is the case i beg you to look back into your past life and recall if possible some of its emotions again i tell you that if i fly from england i shall leave behind me the woman i dearly love i have come to you sir allan beaumerville with an effort i lay all these facts before you and i ask you to decide for me what shall i do  and i repeat my dear fellow answered sir allan suavely that the only advice i can give you is to leave england tonight  mr brown hesitated for a moment then he turned away toward the door without a word or gesture of farewell  by the by sir allan remarked one moment mr brown have you any objection to telling me the name of the lady who has been honored with your affection do i know her  you do her name is no concern of yours though  suddenly an unpleasant idea seemed to flash across sir allans mind he was more disturbed than he had been during the whole of the interview  of course you dont mean that charming miss thurwell he said quickly  the limits of mr browns endurance seemed to have been passed he turned suddenly round his eyes blazing with passion and walked across the room to within a few feet of sir allan he stood there with one hand grasping the back of a chair and looked at him  and if i did mean her sir what is that to you by what right do you dare to  suddenly his upraised hand fell both men stood as though turned to stone listening yet scarcely daring to glance toward the door it was the sound of mortons quiet voice and the trailing of skirts which had checked mr browns passionate speech  lady and miss thurwell  there was no time to move scarcely time for thought morton stood respectfully at the door and the two ladies were already on the threshold  my dear sir allanin lady thurwells silvery voicewhat will you think of such a late visit i felt ashamed to ask for you only we have been at the countess of applecorns in the next square and i could positively not pass your door when i remembered that it was your afternoon but you are all in darkness and you have a visitor havent you  the figures of the two men were barely visible in the deep gloom of the apartment for the lamp had burned low and gave little light lady thurwell had stopped just inside the room surprised  if only sir allans companion had been a patient what a delightful piece of scandal it would have been  lady thurwell ah how good of you exclaimed sir allan coming forward out of the shadow and you too miss helen i am honored indeed morton lights at once  we must not stay a moment declared lady thurwell shaking hands no we wont sit down thanks you know why weve called its about the opera tonight you got my note  i did lady thurwell and i can trustfully say that i never read one from you with more regret  then you have an engagement  unfortunately yes i am dining at downing street  well we must send for that schoolboy cousin of yours helen said lady thurwell laughing you see how dependent we are upon your sex after all why is that really you mr maddison she broke off suddenly as a tall figure emerged a little out of the gloom fancy meeting you here i had no idea that you and sir allan beaumerville were friends helen do you see mr maddison  i cant say that i do she answered with a low happy laugh but im very glad hes here  the lights were brought in as she finished her little speech and they all looked at one another lady thurwell broke into a little laugh  really this is a singular meeting she said but we mustnt stop a moment mr maddison we were hoping to see you yesterday afternoon do come soon  he bowed with a faint smile upon his lips  come out to the carriage with us please mr maddison helen said to him in a low tone as lady thurwell turned to go and he walked down the hall between them and out on to the pavement leaving sir allan on the steps  you will come and dine with me soon wont you mr maddison lady thurwell asked him as she touched his hand stepping into the brougham  i will come whenever you ask me he answered rashly  then come now said helen quickly we are all alone for the evening fancy that and we cant go out anywhere because we havent an escort do come  he looked at lady thurwell  it will be a real charity if you will she said smiling graciously we shall be bored to death alone  i shall be delighted he answered at once about eight oclock i suppose  halfpast seven please and well have a long evening said helen that will give you time to get to your club and dress goodby  they drove off and mr bernard brown walked swiftly away toward pall mall once he stopped in the middle of the pavement and broke into an odd little laugh it was a curious position to be in he was expecting every moment to be arrested for murder and he was going out to dine     chapter xxii  god forbid it   mr maddisonto drop at this point the name under which he had chosen to become the tenant of falcons nestwas a member of a wellknown london club chiefly affected by literary men and after his acceptance of lady thurwells invitation he hastened there at once and went to his room to dress as a rule a man does not indulge in any very profound meditation during the somewhat tedious process of changing his morning clothes for the monotonous garb of western civilization his attention is generally fully claimed by the satisfactory adjusting of his tie and the precaution he has to use to avoid anything so lamentable as a crease in his shirt and if his thoughts stray at all it is seldom beyond the immediate matter of his toilet or at most a little anticipation with regard to the forthcoming evening if on the right side of thirty a pair of bright eyes may sometimes make him pause for a moment even with the hair brushes in his hands to wonder if she will be there tonight and if by any fortunate chance he will be able to take her in to dinner and if the reign of the forties has commenced it is just possible that a little mild speculation as to the entrées may be admitted but as a rule a mans thoughts do not on such an occasion strike deep beneath the surface and there is no record of an author having laid the plan of his next work or a soldier having marked out a campaign while struggling with a refractory tie or obstinate parting even if such had ever happened to be the case we should not have cared to hear about it we prefer to think of a napoleon planning great conquests in the serene stillness of night among a sleeping camp and beneath a starlit sky or of a wordsworth writing his poetry in his cottage home among the mountains  but mr bernard maddison before he left his room that evening had come to a great decisiona decision which made his step the firmer and which asserted itself in the carriage of his head and the increased brightness of his eyes as he slowly descended the wide luxurious staircase and he felt calmer even happier from having at least passed from amid the shoals of doubt and uncertainty the slight nervousness had quite left him he was still more than ordinarily pale and there was a look of calm resignation in his thoughtful æsthetic face which gave to its intellectuality a touch of spirituality one of the members of the club said later on in the smoking room that maddison seemed to him to realize ones idea of st augustine in evening clothes so far as appearance went the comparison was not inapt  as he reached the hall the porter came up to him with his cloak  there is a gentleman waiting for you in the strangers room sir he said  mr maddison turned away that the man might not see the sudden dread in his face it was not a long respite he craved foronly one evening was even this to be denied him  any name he asked quietly  he gave none the man answered but i think it is sir allan beaumerville  ah mr maddison felt a sudden relief which escaped him in that brief interjection he was scarcely surprised at this visit i will go to him he said call me a hansom grey will you  the porter went outside and mr maddison crossed the hall and in a small dimlylit room found himself face to face with his visitor  sir allan wore the brilliant uniform of a colonel in the yeomanry for the dinner to which he was going was to be followed by an official reception but he was very pale and his manner had lost much of its studied nonchalance  i followed you here he began at once because after your departure i began to realize more fully the seriousness of what you told me  yes i thought at the time that your indifference was a little remarkable mr maddison said quietly the positions between them were entirely reversed it was sir allan beaumerville now who was placing a great restraint upon himself and mr maddison who was collected and at his ease  i was taken by surprise sir allan continued since you left me i have been picturing all manner of horrible things have you fully realized that you may be arrested at any moment on this frightful charge  i have fully realized it mr maddison answered calmly in fact when the porter told me that a gentleman wished to see me i imagined at once that it had come  and have you considered too sir allan continued how overwhelming the evidence is against you  i have considered it  then why do you linger here for one moment why dont you escape while you have the chance  why should i mr maddison answered i shall make no attempt to escape  sir allans face grew a shade more pallid and betrayed an agitation which he strove in vain to conceal  but supposing you are arrested he said quickly everything will go against you what shall you do  i shall accept my fate whatever it may be was the quiet reply i prefer this to flight life would not be very valuable to me as a skulking criminal in a foreign country if it be declared forfeit to the law the law shall have it  there was a sudden choking in sir allans voice and an almost piteous look in his face  god forbid it he cried god forbid it  and suddenly this hardened man of the world this professed cynic in an age of cynicism sank down in a chair and buried his head in his arms on the green baize writing table crushing the gold lace of his glittering uniform and the immaculate shirt front with its single diamond stud it was only for a moment that a sudden rush of feeling overcame him but when he looked up his face was haggard and he looked years older  does anyoneknow of this he asked in a hoarse tone  mr maddison shook his head  no one whatever as yet he said shortly if i am free tomorrow i shall go to italy  a sudden change swept into sir allans face he rose from his chair drawing himself up to his full height again he was the stately distinguished man of the world with little feeling in his voice or looks between him and this other man in his sober black with wasted face and thin stooping frame there was a startling difference  i have no doubt that you will do your duty mr maddison he said coldly although if i may be forgiven for saying so your method appears to me a little quixotic and in a certain sense singularly devoid of consideration for others i will not detain you any longer  he wrapped his long cloak around him and left the room in dignified silence mr maddison followed him to the steps and saw him get into his carriage they parted without another word     chapter xxiii  lovers   bernard maddison kept his engagement that evening and dined alone with lady thurwell and helen there had been some talk of going to the opera afterwards but no one seemed to care about it and so it dropped through  for my part lady thurwell said as they sat lingering over their dessert i shall quite enjoy an evenings rest you literary men mr maddison talk a good deal about being overworked but you know nothing of the life of a chaperon in the season i tell helen that she is sadly wanting in gratitude we do everything worth doingpicture galleries matinées shopping afternoon calls dinners dances receptionswhy theres no slavery like it  helen laughed softly  we do a great deal too much aunt she said i am almost coming round to my fathers opinion you know mr maddison he very seldom comes to london and then only when he wants to pay a visit to his gunmaker or to renew his hunting kit or something of that sort london life does not suit him at all  i think your father a very wise man he answered he seeks his pleasures in a more wholesome manner  she looked thoughtful  yes i suppose ethically the life of a man about town is on a very low level that is why one meets so few who interest one as a rule dont you think all this society life very frivolous mr maddison  i am not willing to be its judge he answered yet it is a moral axiom that the higher we seek for our pleasures the greater happiness we attain to i am an uncompromising enemy to what is known as fashionable society so i will draw no conclusions  it is intellect and artistic sensibility versus sensuousness yawned lady thurwell im a weak woman and im afraid im too old to change my ways but im on the wrong side of the argument all the same at least i should be if i took up the cudgels  which are the greater sinners mr maddison asked helen smiling men of the world or women of the world  without doubt men he answered quickly however we may talk about the equality of the sexes the fact remains that women are born into the world with lighter natures than men they have at once a greater capacity and more desire for amusement pure and simple they wear themselves out in search of it more especially the women of other nations and after all when their life has passed they have never known the meaning of real happiness of the pleasures that have no reaction and that sweet elevation of mind that is only won by thought and study  poor women murmured lady thurwell mr maddison you are making me quite uncomfortable paint my sex in more glowing colors please or leave them alone remember that i am the only middleaged woman here i dont count helen at all i see that she is something of your way of thinking already traitress do light a cigarette mr maddison i adore the perfume of them and so does helen  he took one from the box she passed him and gravely lit it they were doing everything in a very informal manner dinner had been served in the library a cozy little apartment with a large open grate in which a cheerful fire had been lit the ordinary table had been dispensed with in favor of a small round one just large enough for them and now with dessert on the table they had turned their chairs round to the fire in very homelike fashion  do you know i like this helen said softly i think it is so much better than a dinner party or going out anywhere  see what a difference the presence of a distinguished man of letters makes laughed lady thurwell now only a few hours ago we were dreading a very dull eveninghelen as well as myself how nice it was of you to take pity on us mr maddison  especially considering your aversion to our society put in helen are not you really thinking it a shocking waste of time to be here talking to two very unlearned women instead of seeking inspiration in your study  he looked at her reproachfully  i know nothing of lady thurwells tastes he said but you can scarcely call yourself unlearned you have read much and you have thought  a pure accidenti mean the thinking she answered lightly if i had not been a country girl with a mind above my station intellectually theres no telling what might have happened town life is very distracting if you once get into the groove isnt it aunt  lady thurwell who was a thorough little dame de société rose with a pout and shrugged her shoulders  im not going to be hauled over the coals by you superior people any longer she answered i shall leave you to form a mutual improvement society and go and write some letters when you want me come into the drawing room but dont come yet thank you mr maddison she added as he held the door open for her be merciful to the absent wont you  and so they were alone as he closed the door and walked across the room to his seat there came back to him with a faint bewildering sweetness something of the passionate emotion of their farewell in the pine grove on the cliff he felt his pulses quicken and his heart beat fast it was in vain that the dying tenets of his old life a life of renunciation and solitude feebly reasserted themselves at that moment if never before he knew the truth the warm fresh sunlight lay across his barren life brightening with a marvelous glow its gloomiest corners the old passionless serenity in which the human had been crushed out by the intellectual was gone forever he loved this woman  and she was very fair he stole a long glance at her as she leaned back in her low wicker chairthe fond glance of a loverand he felt his keenly artistic sense stirred from its very depths by her purely physical beauty the firelight was casting strange gleams upon the deep golden hair which waved about her oval face and shapely forehead in picturesque unrestraint and there was an ethereal glow in her exquisite complexion a light in her eyes which seemed called up by some unusual excitement  the setting of the picture too was perfect her ivory satin gown hung in long straight lines about her slim perfect outline with all the grace of greek drapery unrelieved save by one large bunch of neapolitan violets nestling amongst the folds of old lace which filled up the open space of her bodice he stood and looked at her with a strange confusion of feelings a new life was burning in his veins and for the first time since his boyhood he doubted his absolute selfmastery dared he stay there could he sit by her side and bandy idle words with her  the silence had lasted for several minutes and was beginning to possess something of that peculiar eloquence which such silences usually have at last she raised her eyes and looked at him standing motionless and thoughtful amongst the shadows of the room and at the first glance he felt his strength grow weak and his passionate love rising up like a living force for there was in her eyes and in her face and in her voice when she spoke something of that softening change which transfuses a womans being when she loves and lets the secret go from hera sort of mute yielding an abandonment having in it a subtle essence of unconscious invitation  come and talk to me she said softly why do you stand out there  he made one last despairing effort with a strangely unnatural laugh he drew a chair to her side and began to talk rapidly never once letting his eyes rest upon her loveliness striving to keep his thoughts fixed upon his subject but all the time acutely conscious of her presence he talked of many things with a restless energy which more than once caused her to look up at him in wonderment he strove even to keep her from answering him lest the magic of her voice should turn the trembling scale for her sake he unlocked the inmost recesses of his mind and all the rich store of artistic sensations of jealously preserved memories came flooding out clothed with all that eloquence of jeweled phrase and daintily turned sentence which had made his writings so famous for her sake too he sent his imagination traveling through almost untrodden fields bringing back exquisite word pictures and lifting the curtain before many a landscape of sunsmitten thought all the music of sweet imagery and pure bracing idealism thrilled through her whole being this was indeed a man to love and as his speech grew slower and she heard again that peculiar trembling in his tone the meaning of which her womans heart so easily interpreted she began to long for those few words from him which she felt would be the awakening of a new life in her he could not fail to notice even that slight change and wondering whether her attention was commencing to flag he paused and their eyes met in a gaze full of that deep tragical intensity which marks the birth between man and woman of any new sensation the fire which glowed in his eyes told her of his love as plainly as the dreamy yet expressive light which gleamed in hers spoke also to him and when her head drooped before the gathering passion in his face and the faint color streamed into her cheeks no will of his could keep the words back any longer he felt his breath come quickly and his heart almost stop beating his pulses were quickening and a strange new delight stole through him surely this was the end he could bear no more  and it seemed as though it were indeed so for with a sudden impulse he caught hold of her white ringless hand and drew it gently toward him there was a slight instinctive resistance which came and went in a space of time only a thought could measure then she yielded it to him and the sense of her touch stole through his veins with a sort of dreamy fascination to give place in a moment to the overmastering fire of his great passion  her face was turned away from him but he saw the faint color deepen in her cheeks and the light quivering of the lip and then a torrent of feeling before which his last shaking barriers of resistance crumbled away like dust swept from his heart striking every chord of his nature with a crash of wild music  helen my love my love he cried  and she turned round her eyes dim with trembling tears yet glowing with a great happinessturned around to feel his arms steal around her and hold her clasped to his heart in a mad sweet embrace and it seemed to her that it was for this that she had lived     chapter xxiv  a womans love   it seemed to him in those few golden moments of his life that memory died away and time stood still the past with its hideous sorrows and the future over which it stretched its chilling hand were merged in the present life had neither background nor prospect the overpowering realization of the elysium into which he had stepped had absorbed all sense and all knowledge they were together and words were passing between them which would live to eternity in his heart  but the fairest summer sky will not be fair forever clouds will gather and drive before them the sweetness and joy from the smiling heavens and memory is a mistress who may slumber but who never sleeps those moments of entrancing happiness although in one sense they lasted a lifetime were in the ordinary measure of time but of brief duration for with something of the overmastering suddenness with which his passion had found expression there swept back into his heart all the still cold flow of icy reminiscence she felt his arms loosen around her and she raised her head wondering from his shoulder wonder that turned soon to fear for he rose up and stood before her white and with a great agony in his dark eyes  i have been mad he muttered hoarsely forgive me i must go  she stood up by his side pale but with no fear or weakness in her look she too had begun to realize  tell me one thing she said softly you dolove me  god knows i do he answered the words came from his heart with a nervous intensity which showed itself in his quivering lips and the vibration of his tone she knew their truth as surely as though she had seen them written in letters of fire and that knowledge or rather her absolute confidence in it made her in a measure bold the dainty exclusiveness which had half repelled half attracted other men had fallen away from her she stood before him a loving tearful woman with something of that gentle shame which is twin sister to modesty burning in her cheeks  then i will not let you go she said softly taking both his hands in hers and holding him tightly nothing shall come between us  he looked into the love light which gleamed in her wet eyes and stooping down he took her again into his arms and kissed her  my darling he whispered passionately my darling but you do not know  yes i do she answered drawing him gently back to their old place you mean about what rachel kynaston said that awful night dont you  more than that alas he answered in a low tone other people besides rachel kynaston have had suspicions about me i have been watched and while i was away falcons nest has been entered and papers have been taken away  she was white with fear this was benjamin levys doing and it was through her ought she to tell him she could not she could not  but they do notthe papers i meanmake it appear that  helen he interrupted with his face turned away from her it is best that you should know the truth those papers reveal the story of a bitter enmity between myself and sir geoffrey kynaston when you consider that and the other things you will see that i may at any moment be arrested  a spasm of pain passed across her face at that moment her thoughts were only concerned with his safety the terrible suggestiveness of what he had told her had very little real meaning for her then her one thought was could she buy those papers if all her fortune could do it it should be given only let him never know and let him be safe  bernard she whispered softly i am not afraid it is very terrible but it cannot alter anything love cannot come and go at our bidding it is forever nothing can change that  he stopped her lips with passionate kisses and then he tried to tear himself away but she would not let him go a touch of that complete selfsurrender which comes even to the proudest woman when she loves had made her bold  have i not told you bernard she whispered that i will not let you go  helen you must he said hoarsely who knows but that tomorrow i may stand in the dock charged with that hideous crime  if they will let me i shall gladly stand by your side she answered  he turned away and his shaking fingers hid his face from her  oh this is too much for a man to bear he moaned helen helen there must be nothing of this between you and me  nothing between you and me she repeated with a ring of gentle scorn in her voice bernard do you know so little of women after all do you think that they can play at love in this giveandtake fashion  he did not answer she stood up and passed one of her arms around his neck and with the other hand gently disengaged his fingers from before his face  bernard dearest look at me all things can be changed by fashion or expediency save a womans love and that is eternal dont think please of any of these terrible things that may be in store for us or what other people would think or say i want you to remember that love even though it be personal love is far above all circumstance no power in this world can alter or change it it belongs to that better part of ourselves which lifts us above all misfortune and trouble you have given me a great happiness bernard and you shall not take it away from me whatever happens to you it is my right to share it remember for the future it is we not i you must not think of yourself alone in anything for i belong now to everything that concerns you  and so it was that for the first time in his life bernard maddison who had written much concerning them much that was both faithful and beautiful saw into the inner life of a true woman only for the man whom she loves will she thus lift the curtain from before that sweet depth of unselfishness which makes even the homeliest of her sex one of the most beautiful of gods creations and he if he be in any way a man of human sensibility and capacity must feel something of that wondering awe that reverence with which bernard maddison drank in the meaning of her words the mute anxiety of her tearful gaze the color which came and fled from her facehe understood all these signs they were to him the physical the material covering for her appeal a life of grand thoughts of everclimbing ideas of pure and lofty aims had revealed to him nothing so noble and yet so sweetly human as this had filled his being with no such heartshattering emotion as swept through him at that moment a womans hand had lifted him out from his despair into a higher state and there was a great humility in the silent gesture with which he yielded his will to hers  and then again there were spoken words between them which no chronicles should report and a certain calm happiness took up its settled place in his heart defiant of that despair which could not be driven out then came that reawakening to mundane things which seems like a very great step indeed in such cases she looked at the clock and gave a little start  bernard it is nearly eleven oclock she cried we must go into the drawingroom at once what will aunt think of us you must come with me of course but youd better say good night now there that will do sir  she drew away and smoothed her ruffled hair back from her forehead looking ruefully in the glass at her tearstained cheeks and down at the crushed violets in her corsage  may i have them he asked  she drew them out and placed them in his hand  tomorrow she said  tomorrow i must go into the land of violets he interrupted  she turned round quickly  what do you mean you are not going away without my permission sir  then i must seek it he answered smiling you have given life such an exquisite sweetness for me that i am making plans already to preserve it my one hope lies in italy  how long should you be away she asked anxiously  not a week he answered if i am permitted to leave england which i fear is doubtful tomorrow i can be back perhaps in five days  then you may go bernard she whispered take this with you and think of me sometimes  she had drawn out a photograph of herself from a folding case on the mantelpiece and he took it from her eagerly  nothing in the world could be so precious to me he said  for a novice you say some very nice things she answered laughing softly and now you must go sir no you neednt come into the drawingroom i really couldnt show myself with you ill make your excuses to my aunt farewelllove  farewellsweetheart he answered hesitating for a moment over the words which seemed so strange to him then as though loth to leave him she walked down the hall by his side and they looked out for a moment into the square a footman was standing prepared to open the door but helen sent him away with a message to her maid  do you know why i did that she asked her clasp tightening upon his arm  he shook his head and looked down at her fondly  i cant imagine unless  she glanced half fearfully behind and then up into his face again with a faint blush stealing into her cheeks  i want one more kiss please  he looked into her soft trustful face and he felt with a sense almost of awe the preciousness of such a love as this a love which comprehending the terrible period of anxiety through which he had to pass was not ashamed to seek to sweeten it for him by the simple charm of such an offering then at the sound of returning footsteps in the hall he let go her hands and with her fond farewell still lingering in his ears he hurried out into the street     chapter xxv  mr levy junior goes on the continent   mr benjamin levy was standing in his favorite position before the office fireplace with his legs a little apart and his small keen eyes fixed upon vacancy it was thus in that very pose and on that very hearthrug that he had thought out more than one of those deeplaid schemes which had brought a certain measure of notoriety to the firm of which he was a shining light and at that very moment he was engaged in deep consideration concerning the case in which his energies were at present absorbed  a few feet away his father was carefully calculating with the aid of a ready reckoner the compound interest on a little pile of bills of exchange which lay before him every now and then he paused and looking up from his task glanced cautiously into his sons perplexed face curiosity at length culminated in speech  what was you thinking benjamin my son he said softly the miss thurwell case is plain before us is it not there is nothing fresh is there no fresh business eh my son  mr benjamin started and abandoned his reflections  no nothing fresh dad it was the thurwell affair i was thinking of give me the keys will you  mr levy leaned back in his chair and produced from his trousers pocket a jingling bunch of keys  mr benjamin took them in thoughtful silence and opening the safe drew out a packet of faded letters tied up with ribbon from these he selected one and carefully replaced the rest  those letters again remarked his fond parent chuckling take care of them benjamin take care of them they was worth their weight in gold to us  theyre worth a great deal more than that remarked mr benjamin carelessly theres only one thing dad that puzzles me a bit  it must be a rum thing my boy that does that his fond parent remarked admiringly i never praise undeservedly but i must say this benjamin youve managed this thurwell affair marvelouslymarvelously come let me see what it is that is too deep for you  he rose and looked over his sons shoulder at the letter which he was readingone thin sheet of foreign note paper covered with closely written lines of faint angular writing and emitting even now a delicate musky scent  what is it benjaminwhat is it  his son laid his finger on a sentence toward the close of the letter and read it aloud       what that fear has been to me and what it has grown into during my      sad lonely life i cannot hope to make you understand always those      terrible words of vengeance ring in my ears as i heard them last      they seem to roll over sea and land and in the middle of the night      and out in the sunlit street i seem to hear them still it is not      you i fear bernard so much as him  mr levy listened and nodded approvingly  all is plain there benjamin i think the meaning is quite clear  mr benjamin laid his finger upon the last sentence  what do you make of that dad he asked  mr levy adjusted his spectacles and read it slowly  it is not for you i fear bernard so much as him tut tut thats simple enough he declared this woman whoever she may be is afraid of a meeting between sir geoffrey kynaston and mr bernard maddison to give him his right name and she remarks that it is for him she fears and not for sir geoffrey quite right too considering the affectionate tone of these letters  yes i suppose thats it mr benjamin remarked in an absent tone folding up the letter and putting it back amongst the rest  mr levy watched him narrowly and returned to his desk with a sense of injury his sonhis benjaminhad discovered something which he was not going to confide to the parental ear it was a blow  he was wondering whether it might have the desired effect if he were to produce a scrap of old yellow pocket handkerchief and affect to be overcome when they heard a hurried footstep outside both looked up anxiously there was a quick knocking at the door and a shabbylooking man dressed in black entered  well leekson what news mr benjamin asked quickly  hes off was the prompt reply continent afternoon train waterloo three oclock  mr benjamins eyes sparkled  i knew it he exclaimed triumphantly jobs over leekson get me a cab and go to the office for your money  youre going to let him go cried mr levy piteously  not i im going with him dad a fiftypound note from the safe quick  mr levy gave it to him with trembling fingers  now dad listen to me benjamin said earnestly reaching down his overcoat from the peg miss thurwell will be here some time today im certain to try and buy those letters ive changed my mind about them sell  sell repeated mr levy surprised i thought that that was what we were not to do  never mind never mind im playing a better game than that now continued mr benjamin ill leave it to you to make the bargain theres no one can beat you at that you know dad  mr levy acknowledged his sons compliment with a gratified smile  well well benjamin well say nothing about that ill do my best you may be sure he declared fervently  i may as well just mention that i have ascertained how much money she has got mr benjamin went on shes worth until her father dies about fifteen thousand pounds we wont be hard on her suppose we say five thousand the lowest eh  all right benjamin all right the old man murmured rubbing his hands softly together five thousand pounds my eye and how long shall you be away  i cant quite tell dad just keep your pecker up and stick to the biz  yes ben yes and of course you cant stop to tell me about it now but wont this five thousand pounds from the young lady about put an end to this little game eh and if so need you go following this mr maddison all over the country eh an expensive journey ben youve got that fiftypound note you know  mr benjamin laughed contemptuously  youll never make a pile you wont dad he exclaimed youre so plaguedly narrow minded listen here he added drawing a little closer to him and looking round over his shoulder to be sure that no one was listening to him when i come back ill make you open your eyes you think this thing played out do you bah the letters arent worth twopence to us when i come back from abroad im going to commence to play this game in a manner thatll rather astonish you and a certain other person tata guvnor  mr benjamin levy was a smart young man but he had a narrow escape that afternoon for as he was sauntering up and down the platform at waterloo whom should he see within a dozen yards of him but mr maddison and miss thurwell he had just time to jump into a thirdclass carriage and spread a paper out before his face before they were upon him  jove that was a shave he muttered to himself blest if i thought they were as thick as that i wonder if shes going with him no theres no female luggage and thats her maid hanging about behind there moses aint she a slapup girl and aint they just spooney dd if he aint kissed her he wound up as the train glided out of the station leaving helen thurwell on the platform waving her handkerchief well were off so far so good i feel like winning  but unfortunately for mr benjamin there was a third person in that train whom neither he nor mr maddison knew of who was very much interested in the latter had he only mentioned his name or referred in the slightest possible way to his business abroad before mr benjamin that young gentleman would have promptly abandoned his expedition and returned to town but as he did not all three traveled on together in a happy state of ignorance concerning each other and mr benjamin levy was very near experiencing the greatest disappointment of his life     chapter xxvi  helen decides to go home   mr benjamin levys surmise had been an accurate one late in the afternoon of that day helen thurwell called at the little office off the strand and when she left it an hour later she had in her pocket a packet of letters and mr levy had in his safe a check and promissory note for five thousand pounds both were very well satisfiedmr levy with his money and helen with the consciousness that she had saved her lover from the consequences of what she now regarded as her great folly  she was to have dined out that evening with her aunt but when the time to dress came she pleaded a violent headache and persuaded lady thurwell who was a goodnatured little woman to take an excuse  but my dear helen you dont look one bit ill she had ventured to protest and the cullhamptons are such nice people are you sure that you wont come  if you please aunt she had begged i really do want to stay at home this evening and lady thurwell had not been able to withstand her nieces imploring tone so she had gone alone  helen spent the evening as she had planned to she took her work down into the room where they had been the night before and where this wonderful thing had happened to her then she leaned back in her low chairthe same chairand gave herself up to the luxury of thought and when a young woman does that she is very far gone indeed it was all so strange to her so bewildering that she needed time to realize it  and as she sat there her eyes full of a soft dreamy light fixed upon vacancy and her lips parted in a happy smile she felt a sudden longing to be back again upon the moorland cliffs round thurwell court out in the open country with her thoughts this town season with its monotonous round of gayety was nothing to her now more than ever in the enlarged and sweeter life which seemed opening up before her she saw the littleness and enervating insipidity of it all she would go down home and take some booksthe books he was fond ofand sit out on the cliffs by the sea and read and dream and think over all he had said to her and look forward to his coming it should be there he would find her they two alone would stand together under the blue sky and wander about in the sunshine over the blossoming moors would not this be better than meeting him again in a crowded london drawingroom she knew that he would like it best  so when lady thurwell returned from her party and was sitting in her room in a very becoming dressing gown yawning and thinking over the events of the evening there was a little tap at the door and helen entered similarly attired  please tell me all about it she begged drawing up a chair to the fire my headache is quite gone  so i should imagine remarked lady thurwell i never saw you look better what have you been doing to yourself child you look like aphrodite new bathed in paphian wells  if you mean to insinuate that ive had a bath laughed helen i admit it now tell me all about this evening  which of course lady thurwell did and found a good deal to say about the dresses and the menu  by the bye she wound up with a curious look at her niece sir allan beaumerville was there and seemed a good deal disappointed at the absence of a certain young lady  indeed answered helen that was very nice of him and now aunt do you know what i came in to say to you  lady thurwell shook her head  havent any idea helen has anyone been making love to you  helen shook her head but the color gathered in her cheeks and she took up a screen as though to protect her face from the fire  i want to go home aunt dont look so startled please i heard from papa this morning and hes not very well and lord thurwell comes back tomorrow so you wont be lonely and ive really quite made my mind up town is very nice but i like the country best  like the country best in may lady thurwell gasped my dear child have you taken leave of your senses  not quite aunt helen answered smiling only it is as i say i like the country best and i would really rather go home  lady thurwell considered for a full minute being a very juvenile matron she had by no means enjoyed her rôle as chaperon to an acknowledged beauty she had offered it purely out of good nature and because although only related by marriagelord thurwell was the elder brother of mr thurwell of thurwell court and the head of the familystill there was no one else to perform such a service for helen but if helen did really not care for it and wished to return to her country life why there was no necessity for her to make a martyr of herself any longer  you really mean this helen  i do indeed aunt  then it is settled make your own arrangements i have liked having you child and whenever you choose to come to me again you will be welcome but of course it is not everyone who cares for town life and if you do not you are quite right to detach yourself from it im afraid i know several young men wholl take your sudden flight very much to heart and one who isnt particularly young  nonsense laughed her niece therell be no mourning on my account  we shall see remarked lady thurwell sententiously if one person does not find his way down to thurwell court after you before long i shall be surprised  please dont let anyone do anything so stupid aunt pleaded helen with sudden warmth it would beno good  lady thurwell lifted her eyebrows and looked at her niece with a curious little smile  who is it she asked quietly  but helen only laughed her secret was too precious to part withyet     chapter xxvii  mr thurwell makes some inquiries   and so helen had her own way and went back to her home on the moors where mr thurwell who had just finished his hunting season was very glad to see her although not a little surprised but she told him no more than she had told her aunt that she had no taste for london life the time would soon come when he would know the whole truth but until her lovers return the secret was her own  she had one hasty note from him posted in paris on his way to italy and though there were only a few lines in it she treasured up the little scrap of paper very tenderly for such as it was it was her first love letter he had given her an address in the small town to which he was bound and she noticed with a slight wonder at the coincidence that it was the same place where he had first seen her she had written to him and now there had come a pause she had nothing to do but to wait  but though such waiting is at best but a tedious matter those few days brought their own peculiar happiness to her she would have found it impossible to have confided her secret to any human being she had no bosom friend to whom she could go for sympathy but her healthy openair life her long solitary walks and a certain vein of poetry which she undoubtedly possessed had given her some of that passionate almost personal love of nature which is sweeter by far than any human friendship for her those long stretches of wild moorland with the dark silent tarns and fardistant line of blue hills the high cliffs where the sea wind roared with all the bluster and fury of a late march the sea itself with its everchanging face the faint streaks of brilliant color in the evening sky or the wan glare of a stormy morningall these things had their own peculiar meaning to her and awoke always some echo of response in her heart and it chanced that at that time all the sweet breezy freshness of a late spring was making glad the country which she loved and the perfect sympathy of the season with her own happiness seemed to her very sweet for it was springtime too in her heart a new life glowed in her veins and sometimes it seemed to her that she could see the vista of her whole future bathed in the warm sunlight of a newborn happiness the murmuring pine groves the gay reveling of the birds the budding flowers and heathall these things appealed to her with a strange sympathetic force so she took long walks and came home with sparkling eyes and her cheeks full of a rich color till her father wondered what had come to his proud silent daughter to give this new buoyancy to her frame and added physical beauty to her face which had once seemed to him a little too spirituelle and ethereal  once more helen and her father sat at breakfast out on the sheltered balcony of thurwell court below them the gardens still slightly coated with the early morning dew were bathed in the glittering sunshine and in the distance and over the tops of the trees in the park a slight feathery mist was curling upward the sweet fresh air still a little keen was buoyant with all the joyous exhilaration of spring and nature free at last from the saddened grip of winter was reasserting itself in one glad triumphant chorus down in the park the slumberous cawing of the rooks triumphed over the lightervoiced caroling of innumerable thrushes and blackbirds and mingled with the faint humming of a few early bees seemed to fill the air with a sweetly blended strain of glad music it was one of those mornings typical of its own season in which the whole atmosphere seems charged with quickening life summer with its warm luscious glow and autumn with its clear calm repose have their own special charms but a spring morning coming after the deep sadness of a hard winter gains much by the contrast there is overflowing energy and passionate joy in its newly beating pulses the warm delight of reawakening life happy to find the earth so fair a place which the staider charms of a more developed season altogether lack  it was in some measure owing to this influence and also to the fact that she held in her hand a letter from her lover which her father had handed her without remark but with a somewhat curious glance that helen was feeling very happy that morning the last year had dealt strangely with her tragedy had thrown its startling gloomy shadow across her life and had left traces which could never be altogether wiped out anxieties of another sort had come perplexities and strange unhappy doubts although these last had burned with a fitful uncertain flame and now seemed stilled for ever but triumphing over all these was this newborn love the great deep joy of a womans life so vast so sweet and beautiful that it transfuses her whole being and seems to lift her into another world  and so helen leaning back in her chair with her eyes wandering idly over the pleasant gardens and park below to where through a deep gap in the trees was just visible a faint blue line of sea was wrapped up very much in her own thoughts and scarcely doing her duty toward entertaining her father indeed she seemed almost unconscious of his presence until he looked up suddenly from a letter he was reading and asked her a question  by the bye helen he said ive meant to ask you something every day since youve been home but i have always forgotten it who was that young man who came down here to help johnson with the auditing and who went away so suddenly a protégé of yours i suppose as he came here on your recommendation  yes i was interested in him she answered looking steadily away and with a faint color in her cheeks why do you ask did he not do his work properly  oh yes he did his work very well i believe mr thurwell said impatiently it was what he did after working hours and which has just come to my notice which makes me ask you it seems he spent the whole of his spare time making covert but i must say ingenious inquiries respecting sir geoffreys murder and i am also given to understand that he paid falcons nest an uninvited visit in the middle of the night what does it all mean was it merely curiosity or had he any object in it  i thinkhe had an object she answered slowly  indeed mr thurwell raised his eyebrows and waited for an explanation  you remember papa that awful scene here when rachel kynaston died and what her last words to me were  yes i remember perfectly mr thurwell answered gravely  well at that time i could not help having just a suspicion that mr brown must be mixed up in it in some way and it seemed to me that i should not be quite at ease if i let matters go on without doing anything so iwell this young man came down here to see whether he could find out anything  mr thurwell seldom frowned at his daughter of whom he was secretly a little afraid but he did so now he was seriously angry  it was not a matter for you to have concerned yourself in at all he said rising from his seat at least i should have been consulted  it was all very foolish i know she admitted humbly  it was worse than foolish it was wrong and undutiful he declared i am astonished that my daughter should have mixed herself up with such underhand work and may i ask why i was kept in ignorance  because you would not have allowed me to do what i did she said quietly with downcast eyes i thought it was my duty i have been punishedpunished severely  he softened a little and resumed his seat she was certainly very contrite he was silent for a moment or two and then asked her a question  did this young mandetective i suppose he wasfind out anything about mr brown  she looked up a little surprised at the curiosity in his tone  why papa it was i who found out how stupid i had been she said when i discovered that our mysterious tenant was bernard maddison of course i saw the absurdity of suspecting him at once  mr thurwell moved a little uneasily in his chair  he did not find out anything then he asked  she was silent she had not expected this and she scarcely knew how to answer  he found out what mr browni mean mr maddisonhimself told me that he had known sir geoffrey abroad  nothing more  i did not ask to tell the truth i was not interested the idea of mr maddison being connected with such a crime is simply ridiculous i was heartily sorry that i had ever taken any steps at all  mr thurwell lit a cigarette and drew his remaining letters toward him  i must confess he said slowly that when his house was searched in my presence and all that we discovered was that mr brown was really bernard maddison i felt very much as you feel and as you no doubt remember i went out of my way to be civil to the man and brought him up here to dine but since then things have cropped up and im bound to say that it looks a little queer i hear that young man of yours told several people that he had in his pocket what would bring mr brown to the scaffold any day  it is not true she answered in a low firm tone i know that it is not true  mr thurwell shrugged his shoulders  i hope not im sure still id rather he did not come back here again some one must have done it you see and if it was a stranger he must have been a marvelous sort of fellow to come into this lonely part of the country and go away again without leaving a single trace  criminals are all clever at disguises she interposed  doubtless but they have yet to learn the art of becoming invisible he went on drily im afraid its no use concealing the fact that things look black against maddison and there is more than a whisper in the county about it if hes a wise fellow hell keep away from here  he will not she answered he will come back he is innocent  mr thurwell saw the rising flush in his daughters face but he had no suspicion as to its real cause he knew that bernard maddison was one of her favorite authors and he put her defence of him down to that fact he was not a particularly warm advocate on either side and suddenly remembering his unopened letters he abandoned the discussion  helen whose calm happiness had been altogether disturbed rose in a few minutes with the intention of making her escape but her father with an open letter in his hand checked her  have you been seeing much of sir allen beaumerville in town helen he asked  yes a great deal why she asked  hes coming down here mr thurwell said he asks whether we can put him up for a night or two as he wants to do some botanizing of course we shall be very pleased i did give him a general invitation i remember but i never thought hed come youll see about having some rooms got ready helen  yes papa ill see to it she answered moving slowly away  what could this visit in the middle of the season mean she wondered uneasily it was so unlike sir allan to leave town in may could it be that what her aunt had once laughingly hinted at was really going to happen her cheeks burned at the very thought she liked sir allan and she had found him a delightful companion but even to think of any other man now in such a connection seemed unreal and grotesque after all it was most improbable sir allan had only shown her the attention he showed every woman who pleased his fastidious taste     chapter xxviii  sir allan beaumerville visits the court   on the following day sir allan duly arrived and in a very short space of time helens fears had altogether vanished his appearance was certainly not that of an anxious wooer he was pale and haggard and thin altogether a different person to the brilliant man about town who was such a popular figure in society something seemed to have aged him there were lines and wrinkles in his face which had never appeared there before and an air of restless depression in his manner and bearing quite foreign to his former self  on the first evening mr thurwell broached some plans for his entertainment but sir allan stopped him at once  if i may be allowed to choose he said i should like to be absolutely quiet for a few days london life is not the easiest in the world and im afraid i must be getting an old man at any rate i am knocked up and i want a rest  you have come to the right place for that mr thurwell laughed you could live here for months and never see a soul if you chose but im afraid youll soon be bored  im not afraid of that sir allan answered quietly besides my excuse was not altogether a fiction i really am an enthusiastic botanist and i want to take up my researches here just where i was obliged to leave them off so suddenly last year  mr thurwell nodded  i remember he said you were staying at mallory werent you when that sad affair to poor kynaston happened  yes  sir allan moved his chair a little as though to escape from the warmth of the fire and sat where the heavily shaded lamp left his face in the shadow  yes that was a terrible affair he said in a low tone and a very mysterious one nothing has ever been heard of the murderer i suppose  nothing  and there are no rumors no suspicions  mr thurwell looked uneasily around as though to satisfy himself that there were no servants lingering in the room  it is scarcely a thing to be talked about he said slowly but there have been things said  about whom  about my tenant at falcons nestbernard maddison as he turned out to be  ah  mr thurwell looked at his guest wonderingly he could not quite make up his mind whether he was profoundly indifferent or equally interested his tone sounded a little cold  there was a fellow down here in my employ continued mr thurwell lighting a fresh cigar who turns out to have been a spy or detective of some sort of course i knew nothing of it at the timein fact ive only just found it out but it seems he ransacked falcons nest and discovered some papers which he avowed quite openly would hang mr maddison but whats become of him i dont know  i suppose he didnt disclose the nature of the papers sir allan asked quietly  no he didnt go as far as that by the bye you know every one beaumerville who is this bernard maddison of course i know all about his writing and that but what family is he of he is certainly a gentleman  sir allan threw away his cigarette and rose  i think i have heard once but i dont remember for the moment miss helen promised us a little music didnt she he added if you are ready shall we go and remind her  sir allan brought the conversation to an end with a shrug of his shoulders and during the remainder of his stay mr thurwell noticed that he carefully avoided any reopening of it evidently his guest has no taste for horrors  sir allan rose late on the following morning and until lunchtime begged for the use of the library where he remained writing letters and reading up the flora of the neighborhood early in the afternoon he appeared equipped for his botanizing expedition  helen shall go with you and show you the most likely places mr thurwell had said at luncheon but though sir allan had bowed courteously and had expressed himself as charmed he had not said another word about it so when the time came he started alone on the whole helen although she was by no means illpleased was not a little puzzled in london when it was sometimes difficult to obtain a place by her side at all sir allan had been the most assiduous and attentive of cavaliers but now that they were quite alone in the country and her company was even offered to him he showed himself by no means eager to avail himself of it on the contrary he had deliberately preferred doing his botanizing alone well she was quite satisfied she thought with a little laugh it was far better this way than the other still she was puzzled  later in the afternoon she started for her favorite walk alone she nearly always chose the same way along the cliffs through the fir plantation and sometimes as far as the hill by the side of which was falcons nest it was a walk full of associations for her associations which had become so dear a part of her life that she always strove to heighten them even by choosing the same hour of the day for her walk as that wellremembered one when they had stood handinhand for a single moment in the shadows of the darkening plantation and again as it had done many times before her heart beat fast and sweet memories began to steal back to her as she passed under those black waving branches moaning slightly in the evening breeze and pressed under foot the brown leaves which in a sodden mass carpeted the winding path yes it was here by that tall slender fir that they had stood for that one moment of intense happiness when the thunder of the sea filling the air around them had almost forbidden speech and the strange light had flashed in his dark eyes she passed the spot with slow lingering steps and quickening pulses and opening the little handgate climbed slowly up the cliff  at the summit she paused and looked around a low grey mist hung over the moor and twilight had cast its mantle of halfveiled obscurity over sea and land a wind too had sprung up blowing her ulster and skirts around her and driving the mist across the moor in clouds of small fine rain before her she could just see the dim outline of the opposite hill with its dark patch of firs and falcons nest bare and distinct close up against its side the wind and the rain blew against her but she took no heed all personal discomforts seemed so little beside these memories tinged with such a peculiar sweetness it is a fact that a woman is able to extract far more pleasure from memories than a man for there is in his nature a certain impatience which makes it impossible for him to keep his thought fixed steadfastly upon the past the vivid flashes of memory which do come to him only incite a great restlessness for its renewal which if it be for the time impossible is only disquieting and discontenting but for a woman her love itself even though it be for the time detached from its object is a sweet and precious thing she can yield herself up to its influence can steep her mind and soul in it till a glow of intense happiness steals through her whole frame and hence her patience during separation is so much greater than a mans  and it was so to a certain extent with helen those few moments of intense abstraction had their own peculiar pleasure for her and it was only the sound of the faroff clock borne by the wind across the moor from thurwell court which recalled her to herself then she started and in a moment more would have been on her way home  but that lingering farewell glance toward falcons nest suddenly changed into a startled fearful gaze her heart beat fast and she took an involuntary step forward there was no doubt about it a dim moving light shone from the lower windows of the cottage  her first wild thought was that her lover had himself returned and a thrill of intense joy passed through her whole being only to die away before the cold chill of a heartsickening dread was it not far more likely to be an intruder of the type of benjamin levy a spy or emissary of the law searching amongst his papers as benjamin levy had done for the same hideous reason her heart sank with fear and then leaped up with the fierce defensive instinct of a woman who sees her lovers enemies working for his ruin she did not hesitate for an instant but walked swiftly along the cliffside towards that tremulous light  the twilight was fast deepening and the cold grey tint of the dull afternoon was gradually becoming blotted out into darkness as she drew nearer to her destination the low moaning of the sea below became mingled with the melancholy sighing of the wind amongst the thick fir trees which overhung the cottage the misty rain blew in her face and penetrated her thick ulster everything around was as dreary and lonely as it could be the only sign of any human life was that faint glimmering light now stationary as though the searcher whoever he might be had found what he wanted and had settled down in one of the rooms  as she drew nearer she saw which it was and trembled all the rest of the cottage was in black darkness the light shone only from the window of that little inner study on the ground floor  she had passed through the gate and with beating heart approached the window a few yards away she paused and looked in  a candle was burning on a small bracket and though its light was but dim it showed her everything the cabinet was open and papers were strewn about as though thrown right and left in a desperate search and with his back to her a man was seated before it his bared head resting upon his arms and his whole attitude full of the passionate abandonment of a great despair she had but one thought it was her lover returned and he needed her consolation with a new light in her face she turned and moved softly toward the front door as she reached the threshold she paused and drew back there was the sound of footsteps inside  she stepped behind a bush and waited in a moment the door of the cottage was thrown suddenly open and the tall figure of a man stood in the entrance for one moment he hesitated then with a sudden passionate gesture he raised his hands high above his head and she heard a long deep moan burst from his quivering lips  the pity which swelled up in her heart she kept back with a strong hand a strange bewilderment was creeping over her she had seen only the dark outline of the figure but surely it was not the figure of her lover and then she held her breath and walking swiftly away passing so close to her that she could look into his white strained face sir allan beaumerville strode down the garden and disappeared in the shadows of the plantation     chapter xxix  the scene changes   the midday sun had risen into a sky of deep cloudless blue and a silence almost as intense as the silence of night rested upon the earth no one was abroad no one seemed to have anything particular to do far away on the vinecovered slopes a few peasants were lazily bending over their work the bright garments of their picturesque attire standing out like little specks of brilliant coloring against the duncolored background but in the quaint oldfashioned town itself no one was astir one solitary englishman made his way alone and almost unnoticed through the queer zigzag streets up the worn grey steps by the famous statute of minerva and on to the terraced walk fronting which were the aristocratic villas of the little italian town  it was a solitude which was pleasing to him for it was very evident that he was no curious tourist or casual visitor of any sort his eyes were full of that eager halfabstracted look which so clearly denotes the awakening of old associations quickened into life by familiar surroundings and indeed it was so to bernard maddison every stone in that quietly sleeping picturesque old town spoke with a language of its own the very atmosphere laden with the sultry languorous heat of a southern sun seemed charged with memories their influence was strong upon him and he walked like a man in a dream until he reached what seemed to be his destination and here he paused  he had come to the end of the terraced walk the evening promenade of the whole town before him was a small orange grove whose aromatic odor faintly penetrating the still air added one more to his stock of memories on his right hand was a grey stone wall worn and tottering with age and overhung with green creepers and shrubs reaching over and hanging down from the other side and let into it close to him was a low nailstudded door of monastic shape half hidden by a luxurious drooping shrub from amongst the foliage of which peeped out starlike clusters of soft scarlet flowers  for many moments he stood before that door with his hand resting upon the rusty latch lingering in a sort of apathy as though he were unwilling to disturb some particular train of thought then a mellowsounding bell from a convent in the valley below startled him and immediately he lifted the latch before him there was no other fastening and the door opened he stepped inside and carefully reclosed it  he was in a garden a garden of desolation which nature seemed to have claimed for her own and made beautiful it was a picture of luxuriant overgrowth the grass on the lawns had become almost a jungle it had grown up over the base of the deep grey stone basins of exquisite shape and carving the tiny statuettes tottering into ruin and the worn old sundial across which the slanting rays of the sun still glanced weeds too had crept up around them in picturesque toils weeds which had started to destroy but remained to adorn with all the sweet abandon of unrestrained growth some of them had put forth brilliant blossoms of many hues little spots of exquisite coloring against the sombre hue of the stonework and the deep green of the leaves everywhere nature had triumphed over science and skill everything was changed and nature had shown herself a more perfect gardener than man the gravel paths were embedded with soft green moss studded with clumps of white and purple violets whose faint fragrance mingled with the more exotic scent of other plants filled the warm air with a peculiar dreamy perfume nowhere had the hand of man sought to restrain or to develop nature had had her own way and had made for herself a fair garden  a little overcome by the heat and a little too by swiftly stirring memories bernard maddison sank down upon a low iron seat under the shade of a little clump of almond trees and covered his face with his hands and there came to him as he sat there something more vivid than an ordinary daydream something so real and minutely played out that afterwards it possessed for him all the freshness and significance of a veritable trance it seemed indeed as if some mysterious force had drawn aside the curtain of the past in his mind and had bidden him look out once more upon the moving figures in a living drama                                       the warm sunlight faded from the sky the summer heat died out of the air the soft velvety mantle of a southern night lay upon the brooding land many stars were burning in the deepblue heavens and the horned moon golden and luminous hung low down in the west  pale and with the fever of a great anger burning in his dry eyes a man sat at the open window of the villa yonder watching around him were scattered all the signs of arduous brain labor books manuscripts classical dictionaries and works of reference but his pen had fallen from his hand and he was doing nothing he sat there idle gazing out upon the fantastic shapes and halfveiled gloom of this fair garden its rich balmy odors and the fainter perfume of rarer plants which floated languidly in through the open window were nothing to him he was barely conscious of the sweet delights of the voluptuous summer night he was watching with his eyes fixed upon the east where morning would soon be breaking  it came at lastwhat he was waiting for there was a slight click of the latch from the old postern door in the wall and the low murmur of voicesa mans pleading and passionate and a womans half gay half mocking then the door opened and shut and a tall fair lady walked leisurely up toward the villa  she wore no hat but a hooded operacloak was thrown loosely over her shoulders and as she strolled up the path pausing every now and then to carelessly gather a handful of the drooping lilies whose perfume made faint the heavy night air its folds parted and revealed brief glimpses of soft white drapery and flashing jewels on her bosom and in her hair her feet too were cased in tiny white satin slippers which seemed scarcely to press the ground so lightly and gracefully she walked altogether she was very fair to look uponthe fairest sight in all that lovely garden  not so seemed to think the man who stood back in the shadow of the window waiting for her his white face was ghastly with passion and his fingers were nervously interlaced in the curtains it was only with a supreme effort that he at last flung them from him and moved forward as though to meet her  she saw him standing there pale and rigid like a carved statue save for the passion which burned in his eyes and for a moment she hesitated then with the resigned air of one who makes up her mind to face something disagreeable she shrugged her shoulders and throwing away the handful of lilies she had gathered advanced toward him  they neither of them spoke until they stood face to face then as his motionless form prevented her stepping through the window and barred her further progress she came to a standstill and addressed him lightly  yours is a strange welcome home mon ami she said why do you stand there looking so fierce  he pointed with shaking fingers away toward the east where a faint gleam of daylight was lightening the sky  where have you been he asked harshly can you not see that it is morning all night long i have sat here watching for you where have you been  you know very well where i have been she answered carelessly to the ball at the leon dor i told you that i was going  told me you told me did i not forbid it did i not tell you that i would not have you go  nevertheless i have been she answered lightly it was an engagement and i never break engagements  an engagement you with no chaperon to go to a common ball at a public room an engagement yes with your lover i presume  she looked at him steadily and yawned in his face  you are in a bad temper i fear she said at least you are very rude let me pass will you i am tired of standing here  he was beside himself with passion and for a second or two he did not speak but when at last the words came they were clear and distinct enough  into this house you shall never pass again he said you have disregarded my wishes you have disobeyed my orders and now you are deceiving me you are trifling with my honor you are bringing shame upon my name go and keep your assignations from another roof mine has sheltered your intrigues long enough  the hand which had kept together her operacloak relinquished its grasp and it fell back upon her shoulders the whole beauty of her sinuous figure in its garb of dazzling white stood revealed the moonlight gleamed in her fair hair bound up with one glittering gem shone softly upon her white swelling throat and bare arms and flashed in her dark eyes suddenly full of passion her right hand was nervously clasped around a little morsel of lace handkerchief which she had drawn from the folds of her corsage and which seemed to make the air around heavy with a sweet perfume  you are angry and you do not know what you are saying she said it is true that you forbade me to go tonightbut you forbid everything i cannot live your life it is too dull too triste it is cruel of you to expect it let me go in now if you want to scold you can do so tomorrow  she stepped forward but he laid his hands upon her dainty shoulders and pushed her roughly back  never he cried savagely go and live what life you choose this is no home for you go i say  she looked at him her lovely eyes turned pleadingly upwards and her lips trembling  you are mad she said am i not your wife you have no right to keep me here and my boy too let me pass  he did not move nor did he show any sign of yielding he stood there with his hand stretched out in a threatening gesture toward her his face pale and mute as marble but with the blind rage still burning in his dark eyes  what is the boy or what am i to you he cried hoarsely begone woman  still she did not seem to understand  where would you have me go she asked is not this my home what have i  go to your lover he interrupted fiercely tell him that your husband is no longer your tool he will take you in  a burning color streamed into her delicate cheeks and a sudden passion blazed in her eyes she drew herself up to her full height and turned upon him with the dignity of an empress  listen to me one moment she said ask yourself whether you have ever tried to make my life a happy one did i ever pretend to care for books and solitude before i married you i told you that i was fond of change and gaiety and life and you promised me that i should have it ask yourself how you have kept that promise you deny me every pleasure and drive me to seek them alone i am weary of your jealous furies and your evil temper as god looks down upon us at this moment i have been a faithful wife to you but if you will add to all your cruelties this cowardly miserable indignity then i will never willingly look upon your face again and what sin i do will be on your head not mine will you stand aside and let me pass  never he answered never  she drew her mantle round her shoulders and turned her back upon him with a contemptuous gesture  you have made me what i shall be she said the sin be with you for several weary years you have made me miserable now you have made me wicked  she walked away into the perfumed darkness and presently he heard the gate close behind her he listened frantically hoping to hear her returning steps it was in vain all was silent then he felt his limbs totter and he sank back on a couch and buried his face amongst the cushions     chapter xxx  benjamin levy runs his quarry to earth   the slumberous afternoon wore slowly away a slight breeze rustled amongst the cypresses and the olive trees and the air grew clearer the sun was low in the heavens and long shadows lay across the brilliant patches of flowers half wild half cultivated and on the mossgrown walks  still bernard maddison made no movement it may have been that he shrunk from what was before him or it may have been that he had some special purpose in thus calling up those broken visions of the past into his mind for as he sat there they still thronged in upon him disjointed and confused yet all tinged with that peculiar sadness which seemed to have lain heavy upon his life  again the memory of those long lonely days of his boyhood stole in upon him he thought of that terrible day when his father stood by his bedside and had bidden him in an awful voice ask no more for his mother and think of her only as dead and he remembered well the chill of cold despair with which he had realized that that fair sweet woman who had called him her little son and who had accepted his devoted boyish affection with a sort of amused pleasure was gone from him for ever henceforth life would indeed be a dreary thing alone with that cold silent student with whom he was almost afraid to speak and whom he scarcely ever addressed by the name of father  a dreary time it had indeed been his memory glanced lightly over the long monotonous years with a sort of shuddering recoil he thought of his fathers frequent absences and of his return from one of them in the middle of a winters night propped up in an invalid carriage with a surgeon in attendance and bloodstained bandages around his leg and he thought of a night when he had sat up with him while the nurse rested and one name had ceaselessly burst from those white feverish lips laden with fierce curses and deep vindictive hate a name which had since been written into his memory with letters of fire further and further on his memory dragged him until he himself a boy no longer had stood upon the threshold of manhood and on one awful night had heard from his fathers lips that story which had cast its shadow across his life then for the first time had sprung up of some sort of sympathy between them sympathy which had for its foundation a common hatred a common sense of deep unpardonable wrong the oath which his father had sworn with trembling lips the son had echoed and in dread of the vengeance of these two the man against whom they had sworn it cut himself off from his fellows and skulked in every outoftheway corner of europe a hunted being in peril of his life there had come a great change over their lives and they had drifted farther apart again he himself had gone out into the world something of a scholar and something of a pedant and he had found that all his ideas of life had lain rusting in his country home and that he had almost as much to unlearn as to learn with ample means and an eager thirst for knowledge he had passed from one to another of the great seats of learning of the world but his lesson was not taught him at one of them he learned it not amongst the keen conflict of intellect at the universities not in the toils of the great vague disquiet which was throbbing amongst all cultured and artistic society but in the eternal silence of mont blanc and her snowcapped alps and the whisperings of the night winds which blew across the valleys at heidelberg he had been a philosopher in italy he had been a scholar and in switzerland he became a poet when once again he returned to the more feverish life of cities he was a changed man he looked out upon life now with different eyes and enlarged vision passion had given place to a certain studied calm a sort of inward contemplativeness which is ever inseparable from the true artist life became for him almost too impersonal too little human soon it threatened to become one long abstraction accompanied necessarily with a weakened hold on all sensuous things and a corresponding decline in taste and appreciation one thing had saved him from relapsing into the nervous dreamer and the weaver of bright but aimless fancies he had loved and he had become a man again linked to the world and the things of the world by the pulsations of his passion and his strong deep love was it well for him or ill he wondered well it might have been save for the deadly peril in which he lived and which seemed closing fast around him well it surely would have been  lower and lower the sun had sunk till now its rim touched the horizon the evening breeze stealing down from the hills had gathered strength until now it was almost cold the distant sound of footsteps and the gay laughing voices of the promenaders from the awakening town broke the deep stillness which had hung over the garden and recalled bernard maddison from thoughtland he rose to his feet a little stiff and walked slowly along the path towards the villa at that same moment mr benjamin levy tired and angry with his long waiting stole into the garden by the posterngate     chapter xxxi  benjamin levy writes home        june 10th       my dear dad       i wired you yesterday afternoon immediately on our arrival at      this outlandish little place to write to me at the hotel leon      dor for it seems that we have reached our destinationby we of      course i mean mr maddison and myself though he has not the least      idea of my presence here well this is a queer old crib i can      tell you and the sooner we are on the move again the better i      shall be pleased the fodder is odious not fit for a pig and the      wine is ditto what wouldnt i give for a pint of bass like they      draw at the blue boar old england for me is my motto       and now to biz so far alls well im on the right tack and no      mistake we got here middle day yesterdaycame over the hills      from the railway in a regular old boneshaker of a coach my      tourist getup is quite the fig and though i caught mr m      eyeing me over a bit supercilious like once he didnt recognize me      if ever he did see me down at thurwell court which i dont think      he did well directly we got here off started mr m through      the town and after a bit i followed lord it was hot and no      mistake but he didnt seem to notice it though the perspiration      was streaming down my back like anything about a mile out of town      we came to a great high wall with a door in it and before i could      say jack robinson or get anywhere near him in he went well i      hung round a bit and soon i found a sort of opening in the wall      where i could just see in and there he was sitting down on a seat      in a regular howling wilderness of a garden as though the whole      place belonged to him if you please all right i thought im      agreeable to a rest and i sat down too little thinking what was      in store for me four mortal hours passed before he stirred and      jolly stiff and tired i was i can tell you but it was a lucky      thing for me all the same for when he got up and made for the      house it was almost dark so without more ado i just opened the      door and walked in myself there was no end of shrubs and trees      about the place and though i followed him on another path only a      few yards away he couldnt see me and there was no chance of his      hearing for the moss had grown over the gravel like a blooming      carpet which was all lucky for me again       well we were just close to the house when we both of us got a      start and i nearly yelled out round the corner of his path thank      goodness came a tall whitehaired old lady in a long black      dress with an ivory cross hanging down and looking as dignified      as possible she no sooner saw him than she stopped and cried out      bernard bernard and seemed as though she were going to faint      she pulled herself together however and things became very      interesting for me i can tell you       mr m he was going to take her hands and kiss her but she      drew them away and stood back lord how awful her face did look      it gave me a regular turn just to look at her       bernard she cried out in a low shaking voice i know      allall       what do you mean mother he asked       then she stretched her arms up and it was dreadful to look at      her       i had a dream she cried a dream which kept me shuddering      and sleepless from midnight to daybreak i dreamed i saw      himdeadcold and dead       he said nothing but he seemed fearfully upset i kept crouched      down behind a shrub and listened       in the morning i sent for a file of english newspapers she went      on one by one i searched them through till i came to august last      year there i found it bernard it was at thurwell court i had a      letter in my pocket from you with the postmark thurwell dont come      near me but speak is there blood upon your hands       and now dad the most provoking things happened it seemed just      as though it were done to spite me he had his mouth open to      answer and i had my ears open as you may guess to listen and      see what happens and tell me if it wasnt a rare sell off the old      woman goes into a faint all of a sudden he catches hold of her and      sings out for help down i ran to the door as hard as i could      slammed it as though i had just come in and came running up the      path anything the matter i called out as though i didnt know      my way a lady fainted he shouts come and help me carry her      into the house so up i went and together we carried her inside      and laid her on a couch in one of the queerestfurnished rooms i      ever saw there was servants with lighted lamps running about and      another woman who seemed to be a relation and such a fuss they all      made and no mistake however mr m cooled them all down      again pretty soon for he could see that it was only an ordinary      faint and then he began to look at me curiously i had made up my      mind to stay until the old woman came round but he was too many      for me for he got up and took me to the door himself of course      he was awfully polite and all that and was very much obliged for      my help but i twigged it in a moment he wanted me gone so off i      skedaddled       well back i went to the inn and began to make a few cautious      inquiries about the lady of the villa fiorlessa for that was the      name of the house where i had left mr m i could not get on at      all at first not understanding a word of the blessed lingo but by      good luck i tumbled across an artist chap who turned out a good      sort and offered to interpret for me so we had the landlord in      and i ordered a bottle of his best winenasty greasy stuff it      wasand we went at it hammer and tongs pretty soon i had found      out everything i wanted to       nearly twenty years ago the ladymrs martival she was      calledhad come to the villa fiorlessa with her husband and one      little boy they were it seems one of the worstmatched couples      that could be imagined mr martival was a gloomy severe man who      hated going out and worked at some sort of writing day and night      his wife on the other hand who was a frenchwoman was      passionately fond of travel and change and gaiety her life was      consequently very like a prison and it is stated too that      besides denying her every whim and forcing her to live in a manner      she utterly disliked her husband illtreated her shamefully well      she made a few friends here and went to see them pretty often and      just at that time an english milordyou can guess who he wascame      here to see the statue and met mrs martival whom he seems to      have known before her marriage the exact particulars are not      known but it is supposed that mrs martival would have been      married to this young englishman sir geoffrey kynaston but for      some deep scheming on the part of mr martival anyhow there was a      desperate quarrel between mr and mrs martival when she charged      him with duplicity before this marriage and he forbade her to meet      sir geoffrey kynaston again quite properly she refused to obey      him and they met often although every one seems quite sure that      at that time they met only as friends mr martival however      appears to have thought otherwise for one night after what they      call their carnival dance here which every one in the neighborhood      had attended mr martival had the brutality to close his doors      against her and refuse to let her enter the house it was the      crowning piece of barbarism to a long course of jealous cruelties      mrs martival spent that night with some friends and seems even      then to have hesitated for a long time her married life had been      one long disappointment and this brutal action of her husband had      ended it sir geoffrey kynaston was madly in love with her and she      was one of those women who must be loved in the end she ran away      with him which seemed a very natural thing for her to do       the queerest part of it is to come though sir geoffrey was      devoted to her and would have married her at once if mr martival      would have sued for a divorce he showed her every kindness and he      lavished his money and his love upon her but it seems that she      was a devout roman catholic and the horror of what she had done      preyed upon her so that in less than a month she left sir      geoffrey and entered one of the lower sort of nunneries as a      menial from there she went to the wars as a nurse and did a great      deal of good when she returned of all places in the world she      came back to the villa fiorlessa partly from a curious notion of      penance that she might be continually reminded of her sin the      queerest part of it is however that the people round here behaved      like real christians and jolly different to what they would have      done at home they knew all her history and they welcomed her back      as though that month in her life had never been thats what i call      charity real charity dad dont know what you think about it      well there shes lived ever since with her sister who had lots of      money she died last year and the poor people all around just      worshipped them       now to go back a bit mr martival although he had been such      a brute to his wife no sooner found out that she was with sir      geoffrey kynaston than he swore the most horrible oaths of      vengeance and went off after them he was brought back in a fever      with a pistol shot in his leg which served him dd well right      i think no sooner was he better than he started off again in      pursuit but sir geoffrey dodged him and they never met meanwhile      the young cub whom you will recognize as mr m had grown up      and what must his father do when he returned but tell him as much      of the story as suited him with the result that he too swore an      oath of vengeance against sir geoffrey kynaston time goes on and      mr martival and his son both leave here mr martival is reported      to have died in paris his son goes to england and is lost sight      of we can however follow the story a little further we can      follow it down to its last scene and discover in the mr brown who      had taken a small cottage near sir geoffreys seat within a week      of his return home and whom soon afterwards we discover bending      over sir geoffreys murdered body the boy who fired with what his      father had thundered into his ears as his mothers ruin had sworn      that oath of vengeance against sir geoffrey       all this looks very simple doesnt it and i dare say my dear      dad youre wondering why i dont come straight away home and      cause a sensation at scotland yard by clearing up the kynaston      murder simply because that isnt quite my game i didnt come over      here to collect evidence against mr m for i could have laid      my hand on plenty of that at home there is something else at the      back of it all which i can only see very dimly yet but which will      come as a crasher i can tell you when it does come at present i      wont say anything about this only keep your eyes open and be      prepared tata      your obedient son     ben       ps dont worry about xs they wont come out of your pocket in      the long run i can tell you       ps 2 wednesday evening heres a pretty pickle you remember      the artist i told you about im dd if he isnt a regular from      sy and hes got his pocketbook pretty full too the game is      serious now and no mistake mind you i think we stand to win      still but i cant be quite sure while this chaps on the lay look      out for telegrams and dont be surprised if i turn up at any      moment it may come to a race between us dn i wonder how he      got on the scent     chapter xxxii  a strange trio of passengers   before the open window of her room looking out upon the fair wilderness below and over its high stone walls to the dim distant line of hills vanishing in an ethereal mist lay mrs martival and by her side stood bernard maddison looking down into her white suffering face  sorrow and time together had made strange havoc with its beauty and yet the lines had been laid on with no harsh hand there was a certain dignity which it had never lost which indeed resigned and largeminded sadness only enhances and her simple religious life had given a touch of spirituality to those thin delicate features so exquisitely carved and moulded the bloom had gone from her cheeks for ever and their intense pallor was almost deathlike matching very nearly her snowwhite hair but her eyes seemed to have retained much of their old power and sweetness and the light which sometimes flashed in them lent her face a peculiar charm but now they were full of a deep anxiety as she lay there a restless disquiet which showed itself also in her nervously twitching fingers  far away down the valley the little convent clock struck the hour and at its sound she looked up at him  you go at nine oclock bernard  at nine oclock mother unless you wish me to stay  she shook her head  no i shall be better alone this thing will crush me into the grave but death will be very welcome oh my son my son that the sin of one weak woman should have given birth to all this misery  he stooped over her and held her thin fingers in his strong mans hand  do not trouble about it mother he said i can bear my share try and forget it  her eyes flashed strangely and her lips parted in a smile which was no smile  forget it that is a strange speech bernard have i the power to beckon to those hills yonder and bid them bow their everlasting heads can i put back the hand of time and live my life over again even so futile is my power over memory it is my penance and i pray day and night for strength to bear it  her voice died away with a little break and there was silence soon she spoke again  tell mesomething about her bernard  his face changed but it was only a passing glow almost as though one of those long level rays of sunlight had glanced for a moment across his features  she is good and beautiful and all that a woman should be he whispered  does she know  he shook his head  she trusts me  then you will be happy she asked eagerly happy even if the worst come time will wipe out the memory  he turned away with a dull sickening pain at his heart the worst he had not told her how could he how could he add another to her sorrows by telling her of the peril in which he stood how could he tell her what he suspected to be truethat in that quiet little italian town english detectives were watching his every movement and that at any moment he might be arrested with her joyless life and with this new misery closing around her would it not be well for her to die  it is farewell between us now bernard then she said softly god grant that you may be going back to a new and happier life may i who have failed so utterly give you just one word of advice  he bowed his head for just then he could not have spoken she raised herself a little upon her couch and felt for his hand  bernard you are not as your father was she said yet you too have something of the student in you dont think that i am going to say anything against learning and culture it is a grand thing for a man to devote himself to but like everything else in excess it has its dangers sometimes it makes a man gloomy and reserved and averse to all change and society and intolerant toward others bernard it is bad for his wife then a woman sets so much store by little thingsher happiness is bound up in them she is very very human and she wants to be loved and considered and feel herself a great part in her husbands life and thoughts and if it is all denied to her what is she to do of necessity she must be miserable a man should never let his wife feel that she is shut out from any one of his great interests he should never let those little mutual ties which once held them together grow weak and fancy because he is living amongst the ghosts of great thoughts that little human responsibilities have no claim upon him bernard you will remember all this  every word mother he answered helen would thank you if she had been here  a horn sounded from outside and he drew out his watch hastily  the diligence mother he exclaimed i must go  he took her frail form up into his arms and kissed her  if all goes well he said in a low tone i will bring her to you  if she will come i shall die happy she murmured but not against her will or without knowing all farewell  that night three men were racing home to england as fast as express train and steamer could bear them one was bernard maddison another mr benjamin levy and the third his artist friend     chapter xxxiii  visitors for mr bernard maddison   in an ordinary case with three men starting from a given point in north italy at the same time the odds seem in favor of their all reaching their destination at the same time as it happened however there was another factor to be considered which had its due result bernard maddison was rather more at home on continental railroads than he was on english ones whereas neither of the other two had ever before left their own country save under the wing of cook the consequence was that by the aid of sundry little manoeuvres which completely puzzled his wouldbe companions bernard maddison stood on the platform of waterloo while they were still in the throes of seasickness as a further consequence two telegrams were dispatched from ostend and were duly delivered in england the first was from benjamin levy to his father       meet all boat trains at waterloo and try to recognize b m king      will do to shadow ascertain miss thurwells address home early      tomorrow  the second was from his acquaintance the artist to scotland yard       bernard maddison ahead of us meet all trains tall dark thin      pale brown check traveling ulster photograph for sale in regent      street if can get to shop  both telegrams were conscientiously attended to and when bernard maddison drove out of the station his hansom was followed by two others there was nothing very suspicious about his movements first of all he was set down at his club which meant a wait of an hour and a half for his watchers at the end of that time he reappeared with all the traces of his journey effaced and in a fresh suit of clothes carrying now a smaller portmanteau he lit a cigarette and sent for a hansom this time he was set down at kings cross and took a ticket for a small town on the yorkshire coast hereupon the employee of messrs levy  son retired having ascertained all that he was required to ascertain the other myrmidon however having dispatched his subordinate to headquarters with particulars of his destination took up the chase  it was late in the afternoon before they reached their journeys end but bernard maddison was quite unconscious of any fatigue and marching straight out of the station turned toward mallory the man who was following him however hired a carriage and drove down to the hotel he knew quite well where the other was going to and as nothing could be done that night he determined to enjoy as much as he could of his seaside trip and after making up for his days fasting by a satisfactory tea he spent the evening on the jetty listening to the town brass band                                       that was a strange walk for bernard maddison two sensations were struggling within him for the mastery fear and despair at the terrible crisis which seemed to yawn before his feet and that sweet revolution of feeling that intense yearning love which had suddenly thrown a golden halo over his cold barren life but as he left the road and took the moorland path along the cliff the battle suddenly came to an end before him stretched the open moor brilliant with coloring with dark flushes of purple and bright streaks of yellow gorse and the sunlight glancing upon the hills there was the pleasant murmuring of the sea in his ears a glistening dancing silver sea the blue sky above and the fresh strong breeze full of vigorous bracing life something of a glad recklessness stole over him and lightened his heart this was no scene no hour for sad thoughts where was the philosophy of nursing such of giving them a home even for a moment joy and sorrow what were they but abstract states of the mind let him wait until the ashes were between his teeth the future and the past no man could command but the present was his own he would claim it he would drink deep of the joy which lay before him  and as he walked on over the soft springy turf with the tall chimneys of thurwell court in the valley before him life leaped madly through his veins and a deep joy held memory in a torpor and filled his heart with gladness the whole passionate side of his nature had been suddenly quickened into life by his surroundings and by the thought that down yonder the woman whom he loved was waiting for him once again come what may he would hold her in his arms and hear her voice tremble with joy at his return once more he would hold her face up to his and look into her dim soft eyes full of that glowing lovelight which none can fail to read once again he would drink deep of this delicious happiness a long sweet draught and if life ended after that moment he would at least have touched the limits of all earthly joys  and suddenly he stood face to face with her he had passed falcons nest dismantled and desolate with scarcely a careless glance and had entered the long pine grove which fringed the cliff side already he was close to the spot where they had stood once before and with all the subtle sweetness of those memories stealing in upon him he had turned aside to look through the tree tops down into the sea as they had done together thus he was standing when he heard light firm footsteps close at hand and a little surprised cry which rang in his ears like music for it was her voice  they stood face to face their hands clasped in that first moment of tremulous joy neither of them spoke each was struggling for realization for even an inward expression of the ecstasy of this meeting for them there was a new glory in the sunny heavens a new beauty in the glistening sea and the softly waving pine trees even in the air they breathed the intensity of this joy filled their hearts their fancy their imagination everything was crowned with a soft golden light new springs of feeling leaped up within them bringing glowing revelations of such delight as mocked expression for them only at that moment the sun shone and the summer winds whispered in the trees and the birds sang the world was theirs or rather a new one of their own creation the past and the future emptied their joys into the overflowing bowl of the present life stood still for them there was no horizon no background oh it is a great thing the greatest thing upon this earth to love and be loved  each dreaded speech it seemed as though a single word must drag them down from a new heaven to an old earth yet those murmured passionate words of his as he drew her softly into his arms and her head sank upon his shoulderthey were scarcely words and then again there was silence  it lasted long it seemed to him that it might have lasted forever but the sun went down behind the hills and a dusky twilight stole down upon the earth then she spoke  my love my love you must listen to me i have a confession to make  a confession you he echoed  her cheeks burned with a fire which seemed to her like the fire of shame her tongue seemed hung with sudden weights she had doubted him the hideousness of it oppressed her like a nightmare yet her voice did not falter  you remember those dying words of rachel kynaston  i have never forgotten them he answered simply  they laid a charge upon me i told myself that it was a sacred charge listen my lovelisten and hate me i have been to detectives i paid them money to hunt you down i have done this i who love you no dont draw your arms away i have done this it was before i knew oh i have suffered god how i have suffered it has been an agony to me you will forgive me i will not let you go unless you forgive me  he looked down at her in silence his cheeks were pale and his eyes were grave yet there was no anger  i will forgive you helen he whisperednay there is nothing to forgive only tell me this you do not doubt me now  never again she cried passionately god forgive me that i have ever doubted you it is like a horrible dream to me but it lies far behind and the morning has come  he kissed her once more and opened his arms with a low happy laugh she shook her tumbled hair straight and hand in hand they walked slowly away  you have been long gone she whispered reproachfully  he sighed as he answered her how long might not his next absence be  it has seemed as long to me as to you sweetheart he said every moment away from you i have counted as a lost moment in my life  that is very pretty she answered and now you are here are you going to stay  until the end he said solemnly you know helen that i am in deadly peril the means of averting it which i went abroad to seek i could not use  she thought of those letters bought and safely burnt and she pressed his fingers she would tell him of them presently  they shall not take you from me bernard now she said softly kiss me again dear  he stooped and took her happy upturned face with its crown of wavy golden hair between his hands looking fondly down at her the thought of all that he might so soon lose swept in upon him with a sickening agony and he turned away with trembling lips and dim eyes  god grant that they may not he cried passionately if it were to come now how could i bear it to the end  they walked on in silence then she who had or thought she had so much more reason to be hopeful than he dashed the tears away from her eyes and talked hopefully they would not dare to lay a finger upon bernard maddison whatever they might have done to poor mr brown his great name would protect him from suspicion and as he listened to her he had not the heart to tell her of the men who had followed him abroad that he was even then doubtless under surveillance he let her talk on and feigned to share her hopefulness  the time came when they passed into the grounds of the court and then she thought of something else which she must say to him  we have a visitor bernardonly one but im afraid you dont like him  something told him who it was he stopped short in the path  not sir allan beaumerville  she nodded  yes im so sorry he invited himself and there is something i must tell you about him  his first instinct was to refuse to go on but it was gone in a moment after one glance into helens troubled face  dont look so ashamed he said smiling faintly im not afraid of him what is it you were going to tell me about him  he went out the other day alone to do some botanizing she said do you know where i saw him  he shook his head  no where  in your cottage i saw him sitting at your table and i saw him come out he looked terribly troubled just as though he had found out something  he seemed in no wise so much disturbed as she had feared  its astonishing how many people are interested in my affairs he said with grim lightness  no one so much as i am she whispered softly bernard i must tell you something about papa i had almost forgotten  yes has he been exercising a landlords privilege too  of course not sir but bernard people have been talking and he has heard them and  her face grew troubled and he stood still  he suspects too does he then i certainly cannot force him to become my host  she took hold of both of his hands and looked up at him pleadingly  dont be stupid bernard dear please i didnt say that he suspected only people have been talking and of course it leaves an impression you must make friends with him you know wont you have something to ask himsome dayperhaps  she turned away blushing a little and he was conquered  very well love i will come then he said only please you must go and tell him directly we get there and if he would rather not have me for a guest you must come and let me know i will sit at no mans table under protest he added with a sudden flush of pride  hell be very pleased to have you she said simply a few words from me will be quite enough  your empire extends further than over my heart i see he said laughing there is your father coming round from the stables suppose we go to him  they met him face to face in the hall when he saw who his daughters companion was he looked for a moment grave but he had all the courtly instincts of a gentleman of the old school and though outside he might have acted differently the man was under his own roof now and must be treated as a guest besides he had implicit faith in his daughters judgment so he held out his hand without hesitation  glad to see you mr maddison we began to fear that you had deserted us he said  i have been away longer than i intended bernard maddison answered quietly  of course you dine here mr thurwell continued moving away youll find beaumerville in the library or the smoke room you know your way about dont you my gamekeeper wants to speak to me for a moment i shant be long  he crossed the hall and entered his own room helen slipped her arm through her lovers and led him away in the opposite direction down a long passage to the other end of the house  consider yourself highly favored sir she said pausing with her hand upon one of the furthest doors you are the only male being except my father who has ever been admitted here  she led him into a daintily furnished morning room full of all those trifling indications of a womans constant presence which possesses for the man who loves her a peculiar and almost reverent interest there was her fancy work lying where she had put it down on the little wicker table a book with a paper knife in it one of his own by its side an open piano with a little pile of songs on the stool and a sleek dachshund blinking up at them from the hearthrug the appointments of the room were simple enough and yet everything seemed to speak of a culture a refinement and withal a dainty feminine charm which appealed to him both as an artist and a lover she drew an easy chair to the fire and when he was seated came and stood over him  i expect you to like my room sir she said softly do you  it is like you he answered it is perfect  they were together for half an hour and then the dressing bell sounded she jumped up at once from her little low chair by his side  i must go and give orders about your room she said of course you will stop with us i have made up my mind where to put you roberts shall come and take you to your room in a few moments  dressing will be a farce for me he remarked i have no clothes  oh well forgive you she laughed of course you were too anxious to get here to think about clothes that was quite as it should be goodby dont be dull  he was alone only for a few minutes then a servant knocked at the door and took him to his room he looked around him and saw more evidences of her care for him in the sitting room which opened on one side was a great bowl of freshly cut flowers a pile of new books and a photograph of herself the rooms were the finest in the house the oak paneled walls were hung with tapestry and every piece of furniture was an antique curiosity it was a bedchamber for a prince and indeed a royal prince had once slept in the quaint high fourposter with its carved oak pillars and ancient hangings  to bernard maddison as he strolled round and examined his surroundings it all seemed like a dreamso delightful that awakening was a thing to be dreaded indeed the loud ringing of the second bell however soon brought him back to the immediate present he hastily made such alterations in his toilet as were possible and descended in the hall he met helen who had changed her dress for a soft creamcolored dinner gown and was waiting for him  do you like your room she asked  like it it is perfect he answered quietly i had no idea that thurwell was so old i like you too he added glancing approvingly at her and taking her hand  no time for compliments sir she said laughing we must go into the drawingroom sir allan is there alone  he followed her across the hall and entered the room with her sir allan with his back to them was seated at the piano softly playing an air of chopins to himself at the sound of the opening door he turned round  sir allan you see we have found another visitor to take pity on us helen said you know mr maddison dont you  the music which sir allan had been continuing with his right hand came to a sudden end and for the space of a few seconds he remained perfectly motionless then he rose and bowed slightly  i have that pleasure he said quietly mr maddison is a neighbor of yours is he not i met him you know on a certain very melancholy occasion  will you go on playing she asked sinking down on a low settee we should like to listen  he sat down again and with halfclosed eyes recommenced the air helen and bernard maddison sitting side by side spoke every now and then to one another in a low tone there was no general conversation until mr thurwell entered and then dinner was announced almost immediately  there was no lack of conversation then at first it had lain chiefly between mr thurwell and sir allan beaumerville but catching a somewhat anxious glance from helen her lover suddenly threw off his silence when maddison talks one of his admirers had once said everyone else listens and if that was not quite so in the present case it was simply because he had the art of drawing whoever he chose into the conversation and making them appear far greater sharers in it than they really were what was in truth a monologue seemed to be a brilliantly sustained conversation in which maddison himself was at once the promoter and the background on his part there was not a single faulty phrase or unmusical expression every idea he sprang upon them was clothed in picturesque garb and artistically conceived it was the outpouring of a richly stored cultured mindthe perfect expression of perfect matter  the talk had drifted toward italy and the art of the renaissance mr thurwell had made some remark upon the picturesque beauties of some of the lesserknown towns in the north and bernard maddison had taken up the theme with a new enthusiasm  i am but just come back from such a one he said i wonder if i could describe it  and he did describe it he told them of the crumbling palaces beautiful in their perfect venetian architecture but still more beautiful now in their slow grand decay in which was all the majesty of deep repose teeming with suggestions of past glories he spoke of the still clear air the delicate tints of the softened landscape the dark cool green of the olive trees the green vineyards and the dim blue hills he tried to make them understand the sweet silence the pastoral simplicity of the surrounding country delicate and airy when the faint sunlight of early morning lay across its valleys and sloping vineyards rich and drowsy and languorous when the full glow of midday or the scented darkness of the starlit night succeeded then he passed on to speak of that gardenthe fairest wilderness it was possible to conceivewhere the violets grew like weeds upon the mossgrown paths and brilliant patches of wild geraniums mingled their perfume with the creamy clematis run wild and the clustering japonica  she who lives there he went on more slowly turning from helen toward sir allan is in perfect accord with everything that is sweet and stately and picturesque in her surroundings i see her now as she met me in the garden and stretched out her hands to greet me it is the face the form of a martyr and an angel she is tall and her garb is one of stately simplicity her hair is white as snow and the lines of her face are wasted with sorrow and physical decay yet there is sweetness and softness and light in her worn featuresaye and more almost than a human beings share of that exquisite spirituality which is the reward only of those who have triumphed over pain and suffering and sin guido would have given the world for such a face little does an artist think at what cost such an expression is won through the fires of shame and bitter wrong of humiliation and heartshattering agony the human cross has fallen away and the gold of her nature shines pure and refined god grant to those who have wronged her those at whose door her sin lies as happy a deathbed as hers will be sir allan i am boring you i fear we will change the subject  not at all i have beenvery interested sir allan answered in a low tone pouring himself out a glass of wine and raising it to lips as white as the camellia in his buttonhole  we are all interested helen said softly did you stay with her  for three days he answered then because i could not bring myself to tell her the news which i had gone all that way to impart i came away  there was a moments silence a servant who had just entered the room whispered in mr thurwells ear  two gentlemen wish to speak to you mr maddison he said repeating the message where have you shown them robertsin the library  i wished to do so sir the man replied but  he glanced over his shoulder every one looked toward the door just outside were two dark figures to three people at the table the truth came like a flash  sir allan sat quite still with his eyes fixed upon bernard maddison who had risen to his feet pale as death with rigidly compressed lips and nervously grasping his napkin helen too had risen with a look of horror in her white face and her eyes fastened upon her lover mr thurwell looked from one to the other not comprehending the situation the whole scene the glittering table laden with flowers and wine the wondering servant the attitude and faces of the four people and the dark figures outside would have made a marvelous tableau  suddenly the silence was broken by a low agonized cry helen had thrown her arms with a sudden impulsive gesture around her lovers neck  my love my love she cried it is i who have done this thing they shall not take you from methey shall not     chapter xxxiv  arrested   as is often the case the person most concerned in the culmination of this scene was apparently the least agitated and the first to recover his selfpossession gently loosening helens arms from around him bernard maddison walked steadily toward the door and confronted his visitors one was his fellowpassenger from london the other a tall wirylooking man who was standing with his hat under his arm and his hands in the pocket of a long traveling coat  i am bernard maddison he said quietly what is your business with me  i am sorry sir that it is rather unpleasant the man answered lowering his voice it is my duty to arrest you under this warrant charging you with the murder of sir geoffrey kynaston on the 12th of august last year please do not make any answer to the charge as anything that is now said by you or anyone present in connection with it can be used in evidence against you  i am ready to go with you at once he answered the sooner we get away the better i have no luggage here so i do not need to make any preparations  he felt a hand on his arm and turned round mr thurwell had recovered from his first stupefaction and had come to his side close behind him sir allan beaumerville was standing pale as death and with a curious glitter in his eyes  maddison what is this mr thurwell asked gravely  i am arrested on a charge of murdering sir geoffrey kynaston at your shooting party last year bernard maddison answered quietly i make no reply to the charge save that i am not guilty i am sorry that this should have occurred at your house had i received any intimation of it i would not have come here as it is i can only express my regret  although in some respects a plain man there was a certain innate dignity of carriage and deportment which always distinguished bernard maddison among other men never had it been more apparent than at that moment there was unconscious hauteur in his manner of meeting this awful charge in his tone and in the perfect calm of his demeanor which was more powerful than any vehement protestations could have been mr thurwell had long had his doubts and very uneasy doubts concerning this matter but at that moment he felt ashamed of them he made up his mind on impulse but what he said he meant and adhered to  i believe you mr maddison he said cordially holding out his hand i think that the charge is absurd in any case please reckon me amongst your friends if there is no one else whom you would prefer to see i will go and get dewes down from town in the morning  for the first time bernard maddison showed some slight sign of emotion he took mr thurwells hand but did not speak for a moment then as they stood there in a little group helen glided up to them with a faint smile on her lips and a strange look in her white face  father she said thank god for those words  then she turned to her lover and gave him both her hands looking up at him through a mist of tears but still with that ghostly smile upon her parted lips  bernard she said softly you know that i have no doubts you must go now but it will not be for long you will come back to us and we shall be glad to see you you need not trouble about me see i am quite calm it is because i have no fear  he stooped and kissed her hands but she held up her face  kiss me bernard she said softly father she added turning half round toward him i love him we should have told you everything tomorrow  mr thurwell bowed his head and turned away to speak to the detectives who had remained discreetly outside the door sir allan returned to his seat and poured himself out a glass of wine for a moment they were all alone and he held her hands tightly  this will all come right love she whispered softly and it will make no difference will it promise me that when it is over you will come straight to me promise me that and i will be brave if you do not i shall break my heart  then i promise it he answered with a slight tremble in his voice  but looking at him anxiously she was not satisfied his white face firm and resolute though it was had a certain despair in it which chilled her the hopefulness of her words seemed to have found no echo in his heart  dearest she whispered it will all come right  his expression changed but the effort of it was visible his smile was forced and his words light though they were troubled her  we must hope so nay it will come right dear wish me goodby now or rather au revoir my guardians will be getting impatient  they were virtually alone and he drew from her lips one long passionate kiss then with a few cheerful words he turned resolutely away mr thurwell who had been waiting outside came to him at once  the brougham is at the door he said with an anxious glance at helen who was leaning back against a chair her hands locked in one another ghastly pale and evidently on the point of fainting these men have only an open trap and it is a cold drive across the moor tomorrow you go to york to be brought before the magistrates i shall be there  you are very good bernard maddison said earnestly but so far as defence is concerned i will have no lawyers aid what little there is to be said i will say myself  mr thurwell shook his head  it does not do he said but there will be time to consider that the magistrates will be sure to commit you for trial they must have evidence enough for that or mr malcolm would never have signed the warrant against anyone in your position  i am quite prepared for that he answered let us go  they left the room at once helen had fainted in her chair sir allan beaumerville had apparently disappeared  they stood on the doorstep for a moment while the carriage which had been driven a little way down the avenue to quiet the mettlesome horses returned and mr thurwell spoke a few more encouraging words  jenkins has packed some things of mine which may be useful to you in a portmanteau he said you will find it in the carriage and also an ulster keep up your spirits maddison all will be well  at any rate i shall never forget your kindness bernard maddison answered grasping his hand goodby mr thurwell  good night maddison good night i shall see you tomorrow  the impatient horses leaped forward and mr thurwell turned back into the hall and made his way back into the dining room helen had recovered sufficiently to be able to go to her room he was told sir allan was still sitting at the table quietly sipping a cup of coffee his legs were crossed and he was smoking one of his favorite egyptian cigarettes  has he gone he said looking round languidly  mr thurwell frowned he was a man of somewhat imperturbable manners himself but he was far from being unfeeling and sir allans silence and nonexpression of any sympathy toward bernard maddison annoyed him not a little  yes hes gone he answered shortly i cant believe that theres the slightest vestige of truth in that ridiculous charge the man is innocent im sure of it  sir allan shrugged his shoulders  i dont believe hes guilty myself he answered but one never knows     chapter xxxv  committed for trial   early on the following morning mr thurwell ordered his dog cart and drove into mallory the arrest of bernard maddison had been kept quite secret and nothing was known as yet of the news which was soon to throw the little town into a state of great excitement but in the immediate vicinity of the courthouse there was already some stir the lord lieutenants carriage was drawn up outside and there was an unusual muster of magistrates as a rule the cases brought before their jurisdiction were trivial in the extreme consisting chiefly of drunkenness varied by an occasional petty assault there was scarcely one of them who remembered having sat upon so serious a charge lord lathon came over to mr thurwell directly he entered the retiring room  you have heard of this matter i suppose he inquired as they shook hands  yes mr thurwell answered gravely he was arrested at my house last night  i cant believe the thing possible lord lathon continued still from what i hear we shall certainly have to send it for trial  i am afraid you will mr thurwell answered i shall not sit myself i am prejudiced  in his favor or the reverse his lordship inquired  in his favor decidedly mr thurwell answered passing out behind the others and taking a seat in the body of the room  the general impatience was doomed to be aggravated the first prisoner was an old man charged with assaulting his wife the bench listened for a few minutes to her garrulous tale and managed to gather from it that a caution from their worships was what she chiefly desired having arrived at this point lord lathon ruthlessly stopped her and dismissed the case with a few stern words to the elderly reprobate who departed muttering threats against his better half which for her bodily comfort it is to be hoped that he did not put into execution  then there was a few minutes expectation at the conclusion of which bernard maddison was brought in between two policemen very calm and selfpossessed but very pale directly he appeared mr thurwell rose and shook hands with him a friendly demonstration which brought a faint glow into his cheeks  he was offered a chair and the services of the solicitor of the place the latter of which he declined then the chief constable a little flurried and nervous at the unwonted importance of his office rose and addressed the bench  the case against the prisoner was he said still altogether incomplete and he had only one witness whose evidence however he felt sure would be such as to justify their sending the matter to be decided before a judicial tribunal no doubt they all remembered the painful circumstances of sir geoffrey kynastons death and the mystery with which it was surrounded that death took place within a stones throw of the cottage where the prisoner was then living under an assumed name and more than three miles away from any other dwelling place or refuge of any sort he reminded them of the speedy search that had been made and its extraordinary nonsuccess under those circumstances a certain amount of suspicion naturally attached itself to the prisoner and a search warrant was duly applied for and duly carried out at that time nothing suspicious was discovered owing in some measure he was bound to say to the scrupulous delicacy with which the magistrate who had signed itlooking toward mr thurwellhad insisted upon its being carried out subsequently however and acting upon later information detective robson of scotland yard was appointed to look into the case and the result of his investigation was the issuing of the warrant under which the prisoner stood charged with the murder of sir geoffrey kynaston their worships would hear the evidence of detective robson who was now present  detective robson stepped forward and was sworn on the 15th of june last he said he searched the prisoners cottage on the thurwell court estate he there found in the secret recess of a cabinet which had apparently not been opened for some time a dagger produced in a case evidently intended to hold two and which was an exact facsimile of the one also produced with which the murder was committed he found also a towel produced which was stained with blood and several letters with regard to the towel he here added that in one corner of the room was fixed a small basin and on the floor just beneath covered over by a carpet and bearing several signs of attempted obliteration was a large blood stain the woman who had cleaned the cottage prior to mr maddisons occupation was in court and would swear that the stain in question was not there at that time he mentioned these details first he went on to say but the more important part of his evidence had reference to these letters and his subsequent action with regard to them he would call attention to one of them he remarked producing it and allow the bench to draw their own conclusions he would read it to them and they could then examine it for themselves  the thin rustling sheet of foreign notepaper which he held in his hand was covered closely with delicate feminine handwriting and emitted a faint sweet perfume for the first time during the hearing of the case bernard maddison showed some slight emotion as the letters were handed about but he restrained it immediately  the sentence which detective robson read out was as follows       bernard those who have sinned against their fellow creatures and      against their god may surely be left to his judgment the      vengeance which seeks to take life is a cruel bloodthirsty passion      which no wrong can excuse no suffering justify forgive me if i      seem to dwell so much upon this that terrible oath which at his      bidding i heard you swear against sir geoffrey kynaston rings ever      in my ears  there were other sentences of a somewhat similar nature as mr thurwell listened to them he felt his heart sink what could avail against such evidence as this  there was no hesitation at all on the part of the magistrates bernard maddison had pleaded not guilty but had declined to say another word anything there is to be said on my behalf he remarked quietly in answer to a question from the bench i will say myself to the jury before whom i presume you will send me  while the committal was being made out mr thurwell leaned over and whispered to him  helen sends her love i will arrange about the defence and will try and see you myself before the trial  you need send no lawyer to me he answered i shall defend myself  mr thurwell said no more he was a little dazed by those letters but he was not going to allow himself to be influenced by them for his daughters sake as well as his own he did not like to admit himself in the wrong and he had made up his mind that this man was innocent innocent he must therefore be proved as to his defending himself that was all nonsense he would see to that dewes should be instructed  the committal was read out and bernard maddison was removed from the court on the following day he was to be taken to york there to be tried at the forthcoming assizes mr thurwell bade him keep up his courage in a tone which though it was intended to be cheerful was not particularly sanguine there was but one opinion in the court and despite all his efforts its influence had a certain effect upon him but bernard maddison never carried himself more proudly than when he bowed to lord lathon and left the court that morning  at home helen was eagerly waiting for the news she had no need to ask for her fathers face was eloquent  is itvery bad she whispered  he looked away from her with a queer feeling in his throat to see his daughter who had always been so quiet and selfcontained and dignifiedhis princess he had been used to call herto see her trembling with nervous fear was a new and terrible thing to him and to be able to offer her no comfort was worse still but what could he say  the evidence was rather bad he admitted and only a portion of it was produced still we must hope for the best  please tell me all about it she begged very quietly but with a look in her white face which made him turn away from her with a groan but he obeyed and told her everything and then there was a long silence  how did he look she asked after a while  very pale but he behaved in a most dignified manner throughout he told her he must be well born i wonder what or where his people are i never heard of any of them did you  she shook her head  he told me once that he had no friends and no relations and no name save the one which he had made for himself she said i dont know whether he meant that maddison was not his real name or whether he meant simply his reputation  there must be people in london who know all about him mr thurwell remarked a man of his celebrity can scarcely conceal his family history  helen had walked a little away and was standing before the window looking out with listless eyes  father i wonder whether sir allan beaumerville has anything to do with this she said has he ever hinted to you that he suspected mr maddison  certainly not he answered why do you ask  because one afternoon last week i saw him come out of falcons nest it was the afternoon he went botanizing  mr thurwell shook his head  the detective mentioned the date of his visit and search he said it was a month ago  she wrung her hands and turned away in despair  it must have been through those dreadful people i went to she sobbed oh i was madmad  i scarcely think that mr thurwell said thoughtfully they would not have kept altogether in the background and let scotland yard take the lead if it had been so what is it roberts  the servant had entered bearing an orangecolored envelope on a salver which he carried towards helen  a telegram for miss thurwell sir he said  she took it and tore it open it was from the strand london and the color streamed into her cheeks as she read it aloud       we must see you at once in the interests of b m can you call on      us tomorrow morning levy  son  when are the assizes at york father she asked quickly  in ten days  and you are going to london today are you not to see dewes  yes  then i will go with you she said crumpling up the telegram in her hand     chapter xxxvi  mr levy promises to do his best   once more mr benjamin levy trod the pavement of piccadilly and the strand and was welcomed back again amongst his set with acclamations and many noisy greetings one more unit was added to the vast army of london youth who pass their time in the fascinating but ignominious occupation of aping the man about town in a very small way and benjamin levy strange to say was happy for the life suited him exactly he had brains and money enough to be regarded in a certain measure as one of their leaders and to be looked up to as a power amongst them and it was a weakness of his disposition that he preferred this to being a nonentity of a higher type  certain of his particular cronies had organized a small supper at a middleclass restaurant on the previous night in honor of his return and as a natural consequence mr benjamin levy walked down the strand at about halfpast ten on the following morning on his way to the office a little paler than usual and with a suspicion of a head it would have suited him very much better to have remained in bed for an hour or two and risen towards afternoon but business was business and it must be attended to so he tried to banish the effects of the bad champagne imbibed on the previous night with a stiff glass of brandy and soda and lighting a fresh cigarette turned off the strand and made his way to the office  guvnor in he inquired of the solitary clerk a sharpfeatured jewishlooking young man who was sitting on a high stool with his hands in his pockets apparently unburdened with stress of work  the youth nodded and jerked his head backwards  somethings up he remarked laconically hes on the rampage  mr benjamin passed on without remark and entered the inner office it was easy indeed to see that something had gone wrong mr levy was walking restlessly up and down with a newspaper in his hand and muttering to himself in a disturbed manner at his sons entrance he stopped short and looked at him angrily  benjamin my boy he said rustling the paper before his face youve been made a fool of scotland yard have licked us  mr benjamin yawned and tilted his hat on the back of his head  whats up now guvnor he inquired  his father laid the paper flat on the desk before him and pointed to one of the paragraphs with trembling fingers  read that read that he exclaimed  his obedient son glanced at it and pushed the paper away in contempt  stale news he remarked shortly  mr levy looked at him amazed  maybe you knew all about it he remarked a little sarcastically  may be i did was the cool reply  and yet you have let them be beforehand with us mr levy exclaimed angrily if this was to be done why did we not do it  because weve got a better game to play answered the junior partner of the firm with a hardly restrained air of triumph  mr levy regarded his son with a look of astonishment which speedily changed into one of admiration  is this true benjamin he asked butbut  but you dont understand benjamin interrupted impatiently of course you dont and youll have to wait a bit for an explanation too for heres the very person i was expecting he added raising himself on his stool and looking out of the window now father just you sit quiet and dont say a word he went on quickly leave it all to me ill pull the thing through  mr levy had only time to express by a pantomimic sign his entire confidence in his sons diplomacy before miss thurwell was announced she was shown in at once  i had your telegram she began hurriedly what does it mean can you do anything  mr benjamin placed a chair for her and took up his favorite position on the hearthrug  i hope so miss thurwell he said quietly first of all of course you are aware that mr maddisons arrest was as much of a surprise to us as to any one we neither had any hand in it nor should we have dreamed of taking any step of the sort  i thought it could not be you she answered how do you think it came about  mr levy junior shrugged his shoulders  quite in the ordinary course he answered so i should think the police have never let the matter really drop and i should imagine that he had been watched for some time how it came to pass however it is not worth while discussing now the question with you i presume iscan he be saved  yes that is it helen answered quietly but with deep intensity can he be saved do you know anything can you help  mr benjamin levy cleared his throat and appeared to reflect for a moment or two then he turned towards helen and commenced speaking earnestly  look here miss thurwell he said your interest in this matter is of course a personal one mine on the other hand is naturally a business one you understand that  she nodded  yes i understand that she said  let us put it on a business basis then he went on the question is what will you give us to get mr maddison off thats putting it baldly but weve no time to waste mincing matters  i will give you onetwo thousand pounds if you can do it she said her voice trembling with eagerness will that be enough  two thousand five hundredthe five hundred for expenses mr benjamin said firmly father make out a paper and miss thurwell will sign it  at once she answered drawing off her glove mr levy you have some hope you know something tell me about it please she begged  miss thurwell he said at present i can tell you no more than this i really think that i shall be able in a short time to upset the whole case against mr maddison i cant tell you more at present let me have your address and you shall hear from me  she had signed her name to the document which mr levy had drawn up and she now wrote her address mr benjamin copied the latter into his pocketbook and prepared to show his visitor out  i really dont think that you need be very anxious miss thurwell he said hopefully at present things look bad enough but i think that when the time comes i shall be able to throw a different light upon them  thank you she answered dropping her veil you will let me know immediately you have definite news  immediately miss thurwell you may rely upon that goodmorning  he closed the door after her and returning to his seat scribbled something on a piece of paper then he rang the bell  is morrison about he asked the boy  been in and gone round at the golden sun if wanted  take him this slip of paper ordered benjamin and tell him to keep a keen watch on the person whose name and address are there understand  the boy nodded and withdrew then mr benjamin looked across at his father  well guvnor he remarked laconically  benjamin his fond parent replied with enthusiasm you are indeed a jewel of a son  i think i am benjamin replied modestly come out and have a drink     chapter xxxvii  bernard a prisoner   the arrest and committal of bernard maddison on a charge of murder created the most profound sensation in every circle of english society his work abstruse and scholarly though some of it was had appealed to a great reading public and had made his name like a household word that long deep cry for a larger and sweeter culture which had been amongst the signs of this troubled generation had found its most perfect and adequate expression in his works he had been at once its interpreter and its guide there were thoughtful men and women a great mixed class who in their own minds reckoned themselves as his apostles and acknowledged no other intellectual master some were of the highest rank of society others of the very lowest it was a literary republic of which he had been the unacknowledged dictator containing all those whose eyes had been in any way opened who had felt stirring even faintly within them that instinct of minddevelopment and expansion to which his work seemed peculiarly fitted to minister and so although his career as an apostle of culture had been but a short one he was already the leader of a school whose tenets it would have been a heresy to modern taste to doubt or question  the news of this tragical event therefore fell like a thunderbolt upon society eclipsing every other topic in the newspapers in conversation and general interest the first instinct of every one appeared to be to look upon the whole affair as a ludicrous piece of mismanagement on the part of the police and scotland yard came in for a good deal of scathing criticism as is usual in such cases but when the evidence before the magistrates was carefully read and sundry other little matters discussed mens tongues began to run less glibly of course it was impossible that it could be true and yet the evidence was certainly strong in the country generally the first impulse of generous disbelief was followed by a period of pained and reserved expectancy in clubdom where neither fear of the devil nor love of god had yet been able to keep the modern man of the world from discussing freely any subject interesting to him a gradual but sure reaction against the possibilities of his innocence set in  there were plenty of men about still who remembered sir geoffrey kynaston and the peculiar manner of his life during his long absence from england there had been many rumors about concerning its reason and now these were all suddenly revived the breach of a certain commandment a duel at boulogne and many other similar adventures were freely spoken of after all this story improbable though it sounded was far from impossible it had always been reckoned a little mysterious that nothing whatever had been known of bernard maddisons antecedents great though had been his fame and assiduous his interviewers as all these things began slowly to fit themselves together men commenced to look grave and to avoid the subject in the presence of their womankind who were one and all unswerving in their loyalty to that dear delightful bernard maddison who had written those exquisite books but in the smokingroom and among themselves views were gradually adopted which it would have been heresy to avow in the drawingroom  no man appeared to take less interest in the event and the discussion of it than sir allan beaumerville known generally amongst his acquaintances as a cynic and pessimist men were pretty sure what his opinion would be but he never expressed it whenever he strolled up to any group in the smokingroom or library of the club and found them discussing the maddison murder case he turned on his heel and walked another way if it were broached in his presence it was the signal for his retirement and any question concerning it he refused pointblank to answer gradually the idea sprang up and began to circulate that sir allan beaumerville had formed an idea of his own concerning the maddison murder and that it was one which he intended to keep to himself every one was curious about it but in the face of his reticence no one cared to ask him what it was                                       a plain whitewashed cell with high bare walls and tiny window through which the sunlight could only struggle faintly only one article of furniture which could justly be called such a rude wooden bedstead and seated on its end with folded arms and bent head like a man in some sort of stupor sat bernard maddison  he was in that most pitiable of all states when merciless realization had driven before it all apathy all lingering hope all save that deadly cold sea of absolute unutterable despair there had been moments on his first arrival here when he had fallen into a dozing sleep and had leaped up from his hard bed and had stretched up his hands above his head and had called out in agony that it must be a dream a hideous nightmare from which he would awaken only to look back upon it with horror and then his glazed fearful eyes had slowly taken in his surroundingsthe stone walls the cold floor the barred windowand pitiless memory had dragged back his thoughts amongst the vivid horrors of the last fortyeight hours it was all there written in letters of fire he shrunk back upon his mattress and buried his face in his hands whilst every instinct of manliness fought against the sobs which seemed as though they would rend to pieces his very frame  once more the morning light had come and the burning agony of the hours of darkness was exchanged for the cold crushing despair of the weary day they had brought his breakfast which he had loathed and left untasted and then as he sat there so worn out with physical and mental exhaustion something of a dull miserable apathy acted like opium on his wearied nerves and brain he sat there thinking  the great passions of the world are either our sweetest happiness or our most utter misery not unfrequently the one becomes the other circumstances may change but the force remains sometimes after yielding us the most exquisite pleasure to lash us with scorpionlike whips the love of bernard maddison had thrilled through heart and soulit had become not a thing of his life but his whole life every impulse and passion of his being had yielded itself up to it ambition intellectual visions imaginative fancies all these had been not indeed driven out by this passion but more fatal still they had opened their arms to receive it they had bidden it welcome and heart and brain and imagination had glowed with a new significance and a newborn power a lesser love would have had a lesser effect it would have made rivals of these other parts of himself not so the love of bernard maddison every fiber of his deep strong nature was strengthened and beautified by this newkindled fire at that moment had he been free to write he would have been conscious of a capacity beyond any which he had ever before possessed for a great nature is perfected by a great love as the blossoms of spring by the april showers and may sun the dry dust of scholarship sometimes chokes up the well of fancy the perfect humanity of love acts like a sweet quickening impulse upon it breathing sweet soft life into dry images and rich coloring into pallid visions such love which is at once spiritual and passionate of heaven and of the earth absorbing and concentrative widening and narrowing is to a mans nature if he be strong enough to conceive and appreciate it the very food the essence of sublimated life  to bernard maddison it had been so to its very depths he realized it as he sat in his prison cell with something of the deep passive resignation of the man who stands with one foot in the grave the latter part of his lifenay the whole of ithad been full of noble dreams and pure thoughts his genius had never run riot over the whole face of nature to yield its fruits in a sickly sweet realism with only faint flashes of his deeper power always subordinated by the innate and cultured healthiness of his mind he had sent it forth a living power for good great joy had been his as he had watched his message to the world listened to and understood and appreciated another age might witness its fruits it was sufficient for him that the seed was rightly planted  oh the horror of itthe burning unspeakable horror in his ears there seemed to come ringing from the world without the great hum of gossip and lies which were dragging his name down into hell a murderer the time might come when she too would think thus of him when the tragedy of her first love might fade away and the lovelight might flash again in her eyes but not for him he shook his head wildly stretched out his hands as though to hide something from his quivering face and barely suppressed the groan of deep agony which trembled on his lips god in his mercy keep him from such thoughts death disgrace surpassing humiliation let them float in their ghostly garments before his shuddering gaze but keep that thought from him for with it madness moved hand in hand as michael angelo had stifled his grief at vittoria colonnas death in the sweet hope of rejoining her as soon as the last lingering breath should leave his mortal body and as dante had hoped for his beatrice so let him think of the woman without whom no human life was possible for him almost he cried out in his agony no spiritual hope or longing  the sound of the key in the lock of his door and the tramp of footsteps on the stone floor outside awoke him with a start from his halfdreaming state the thought of visitors being permitted to come had never occurred to him nor did it even then the footsteps had paused outside his door but he felt no interest in them nor ever the vaguest stirrings of curiosity then the harsh lock was turned with a grating sound and two figures followed by the prison warder entered the room     chapter xxxviii  there is my hand dare you take it   there is nothing which can transport one so quickly from thoughtland to acute and comprehensive realization as the sound of a human voice or the consciousness of a human presence like a flash it all came back to the lonely occupant of the prison cellthe personal degradation of his position his surroundings and everything connected with them and with it too came a strong keen desire to bear himself like a man before her father  he rose to his feet and the pitiful bareness of the place seemed to become suddenly enhanced by the quiet dignity of his demeanor out of the gloom mr thurwell came forward with outstretched hand followed by another gentlemana stranger between the two men that one long ray of sunlight lay across the stone floor and as bernard maddison stepped forward to meet his visitor it gleamed for a moment upon his white haggard face worn and stricken yet retaining all that quiet force and delicacy of expression which seemed like the index of his inward life it was the face of a poet of a dreamer a visionary perhapsbut a criminal the thing seemed impossible  this is very good of you mr thurwell he said in a low but clear tone i scarcely expected that i should be permitted to see visitors  mr thurwell grasped his hand and held it for a moment without speaking he had all an englishmans reticence of speech in times of great emotion and it seemed to him that there was nothing that he could say but silence was very eloquent  i have brought mr dewes with me he said at last he wants to see you about the defence you know the high sheriffs a friend of mine so i got him to pass me in at the same time but if youd rather see dewes alone youll say so wont you  there had been an acute nervous force working in bernard maddisons face during that brief silence at mr thurwells words a change came he dropped his visitors hand and his features were still and cold as marble and almost as expressionless save for the lightly drawn lips and lowered eyebrows which gave to his expression a fixed look of power  that is very kind and thoughtful of you mr thurwell and i am sorry that you should have had the trouble to no purpose i have nothing to add to my previous decision i will not be represented by either lawyer or counsel  mr dewes moved forward out of the background and bowed he was a handsome middleaged man looking more like a cavalry officer than a solicitor but as everyone knew so far as criminal cases were concerned he was the cleverest lawyer in london  you are relying upon your innocence of course mr maddison he said but it is a very great mistake to suppose that it will establish itself without extraneous aid you will have the attorneygeneral against you and you must have some one of the same caliber on your side the old saying truth will out does not apply in an assize court it requires to be dragged out i think you will do well to accept my services roberts holds himself open to take the brief for your defence if i wire him before midday  i seldom change my mind bernard maddison said quietly in the present case i shall not do so if it seems to me that there is anything which should be said on my behalf i shall say it myself  there was a short silence mr dewes looked at mr thurwell and mr thurwell looked both perplexed and worried  maddison you must admit that yours is an extraordinary decision he said at last you must forgive me if i ask you in plain words what your reason is for it i ask as one who is willing to be your friend in this matter and i ask you as helens father  a sudden spasm of pain passed across bernard maddisons face he shrunk back a little and when he spoke his voice sounded hollow and strained  i do not deny you the right to askbut i cannot tell you simply it is my will it is best so it must be so  can you not see mr maddison the lawyer said quietly that to some people this will seem almost like a tacit admission of guilt  i shall plead not guilty he answered in a low tone  that will be looked upon only as a matter of form mr dewes remarked mr maddison i should not be doing my duty if i did not point out to you that the evidence against you is terribly strong just consider it yourself only for a moment sir geoffrey kynaston is known to have seriously wronged a member of your family you are known to have sworn an oath of vengeance against him there are witnesses coming from abroad to prove that immediately on his return to his home you take a cottage under an assumed name close to his estate he is found murdered close to that cottage of which it seems that at that time you were the only occupant you are the only person known to have been near the spot the dagger is proved to be yours letters are found in your cabinet urging you to desist from your threatened vengeance there is the stain of blood on the floor of your study near the place where you would have washed your hands and a bloodstained towel is found hidden in the room all this and more can be proved and unless you can throw a fresh light upon these things there is no jury in the world that would not find you guilty you hold your fate in your own hands  i have considered all this bernard maddison answered in a low tone i know that my case is almost hopeless and i am prepared for the worst  mr thurwell turned away and walked to the furthermost corner of the apartment for his daughters sake and for the sake of his own strong liking for this man he had resolutely shut his eyes upon the damning chain of evidence against him now he felt that that he could do so no longer nothing but guilt could account for this strange reticence he was forced to admit it at last his compassion was still strong but it was mingled with a great horror he felt that he must get away as soon as possible  mr dewes who had all along had the most profound conviction of the guilt of the accused man seized his opportunity and stepping close up to him whispered in his ear  mr maddison i should like to save you if i can there have been casesforgive me for suggesting itin which by knowing every circumstance and trifling detail connected with a crime we have been able to build up a def  bernard maddison drew himself up with a sudden hauteur and raised his hand  stop mr dewes he said firmly i do not blame you for assuming what you do but you are mistaken i am not guilty i do not ask you to believe it i only ask you to bring this painful interview to an end  we will go said mr thurwell suddenly advancing from the other end of the cell i am not your judge bernard maddison and it is not for me to hold you guilty god shall pass his own judgment upon you there is my hand dare you take it  for answer bernard maddison stepped forward and clasped it in his own once more he had moved from out of the darkness and a soft stream of sunshine fell upon his pallid face white though it was even to ghastliness it betrayed no sign of blanching or fear and his dark eyes from their hollow depths shone with a clear steadfast light once more its calm spirituality the effortless force which seemed to lurk in every line and feature of the pale wasted countenance had its effect upon mr thurwell he wrung the hand which it had cost him a suppressed effort to take and for the moment his doubts faded away  god help you maddison he said fervently shall i tell her anything from you  a faint smile parted his tremulous lips at that moment he was beyond earthly suffering a sweet strong power had filled his heart with peace  tell her not to grieve and that i am innocent he said softly farewell     chapter xxxix  mr benjamin levy is busy   a woman stood on the little stone piazza of that italian villa with her face raised in agony to the blue sky and her thin white hands wrung together with frantic nervous strength her whole attitude was full of the hopeless abandonment of a great tearless grief and slowly dawning passion long a stranger to her calm face was creeping into her features on the ground spurned beneath her feet was a long officiallooking letter and envelope a thunderbolt had flashed down upon the sweet stillness of her serene life  she was quite alone and she looked out upon an unbroken solitudethat fair neglected garden with its high walls which seemed to give it an air of peculiar exclusiveness  i will not go she said speaking quickly to herself in an odd uneven tone the law of england shall not make me i am an old woman if they do they cannot open my lips i to stand up in one of their courts and tell the story of my shame that they may listen and condemn my son oh bernard bernard bernard the lord have mercy upon you for this your crime mine was the sin mine should be the guilt oh my god my god is this just in my old age to pour down this fire of punishment upon my bowed head have i not suffered and done penanceay until i had even thought that i had won for myself peace and rest and forgiveness was it a sin to think so is this my punishment oh bernard my son my son let not the sin be his o lord it is minemine only  sweet perfumes were floating upon the soft still air and away on the hill sides the morning mists were rolling away the suns warmth fell upon the earth and the flowers and birds and humming insects were glad and in the midst of it all she stood there a silent stony figure grief and anguish and despair written in her worn face god was dealing very hardly with her she cried in her agony truly sin was everlasting  signorina  she turned round with a start a servant girl stood by her side with a card on a salver  a gentleman to see the signorina she announced an english gentleman  the woman turned pale with fear and her fingers trembled she would not even glance at the name on the card  tell him that i see no one i am ill i will not see him be his business what it may do you hear child go and send him away  the girl curtsied and disappeared her mistress stepped back into the room and listened fearfully soon there came what she had dreaded the sound of an altercation she could hear nicolette protesting in her shrill patois and a rather vulgar but very determined english voice vigorously asserting itself then there came the sound of something almost like a scuffle and nicolette came running in with red eyes  signorina the brute the brute she cried he will come in he dared to lay his hands upon me see he is here oh that marco had been in the house he should have beaten him the dog the coward to oppose a womans will by force  while she had been sobbing out her complaint her assailant had followed up his advantage and mr benjamin levy in a rather loud check suit and with a cringing air but with a certain dogged determination in his manner appeared mrs martival turned to him with quiet dignity but with flashing eyes  sir by what right do you dare to enter my house by force and against my command i will not speak with you or know your business i will have no communication with you  then your son will be hanged mr benjamin said with unaccustomed bluntness  mrs martival trembled and sank into a chair mr benjamin followed up his advantage  i am not from the police i have no connection with them on the other hand i am considerably interested in saving your son and i tell you that i can put into your hands the means of doing so now will you listen to me  something in mrs martivals face checked him the features had suddenly become rigid and an ashy pallor had stolen over them nicolette who had been lingering in the room suddenly threw herself on her knees beside her mistresss side and caught hold of her hands  oh the wretch she cried the miserable wretch he has killed my mistress  he stood helplessly by while she ran backwards and forwards with cold water smelling salts and other restoratives keeping up all the while a running fire of scathing comments upon his heartless conduct of which needless to say he understood not a single word beneath his breath he cursed this unlucky fainting fit he had already lost a day on the way and the time was short what if she were to be illtoo ill to be moved the very thought made him restless and uneasy  in the midst of the confusion mrs martivals housekeeper returned from her marketing in the little town and to his relief he found that she understood english he interrupted nicolettes shrill torrents of abuse against him and briefly explained the situation  i do not wish to force myself upon her he said i do not wish to be troublesome in any way but when she is conscious i want you just to show her half a dozen words which i will write on the back of a card if when she has read them she still wishes me to go i will do so without attempting to see her again  the woman nodded  very well she said wait outside  he left the room and walked softly up and down the passage eyeing with some contempt the rich faded curtains and quaint artistic furniture about the place so unlike the gilded glories of his own taste in about half an hour the housekeeper came out to him  she is conscious now she said give me your message  he gave her a card on which he had already penciled a few words and waited terribly anxious for the result the woman withdrew and closed the door for a moment there was silence then a wild fierce cry rang out from the room and echoed through the house before it had died away the door was flung open and she stood on the threshold her white hair streaming down her back and every vestige of color gone from her face her eyes too shone with a feverish glow which fascinated him  is it you who wrote this she cried holding up the card clenched in her trembling fingers if you are a man tell me is it true  i believe it is he answered in my own mind i am certain that it is you are the only person who can prove it i want you to come to england with me  i am ready she said when can we start  he looked at his watch  i will be here in half an hour with a carriage he said if we can get over the hills by midday we shall catch the express  go then she said calmly i shall be waiting for you  he hurried away and soon returned with a carriage from the inn in less than an hour they had commenced their journey to england                                       it was an early summer evening in mayfair and sir allan beaumerville stood on the balcony of his bijou little house for which he had lately deserted the more stately family mansion in grosvenor square there was a soft pleasant stillness in the air and a gentle rustling of green leaves among the trees the streets below were almost blocked with streams of carriages and hansoms for the season was not yet over and it was fast approaching the fashionable dinner hour overhead in somewhat curious contrast the stars were shining in a deep cloudless sky and a goldenhorned moon hung down in the west  sir allan was himself dressed for the evening with an orchid in his buttonhole and a light overcoat on his arm in the street his night brougham with its pair of great thoroughbred horses stood waiting yet he made no movement toward it he did not appear to be waiting for anyone nor was he watching the brilliant throng passing westward his eyes were fixed upon vacancy and there was a certain steadfast rapt look in them which altered his expression curiously sir allan beaumerville seldom used his powers of reflection save for practical purposes just then however he was departing from his usual custom strange ghosts of a strange past were flitting through his mind old passions which had long lain undisturbed were sweeping through him old dreams were revived old memories kindled once more smoldering fires and aided at the resurrection of a former self the cold manoftheworld philosophy which had ruled his life for many years seemed suddenly conquered by this upheaval of a stormy past under the influence of the serene night the starlit sky and the force of these old memories he seemed to realize more than he had ever done before the littleness of his life its colorless egotism the barrenness of its routine like a flash it stood glaringly out before him stripped of all its intellectual furbishing the chill selfishness of the creed he had adopted struck home to his heart a finite life with a finite goalannihilation had it really ever satisfied him could it satisfy anyone a great weariness crept in upon him epicureanism could have been carried no further than he had carried it he had steeped his senses in the most refined and voluptuous pleasures civilization had to offer him where was the afterglow was this all that remained a palled appetite a hungry heart and a cold chill despair what comfort could his muchstudied philosophy afford him it had satisfied the brain had it nothing to offer the heart something within him seemed to repeat the word with a grim echo nothing nothing nothing  what was it that caused his eyes to droop till they rested upon two figures on the opposite pavement he could not tell whence the power and yet he obeyed the impulse they glanced over the man with indifference and met the womans upturned gaize and sir allan beaumerville stood like a figure of stone with a deathlike pallor in his marble face  the stream of carriages swept on and the motley crowds of men and women passed on their way unnoticing little they knew that a tragedy was being played out before their very eyes a few noticed that stately whitehaired lady gazing strangely at the house across the way and a few too saw the figure of the man on whom her eyes were bent but no one could read what passed between them that lay in their own hearts  interruption came at last mr benjamin levys excitement mastered his patience he asked the question which had been trembling on his lips  is it he  she started and laid her hand upon his shoulder for support she was very much shaken  yes see he is beckoning he wants me i shall go to him may god give me strength  she moved forward to cross the road he caught hold of her arm in sudden fear  you mustnt think of it he exclaimed you will spoil everything i want you to come with me todn come back i say come back curse the woman  he stood on the pavement fuming she had glided from his grasp and his words had fallen upon deaf ears already she was half across the road the door of sir allans house stood open and a servant was hurrying down to meet her at that moment mr benjamin levy felt distinctly illused  dd old fool he muttered to himself angrily hi hansom scotland yard and drive like blazes the games getting exciting at any rate he added it was mine easy before that last move now its a blessed toss up which way it goes well ill back my luck i rather reckon i stand to win still if miss thurwell acts on the square     chapter xl  a strange birthday party   it was close upon midnight and one of the oldest and most exclusive of westend clubs was in a state of great bustle and excitement sir allan beaumerville was giving a supper party to his friends to celebrate his sixtieth birthday and the guests were all assembled  sir allan himself was the last to arrive the final touches had been given to the brilliantly decorated supper table and the chef who had done his best for the greatest connoisseur and the most liberal member in the club had twice looked at his watch as midnight struck however sir allans great black horses turned into pall mall and a few minutes later he was quietly welcoming his guests and leading the way into the room which had been reserved for the occasion  as a rule men are not quick at noticing one anothers looks but tonight more than one person remarked upon a certain change in their hosts appearance  beaumervilles getting quite the old man remarked lord lathon as he helped himself to an ortolan looks jolly white about the gills tonight doesnt he  his neighbor a barrister and wearer of the silk adjusted his eyeglass and looked down the table  gad he does he answered looks as though hes had a shock  not at all in his usual form at any rate put in mr thurwell sotto voce from the other side of the table  queer thing but he seems to remind me of some one tonight lord lathon remarked to the home secretary who was on the other side cant remember who it is though its some fellow whos in a devil of a scrape i know who the mischief is it  you mean maddison dont you sir philip roden answered plenty of people have noticed that there is a likeness certainly  by jove there is though lord lathon assented i never noticed it before im devilish sorry for maddison roden and i hope you wont let them hang him  the conversation turned upon the maddison case and became general everybody had something to say about it except sir allan he himself it was noticed forbore to pass any opinion at all and at the first opportunity he diverted the talk into another channel  the quality of his guests spoke volumes for the social position and popularity of their entertainer probably there were not half a dozen men in london who could have got together so brilliant and select an assembly there were only twenty but every man was a man of note politics were represented by the home secretary sir philip roden and the first lord of the treasury the peerage by the duke of leicester and the earl of lathon there were two judges and a half a dozen qcs the most popular novelist of the day and the most renowned physician a prince might have entertained such a company with honor  it had been arranged that the advent of cigars should be the signal for the duke of leicester to rise and propose their hosts health but to the surprise of every one whilst his grace was preparing for the ordeal and was on the point of rising sir allan himself slowly rose to his feet with a look in his still cold face so different from anything that might be expected of a man who rises at two oclock in the morning after a capital supper to make a speech to his guests that every ones attention was at once arrested  i am given to understand gentlemen he said slowly that his grace the duke of leicester was about to propose my health on your behalf i rise to prevent this for two reasons first because to a dying man such a toast could only be a mockery the second reason will be sufficiently apparent when i have said what i have to say to you  every one was stupefied had their host suddenly gone mad or had those empty bottles of heidseck which had just been removed from his end of the table anything to do with it several murmurs for an explanation arose  i had forgotten for the moment sir allan continued that none of you are yet aware of what i have only known myself during the last few days i am suffering from acute heart disease which may terminate fatally at any moment  a sudden awed gloom fell upon the party cigars were put down and shocked glances exchanged a murmur of condolence arose but sir allan checked it with a little gesture  i need scarcely say that i did not ask you to meet me here this evening to tell you this he continued my object is a different one i have a confession to make  the general bewilderment increased the air of festivity was replaced by a dull restrained silence could it be that their hosts illness had affected his brain a painful impression to that effect had passed into the minds of more than one of them  you will say perhaps sir allan continued speaking very slowly and with a certain difficulty in his articulation which did not however prevent every word from being distinctly audible that i am choosing a strange time and place for making a personal statement but i see amongst those who have done me the honor of becoming my guests tonight men whom i should wish to know the whole truth from my own lipsi refer more particularly to you sir philip rodenand tonight is my last opportunity for tomorrow all london will know my story and i shall be banned forever from all converse and intercourse with my fellowmen  very few words will tell my story most of you will remember that i came into my title and fortune late in life my youth was spent in comparative poverty abroad sometimes practicing my profession sometimes living merely as a student and an experimenting scientist in my thirtieth year i married a woman of good family with whom i was very much in love so much so that in order to win her i forged a letter from the man whom she would otherwise have married and obtained her consent in a fit of indignation at his supposed infidelity that man gentleman was sir geoffrey kynaston  there was a subdued murmur of astonishment every ones interest was suddenly redoubled sir allan proceeded standing at the head of the table motionless as a statue but with a strange look in his white face  in every possible way i failed in my duty as a husband toward my wife she was lighthearted fond of change gayety travel i shut her up in a quiet oldfashioned town while i pursued my studies and expected her to content herself with absolute solitude for years i crushed the life out of her by withdrawing every interest and every amusement from her life we had one child only a son  from bad things grew to worse what i had dreaded came to pass she discovered my treachery still she was faithful to me but we were husband and wife in name only  time passed on and she made a few friends and went out occasionally then who should come by accident to the little town where we lived but sir geoffrey kynaston i was madly insanely jealous and i forbade my wife to meet him she declined to obey me and she was quite right to do so at that time she was as faithful to me as any woman could be and she treated my suspicions as they deserved to be treated with contempt sir geoffrey and she met as friends and if it had not been for my brutality they would never have met in any other way  one night there was a fête and dance in our little town my wife went against my orders and sir geoffrey escorted her home a demon of jealousy entered into my soul that night although all the time i knew that my wife was faithful to me the worse half of my nature whispered to me that she was not and wretch that i was i stooped to listen to it when she returned i was mad with a fit of ungovernable rage i shut my doors against her and refused to allow her to enter my house i taunted her with her infidelity i bade her go to her lover she went to some friends and for two days she waited for a message from me i sent none and on the third day she left the place with sir geoffrey kynaston in less than a month she was in a convent and from that day to this she has lived the life of a holy woman  there was a slight tremor in his voice for the first time and he paused the silence was profound everyone sat motionless everyones eyes were fixed upon him in a moment he continued  although by sheer brutality by coarse insults and undeviating cruelty i had driven my wife to the edge of the precipice my rage against the man whom i knew she had always loved burned as fiercely as though he had won her from me by the cruelest means i followed them to vienna and insulted him publicly my wife left him on that very night and he has never seen her since but sir geoffrey and i fought on the sands near boulogne and i strove my utmost to kill him fortune was against me however and i was wounded i returned to my home with my thirst for vengeance unabated i taught my son to curse the name of sir geoffrey kynaston and as soon as i had recovered from my wounds i hunted him all over europe where he spent those years i cannot tell but he eluded me often i reached a town only to learn that he had left it but a few days once i remember at belgrade i was only a few hours behind him but meet him face to face i could not  when at last i saw my son again i found him grown up and in his first words he told me boldly that he had espoused his mothers cause and that he withdrew altogether from his vow of vengeance against sir geoffrey kynaston i left him in a fury and almost immediately afterwards came the unexpected news of my accession to the baronetcy of beaumerville i made up my mind then to turn over the past chapter of my life and start the world afresh i had always been known by the family name of martival and my wife was unaware of my connection with the beaumerville family taking advantage of this i sent her false news of my death at paris and started life afresh as sir allan beaumerville  the past however soon began to cast its shadows into the future a new author calling himself bernard maddison was one night introduced to me at a crowded assembly i held out my hand which he did not take and recognized my son  there was a general start the first gleam of light struggled into the minds of the little group of listeners they began to see whither this thing was tending and everyone looked very grave  i had nothing to fear sir allan continued my son showed by his looks the contempt in which he held me we met frequently after that but we never exchanged a single word he kept my secret too from his mothernot for my sake but for her own  six months after our first meeting sir geoffrey kynaston returned to england it may seem strange to you gentlemen but my hate for this man had never lessened never decreased the moment i heard the news i began to lay my plans  then for the first time my son sought me he had come he said to make one request and if i granted it he would leave me in peace forever would i tell him that my oath had been buried with the old life and that i would seek no harm to my old enemy i simply declined to discuss the matter with him and he went away  from that time he commenced to watch me i laid my plans deeply but somehow he got to hear of them when i went down on a visit to you lord lathon that i might be near sir geoffrey he took a small cottage in the neighborhood intending to do his best to counteract my schemes but i was too cunning for him  on the morning of sir geoffreys murder i was on the cliffs under the pretence of botanizing while there i heard the guns of a shooting party and through a fieldglass i saw mr thurwell and sir geoffrey kynaston at that time i scarcely thought that chance would bring sir geoffrey within my power but i made up my mind to watch them  accordingly i descended from the cliffs and on my way passed close to my sons cottage i looked in at his sittingroom through the open windows and it seemed as though the devil must have guided my eyes his cabinet was open and right opposite my eyes was a pair of long turkish daggers carelessly thrown down with a heap of other curios i listened there was no one about i stepped through the window seized one of them and hurried away about a hundred yards from the cottage was a long narrow belt of plantation running from a considerable distance inland almost to the cliff side here i concealed myself and looked out at the shooting party i could see them all hurrying across the moor except sir geoffrey kynaston while i was wondering what had become of him i heard footsteps on the other side of the plantation i stole back to the edge and looked out coming slowly down by the side of the ditch was sir geoffrey with his gun under his arm and whistling softly to himself he was alone there was no one within sight gentlemen it is an awful confession which i am making to you i stole out upon him as he passed and stabbed him to the heart so that he died without a groan  rembrandt might have found a worthy study in the faces of the men seated round that brilliant supper table blank horror seemed to hold them all speechless sir allan too was trembling and his hand which rested upon the table was as white as the damask cloth  suddenly there was a knock at the door and a waiter entered  a gentleman wishes to speak with sir allan beaumerville he announced  sir philip roden rose to his feet and pointed to the door  the gentleman must wait nillson he answered leave the room now and see that we are not interrupted until i ring the bell  the servant bowed and withdrew after a wondering glance at the faces of the little party sir philip roden left his seat and crossing the room locked the door  sir allan beaumerville he said quietly there can be only one course to take with regard to the painful disclosures which you have laid before us tonight if you have anything to add please let us hear it quickly  sir allan continued at once  i went back to my sons cottage i washed my hands in his room and the towel i concealed in his cabinet just as i was leaving he entered what passed between us i need not mention i took up my botanizing case and hurried away along the cliffs and afterward was met by mr thurwells servant with whom i returned once more to look upon my work then came the time when suspicion commenced to fall upon my son i implored him to leave the country he refused at last he was arrested for the father whom he can only despise he has been willing to die tonight i had made up my mind to leave a confession of my guilt and fly my plans are changed only a few hours ago i looked into the face of one whom i had never thought to see again in this world her advice i am now following to her care i entrusted my confession and to your ears i have detailed it my story is done gentlemen sir philip roden i place myself in your hands  his last words had been almost drowned by a clamorous knocking at the closed door when he had ceased sir philip roden rose and opened it two men entered at once followed by mr benjamin levy the men recognized sir philip and saluted  what is your business he asked  we hold a warrant for the arrest of sir allan beaumerville sir was the respectful answer granted on the sworn information of mr benjamin levy there by mr pulsford half an hour ago which is he sir  sir philip pointed to where his late host was standing a little away from the others his hand resting on the carved knob of his highbacked chair and his eyes fixed wildly upon them the man advanced to him at once  you are my prisoner sir allan beaumerville he said quietly i hold a warrant here for your arrest on the charge of having murdered sir geoffrey kynaston on the 12th of august of last year  those who were watching sir allans face closely saw only a slight change its deep pallor grew only a shade more livid and there was a faint twitching of the features then with an awful light flashing into his burning eyes and a cry which rang through the whole building he threw up his arms and fell like a log across the hearth rug every one sprang up and crowded round him but the physician pushed his way through the group and fell on his knees he was up again in a moment looking very pale and awed  keep back gentlemen keep back please he said in a low tone never mind about the brandy sir philip every one had better go away these people from scotland yard need not wait sir allan will answer for his crime at a higher court than ours  and so it indeed was tragical justice had herself added the last and final scene to the drama sir allan beaumervilles lips were closed for ever in this world     chapter xli  innocent   an hour or two before the dénouement of sir allan beaumervilles supper party his brougham had driven up to mr thurwells town house and had set down a lady there she had rung the bell and inquired for miss thurwell  the footman who answered the door looked dubious  miss thurwell was in certainly but she was unwell and saw no visitors and it was late could he take her name  the lady handed him a note  if you will take this to miss thurwell and tell her that i am waiting i think that she will see me she said quietly  the man took it and somewhat impressed by the bearing and manner of speech of the unknown lady he showed her into the morningroom and ringing for miss thurwells maid handed her the note and awaited the decision it was speedily given the lady was to be shown to her room at once  the agonizing suspense in which helen had been living for the last few days had laid a heavy hand upon her her cheeks were thin and had been woefully pale until the sudden excitement of this visit had called up a faint hectic flush which had no kindred with the color of health her form too seemed to have shrunken and the loose teagown which she wore enhanced the fragility of her appearance she had been sitting in a low chair before the fire with her head buried in her hands but when her visitor was announced she was standing up with her dry bright eyes eagerly fixed upon the woman who stood on the threshold the door was closed and they looked at one another for a moment in silence  to an artist the figures of these two women each so intensely interested in the other and each possessed of a distinctive and impressive personality would have been full of striking suggestions helen in her loose gown of a soft dusky orange hue and with no harsher light thrown upon her features than the subdued glow of a shaded lamp and occasional flashes of the firelight which gleamed in her toobrilliant eyes seemed to have lost none of her beauty all her surroundings too went to enhance it the delicatelytoned richness of the coloring around the faintly perfumed air the indefinable suggestion of feminine daintiness so apparent in all the appointments of the little chamber from the semidarkness of her position near the door helens visitor brought her eager scrutiny to an end she advanced a little into the room and spoke  you are helen thurwell she said softly sir allan beaumerville has bidden me come to you you have read his note  yes yes i have read it she answered quickly he tells me that you have newsnews that concerns bernard maddison is it anything that will prove his innocence  it is already proved  helen gave a great cry and sank into a low chair she had no doubts her visitors tone and manner forbade them but the tension of her feelings strung to such a pitch of nervousness gave way all at once her whole frame was shaken with passionate sobs the burning agony of her grief was dissolved in melting tears  and the woman whose glad tidings had brought this change stood all the while patient and motionless once when helen had first yielded to her emotion she had made a sudden movement forward and a sweet sympathetic light had flashed for a moment over her pale features but something had seemed to restrain her some chilling memory which had checked her first impulse and made her resume her former attitude of quiet reserve she stood there and waited by and by helen looked up and started to her feet  i had almost forgotten i am so sorry she said do sit down please and tell me everything and who you are you have brought me the best news i ever had in my life she added with a little burst of gratitude  her visitor remained standingremained grave silent and unresponsive yet there was nothing forbidding about her appearance looking into her soft gray eyes and face still beautiful though wrinkled and colorless helen was conscious of a strange feeling of attraction toward her a sort of unexplained affinity which women in trouble or distress often feel for one another but which the sterner fiber of mans nature rarely admits of she moved impulsively forward and stretched out her hands in mute invitation but there was no response if anything indeed her visitor seemed to shrink a little away from her  you ask me who i am she said softly i am sir allan beaumervilles wife i am bernard maddisons mother  helen sank back upon her chair perfectly helpless this thing was too much for her to grasp she looked up at the woman who had spoken these marvelous words half frightened altogether bewildered  you are sir allan beaumervilles wife she repeated slowly i do not understand i never knew that he was married and bernard maddison his son  helen sat quite still for a moment then light began to stream in upon her darkened understanding suddenly she sprang to her feet  who was it then who killedoh my god i see it all now it was  she ceased and looked at her visitor with blanched cheeks a low tremulous cry of horror broke from lady beaumervilles white lips her calmness seemed gone she was trembling from head to foot  god help him it was my husband who killed sir geoffrey kynaston she cried and the sin is on my head  helen was scarcely less agitated she caught hold of the edge of the table to steady herself her voice seemed to come from a great distance  sir allan i do not understand why did he do that horrible thing  sir geoffrey kynaston and my husband were mortal enemies answered lady beaumerville her voice scarcely raised above a whisper mine was the fault mine the guilt alas alas  the stately head with its wealth of silvery white hair was buried in her hands her attitude the agony which quivered in her tone dying away in her final expression of despair like chords of wild sad music and above all her likeness to the man she loved appealed irresistibly to helen a great pity filled her heart she passed her arm round lady beaumerville and drew her on to the sofa  there were no words between them then only after a while helen asked quietly  sir allanmust he confess  it is already done her visitor answered tomorrow the world will know his guilt and my shame ah she cried her voice suddenly changing i had forgotten turn your face away from me helen thurwell and listen  in the silence of the halfdarkened chamber she told her storytold it in the low humbled tone of saintly penitence rising sometimes into passion and at others falling into an agonized whisper she spoke of her girlhood of the falsehood by which she had been cheated into a loveless marriage and the utter misery which it had brought then she told her of her sin committed in a moment of madness after her husbands brutal treatment and so soon repented of lightly she touched upon her many years of solitary penance her whole lifetime dedicated willingly and earnestly to the expiation of that dark stain and of the coming to her quiet home of the awful news of sir geoffreys murder in her old age her sin had risen up against her remorseless and unsatiated almost she had counted herself forgiven almost she had dared to hope that she might die in peace but sin is everlasting its punishment eternal  here her voice died away in a sudden fit of weakness as though the fierce consuming passion of her grief had eaten away all her strength but in a moment or two she continued  i thought my husband dead and the sin my sons she whispered they sent to me to come to his trial that they might hear from my lips what they thought evidence against him i would have died first then came a young man who told me all and i came with him to england i have seen and spoken with my husband on his table he showed me signed papers his confession was ready this night he said i take my leave of the world thank god he forgave me and i him we have stood handinhand together and the past between us is no more he bade me come here and i have come i have seen the woman my son loves and i am satisfied now i will go  her eyes rested for a moment upon helen full of an inexpressible yearning and there had been a faint sad wistfulness in her tone but when she had finished she drew her cloak around her and turned toward the door  helen let her take a few steps scarcely conscious of her intention then she sprang up and laid her hand upon lady beaumervilles shoulder  you are his mother she said softly may i not be your daughter                                       helen helen i have strange news for you  the room was in semidarkness for the fire had burnt low and the heavily shaded lamp gave out but little light side by side on the low sofa two women handinhand had been sobbing out their grief to one another on the threshold peering with strained eyes through the gloom was mr thurwell his light overcoat hastily thrown over his evening clothes still unremoved  she rose to her feet and he saw the dim outline of her graceful figure even a vision of her white tearstained face  the truth has come out he said gravely tomorrow bernard will be free the man who killed sir geoffrey kynaston has confessed  confessed helen repeated where to whom  to the home secretary to a party of us as we sat at supper his guests at the club helen be prepared for a great surprise the murderer was sir allan beaumerville  i know it helen whispered hoarsely across the room have they arrested sir allan  mr thurwells surprise at his daughters knowledge was forgotten in the horror of the scene which her words had called up across the darkened air of the little chamber it seemed to float again before his shuddering memory and he stretched out his hands for a moment before his face  arrested himno he answered in an agitated tone i have seen nothing so awful in all my life he made his confession at the head of his table the police were clamoring outside with a warrant and while we all sat dazed and stupefied he fell backwarddead  a cry rang through the little chamber a sudden wail half of relief half of anguish helen fell upon her knees by the side of the sofa mr thurwell started and moved forward  who is that he asked quickly i thought you were alone  it is his wife helen answered not without some fear see she has fainted  mr thurwell hesitated only for a moment then his face filled with compassion  god help her he said solemnly i will send the women up to you and a doctor god help her     chapter xlii  at last   the morning sunlight lay upon that wonderful fair garden of the villa the tall white lilies the scarlet poppies the clustering japonica the purple hyacinths and the untrimmed brilliantlyflowering shrubs lifted their heads before its sweet quickening warmth and yielded up their perfume to the still clear air the languorous hour of noon was still far off it was the birth of a southern summer day and everything was fresh and pure untainted by the burning enervating heat which was soon to dry up the sweetness from the earth and the freshness from the slightly moving breeze away on the brown hills fading into a transparent veil of blue the bright dresses of the peasant women stooping at their toil the purple glory of the vineyards and the deep quiet green of the olive grovesall these simple characteristics of the pastoral landscape were like brilliant patches of coloring upon a fitting background soon the haze of the noonday heat would hang upon the earth deadening the purity of its color and making the air heavy and oppressive with faint overladen perfumes but as yet the sun lay low in the heavens and the earth beneath was like a fair still picture  the heavy lumbering coach which connected the little town with the outside world was drawn up at the gate of the villa and twice the quaintly sounding horn had broken the morning stillness it was a moment of farewell a farewell not for days or for years but forever  their words denied it yet in their hearts was that certain conviction and much of that peculiar sadness which it could not fail to bring yet she would not have them stay for the end she had bidden them go and the hour had come  too weak to walk or even sit upright they had laid her upon a sofa in front of the open windows through which the perfume from the garden below stole sweetly in on the bosom of the slowly stirring south wind on one side of her stood a tall mildfaced priest from the brotherhood who had made their home in the valley below on the other were bernard and his wife her son and daughter  there was no doubt that she was dying that she was indeed very near death yet she was sending them away from her the brief while they three had lived there together had been like a late autumn to her life which had blossomed forth with sweet moments of happiness such as she had never dreamed of and now her summons had come and she was ready in her last moments she must return once more to that absolute detachment from all save spiritual things in which for many years she had lived a saintly blessed woman so she had bidden them go even her son even that fair sweet english girl who had been more than a daughter to her she had bidden them go the last words had been spoken for the last time her trembling lips had been pressed to her sons yet they lingered  and there came of a sudden floating through the window the sweet slow chiming of the matins bell from the monastery below almost it seemed as though the soft delicate air through which it passed the exquisite beauty of the sloping landscape and old garden over which it traveled had had a rarefying influence upon the sound itself and had mellowed its tones into a strain of the most perfect music throbbing with harmony and dying away in faint delicious murmurs they stood and listened to it and a sudden light swept into the pale face upon the couch they all looked at her in a sudden awe the priest sank upon his knees by her side and prayed long desired it had come at last at this most fitting moment the glory of death shone in her face and the light of a coming release flashed across her features she died as few can die as one who sees descending from the clouds a longpromised happiness and whose heart and soul go forth to meet it with joy  they stayed and buried her under a cypress tree in a sunny corner of the monastery churchyard where a plain black cross marked her grave then they turned their faces toward england                                       and in england they were happy for the first few years they chose to live almost in retirement at their stately home for with no desire for notoriety sir bernard beaumerville found himself on his return from abroad the most famous man in london to escape from the lionizing that threatened him helen and he shut themselves up at beaumerville court and steadfastly refused all invitations of their life there little need be said save that to each it was the perfect realization of dreams which had once seemed too sweet to be possible  and in the midst of it all he found time to write from the quaint oak library where he had gone back into the old realms of thoughtland he sent out into the world a great work once more the columns of the daily papers and the reviews were busy with his name and for once all were unanimous all bowed down before his genius and his name was written into the history of his generation through a burning sea of trouble of intellectual disquiet and mental agony he had emerged strengthened at every point love had fulfilled upon him its great office he was humanized the impersonality which is the students bane which deepens into misanthropy cynicism and pessimism yielded before it the voices of his own children became dearer to him than the written thoughts of dead men it was the reassertion of nature and it was well for him so was he saved so was his genius unfettered from the cloying weight of too much abstract thought which at one time save for his artistic instincts would have plunged him into the morass of pedantry and turned his genius into a pillar of salt a woman had saved him and through the long years of their life together he never forgot it  the end
