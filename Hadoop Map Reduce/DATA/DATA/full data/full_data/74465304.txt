absorbed in thoughts of her own  the      voices are tuned to the pitch of heated discussion as the      curtain rises   the dean i disagree with you stephen absolutely entirely disagree  more  i cant help it  mendip  remember a certain war stephen  were your chivalrous notions any good then  and what was winked at in an obscure young member is anathema for an under secretary of state  you cant afford  more  to follow my conscience  thats new mendip  mendip  idealism can be out of place my friend  the dean  the government is dealing here with a wild lawless race on whom i must say i think sentiment is rather wasted  more  god made them dean  mendip  i have my doubts  the dean  they have proved themselves faithless  we have the right to chastise  more  if i hit a little man in the eye and he hits me back have i the right to chastise him  sir john  we didnt begin this business  more  what  with our missionaries and our trading  the dean  it is news indeed that the work of civilization may be justifiably met by murder  have you forgotten glaive and morlinson  sir john  yes  and that poor fellow groome and his wife  more  they went into a wild country against the feeling of the tribes on their own business  what has the nation to do with the mishaps of gamblers  sir john  we cant stand by and see our own flesh and blood illtreated  the dean  does our rule bring blessingor does it not stephen  more  sometimes but with all my soul i deny the fantastic superstition that our rule can benefit a people like this a nation of one race as different from ourselves as dark from lightin colour religion every mortal thing  we can only pervert their natural instincts  the dean  that to me is an unintelligible point of view  mendip  go into that philosophy of yours a little deeper stephen it spells stagnation  there are no fixed stars on this earth nations cant let each other alone  more  big ones could let little ones alone  mendip  if they could thered be no big ones  my dear fellow we know little nations are your hobby but surely office should have toned you down  sir john  ive served my country fifty years and i say she is not in the wrong  more  i hope to serve her fifty sir john and i say she is  mendip  there are moments when such things cant be said more  more  theyll be said by me tonight mendip  mendip  in the house       more nods  katherine  stephen  mendip  mrs more you mustnt let him  its madness  more  rising  you can tell people that tomorrow mendip  give it a leader in the parthenon  mendip  political lunacy  no man in your position

that risk  sir john  it is not the truth  mendip  the greater the truth the greater the libel and the greater the resentment of the person libelled  the dean  trying to bring matters to a blander level  my dear stephen even if you were rightwhich i denyabout the initial merits there surely comes a point where the individual conscience must resign it self to the countrys feeling  this has become a question of national honour  sir john  well said james  more  nations are bad judges of their honour dean  the dean  i shall not follow you there  more  no  its an awkward word  katherine  stopping the dean  uncle james  please       more looks at her intently  sir john  so youre going to put yourself at the head of the cranks ruin your career and make me ashamed that youre my soninlaw  more  is a man only to hold beliefs when theyre popular  youve stood up to be shot at often enough sir john  sir john  never by my country  your speech will be in all the foreign presstrust em for seizing on anything against us  a showup before other countries  more  you admit the showup  sir john  i do not sir  the dean  the position has become impossible  the state of things out there must be

sir john we great powers have got to change our ways in dealing with weaker nations  the very dogs can give us lessons watch a big dog with a little one  mendip  no no these things are not so simple as all that  more  theres no reason in the world mendip why the rules of chivalry should not apply to nations at least as well as todogs  mendip  my dear friend are you to become that hapless kind of outcast a champion of lost causes  more  this cause is not lost  mendip  right or wrong as lost as ever was cause in all this world there was never a time when the word patriotism stirred mob sentiment as it does now  ware mob stephenware mob  more  because general sentiments against me ia public manam to deny my faith  the point is not whether im right or wrong mendip but whether im to

say and this they did without a single protest from their public men  katherine  there are plenty who  more  poets  katherine  do you remember that day on our honeymoon going up ben lawers  you were lying on your face in the heather you said it was like kissing a loved woman  there was a lark singingyou said that was the voice of ones worship  the hills were very blue thats why we had blue here because it was the best dress of our country  you do love her  more  love her  katherine  youd have done this for methen  more  would you have asked methen kit  katherine  yes  the countrys our

feel myself a cur  katherine  breathless iialmost feel youll be a cur to do it she looks at him frightened by her own words  then as the footman henry has come in to clear the tablevery low  i ask you not       he does not answer and she goes out  more  to the servant later please henry later       the servant retires  more still stands looking down at the      diningtable then putting his hand to his throat as if to free      it from the grip of his collar he pours out a glass of water      and drinks it of  in the street outside the bay window two      street musicians a harp and a violin have taken up their      stand and after some twangs and scrapes break into music      more goes towards the sound and draws aside one curtain  after      a moment he returns to the table and takes up the notes of the      speech  he is in an agony of indecision  more  a cur       he seems about to tear his notes across  then changing his      mind turns them over and over muttering  his voice gradually      grows louder till he is declaiming to the empty room the      peroration of his speech  more  we have arrogated to our land the title champion of freedom foe of oppression  is that indeed a bygone glory  is it not worth some sacrifice of our pettier dignity to avoid laying another stone upon its grave to avoid placing before the searchlight eyes of history the spectacle of yet one more piece of national cynicism  we are about to force our will and our dominion on a race that has always been free that loves its country and its independence as much as ever we love ours  i cannot sit silent tonight and see this begin  as we are tender of our own land so we should be of the lands of others  i love my country  it is because i love my country that i raise my voice  warlike in spirit these people may bebut they have no chance against ourselves  and war on such however agreeable to the blind moment is odious to the future the great heart of mankind ever beats in sense and sympathy with the weaker  it is against this great heart of mankind that we are going in the name of justice and civilization we pursue this policy but by justice we shall hereafter be judged and by civilizationcondemned       while he is speaking a little figure has flown along the      terrace outside in the direction of the music but has stopped      at the sound of his voice and stands in the open window      listeninga darkhaired darkeyed child in a blue      dressinggown caught up in her hand  the street musicians      having reached the end of a tune are silent       in the intensity of mores feeling a wineglass gripped too      strongly breaks and falls in pieces onto a fingerbowl  the      child starts forward into the room  more  olive  olive  who were you speaking to daddy  more

and whispering  i must get back again in secret  hsh       she suddenly runs and wraps herself into one of the curtains of      the bay window  a young man enters with a note in his hand  more  hello steel       the street musicians have again begun to play  steel  from sir johnby special messenger from the war office  more  reading the note the ball is opened       he stands brooding over the note and steel looks at him      anxiously  he is a dark sallow thinfaced young man with the      eyes of one who can attach himself to people and suffer with      them  steel  im glad its begun sir

to the terrace  nice quiet night  steel  this to the cottage hospitalshall i say you will preside  more  no       steel writes then looking up and seeing that more is no longer      there he goes to the window looks to right and left returns      to the bureau and is about to sit down again when a thought      seems to strike him with consternation  he goes again to the      window  then snatching up his hat he passes hurriedly out      along the terrace  as he vanishes katherine comes in from the      hall  after looking out on to the terrace she goes to the bay      window stands there listening then comes restlessly back into      the room  olive creeping quietly from behind the curtain      clasps her round the waist  katherine  o my darling  how you startled me  what are

right through me darling  olive  oh       the musicians strike up a dance  olive  oh  mummy  i must just dance       she kicks off her lisle blue shoes and begins dancing  while      she is capering

this morning of that pass  and have you seen these  reading from the newspaper we will have no truck with the jargon of the degenerate who vilifies his country at such a moment the member for toulmin has earned for himself the contempt of all virile patriots  he takes up a second journal  there is a certain type of public man who even at his own expense cannot resist the itch to advertise himself  we would at moments of national crisis muzzle such persons as we muzzle dogs that we suspect of incipient rabies  theyre in full cry after him  katherine  i mind much more all the creatures who are always flinging mud at the country making him their hero suddenly  you know whats in his mind  steel  oh  we must get him to give up that idea of lecturing everywhere against the war mrs more we simply must  katherine  listening  the deputations come  go and fetch him mr steel  hell be in his room at the house       steel goes out and katherine stands at bay  in a moment he      opens the door again to usher in the deputation then retires      the four gentlemen have entered as if conscious of grave issues      the first and most picturesque is james home a thin tall      greybearded man with plentiful hair contradictious eyebrows      and the halfshy halfbold manners alternately rude and over      polite of one not accustomed to society yet secretly much      taken with himself  he is dressed in rough tweeds with a red      silk tie slung through a ring and is closely followed by mark      wace a waxy roundfaced man of middleage with sleek dark      hair traces of whisker and a smooth way of continually rubbing      his hands together as if selling something to an esteemed      customer  he is rather stout wears dark clothes with a large      gold chain  following him comes charles shelder a lawyer of      fifty with a bald eggshaped head and gold pincenez  he has      little side whiskers a leathery yellowish skin a rather kind      but watchful and dubious face and when he speaks seems to have      a plum in his mouth which arises from the preponderance of his      shaven upper lip  last of the deputation comes william banning      an energeticlooking squareshouldered selfmade countryman      between fifty and sixty with grey moustaches ruddy face and      lively brown eyes  katherine  how do you do mr home  home  bowing rather extravagantly over her hand as if to show his independence of womens influence  mrs more  we hardly expected this is an honour  wace  how do you do maam  katherine  and you mr wace  wace  thank you maam well indeed

down gentlemen       seeing that they will not settle down while she is standing she      sits at the table  they gradually take their seats  each      member of the deputation in his own way is severely hanging back      from any mention of the subject in hand and katherine as intent      on drawing them to it  katherine  my husband will be here in two minutes  hes only over at the house  shelder  who is of higher standing and education than the others charming positionthis mrs more  so near theercentre of gravity um  katherine  i read the account of your second meeting at toulmin

looks at her but for answer she only compresses her lips  banning  i tell you what hit mewhats hit the whole constituency and thats his knowing we were over the frontier fighting already when he made it  katherine  what difference does it make if he did know  home  hitting below the belti should have thoughtyoull pardon me  banning  till wars begun mrs more youre entitled to say what you like no

pardon me  shelder  weve come with the friendliest feelings mrs morebut you know it wont do this sort of thing  wace  we shall be able to smooth him down  oh surely  banning  wed be best perhaps not to mention about his knowing that fighting had begun       as he speaks more enters through the french windows  they all      rise  more  goodmorning gentlemen       he comes down to the table but does not offer to shake hands  banning  well mr more  youve made a woeful mistake sir i tell you to your face  more  as everybody else does banning  sit down again please       they gradually resume their seats and more sits in katherines      chair  she alone remains standing leaning against the corner of      the bay window watching their faces  banning  youve seen the mornings telegrams  i tell you mr moreanother reverse like that and the flood will sweep you clean away  and ill not blame it  its only flesh and blood  more allow for the flesh and blood in me too please  when i spoke the other night it was not without a certain feeling here  he touches his heart  banning  but your attitudes so suddenyoud not been going that length when you were down with us in may  more  do me the justice to remember that even then i was against our policy  it cost me three weeks hard struggle to make up my mind to that speech  one comes slowly to these things banning  shelder  case of conscience  more  such things have happened shelder even in politics  shelder  you see our ideals are naturally lowhow different from yours       more smiles       katherine who has drawn near her

to save my parliamentary skin  then indeed they might call me a degenerate  he touches the newspapers on the table       katherine makes an abrupt and painful movement then remains as      still as before leaning against the corner of the windowseat  banning  well well  i know  but we dont ask you to take your words backwe only want discretion in the future  more  conspiracy of silence  and have it said that a mob of newspapers have hounded me to it  banning  they wont say that of you  shelder  my dear more arent you rather dropping to our level with your principles you ought not to care two straws what people say  more  but i do  i cant betray the dignity and courage of public men  if popular opinion is to control the utterances of her politicians then goodbye indeed to this country  banning  come now  i wont say that your views werent sound enough before the fighting began  ive never liked our policy out there but our bloods being spilled and that makes all the difference i dont suppose theyd want me exactly but id be ready to go myself  wed all of us be ready  and we cant have the man that represents us talking wild until weve licked these fellows  thats it in a nutshell

weak  shelder  my dear more how can you get up any enthusiasm for those cattlelifting ruffians  more  better lift cattle than lift freedom  shelder  well all well ask is that you shouldnt go about the

gone into other landsas all we big powers go into other lands when theyre little and weak  the prime ministers words the other night were these if we are forced to spend this blood and money now we must never again be forced what does that mean but swallowing this country  shelder  well and quite frankly itd be no bad thing  home  we dont want their wretched countrywere forced  more  we are not forced  shelder  my dear more what is civilization but the logical inevitable swallowing up of the lower by the higher types of man and what else will it be here  more  we shall not agree there shelder and we might argue it all day  but the point is not whether you or i are rightthe point is what is a man who holds a faith with all his heart to do  please tell me       there is a silence  banning  simply i was just thinkin of those poor fellows in the pass  more  i can see them as well as you banning  but imagine  up in our own countrythe black valleytwelve hundred foreign devils dead

too       the passion of those words touches and grips as no arguments      could and they are silent  more  well  whats the difference out there  im not so inhuman as not to want to see this disaster in the pass wiped out  but once thats done in spite of my affection for you my ambitions and theyre not few  very low  in spite of my own wifes feeling i must be free to raise my voice against this war  banning  speaking slowly consulting the others as it were with his eyes  mr more theres no man i respect more than yourself  i cant tell what theyll say down there when we go back but i for one

distorted by the strafe of his emotions  he      paces the room taking in some sort the rhythm of the march       slowly the music dies away in the distance to a drumtap and the      tramp of a company  more stops at the table covering his eyes      with his hands       the deputation troop back across the terrace and come in at the      french windows  their faces and manners have quite

 the alley is plentifully strewn with refuse and scraps      of paper  three stone steps inset lead to the stage door  it      is a dark night and a street lamp close to the wall throws all      the light there is  a faint confused murmur as of distant      hooting is heard  suddenly a boy comes running then two rough      girls hurry past in the direction of the sound and the alley is      again deserted  the stage door opens and a doorkeeper poking      his head out looks up and down  he withdraws but in a second      reappears preceding three blackcoated gentlemen  doorkeeper  its all clear

the blue night is seen where a mist is rolled out flat amongst trees so that only dark clumps of boughs show here and there beneath a moonlit sky  as the curtain rises katherine with brush arrested is listening  she begins again brushing her hair then stops and taking a packet of letters from a drawer of her dressingtable reads  through the just open door behind her comes the voice of olive  olive

follows her to the door but stops there  then as full      realization begins to dawn on him he runs to the bay window      craning his head to catch sight of the front door  there is the      sound of a vehicle starting and the continual hooting of its      horn as it makes its way among the crowd  he turns from the      window  more  alone as the last man on earth       suddenly a voice rises clear out of the hurlyburly in the      street  voice  there e is  thats im  more  traitor  more       a shower of nutshells orangepeel and harmless missiles begins      to rattle against the glass of the window  many voices take up      the groaning more  traitor  blackleg  more  and through      the window can be seen waving flags and lighted chinese      lanterns swinging high on long bamboos  the din of execration      swells  more stands unheeding still gazing after the cab      then with a sharp crack a flung stone crashes through one of      the panes  it is followed by a hoarse shout of laughter and a      hearty groan  a second stone crashes through the glass  more      turns for a moment with a contemptuous look towards the      street and the flare of the chinese lanterns lights up his      face  then as if forgetting all about the din outside he      moves back into the room looks round him and lets his head      droop  the din rises louder and louder a third stone crashes      through  more raises his head again and clasping his hands      looks straight before him  the footman henry entering      hastens to the french windows  more  ah  henry i thought youd

an      athletic hatless young man with a projecting underjaw and      heavy coalblack moustache who seems with the swing of his huge      arms and shoulders to sway the currents of motion  when the      first surge of noise and movement subsides he calls out to      him boys  chair the hero  the students rush at the impassive      more swing him roughly on to their shoulders and bear him round

the body of more lies in the gleam from a single chinese      lantern  muttering the words poor devil  he kept his end up      anyway the chief student picks from the floor a little      abandoned union jack and lays it on mores breast  then he      too turns and rushes out       and the body of more lies in the streak of light and flee      noises in the street continue to rise             the
