for their sakes  many also     have perished have erred and sinned for women o     ye men how can it be but women should be strong seeing     they do thusesdras   i   the schoolmaster was leaving the village and everybody seemed sorry the miller at cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and horse to carry his goods to the city of his destination about twenty miles off such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the departing teachers effects  for the schoolhouse had been partly furnished by the managers and the only cumbersome article possessed by the master in addition to the packingcase of books was a cottage piano that he had bought at an auction during the year in which he thought of learning instrumental music  but the enthusiasm having waned he had never acquired any skill in playing and the purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since in moving house  the rector had gone away for the day being a man who disliked the sight of changes  he did not mean to return till the evening when the new schoolteacher would have arrived and settled in and everything would be smooth again  the blacksmith the farm bailiff and the schoolmaster himself were standing in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument the master had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should not know what to do with it on his arrival at christminster the city he was bound for since he was only going into temporary lodgings just at first  a little boy of eleven who had been thoughtfully assisting in the packing joined the group of men and as they rubbed their chins he spoke up blushing at the sound of his own voice aunt have got a great fuelhouse and it could be put there perhaps till youve found a place to settle in sir  a proper good notion said the blacksmith  it was decided that a deputation should wait on the boys auntan old maiden residentand ask her if she would house the piano till mr phillotson should send for it  the smith and the bailiff started to see about the practicability of the suggested shelter and the boy and the schoolmaster were left standing alone  sorry i am going jude asked the latter kindly  tears rose into the boys eyes for he was not among the regular day scholars who came unromantically close to the schoolmasters life but one who had attended the night school only during the present teachers term of office  the regular scholars if the truth must be told stood at the present moment afar off like certain historic disciples indisposed to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid  the boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand which mr phillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift and admitted that he was sorry  so am i said mr phillotson  why do you go sir asked the boy  ahthat would be a long story  you wouldnt understand my reasons jude  you will perhaps when you are older  i think i should now sir  welldont speak of this everywhere  you know what a university is and a university degree  it is the necessary hallmark of a man who wants to do anything in teaching  my scheme or dream is to be a university graduate and then to be ordained  by going to live at christminster or near it i shall be at headquarters so to speak and if my scheme is practicable at all i consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than i should have elsewhere  the smith and his companion returned  old miss fawleys fuelhouse was dry and eminently practicable and she seemed willing to give the instrument standingroom there  it was accordingly left in the school till the evening when more hands would be available for removing it and the schoolmaster gave a final glance round  the boy jude assisted in loading some small articles and at nine oclock mr phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other impedimenta and bade his friends goodbye  i shant forget you jude he said smiling as the cart moved off be a good boy remember and be kind to animals and birds and read all you can  and if ever you come to christminster remember you hunt me out for old acquaintance sake  the cart creaked across the green and disappeared round the corner by the rectoryhouse the boy returned to the drawwell at the edge of the greensward where he had left his buckets when he went to help his patron and teacher in the loading  there was a quiver in his lip now and after opening the wellcover to begin lowering the bucket he paused and leant with his forehead and arms against the framework his face wearing the fixity of a thoughtful childs who has felt the pricks of life somewhat before his time  the well into which he was looking was as ancient as the village itself and from his present position appeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining disk of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down there was a lining of green moss near the top and nearer still the hartstongue fern  he said to himself in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a morning like this and would never draw there any more  ive seen him look down into it when he was tired with his drawing just as i do now and when he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home but he was too clever to bide here any longera small sleepy place like this  a tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well  the morning was a little foggy and the boys breathing unfurled itself as a thicker fog upon the still and heavy air  his thoughts were interrupted by a sudden outcry  bring on that water will ye you idle young harlican  it came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the garden gate of a greenthatched cottage not far off  the boy quickly waved a signal of assent drew the water with what was a great effort for one of his stature landed and emptied the big bucket into his own pair of smaller ones and pausing a moment for breath started with them across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well stoodnearly in the centre of the little village or rather hamlet of marygreen  it was as oldfashioned as it was small and it rested in the lap of an undulating upland adjoining the north wessex downs  old as it was however the wellshaft was probably the only relic of the local history that remained absolutely unchanged  many of the thatched and dormered dwellinghouses had been pulled down of late years and many trees felled on the green  above all the original church humpbacked woodturreted and quaintly hipped had been taken down and either cracked up into heaps of roadmetal in the lane or utilized as pigsty walls garden seats guardstones to fences and rockeries in the flowerbeds of the neighbourhood  in place of it a tall new building of modern gothic design unfamiliar to english eyes had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain obliterator of historic records who had run down from london and back in a day  the site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to the christian divinities was not even recorded on the green and level grassplot that had immemorially been the churchyard the obliterated graves being commemorated by eighteenpenny castiron crosses warranted to last five years    ii   slender as was jude fawleys frame he bore the two brimming housebuckets of water to the cottage without resting  over the door was a little rectangular piece of blue board on which was painted in yellow letters drusilla fawley baker  within the little lead panes of the windowthis being one of the few old houses leftwere five bottles of sweets and three buns on a plate of the willow pattern  while emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an animated conversation in progress withindoors between his greataunt the drusilla of the signboard and some other villagers  having seen the schoolmaster depart they were summing up particulars of the event and indulging in predictions of his future  and whos he asked one comparatively a stranger when the boy entered  well ye med ask it mrs williams  hes my greatnephewcome since you was last this way  the old inhabitant who answered was a tall gaunt woman who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject and gave a phrase of her conversation to each auditor in turn  he come from mellstock down in south wessex about a year agoworse luck for n belinda turning to the right where his father was living and was took wi the shakings for death and died in two days as you know caroline turning to the left it would ha been a blessing if goddymighty had took thee too wi thy mother and father poor useless boy  but ive got him here to stay with me till i can see whats to be done with un though i am obliged to let him earn any penny he can  just now hes ascaring of birds for farmer troutham it keeps him out of mischty  why do ye turn away jude she continued as the boy feeling the impact of their glances like slaps upon his face moved aside  the local washerwoman replied that it was perhaps a very good plan of miss or mrs fawleys as they called her indifferently to have him with herto kip ee company in your loneliness fetch water shet the windershetters o nights and help in the bit o baking  miss fawley doubted it  why didnt ye get the schoolmaster to take ee to christminster wi un and make a scholar of ee she continued in frowning pleasantry  im sure he couldnt ha took a better one  the boy is crazy for books that he is  it runs in our family rather  his cousin sue is just the sameso ive heard but i have not seen the child for years though she was born in this place within these four walls as it happened  my niece and her husband after they were married didn get a house of their own for some year or more and then they only had one tillwell i wont go into that  jude my child dont you ever marry  tisnt for the fawleys to take that step any more  she their only one was like a child o my own belinda till the split come  ah that a little maid should know such changes  jude finding the general attention again centering on himself went out to the bakehouse where he ate the cake provided for his breakfast  the end of his spare time had now arrived and emerging from the garden by getting over the hedge at the back he pursued a path northward till he came to a wide and lonely depression in the general level of the upland which was sown as a cornfield  this vast concave was the scene of his labours for mr troutham the farmer and he descended into the midst of it  the brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all round where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the actual verge and accentuated the solitude  the only marks on the uniformity of the scene were a rick of last years produce standing in the midst of the arable the rooks that rose at his approach and the path athwart the fallow by which he had come trodden now by he hardly knew whom though once by many of his own dead family  how ugly it is here he murmured  the fresh harrowlines seemed to stretch like the channellings in a piece of new corduroy lending a meanly utilitarian air to the expanse taking away its gradations and depriving it of all history beyond that of the few recent months though to every clod and stone there really attached associations enough and to spareechoes of songs from ancient harvestdays of spoken words and of sturdy deeds  every inch of ground had been the site first or last of energy gaiety horseplay bickerings weariness  groups of gleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard lovematches that had populated the adjoining hamlet had been made up there between reaping and carrying  under the hedge which divided the field from a distant plantation girls had given themselves to lovers who would not turn their heads to look at them by the next harvest and in that ancient cornfield many a man had made lovepromises to a woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next seedtime after fulfilling them in the church adjoining  but this neither jude nor the rooks around him considered for them it was a lonely place possessing in the one view only the quality of a workground and in the other that of a granary good to feed in  the boy stood under the rick before mentioned and every few seconds used his clacker or rattle briskly  at each clack the rooks left off pecking and rose and went away on their leisurely wings burnished like tassets of mail afterwards wheeling back and regarding him warily and descending to feed at a more respectful distance  he sounded the clacker till his arm ached and at length his heart grew sympathetic with the birds thwarted desires  they seemed like himself to be living in a world which did not want them  why should he frighten them away  they took upon more and more the aspect of gentle friends and pensionersthe only friends he could claim as being in the least degree interested in him for his aunt had often told him that she was not  he ceased his rattling and they alighted anew  poor little dears said jude aloud  you shall have some dinner you shall  there is enough for us all  farmer troutham can afford to let you have some  eat then my dear little birdies and make a good meal  they stayed and ate inky spots on the nutbrown soil and jude enjoyed their appetite  a magic thread of fellowfeeling united his own life with theirs  puny and sorry as those lives were they much resembled his own  his clacker he had by this time thrown away from him as being a mean and sordid instrument offensive both to the birds and to himself as their friend  all at once he became conscious of a smart blow upon his buttocks followed by a loud clack which announced to his surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence used  the birds and jude started up simultaneously and the dazed eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person the great troutham himself his red face glaring down upon judes cowering frame the clacker swinging in his hand  so its eat my dear birdies is it young man  eat dear birdies indeed  ill tickle your breeches and see if you say eat dear birdies again in a hurry  and youve been idling at the schoolmasters too instead of coming here hant ye hey  thats how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn  whilst saluting judes ears with this impassioned rhetoric troutham had seized his left hand with his own left and swinging his slim frame round him at armslength again struck jude on the hind parts with the flat side of judes own rattle till the field echoed with the blows which were delivered once or twice at each revolution  dont ee sirplease dont ee cried the whirling child as helpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked fish swinging to land and beholding the hill the rick the plantation the path and the rooks going round and round him in an amazing circular race  ii sironly meant thatthere was a good crop in the groundi saw em sow itand the rooks could have a little bit for dinnerand you wouldnt miss it sirand mr phillotson said i was to be kind to emoh oh oh  this truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more than if jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all and he still smacked the whirling urchin the clacks of the instrument continuing to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant workerswho gathered thereupon that jude was pursuing his business of clacking with great assiduityand echoing from the brandnew church tower just behind the mist towards the building of which structure the farmer had largely subscribed to testify his love for god and man  presently troutham grew tired of his punitive task and depositing the quivering boy on his legs took a sixpence from his pocket and gave it him in payment for his days work telling him to go home and never let him see him in one of those fields again  jude leaped out of arms reach and walked along the trackway weepingnot from the pain though that was keen enough not from the perception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme by which what was good for gods birds was bad for gods gardener but with the awful sense that he had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year in the parish and hence might be a burden to his greataunt for life  with this shadow on his mind he did not care to show himself in the village and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge and across a pasture  here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms lying half their length on the surface of the damp ground as they always did in such weather at that time of the year  it was impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them at each tread  though farmer troutham had just hurt him he was a boy who could not himself bear to hurt anything  he had never brought home a nest of young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after and often reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next morning  he could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped from a fancy that it hurt them and late pruning when the sap was up and the tree bled profusely had been a positive grief to him in his infancy  this weakness of character as it may be called suggested that he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life should signify that all was well with him again  he carefully picked his way on tiptoe among the earthworms without killing a single one  on entering the cottage he found his aunt selling a penny loaf to a little girl and when the customer was gone she said well how do you come to be back here in the middle of the morning like this  im turned away  what  mr troutham have turned me away because i let the rooks have a few peckings of corn  and theres my wagesthe last i shall ever hae  he threw the sixpence tragically on the table  ah said his aunt suspending her breath  and she opened upon him a lecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands doing nothing  if you cant skeer birds what can ye do  there dont ye look so deedy  farmer troutham is not so much better than myself come to that  but tis as job said now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock  his father was my fathers journeyman anyhow and i must have been a fool to let ee go to work for n which i shouldnt ha done but to keep ee out of mischty  more angry with jude for demeaning her by coming there than for dereliction of duty she rated him primarily from that point of view and only secondarily from a moral one  not that you should have let the birds eat what farmer troutham planted  of course you was wrong in that  jude jude why didstnt go off with that schoolmaster of thine to christminster or somewhere but oh nopoor ornary childthere never was any sprawl on thy side of the family and never will be  where is this beautiful city auntthis place where mr phillotson is gone to asked the boy after meditating in silence  lord you ought to know where the city of christminster is  near a score of miles from here  it is a place much too good for you ever to have much to do with poor boy im athinking  and will mr phillotson always be there  how can i tell  could i go to see him  lord no  you didnt grow up hereabout or you wouldnt ask such as that  weve never had anything to do with folk in christminster nor folk in christminster with we  jude went out and feeling more than ever his existence to be an undemanded one he lay down upon his back on a heap of litter near the pigsty  the fog had by this time become more translucent and the position of the sun could be seen through it  he pulled his straw hat over his face and peered through the interstices of the plaiting at the white brightness vaguely reflecting  growing up brought responsibilities he found  events did not rhyme quite as he had thought  natures logic was too horrid for him to care for that mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards another sickened his sense of harmony  as you got older and felt yourself to be at the centre of your time and not at a point in its circumference as you had felt when you were little you were seized with a sort of shuddering he perceived  all around you there seemed to be something glaring garish rattling and the noises and glares hit upon the little cell called your life and shook it and warped it  if he could only prevent himself growing up  he did not want to be a man  then like the natural boy he forgot his despondency and sprang up during the remainder of the morning he helped his aunt and in the afternoon when there was nothing more to be done he went into the village  here he asked a man whereabouts christminster lay  christminster  oh well out by there yonder though ive never bin therenot i  ive never had any business at such a place  the man pointed northeastward in the very direction where lay that field in which jude had so disgraced himself  there was something unpleasant about the coincidence for the moment but the fearsomeness of this fact rather increased his curiosity about the city  the farmer had said he was never to be seen in that field again yet christminster lay across it and the path was a public one  so stealing out of the hamlet he descended into the same hollow which had witnessed his punishment in the morning never swerving an inch from the path and climbing up the long and tedious ascent on the other side till the track joined the highway by a little clump of trees  here the ploughed land ended and all before him was bleak open down    iii   not a soul was visible on the hedgeless highway or on either side of it and the white road seemed to ascend and diminish till it joined the sky  at the very top it was crossed at right angles by a green ridgewaythe ickneild street and original roman road through the district  this ancient track ran east and west for many miles and down almost to within living memory had been used for driving flocks and herds to fairs and markets  but it was now neglected and overgrown  the boy had never before strayed so far north as this from the nestling hamlet in which he had been deposited by the carrier from a railway station southward one dark evening some few months earlier and till now he had had no suspicion that such a wide flat lowlying country lay so near at hand under the very verge of his upland world  the whole northern semicircle between east and west to a distance of forty or fifty miles spread itself before him a bluer moister atmosphere evidently than that he breathed up here  not far from the road stood a weatherbeaten old barn of reddishgrey brick and tile  it was known as the brown house by the people of the locality  he was about to pass it when he perceived a ladder against the eaves and the reflection that the higher he got the further he could see led jude to stand and regard it  on the slope of the roof two men were repairing the tiling  he turned into the ridgeway and drew towards the barn  when he had wistfully watched the workmen for some time he took courage and ascended the ladder till he stood beside them  well my lad and what may you want up here  i wanted to know where the city of christminster is if you please  christminster is out across there by that clump  you can see itat least you can on a clear day  ah no you cant now  the other tiler glad of any kind of diversion from the monotony of his labour had also turned to look towards the quarter designated you cant often see it in weather like this he said  the time ive noticed it is when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame and it looks likei dont know what  the heavenly jerusalem suggested the serious urchin  aythough i should never ha thought of it myself but i cant see no christminster today  the boy strained his eyes also yet neither could he see the faroff city  he descended from the barn and abandoning christminster with the versatility of his age he walked along the ridgetrack looking for any natural objects of interest that might lie in the banks thereabout  when he repassed the barn to go back to marygreen he observed that the ladder was still in its place but that the men had finished their days work and gone away  it was waning towards evening there was still a faint mist but it had cleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country and along the rivercourses  he thought again of christminster and wished since he had come two or three miles from his aunts house on purpose that he could have seen for once this attractive city of which he had been told  but even if he waited here it was hardly likely that the air would clear before night  yet he was loth to leave the spot for the northern expanse became lost to view on retreating towards the village only a few hundred yards  he ascended the ladder to have one more look at the point the men had designated and perched himself on the highest rung overlying the tiles  he might not be able to come so far as this for many days  perhaps if he prayed the wish to see christminster might be forwarded  people said that if you prayed things sometimes came to you even though they sometimes did not  he had read in a tract that a man who had begun to build a church and had no money to finish it knelt down and prayed and the money came in by the next post another man tried the same experiment and the money did not come but he found afterwards that the breeches he knelt in were made by a wicked jew  this was not discouraging and turning on the ladder jude knelt on the third rung where resting against those above it he prayed that the mist might rise  he then seated himself again and waited  in the course of ten or fifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the northern horizon as it had already done elsewhere and about a quarter of an hour before the time of sunset the westward clouds parted the suns position being partially uncovered and the beams streaming out in visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud  the boy immediately looked back in the old direction  some way within the limits of the stretch of landscape points of light like the topaz gleamed  the air increased in transparency with the lapse of minutes till the topaz points showed themselves to be the vanes windows wet roof slates and other shining spots upon the spires domes freestonework and varied outlines that were faintly revealed  it was christminster unquestionably either directly seen or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere  the spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their shine going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles  the vague city became veiled in mist  turning to the west he saw that the sun had disappeared  the foreground of the scene had grown funereally dark and near objects put on the hues and shapes of chimaeras  he anxiously descended the ladder and started homewards at a run trying not to think of giants herne the hunter apollyon lying in wait for christian or of the captain with the bleeding hole in his forehead and the corpses round him that remutinied every night on board the bewitched ship  he knew that he had grown out of belief in these horrors yet he was glad when he saw the church tower and the lights in the cottage windows even though this was not the home of his birth and his greataunt did not care much about him    inside and round about that old womans shop window with its twentyfour little panes set in leadwork the glass of some of them oxidized with age so that you could hardly see the poor penny articles exhibited within and forming part of a stock which a strong man could have carried jude had his outer being for some long tideless time  but his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings were small  through the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward he was always beholding a gorgeous citythe fancied place he had likened to the new jerusalem though there was perhaps more of the painters imagination and less of the diamond merchants in his dreams thereof than in those of the apocalyptic writer  and the city acquired a tangibility a permanence a hold on his life mainly from the one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes he had so much reverence was actually living there not only so but living among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein  in sad wet seasons though he knew it must rain at christminster too he could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there  whenever he could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two which was not often he would steal off to the brown house on the hill and strain his eyes persistently sometimes to be rewarded by the sight of a dome or spire at other times by a little smoke which in his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense  then the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he ascended to the point of view after dark or possibly went a mile or two further he would see the night lights of the city  it would be necessary to come back alone but even that consideration did not deter him for he could throw a little manliness into his mood no doubt  the project was duly executed  it was not late when he arrived at the place of outlook only just after dusk but a black northeast sky accompanied by a wind from the same quarter made the occasion dark enough  he was rewarded but what he saw was not the lamps in rows as he had half expected  no individual light was visible only a halo or glowfog overarching the place against the black heavens behind it making the light and the city seem distant but a mile or so  he set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the schoolmaster might behe who never communicated with anybody at marygreen now who was as if dead to them here  in the glow he seemed to see phillotson promenading at ease like one of the forms in nebuchadnezzars furnace  he had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour and the fact now came into his mind  he parted his lips as he faced the northeast and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor  you he said addressing the breeze caressingly were in christminster city between one and two hours ago floating along the streets pulling round the weathercocks touching mr phillotsons face being breathed by him and now you are here breathed by meyou the very same  suddenly there came along this wind something towards hima message from the placefrom some soul residing there it seemed  surely it was the sound of bells the voice of the city faint and musical calling to him we are happy here  he had become entirely lost to his bodily situation during this mental leap and only got back to it by a rough recalling  a few yards below the brow of the hill on which he paused a team of horses made its appearance having reached the place by dint of half an hours serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity they had a load of coals behind thema fuel that could only be got into the upland by this particular route  they were accompanied by a carter a second man and a boy who now kicked a large stone behind one of the wheels and allowed the panting animals to have a long rest while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged in a drink round  they were elderly men and had genial voices  jude addressed them inquiring if they had come from christminster  heaven forbid with this load said they  the place i mean is that one yonder  he was getting so romantically attached to christminster that like a young lover alluding to his mistress he felt bashful at mentioning its name again  he pointed to the light in the skyhardly perceptible to their older eyes  yes  there do seem a spot a bit brighter in the noreast than elsewhere though i shouldnt ha noticed it myself and no doubt it med be christminster  here a little book of tales which jude had tucked up under his arm having brought them to read on his way hither before it grew dark slipped and fell into the road  the carter eyed him while he picked it up and straightened the leaves  ah young man he observed youd have to get your head screwed on tother way before you could read what they read there  why asked the boy  oh they never look at anything that folks like we can understand the carter continued by way of passing the time  ony foreign tongues used in the days of the tower of babel when no two families spoke alike  they read that sort of thing as fast as a nighthawk will whir  tis all learning therenothing but learning except religion  and thats learning too for i never could understand it yes tis a seriousminded place  not but theres wenches in the streets o nights  you know i suppose that they raise pasons there like radishes in a bed  and though it do takehow many years bobfive years to turn a lirruping hobbledehoy chap into a solemn preaching man with no corrupt passions theyll do it if it can be done and polish un off like the workmen they be and turn un out wi a long face and a long black coat and waistcoat and a religious collar and hat same as they used to wear in the scriptures so that his own mother wouldnt know un sometimes  there tis their business like anybody elses  but how should you know  now dont you interrupt my boy  never interrupt your senyers move the fore hoss aside bobby heres somat coming  you must mind that i be atalking of the college life  em lives on a lofty level theres no gainsaying it though i myself med not think much of em  as we be here in our bodies on this high ground so be they in their mindsnobleminded men enough no doubtsome on emable to earn hundreds by thinking out loud  and some on em be strong young fellows that can earn amost as much in silver cups  as for music theres beautiful music everywhere in christminster  you med be religious or you med not but you cant help striking in your homely note with the rest  and theres a street in the placethe main streetthat hant another like it in the world  i should think i did know a little about christminster  by this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their collars again  jude throwing a last adoring look at the distant halo turned and walked beside his remarkably wellinformed friend who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the cityits towers and halls and churches  the waggon turned into a crossroad whereupon jude thanked the carter warmly for his information and said he only wished he could talk half as well about christminster as he  well tis oonly what has come in my way said the carter unboastfully  ive never been there no more than you but ive picked up the knowledge here and there and you be welcome to it agetting about the world as i do and mixing with all classes of society one cant help hearing of things  a friend o mine that used to clane the boots at the crozier hotel in christminster when he was in his prime why i knowed un as well as my own brother in his later years  jude continued his walk homeward alone pondering so deeply that he forgot to feel timid  he suddenly grew older  it had been the yearning of his heart to find something to anchor on to cling tofor some place which he could call admirable  should he find that place in this city if he could get there would it be a spot in which without fear of farmers or hindrance or ridicule he could watch and wait and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the men of old of whom he had heard  as the halo had been to his eyes when gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier so was the spot mentally to him as he pursued his dark way  it is a city of light he said to himself  the tree of knowledge grows there he added a few steps further on  it is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to  it is what you may call a castle manned by scholarship and religion  after this figure he was silent a long while till he added  it would just suit me    iv   walking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration the boyan ancient man in some phases of thought much younger than his years in otherswas overtaken by a lightfooted pedestrian whom notwithstanding the gloom he could perceive to be wearing an extraordinarily tall hat a swallowtailed coat and a watchchain that danced madly and threw around scintillations of skylight as its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots jude beginning to feel lonely endeavoured to keep up with him  well my man  im in a hurry so youll have to walk pretty fast if you keep alongside of me  do you know who i am  yes i think  physician vilbert  ahim known everywhere i see  that comes of being a public benefactor  vilbert was an itinerant quackdoctor well known to the rustic population and absolutely unknown to anybody else as he indeed took care to be to avoid inconvenient investigations  cottagers formed his only patients and his wessexwide repute was among them alone  his position was humbler and his field more obscure than those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of advertising  he was in fact a survival  the distances he traversed on foot were enormous and extended nearly the whole length and breadth of wessex  jude had one day seen him selling a pot of coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg the woman arranging to pay a guinea in instalments of a shilling a fortnight for the precious salve which according to the physician could only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on mount sinai and was to be captured only at great risk to life and limb  jude though he already had his doubts about this gentlemans medicines felt him to be unquestionably a travelled personage and one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not strictly professional  i spose youve been to christminster physician  i havemany times replied the long thin man  thats one of my centres  its a wonderful city for scholarship and religion  youd say so my boy if youd seen it  why the very sons of the old women who do the washing of the colleges can talk in latinnot good latin that i admit as a critic doglatincatlatin as we used to call it in my undergraduate days  and greek  wellthats more for the men who are in training for bishops that they may be able to read the new testament in the original  i want to learn latin and greek myself  a lofty desire  you must get a grammar of each tongue  i mean to go to christminster some day  whenever you do you say that physician vilbert is the only proprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all disorders of the alimentary system as well as asthma and shortness of breath  two and threepence a boxspecially licensed by the government stamp  can you get me the grammars if i promise to say it hereabout  ill sell you mine with pleasurethose i used as a student  oh thank you sir said jude gratefully but in gasps for the amazing speed of the physicians walk kept him in a dogtrot which was giving him a stitch in the side  i think youd better drop behind my young man  now ill tell you what ill do  ill get you the grammars and give you a first lesson if youll remember at every house in the village to recommend physician vilberts golden ointment lifedrops and female pills  where will you be with the grammars  i shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of fiveandtwenty minutes past seven  my movements are as truly timed as those of the planets in their courses  here ill be to meet you said jude  with orders for my medicines  yes physician  jude then dropped behind waited a few minutes to recover breath and went home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for christminster  through the intervening fortnight he ran about and smiled outwardly at his inward thoughts as if they were people meeting and nodding to himsmiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen to spread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea as if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures giving rise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then  he honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures in whom he now sincerely believed walking miles hither and thither among the surrounding hamlets as the physicians agent in advance  on the evening appointed he stood motionless on the plateau at the place where he had parted from vilbert and there awaited his approach the roadphysician was fairly up to time but to the surprise of jude on striking into his pace which the pedestrian did not diminish by a single unit of force the latter seemed hardly to recognize his young companion though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings had grown light  jude thought it might perhaps be owing to his wearing another hat and he saluted the physician with dignity  well my boy said the latter abstractedly  ive come said jude  you who are you  oh yesto be sure  got any orders lad  yes  and jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers who were willing to test the virtues of the worldrenowned pills and salve  the quack mentally registered these with great care  and the latin and greek grammars  judes voice trembled with anxiety  what about them  you were to bring me yours that you used before you took your degree  ah yes yes  forgot all about itall  so many lives depending on my attention you see my man that i cant give so much thought as i would like to other things  jude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth and he repeated in a voice of dry misery you havent brought em  no but you must get me some more orders from sick people and ill bring the grammars next time  jude dropped behind  he was an unsophisticated boy but the gift of sudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him all at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of  there was to be no intellectual light from this source  the leaves dropped from his imaginary crown of laurel he turned to a gate leant against it and cried bitterly  the disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness  he might perhaps have obtained grammars from alfredston but to do that required money and a knowledge of what books to order and though physically comfortable he was in such absolute dependence as to be without a farthing of his own  at this date mr phillotson sent for his pianoforte and it gave jude a lead  why should he not write to the schoolmaster and ask him to be so kind as to get him the grammars in christminster  he might slip a letter inside the case of the instrument and it would be sure to reach the desired eyes  why not ask him to send any old secondhand copies which would have the charm of being mellowed by the university atmosphere  to tell his aunt of his intention would be to defeat it  it was necessary to act alone  after a further consideration of a few days he did act and on the day of the pianos departure which happened to be his next birthday clandestinely placed the letter inside the packingcase directed to his muchadmired friend being afraid to reveal the operation to his aunt drusilla lest she should discover his motive and compel him to abandon his scheme  the piano was despatched and jude waited days and weeks calling every morning at the cottage post office before his greataunt was stirring  at last a packet did indeed arrive at the village and he saw from the ends of it that it contained two thin books  he took it away into a lonely place and sat down on a felled elm to open it  ever since his first ecstasy or vision of christminster and its possibilities jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable sort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one language into those of another  he concluded that a grammar of the required tongue would contain primarily a rule prescription or clue of the nature of a secret cipher which once known would enable him by merely applying it to change at will all words of his own speech into those of the foreign one  his childish idea was in fact a pushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is everywhere known as grimms lawan aggrandizement of rough rules to ideal completeness  thus he assumed that the words of the required language were always to be found somewhere latent in the words of the given language by those who had the art to uncover them such art being furnished by the books aforesaid  when therefore having noted that the packet bore the postmark of christminster he cut the string opened the volumes and turned to the latin grammar which chanced to come uppermost he could scarcely believe his eyes  the book was an old onethirty years old soiled scribbled wantonly over with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the letterpress and marked at random with dates twenty years earlier than his own day  but this was not the cause of judes amazement he learnt for the first time that there was no law of transmutation as in his innocence he had supposed there was in some degree but the grammarian did not recognize it but that every word in both latin and greek was to be individually committed to memory at the cost of years of plodding  jude flung down the books lay backward along the broad trunk of the elm and was an utterly miserable boy for the space of a quarter of an hour  as he had often done before he pulled his hat over his face and watched the sun peering insidiously at him through the interstices of the straw  this was latin and greek then was it this grand delusion  the charm he had supposed in store for him was really a labour like that of israel in egypt  what brains they must have in christminster and the great schools he presently thought to learn words one by one up to tens of thousands there were no brains in his head equal to this business and as the little sunrays continued to stream in through his hat at him he wished he had never seen a book that he might never see another that he had never been born  somebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his trouble and might have cheered him by saying that his notions were further advanced than those of his grammarian  but nobody did come because nobody does and under the crushing recognition of his gigantic error jude continued to wish himself out of the world    v   during the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular vehicle might have been discerned moving along the lanes and byroads near marygreen driven in a quaint and singular way  in the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books jude had grown callous to the shabby trick played him by the dead languages  in fact his disappointment at the nature of those tongues had after a while been the means of still further glorifying the erudition of christminster  to acquire languages departed or living in spite of such obstinacies as he now knew them inherently to possess was a herculean performance which gradually led him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent process  the mountainweight of material under which the ideas lay in those dusty volumes called the classics piqued him into a dogged mouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal  he had endeavoured to make his presence tolerable to his crusty maiden aunt by assisting her to the best of his ability and the business of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence  an aged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at a sale a creaking cart with a whitybrown tilt obtained for a few pounds more and in this turnout it became judes business thrice a week to carry loaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters immediately round marygreen  the singularity aforesaid lay after all less in the conveyance itself than in judes manner of conducting it along its route its interior was the scene of most of judes education by private study  as soon as the horse had learnt the road and the houses at which he was to pause awhile the boy seated in front would slip the reins over his arm ingeniously fix open by means of a strap attached to the tilt the volume he was reading spread the dictionary on his knees and plunge into the simpler passages from caesar virgil or horace as the case might be in his purblind stumbling way and with an expenditure of labour that would have made a tenderhearted pedagogue shed tears yet somehow getting at the meaning of what he read and divining rather than beholding the spirit of the original which often to his mind was something else than that which he was taught to look for  the only copies he had been able to lay hands on were old delphin editions because they were superseded and therefore cheap  but bad for idle schoolboys it did so happen that they were passably good for him  the hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously covered up the marginal readings and used them merely on points of construction as he would have used a comrade or tutor who should have happened to be passing by  and though jude may have had little chance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means he was in the way of getting into the groove he wished to follow  while he was busied with these ancient pages which had already been thumbed by hands possibly in the grave digging out the thoughts of these minds so remote yet so near the bony old horse pursued his rounds and jude would be aroused from the woes of dido by the stoppage of his cart and the voice of some old woman crying two today baker and i return this stale one  he was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without his seeing them and by degrees the people of the neighbourhood began to talk about his method of combining work and play such they considered his reading to be which though probably convenient enough to himself was not altogether a safe proceeding for other travellers along the same roads  there were murmurs  then a private resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the bakers boy should not be allowed to read while driving and insisted that it was the constables duty to catch him in the act and take him to the police court at alfredston and get him fined for dangerous practices on the highway  the policeman thereupon lay in wait for jude and one day accosted him and cautioned him  as jude had to get up at three oclock in the morning to heat the oven and mix and set in the bread that he distributed later in the day he was obliged to go to bed at night immediately after laying the sponge so that if he could not read his classics on the highways he could hardly study at all  the only thing to be done was therefore to keep a sharp eye ahead and around him as well as he could in the circumstances and slip away his books as soon as anybody loomed in the distance the policeman in particular  to do that official justice he did not put himself much in the way of judes breadcart considering that in such a lonely district the chief danger was to jude himself and often on seeing the white tilt over the hedges he would move in another direction  on a day when fawley was getting quite advanced being now about sixteen and had been stumbling through the carmen sæculare on his way home he found himself to be passing over the high edge of the plateau by the brown house  the light had changed and it was the sense of this which had caused him to look up  the sun was going down and the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in the opposite quarter  his mind had become so impregnated with the poem that in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years before had caused him to kneel on the ladder he stopped the horse alighted and glancing round to see that nobody was in sight knelt down on the roadside bank with open book  he turned first to the shiny goddess who seemed to look so softly and critically at his doings then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand as he began   phoebe silvarumque potens diana   the horse stood still till he had finished the hymn which jude repeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never have thought of humouring in broad daylight  reaching home he mused over his curious superstition innate or acquired in doing this and the strange forgetfulness which had led to such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished next to being a scholar to be a christian divine  it had all come of reading heathen works exclusively  the more he thought of it the more convinced he was of his inconsistency  he began to wonder whether he could be reading quite the right books for his object in life  certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan literature and the mediæval colleges at christminster that ecclesiastical romance in stone  ultimately he decided that in his sheer love of reading he had taken up a wrong emotion for a christian young man  he had dabbled in clarkes homer but had never yet worked much at the new testament in the greek though he possessed a copy obtained by post from a secondhand bookseller  he abandoned the now familiar ionic for a new dialect and for a long time onward limited his reading almost entirely to the gospels and epistles in griesbachs text  moreover on going into alfredston one day he was introduced to patristic literature by finding at the booksellers some volumes of the fathers which had been left behind by an insolvent clergyman of the neighbourhood  as another outcome of this change of groove he visited on sundays all the churches within a walk and deciphered the latin inscriptions on fifteenthcentury brasses and tombs  on one of these pilgrimages he met with a hunchbacked old woman of great intelligence who read everything she could lay her hands on and she told him more yet of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore  thither he resolved as firmly as ever to go  but how live in that city  at present he had no income at all  he had no trade or calling of any dignity or stability whatever on which he could subsist while carrying out an intellectual labour which might spread over many years  what was most required by citizens  food clothing and shelter an income from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre for making the second he felt a distaste the preparation of the third requisite he inclined to  they built in a city therefore he would learn to build  he thought of his unknown uncle his cousin susannas father an ecclesiastical worker in metal and somehow mediæval art in any material was a trade for which he had rather a fancy  he could not go far wrong in following his uncles footsteps and engaging himself awhile with the carcases that contained the scholar souls  as a preliminary he obtained some small blocks of freestone metal not being available and suspending his studies awhile occupied his spare halfhours in copying the heads and capitals in his parish church  there was a stonemason of a humble kind in alfredston and as soon as he had found a substitute for himself in his aunts little business he offered his services to this man for a trifling wage here jude had the opportunity of learning at least the rudiments of freestoneworking  some time later he went to a churchbuilder in the same place and under the architects direction became handy at restoring the dilapidated masonries of several village churches round about  not forgetting that he was only following up this handicraft as a prop to lean on while he prepared those greater engines which he flattered himself would be better fitted for him he yet was interested in his pursuit on its own account  he now had lodgings during the week in the little town whence he returned to marygreen village every saturday evening  and thus he reached and passed his nineteenth year    vi   at this memorable date of his life he was one saturday returning from alfredston to marygreen about three oclock in the afternoon it was fine warm and soft summer weather and he walked with his tools at his back his little chisels clinking faintly against the larger ones in his basket  it being the end of the week he had left work early and had come out of the town by a roundabout route which he did not usually frequent having promised to call at a flourmill near cresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt  he was in an enthusiastic mood  he seemed to see his way to living comfortably in christminster in the course of a year or two and knocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of which he had dreamed so much  he might of course have gone there now in some capacity or other but he preferred to enter the city with a little more assurance as to means than he could be said to feel at present  a warm selfcontent suffused him when he considered what he had already done  now and then as he went along he turned to face the peeps of country on either side of him  but he hardly saw them the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been accustomed to do when less occupied and the one matter which really engaged him was the mental estimate of his progress thus far  i have acquired quite an average students power to read the common ancient classics latin in particular  this was true jude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him with great ease to himself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary conversations therein  i have read two books of the iliad besides being pretty familiar with passages such as the speech of phoenix in the ninth book the fight of hector and ajax in the fourteenth the appearance of achilles unarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth and the funeral games in the twentythird i have also done some hesiod a little scrap of thucydides and a lot of the greek testament  i wish there was only one dialect all the same  i have done some mathematics including the first six and the eleventh and twelfth books of euclid and algebra as far as simple equations  i know something of the fathers and something of roman and english history  these things are only a beginning  but i shall not make much farther advance here from the difficulty of getting books  hence i must next concentrate all my energies on settling in christminster once there i shall so advance with the assistance i shall there get that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish ignorance  i must save money and i will and one of those colleges shall open its doors to meshall welcome whom now it would spurn if i wait twenty years for the welcome  ill be dd before i have done  and then he continued to dream and thought he might become even a bishop by leading a pure energetic wise christian life  and what an example he would set  if his income were £5000 a year he would give away £4500 in one form and another and live sumptuously for him on the remainder  well on second thoughts a bishop was absurd  he would draw the line at an archdeacon  perhaps a man could be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of archdeacon as in that of bishop  yet he thought of the bishop again  meanwhile i will read as soon as i am settled in christminster the books i have not been able to get hold of here livy tacitus herodotus Æschylus sophocles aristophanes  ha ha ha  hoitytoity  the sounds were expressed in light voices on the other side of the hedge but he did not notice them his thoughts went on  euripides plato aristotle lucretius epictetus seneca antoninus  then i must master other things the fathers thoroughly bede and ecclesiastical history generally a smattering of hebrewi only know the letters as yet  hoitytoity  but i can work hard  i have staying power in abundance thank god and it is that which tells yes christminster shall be my alma mater and ill be her beloved son in whom she shall be well pleased  in his deep concentration on these transactions of the future judes walk had slackened and he was now standing quite still looking at the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic lantern  on a sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear and he became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him and had fallen at his feet  a glance told him what it wasa piece of flesh the characteristic part of a barrowpig which the countrymen used for greasing their boots as it was useless for any other purpose  pigs were rather plentiful hereabout being bred and fattened in large numbers in certain parts of north wessex  on the other side of the hedge was a stream whence as he now for the first time realized had come the slight sounds of voices and laughter that had mingled with his dreams  he mounted the bank and looked over the fence  on the further side of the stream stood a small homestead having a garden and pigsties attached in front of it beside the brook three young women were kneeling with buckets and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs chitterlings which they were washing in the running water  one or two pairs of eyes slyly glanced up and perceiving that his attention had at last been attracted and that he was watching them they braced themselves for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity  thank you said jude severely  i didnt throw it i tell you asserted one girl to her neighbour as if unconscious of the young mans presence  nor i the second answered  oh anny how can you said the third  if i had thrown anything at all it shouldnt have been that  pooh  i dont care for him  and they laughed and continued their work without looking up still ostentatiously accusing each other  jude grew sarcastic as he wiped his face and caught their remarks  you didnt do itoh no he said to the upstream one of the three  she whom he addressed was a fine darkeyed girl not exactly handsome but capable of passing as such at a little distance despite some coarseness of skin and fibre  she had a round and prominent bosom full lips perfect teeth and the rich complexion of a cochin hens egg  she was a complete and substantial female animalno more no less and jude was almost certain that to her was attributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him  that youll never be told said she deedily  whoever did it was wasteful of other peoples property  oh thats nothing  but you want to speak to me i suppose  oh yes if you like to  shall i clamber across or will you come to the plank above here  perhaps she foresaw an opportunity for somehow or other the eyes of the brown girl rested in his own when he had said the words and there was a momentary flash of intelligence a dumb announcement of affinity in posse between herself and him which so far as jude fawley was concerned had no sort of premeditation in it  she saw that he had singled her out from the three as a woman is singled out in such cases for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance but in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters unconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of their lives is to be occupied with the feminine  springing to her feet she said bring back what is lying there  jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her fathers business had prompted her signal to him  he set down his basket of tools picked up the scrap of offal beat a pathway for himself with his stick and got over the hedge  they walked in parallel lines one on each bank of the stream towards the small plank bridge  as the girl drew nearer to it she gave without jude perceiving it an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her cheeks in succession by which curious and original manoeuvre she brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect dimple which she was able to retain there as long as she continued to smile  this production of dimples at will was a not unknown operation which many attempted but only a few succeeded in accomplishing  they met in the middle of the plank and jude tossing back her missile seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him  but she slyly looking in another direction swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge till moved by amatory curiosity she turned her eyes critically upon him  you dont think i would shy things at you  oh no  we are doing this for my father who naturally doesnt want anything thrown away  he makes that into dubbin  she nodded towards the fragment on the grass  what made either of the others throw it i wonder jude asked politely accepting her assertion though he had very large doubts as to its truth  impudence  dont tell folk it was i mind  how can i  i dont know your name  ah no  shall i tell it to you  do  arabella donn  im living here  i must have known it if i had often come this way  but i mostly go straight along the highroad  my father is a pigbreeder and these girls are helping me wash the innerds for blackpuddings and such like  they talked a little more and a little more as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the handrail of the bridge  the unvoiced call of woman to man which was uttered very distinctly by arabellas personality held jude to the spot against his intentionalmost against his will and in a way new to his experience  it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this moment jude had never looked at a woman to consider her as such but had vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes he gazed from her eyes to her mouth thence to her bosom and to her full round naked arms wet mottled with the chill of the water and firm as marble  what a nicelooking girl you are he murmured though the words had not been necessary to express his sense of her magnetism  ah you should see me sundays she said piquantly  i dont suppose i could he answered  thats for you to think on  theres nobody after me just now though there med be in a week or two  she had spoken this without a smile and the dimples disappeared  jude felt himself drifting strangely but could not help it  will you let me  i dont mind  by this time she had managed to get back one dimple by turning her face aside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking operation before mentioned jude being still unconscious of more than a general impression of her appearance  next sunday he hazarded tomorrow that is  yes  shall i call  yes  she brightened with a little glow of triumph swept him almost tenderly with her eyes in turning and retracing her steps down the brookside grass rejoined her companions  jude fawley shouldered his toolbasket and resumed his lonely way filled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze  he had just inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere which had evidently been hanging round him everywhere he went for he knew not how long but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as by a sheet of glass  the intentions as to reading working and learning which he had so precisely formulated only a few minutes earlier were suffering a curious collapse into a corner he knew not how  well its only a bit of fun he said to himself faintly conscious that to common sense there was something lacking and still more obviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had drawn him to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere sportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking hersomething in her quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied with literary study and the magnificent christminster dream  it had been no vestal who chose that missile for opening her attack on him he saw this with his intellectual eye just for a short fleeting while as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness  and then this passing discriminative power was withdrawn and jude was lost to all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected though it had lain close beside him  he was to meet this enkindling one of the other sex on the following sunday  meanwhile the girl had joined her companions and she silently resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid stream  catched un my dear laconically asked the girl called anny  i dont know  i wish i had thrown something else than that regretfully murmured arabella  lord hes nobody though you med think so  he used to drive old drusilla fawleys breadcart out at marygreen till he prenticed himself at alfredston  since then hes been very stuck up and always reading  he wants to be a scholar they say  oh i dont care what he is or anything about n  dont you think it my child  oh dont ye  you neednt try to deceive us  what did you stay talking to him for if you didnt want un  whether you do or whether you dont hes as simple as a child  i could see it as you courted on the bridge when he looked at ee as if he had never seen a woman before in his born days  well hes to be had by any woman who can get him to care for her a bit if she likes to set herself to catch him the right way    vii   the next day jude fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping ceiling looking at the books on the table and then at the black mark on the plaster above them made by the smoke of his lamp in past months  it was sunday afternoon fourandtwenty hours after his meeting with arabella donn  during the whole bygone week he had been resolving to set this afternoon apart for a special purposethe rereading of his greek testamenthis new one with better type than his old copy following griesbachs text as amended by numerous correctors and with variorum readings in the margin  he was proud of the book having obtained it by boldly writing to its london publisher a thing he had never done before  he had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoons reading under the quiet roof of his greataunts house as formerly where he now slept only two nights a week  but a new thing a great hitch had happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life and he felt as a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter skin and cannot understand the brightness and sensitiveness of its new one  he would not go out to meet her after all  he sat down opened the book and with his elbows firmly planted on the table and his hands to his temples began at the beginning      hÊ kainÊ diathÊkÊ   had he promised to call for her  surely he had  she would wait indoors poor girl and waste all her afternoon on account of him there was a something in her too which was very winning apart from promises  he ought not to break faith with her  even though he had only sundays and weekday evenings for reading he could afford one afternoon seeing that other young men afforded so many  after today he would never probably see her again  indeed it would be impossible considering what his plans were  in short as if materially a compelling arm of extraordinary muscular power seized hold of himsomething which had nothing in common with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto this seemed to care little for his reason and his will nothing for his socalled elevated intentions and moved him along as a violent schoolmaster a schoolboy he has seized by the collar in a direction which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no respect and whose life had nothing in common with his own except locality   hÊ kainÊ diathÊkÊ was no more heeded and the predestinate jude sprang up and across the room  foreseeing such an event he had already arrayed himself in his best clothes  in three minutes he was out of the house and descending by the path across the wide vacant hollow of cornground which lay between the village and the isolated house of arabella in the dip beyond the upland  as he walked he looked at his watch  he could be back in two hours easily and a good long time would still remain to him for reading after tea  passing the few unhealthy firtrees and cottage where the path joined the highway he hastened along and struck away to the left descending the steep side of the country to the west of the brown house  here at the base of the chalk formation he neared the brook that oozed from it and followed the stream till he reached her dwelling  a smell of piggeries came from the back and the grunting of the originators of that smell  he entered the garden and knocked at the door with the knob of his stick  somebody had seen him through the window for a male voice on the inside said  arabella  heres your young man come coorting  mizzle my girl  jude winced at the words  courting in such a businesslike aspect as it evidently wore to the speaker was the last thing he was thinking of  he was going to walk with her perhaps kiss her but courting was too coolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his ideas the door was opened and he entered just as arabella came downstairs in radiant walking attire  take a chair mr whatsyourname said her father an energetic blackwhiskered man in the same businesslike tones jude had heard from outside  id rather go out at once wouldnt you she whispered to jude  yes said he  well walk up to the brown house and back we can do it in half an hour  arabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings that he felt glad he had come and all the misgivings vanished that had hitherto haunted him  first they clambered to the top of the great down during which ascent he had occasionally to take her hand to assist her  then they bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway which they followed till it intersected the highroad at the brown house aforesaid the spot of his former fervid desires to behold christminster  but he forgot them now  he talked the commonest local twaddle to arabella with greater zest than he would have felt in discussing all the philosophies with all the dons in the recently adored university and passed the spot where he had knelt to diana and phoebus without remembering that there were any such people in the mythology or that the sun was anything else than a useful lamp for illuminating arabellas face  an indescribable lightness of heel served to lift him along and jude the incipient scholar prospective dd professor bishop or what not felt himself honoured and glorified by the condescension of this handsome country wench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her sunday frock and ribbons  they reached the brown house barnthe point at which he had planned to turn back  while looking over the vast northern landscape from this spot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke from the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a distance of a couple of miles  it is a fire said arabella  lets run and see itdo  it is not far  the tenderness which had grown up in judes bosom left him no will to thwart her inclination nowwhich pleased him in affording him excuse for a longer time with her  they started off down the hill almost at a trot but on gaining level ground at the bottom and walking a mile they found that the spot of the fire was much further off than it had seemed  having begun their journey however they pushed on but it was not till five oclock that they found themselves on the scenethe distance being altogether about halfadozen miles from marygreen and three from arabellas  the conflagration had been got under by the time they reached it and after a short inspection of the melancholy ruins they retraced their stepstheir course lying through the town of alfredston  arabella said she would like some tea and they entered an inn of an inferior class and gave their order  as it was not for beer they had a long time to wait  the maidservant recognized jude and whispered her surprise to her mistress in the background that he the student who kept hisself up so particular should have suddenly descended so low as to keep company with arabella  the latter guessed what was being said and laughed as she met the serious and tender gaze of her loverthe low and triumphant laugh of a careless woman who sees she is winning her game  they sat and looked round the room and at the picture of samson and delilah which hung on the wall and at the circular beerstains on the table and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust  the whole aspect of the scene had that depressing effect on jude which few places can produce like a taproom on a sunday evening when the setting sun is slanting in and no liquor is going and the unfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest  it began to grow dusk  they could not wait longer really for the tea they said  yet what else can we do asked jude  it is a threemile walk for you  i suppose we can have some beer said arabella  beer oh yes  i had forgotten that  somehow it seems odd to come to a publichouse for beer on a sunday evening  but we didnt  no we didnt jude by this time wished he was out of such an uncongenial atmosphere but he ordered the beer which was promptly brought  arabella tasted it  ugh she said  jude tasted  whats the matter with it he asked  i dont understand beer very much now it is true  i like it well enough but it is bad to read on and i find coffee better  but this seems all right  adulteratedi cant touch it  she mentioned three or four ingredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops much to judes surprise  how much you know he said goodhumouredly  nevertheless she returned to the beer and drank her share and they went on their way  it was now nearly dark and as soon as they had withdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together till they touched each other  she wondered why he did not put his arm round her waist but he did not he merely said what to himself seemed a quite bold enough thing take my arm  she took it thoroughly up to the shoulder  he felt the warmth of her body against his and putting his stick under his other arm held with his right hand her right as it rested in its place  now we are well together dear arent we he observed  yes said she adding to herself rather mild  how fast i have become he was thinking  thus they walked till they reached the foot of the upland where they could see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom  from this point the only way of getting to arabellas was by going up the incline and dipping again into her valley on the right  before they had climbed far they were nearly run into by two men who had been walking on the grass unseen  these loversyou find em out o doors in all seasons and weatherslovers and homeless dogs only said one of the men as they vanished down the hill  arabella tittered lightly  are we lovers asked jude  you know best  but you can tell me  for answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder  jude took the hint and encircling her waist with his arm pulled her to him and kissed her  they walked now no longer arm in arm but as she had desired clasped together  after all what did it matter since it was dark said jude to himself  when they were halfway up the long hill they paused as by arrangement and he kissed her again  they reached the top and he kissed her once more  you can keep your arm there if you would like to she said gently  he did so thinking how trusting she was  thus they slowly went towards her home  he had left his cottage at halfpast three intending to be sitting down again to the new testament by halfpast five  it was nine oclock when with another embrace he stood to deliver her up at her fathers door  she asked him to come in if only for a minute as it would seem so odd otherwise and as if she had been out alone in the dark  he gave way and followed her in  immediately that the door was opened he found in addition to her parents several neighbours sitting round they all spoke in a congratulatory manner and took him seriously as arabellas intended partner  they did not belong to his set or circle and he felt out of place and embarrassed  he had not meant this a mere afternoon of pleasant walking with arabella that was all he had meant  he did not stay longer than to speak to her stepmother a simple quiet woman without features or character and bidding them all good night plunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down  but that sense was only temporary arabella soon reasserted her sway in his soul  he walked as if he felt himself to be another man from the jude of yesterday  what were his books to him what were his intentions hitherto adhered to so strictly as to not wasting a single minute of time day by day  wasting  it depended on your point of view to define that he was just living for the first time not wasting life  it was better to love a woman than to be a graduate or a parson ay or a pope  when he got back to the house his aunt had gone to bed and a general consciousness of his neglect seemed written on the face of all things confronting him  he went upstairs without a light and the dim interior of his room accosted him with sad inquiry  there lay his book open just as he had left it and the capital letters on the titlepage regarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight like the unclosed eyes of a dead man      hÊ kainÊ diathÊkÊ                                    jude had to leave early next morning for his usual week of absence at lodgings and it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his basket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book he had brought with him  he kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself arabella on the contrary made them public among all her friends and acquaintance  retracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours earlier under cover of darkness with his sweetheart by his side he reached the bottom of the hill where he walked slowly and stood still  he was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss  as the sun had only just risen it was possible that nobody had passed there since  jude looked on the ground and sighed  he looked closely and could just discern in the damp dust the imprints of their feet as they had stood locked in each others arms  she was not there now and the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of nature so depicted her past presence that a void was in his heart which nothing could fill  a pollard willow stood close to the place and that willow was different from all other willows in the world utter annihilation of the six days which must elapse before he could see her again as he had promised would have been his intensest wish if he had had only the week to live  an hour and a half later arabella came along the same way with her two companions of the saturday  she passed unheedingly the scene of the kiss and the willow that marked it though chattering freely on the subject to the other two  and what did he tell ee next  then he said  and she related almost word for word some of his tenderest speeches  if jude had been behind the fence he would have felt not a little surprised at learning how very few of his sayings and doings on the previous evening were private  youve got him to care for ee a bit nation if you hant murmured anny judicially  its well to be you  in a few moments arabella replied in a curiously low hungry tone of latent sensuousness ive got him to care for me yes  but i want him to more than care for me i want him to have meto marry me  i must have him  i cant do without him  hes the sort of man i long for  i shall go mad if i cant give myself to him altogether  i felt i should when i first saw him  as he is a romancing straightforard honest chap hes to be had and as a husband if you set about catching him in the right way  arabella remained thinking awhile  what med be the right way she asked  oh you dont knowyou dont said sarah the third girl  on my word i dontno further that is than by plain courting and taking care he dont go too far  the third girl looked at the second  she dont know  tis clear she dont said anny  and having lived in a town too as one may say  well we can teach ee somat then as well as you us  yes  and how do you meana sure way to gain a man  take me for an innocent and have done wi it  as a husband  as a husband  a countryman thats honourable and seriousminded such as he god forbid that i should say a sojer or sailor or commercial gent from the towns or any of them that be slippery with poor women  id do no friend that harm  well such as he of course  arabellas companions looked at each other and turning up their eyes in drollery began smirking  then one went up close to arabella and although nobody was near imparted some information in a low tone the other observing curiously the effect upon arabella  ah said the lastnamed slowly  i own i didnt think of that way   but suppose he isnt honourable  a woman had better not have tried it  nothing venture nothing have  besides you make sure that hes honourable before you begin  youd be safe enough with yours  i wish i had the chance  lots of girls do it or do you think theyd get married at all  arabella pursued her way in silent thought  ill try it she whispered but not to them    viii   one weeks end jude was as usual walking out to his aunts at marygreen from his lodging in alfredston a walk which now had large attractions for him quite other than his desire to see his aged and morose relative  he diverged to the right before ascending the hill with the single purpose of gaining on his way a glimpse of arabella that should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments before quite reaching the homestead his alert eye perceived the top of her head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge entering the gate he found that three young unfattened pigs had escaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top and that she was endeavouring unassisted to drive them in through the door which she had set open  the lines of her countenance changed from the rigidity of business to the softness of love when she saw jude and she bent her eyes languishingly upon him  the animals took advantage of the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way  they were only put in this morning she cried stimulated to pursue in spite of her lovers presence  they were drove from spaddleholt farm only yesterday where father bought em at a stiff price enough they are wanting to get home again the stupid toads  will you shut the garden gate dear and help me to get em in  there are no men folk at home only mother and theyll be lost if we dont mind  he set himself to assist and dodged this way and that over the potato rows and the cabbages  every now and then they ran together when he caught her for a moment and kissed her  the first pig was got back promptly the second with some difficulty the third a longlegged creature was more obstinate and agile  he plunged through a hole in the garden hedge and into the lane  hell be lost if i dont follow n said she  come along with me  she rushed in full pursuit out of the garden jude alongside her barely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight  occasionally they would shout to some boy to stop the animal but he always wriggled past and ran on as before  let me take your hand darling said jude  you are getting out of breath  she gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness and they trotted along together  this comes of driving em home she remarked  they always know the way back if you do that  they ought to have been carted over  by this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the open down across which he sped with all the agility his little legs afforded  as soon as the pursuers had entered and ascended to the top of the high ground it became apparent that they would have to run all the way to the farmers if they wished to get at him  from this summit he could be seen as a minute speck following an unerring line towards his old home  it is no good cried arabella  hell be there long before we get there  it dont matter now we know hes not lost or stolen on the way  theyll see it is ours and send un back  oh dear how hot i be  without relinquishing her hold of judes hand she swerved aside and flung herself down on the sod under a stunted thorn precipitately pulling jude on to his knees at the same time  oh i ask pardoni nearly threw you down didnt i  but i am so tired  she lay supine and straight as an arrow on the sloping sod of this hilltop gazing up into the blue miles of sky and still retaining her warm hold of judes hand  he reclined on his elbow near her  weve run all this way for nothing she went on her form heaving and falling in quick pants her face flushed her full red lips parted and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin  wellwhy dont you speak deary  im blown too  it was all up hill  they were in absolute solitudethe most apparent of all solitudes that of empty surrounding space  nobody could be nearer than a mile to them without their seeing him  they were in fact on one of the summits of the county and the distant landscape around christminster could be discerned from where they lay  but jude did not think of that then  oh i can see such a pretty thing up this tree said arabella  a sort of acaterpillar of the most loveliest green and yellow you ever came across  where said jude sitting up  you cant see him thereyou must come here said she  he bent nearer and put his head in front of hers  noi cant see it he said  why on the limb there where it branches offclose to the moving leafthere  she gently pulled him down beside her  i dont see it he repeated the back of his head against her cheek  but i can perhaps standing up  he stood accordingly placing himself in the direct line of her gaze  how stupid you are she said crossly turning away her face  i dont care to see it dear why should i he replied looking down upon her  get up abby  why  i want you to let me kiss you  ive been waiting to ever so long  she rolled round her face remained a moment looking deedily aslant at him then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet and exclaiming abruptly i must mizzle walked off quickly homeward jude followed and rejoined her  just one he coaxed  shant she said  he surprised whats the matter  she kept her two lips resentfully together and jude followed her like a pet lamb till she slackened her pace and walked beside him talking calmly on indifferent subjects and always checking him if he tried to take her hand or clasp her waist  thus they descended to the precincts of her fathers homestead and arabella went in nodding goodbye to him with a supercilious affronted air  i expect i took too much liberty with her somehow jude said to himself as he withdrew with a sigh and went on to marygreen  on sunday morning the interior of arabellas home was as usual the scene of a grand weekly cooking the preparation of the special sunday dinner  her father was shaving before a little glass hung on the mullion of the window and her mother and arabella herself were shelling beans hard by  a neighbour passed on her way home from morning service at the nearest church and seeing donn engaged at the window with the razor nodded and came in  she at once spoke playfully to arabella i zeed ee running with unheehee i hope tis coming to something  arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without raising her eyes  hes for christminster i hear as soon as he can get there  have you heard that latelyquite lately asked arabella with a jealous tigerish indrawing of breath  oh no  but it has been known a long time that it is his plan  hes ony waiting here for an opening  ah well he must walk about with somebody i spose  young men dont mean much nowadays tis a sip here and a sip there with em  twas different in my time  when the gossip had departed arabella said suddenly to her mother i want you and father to go and inquire how the edlins be this evening after tea  or notheres evening service at fensworthyou can walk to that  oh  whats up tonight then  nothing  only i want the house to myself  hes shy and i cant get un to come in when you are here  i shall let him slip through my fingers if i dont mind much as i care for n  if it is fine we med as well go since you wish  in the afternoon arabella met and walked with jude who had now for weeks ceased to look into a book of greek latin or any other tongue  they wandered up the slopes till they reached the green track along the ridge which they followed to the circular british earthbank adjoining jude thinking of the great age of the trackway and of the drovers who had frequented it probably before the romans knew the country  up from the level lands below them floated the chime of church bells  presently they were reduced to one note which quickened and stopped  now well go back said arabella who had attended to the sounds  jude assented  so long as he was near her he minded little where he was  when they arrived at her house he said lingeringly i wont come in  why are you in such a hurry to go in tonight  it is not near dark  wait a moment said she  she tried the handle of the door and found it locked  ahthey are gone to church she added  and searching behind the scraper she found the key and unlocked the door  now youll come in a moment she asked lightly  we shall be all alone  certainly said jude with alacrity the case being unexpectedly altered  indoors they went  did he want any tea  no it was too late he would rather sit and talk to her  she took off her jacket and hat and they sat downnaturally enough close together  dont touch me please she said softly  i am part eggshell or perhaps i had better put it in a safe place  she began unfastening the collar of her gown  what is it said her lover  an egga cochins egg  i am hatching a very rare sort  i carry it about everywhere with me and it will get hatched in less than three weeks  where do you carry it  just here  she put her hand into her bosom and drew out the egg which was wrapped in wool outside it being a piece of pigs bladder in case of accidents  having exhibited it to him she put it back now mind you dont come near me  i dont want to get it broke and have to begin another  why do you do such a strange thing  its an old custom  i suppose it is natural for a woman to want to bring live things into the world  it is very awkward for me just now he said laughing  it serves you right  therethats all you can have of me  she had turned round her chair and reaching over the back of it presented her cheek to him gingerly  thats very shabby of you  you should have catched me a minute ago when i had put the egg down there she said defiantly i am without it now  she had quickly withdrawn the egg a second time but before he could quite reach her she had put it back as quickly laughing with the excitement of her strategy  then there was a little struggle jude making a plunge for it and capturing it triumphantly  her face flushed and becoming suddenly conscious he flushed also  they looked at each other panting till he rose and said one kiss now i can do it without damage to property and ill go  but she had jumped up too  you must find me first she cried  her lover followed her as she withdrew  it was now dark inside the room and the window being small he could not discover for a long time what had become of her till a laugh revealed her to have rushed up the stairs whither jude rushed at her heels    ix   it was some two months later in the year and the pair had met constantly during the interval  arabella seemed dissatisfied she was always imagining and waiting and wondering  one day she met the itinerant vilbert  she like all the cottagers thereabout knew the quack well and she began telling him of her experiences  arabella had been gloomy but before he left her she had grown brighter  that evening she kept an appointment with jude who seemed sad  i am going away he said to her  i think i ought to go  i think it will be better both for you and for me  i wish some things had never begun  i was much to blame i know  but it is never too late to mend  arabella began to cry  how do you know it is not too late she said  thats all very well to say  i havent told you yet and she looked into his face with streaming eyes  what he asked turning pale  not  yes  and what shall i do if you desert me  oh arabellahow can you say that my dear  you know i wouldnt desert you  well then  i have next to no wages as yet you know or perhaps i should have thought of this before  but of course if thats the case we must marry  what other thing do you think i could dream of doing  i thoughti thought deary perhaps you would go away all the more for that and leave me to face it alone  you knew better  of course i never dreamt six months ago or even three of marrying  it is a complete smashing up of my plansi mean my plans before i knew you my dear  but what are they after all dreams about books and degrees and impossible fellowships and all that  certainly well marry we must  that night he went out alone and walked in the dark selfcommuning he knew well too well in the secret centre of his brain that arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind yet such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable young men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he unfortunately had done he was ready to abide by what he had said and take the consequences  for his own soothing he kept up a factitious belief in her  his idea of her was the thing of most consequence not arabella herself he sometimes said laconically  the banns were put in and published the very next sunday  the people of the parish all said what a simple fool young fawley was  all his reading had only come to this that he would have to sell his books to buy saucepans  those who guessed the probable state of affairs arabellas parents being among them declared that it was the sort of conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as jude in reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart  the parson who married them seemed to think it satisfactory too  and so standing before the aforesaid officiator the two swore that at every other time of their lives till death took them they would assuredly believe feel and desire precisely as they had believed felt and desired during the few preceding weeks  what was as remarkable as the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all surprised at what they swore  fawleys aunt being a baker she made him a bridecake saying bitterly that it was the last thing she could do for him poor silly fellow and that it would have been far better if instead of his living to trouble her he had gone underground years before with his father and mother  of this cake arabella took some slices wrapped them up in white notepaper and sent them to her companions in the porkdressing business anny and sarah labelling each packet in remembrance of good advice  the prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very brilliant even to the most sanguine mind  he a stonemasons apprentice nineteen years of age was working for half wages till he should be out of his time  his wife was absolutely useless in a townlodging where he at first had considered it would be necessary for them to live  but the urgent need of adding to income in ever so little a degree caused him to take a lonely roadside cottage between the brown house and marygreen that he might have the profits of a vegetable garden and utilize her past experiences by letting her keep a pig  but it was not the sort of life he had bargained for and it was a long way to walk to and from alfredston every day arabella however felt that all these makeshifts were temporary she had gained a husband that was the thinga husband with a lot of earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats when he should begin to get frightened a bit and stick to his trade and throw aside those stupid books for practical undertakings  so to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage giving up his old room at his auntswhere so much of the hard labour at greek and latin had been carried on  a little chill overspread him at her first unrobing  a long tail of hair which arabella wore twisted up in an enormous knob at the back of her head was deliberately unfastened stroked out and hung upon the lookingglass which he had bought her  whatit wasnt your own he said with a sudden distaste for her  oh noit never is nowadays with the better class  nonsense  perhaps not in towns  but in the country it is supposed to be different  besides youve enough of your own surely  yes enough as country notions go  but in town the men expect more and when i was barmaid at aldbrickham  barmaid at aldbrickham  well not exactly barmaidi used to draw the drink at a publichouse therejust for a little time that was all  some people put me up to getting this and i bought it just for a fancy the more you have the better in aldbrickham which is a finer town than all your christminsters  every lady of position wears false hairthe barbers assistant told me so  jude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be true to some extent for all that he knew many unsophisticated girls would and did go to towns and remain there for years without losing their simplicity of life and embellishments  others alas had an instinct towards artificiality in their very blood and became adepts in counterfeiting at the first glimpse of it  however perhaps there was no great sin in a woman adding to her hair and he resolved to think no more of it  a newmade wife can usually manage to excite interest for a few weeks even though the prospects of the household ways and means are cloudy  there is a certain piquancy about her situation and her manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it which carries off the gloom of facts and renders even the humblest bride independent awhile of the real  mrs jude fawley was walking in the streets of alfredston one marketday with this quality in her carriage when she met anny her former friend whom she had not seen since the wedding  as usual they laughed before talking the world seemed funny to them without saying it  so it turned out a good plan you see remarked the girl to the wife  i knew it would with such as him  hes a dear good fellow and you ought to be proud of un  i am said mrs fawley quietly  and when do you expect  ssh  not at all  what  i was mistaken  oh arabella arabella you be a deep one  mistaken well thats cleverits a real stroke of genius  it is a thing i never thought o wi all my experience  i never thought beyond bringing about the real thingnot that one could sham it  dont you be too quick to cry sham  twasnt sham  i didnt know  my wordwont he be in a taking  hell give it to ee o saturday nights  whatever it was hell say it was a tricka double one by the lord  ill own to the first but not to the second poohhe wont care  hell be glad i was wrong in what i said  hell shake down bless eemen always do  what can em do otherwise  married is married  nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that arabella approached the time when in the natural course of things she would have to reveal that the alarm she had raised had been without foundation the occasion was one evening at bedtime and they were in their chamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which jude walked home from his work every day  he had worked hard the whole twelve hours and had retired to rest before his wife  when she came into the room he was between sleeping and waking and was barely conscious of her undressing before the little lookingglass as he lay  one action of hers however brought him to full cognition  her face being reflected towards him as she sat he could perceive that she was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the dimple before alluded to a curious accomplishment of which she was mistress effecting it by a momentary suction  it seemed to him for the first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face during his intercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the earlier weeks of their acquaintance  dont do that arabella he said suddenly  there is no harm in it buti dont like to see you  she turned and laughed  lord i didnt know you were awake she said  how countrified you are  thats nothing  where did you learn it  nowhere that i know of  they used to stay without any trouble when i was at the publichouse but now they wont  my face was fatter then  i dont care about dimples  i dont think they improve a womanparticularly a married woman and of fullsized figure like you  most men think otherwise  i dont care what most men think if they do  how do you know  i used to be told so when i was serving in the taproom  ahthat publichouse experience accounts for your knowing about the adulteration of the ale when we went and had some that sunday evening  i thought when i married you that you had always lived in your fathers house  you ought to have known better than that and seen i was a little more finished than i could have been by staying where i was born there was not much to do at home and i was eating my head off so i went away for three months  youll soon have plenty to do now dear wont you  how do you mean  why of courselittle things to make  oh  when will it be  cant you tell me exactly instead of in such general terms as you have used  tell you  yesthe date  theres nothing to tell  i made a mistake  what  it was a mistake  he sat bolt upright in bed and looked at her  how can that be  women fancy wrong things sometimes  but why of course so unprepared as i was without a stick of furniture and hardly a shilling i shouldnt have hurried on our affair and brought you to a halffurnished hut before i was ready if it had not been for the news you gave me which made it necessary to save you ready or no  good god  dont take on dear  whats done cant be undone  i have no more to say  he gave the answer simply and lay down and there was silence between them  when jude awoke the next morning he seemed to see the world with a different eye  as to the point in question he was compelled to accept her word in the circumstances he could not have acted otherwise while ordinary notions prevailed  but how came they to prevail  there seemed to him vaguely and dimly something wrong in a social ritual which made necessary a cancelling of wellformed schemes involving years of thought and labour of foregoing a mans one opportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals and of contributing his units of work to the general progress of his generation because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory instinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice and could be only at the most called weakness  he was inclined to inquire what he had done or she lost for that matter that he deserved to be caught in a gin which would cripple him if not her also for the rest of a lifetime  there was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the immediate reason of his marriage had proved to be nonexistent  but the marriage remained    x   the time arrived for killing the pig which jude and his wife had fattened in their sty during the autumn months and the butchering was timed to take place as soon as it was light in the morning so that jude might get to alfredston without losing more than a quarter of a day  the night had seemed strangely silent  jude looked out of the window long before dawn and perceived that the ground was covered with snowsnow rather deep for the season it seemed a few flakes still falling  im afraid the pigkiller wont be able to come he said to arabella  oh hell come  you must get up and make the water hot if you want challow to scald him  though i like singeing best  ill get up said jude  i like the way of my own county  he went downstairs lit the fire under the copper and began feeding it with beanstalks all the time without a candle the blaze flinging a cheerful shine into the room though for him the sense of cheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blazeto heat water to scald the bristles from the body of an animal that as yet lived and whose voice could be continually heard from a corner of the garden  at halfpast six the time of appointment with the butcher the water boiled and judes wife came downstairs  is challow come she asked  no  they waited and it grew lighter with the dreary light of a snowy dawn  she went out gazed along the road and returning said hes not coming  drunk last night i expect  the snow is not enough to hinder him surely  then we must put it off  it is only the water boiled for nothing the snow may be deep in the valley  cant be put off  theres no more victuals for the pig  he ate the last mixing o barleymeal yesterday morning  yesterday morning  what has he lived on since  nothing  whathe has been starving  yes  we always do it the last day or two to save bother with the innerds  what ignorance not to know that  that accounts for his crying so  poor creature  wellyou must do the stickingtheres no help for it  ill show you how  or ill do it myselfi think i could  though as it is such a big pig i had rather challow had done it  however his basket o knives and things have been already sent on here and we can use em  of course you shant do it said jude  ill do it since it must be done  he went out to the sty shovelled away the snow for the space of a couple of yards or more and placed the stool in front with the knives and ropes at hand  a robin peered down at the preparations from the nearest tree and not liking the sinister look of the scene flew away though hungry  by this time arabella had joined her husband and jude rope in hand got into the sty and noosed the affrighted animal who beginning with a squeak of surprise rose to repeated cries of rage  arabella opened the stydoor and together they hoisted the victim on to the stool legs upward and while jude held him arabella bound him down looping the cord over his legs to keep him from struggling  the animals note changed its quality  it was not now rage but the cry of despair longdrawn slow and hopeless  upon my soul i would sooner have gone without the pig than have had this to do said jude  a creature i have fed with my own hands  dont be such a tenderhearted fool  theres the stickingknife the one with the point  now whatever you do dont stick un too deep  ill stick him effectually so as to make short work of it  thats the chief thing  you must not she cried  the meat must be well bled and to do that he must die slow  we shall lose a shilling a score if the meat is red and bloody  just touch the vein thats all  i was brought up to it and i know  every good butcher keeps un bleeding long he ought to be eight or ten minutes dying at least  he shall not be half a minute if i can help it however the meat may look said jude determinedly  scraping the bristles from the pigs upturned throat as he had seen the butchers do he slit the fat then plunged in the knife with all his might  od damn it all she cried that ever i should say it  youve overstuck un  and i telling you all the time  do be quiet arabella and have a little pity on the creature  hold up the pail to catch the blood and dont talk  however unworkmanlike the deed it had been mercifully done  the blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she had desired  the dying animals cry assumed its third and final tone the shriek of agony his glazing eyes riveting themselves on arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends  make un stop that said arabella  such a noise will bring somebody or other up here and i dont want people to know we are doing it ourselves  picking up the knife from the ground whereon jude had flung it she slipped it into the gash and slit the windpipe  the pig was instantly silent his dying breath coming through the hole  thats better she said  it is a hateful business said he  pigs must be killed  the animal heaved in a final convulsion and despite the rope kicked out with all his last strength  a tablespoonful of black clot came forth the trickling of red blood having ceased for some seconds  thats it now hell go said she  artful creaturesthey always keep back a drop like that as long as they can  the last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make jude stagger and in recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood had been caught  there she cried thoroughly in a passion  now i cant make any blackpot  theres a waste all through you  jude put the pail upright but only about a third of the whole steaming liquid was left in it the main part being splashed over the snow and forming a dismal sordid ugly spectacleto those who saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat  the lips and nostrils of the animal turned livid then white and the muscles of his limbs relaxed  thank god jude said  hes dead  whats god got to do with such a messy job as a pigkilling i should like to know she said scornfully  poor folks must live  i know i know said he  i dont scold you  suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand  well done young married volk  i couldnt have carried it out much better myself cuss me if i could  the voice which was husky came from the gardengate and looking up from the scene of slaughter they saw the burly form of mr challow leaning over the gate critically surveying their performance  tis well for ee to stand there and glane said arabella  owing to your being late the meat is blooded and half spoiled twont fetch so much by a shilling a score  challow expressed his contrition  you should have waited a bit he said shaking his head and not have done thisin the delicate state too that you be in at present maam  tis risking yourself too much  you neednt be concerned about that said arabella laughing jude too laughed but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in his amusement  challow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the scalding and scraping  jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man at what he had done though aware of his lack of common sense and that the deed would have amounted to the same thing if carried out by deputy  the white snow stained with the blood of his fellowmortal wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice not to say a christian but he could not see how the matter was to be mended  no doubt he was as his wife had called him a tenderhearted fool  he did not like the road to alfredston now  it stared him cynically in the face  the wayside objects reminded him so much of his courtship of his wife that to keep them out of his eyes he read whenever he could as he walked to and from his work  yet he sometimes felt that by caring for books he was not escaping commonplace nor gaining rare ideas every workingman being of that taste now  when passing near the spot by the stream on which he had first made her acquaintance he one day heard voices just as he had done at that earlier time  one of the girls who had been arabellas companions was talking to a friend in a shed himself being the subject of discourse possibly because they had seen him in the distance  they were quite unaware that the shedwalls were so thin that he could hear their words as he passed  howsomever twas i put her up to it  nothing venture nothing have i said  if i hadnt shed no more have been his misess than i  tis my belief she knew there was nothing the matter when she told him she was  what had arabella been put up to by this woman so that he should make her his misess otherwise wife  the suggestion was horridly unpleasant and it rankled in his mind so much that instead of entering his own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket inside the gardengate and passed on determined to go and see his old aunt and get some supper there  this made his arrival home rather late  arabella however was busy melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig for she had been out on a jaunt all day and so delayed her work  dreading lest what he had heard should lead him to say something regrettable to her he spoke little  but arabella was very talkative and said among other things that she wanted some money  seeing the book sticking out of his pocket she added that he ought to earn more  an apprentices wages are not meant to be enough to keep a wife on as a rule my dear  then you shouldnt have had one  come arabella  thats too bad when you know how it came about  ill declare afore heaven that i thought what i told you was true doctor vilbert thought so  it was a good job for you that it wasnt so  i dont mean that he said hastily  i mean before that time i know it was not your fault but those women friends of yours gave you bad advice  if they hadnt or you hadnt taken it we should at this moment have been free from a bond which not to mince matters galls both of us devilishly  it may be very sad but it is true  whos been telling you about my friends  what advice  i insist upon you telling me  poohid rather not  but you shallyou ought to  it is mean of ee not to  very well  and he hinted gently what had been revealed to him but i dont wish to dwell upon it  let us say no more about it  her defensive manner collapsed  that was nothing she said laughing coldly  every woman has a right to do such as that  the risk is hers  i quite deny it bella  she might if no lifelong penalty attached to it for the man or in his default for herself if the weakness of the moment could end with the moment or even with the year but when effects stretch so far she should not go and do that which entraps a man if he is honest or herself if he is otherwise  what ought i to have done  given me time  why do you fuss yourself about melting down that pigs fat tonight  please put it away  then i must do it tomorrow morning  it wont keep  very welldo    xi   next morning which was sunday she resumed operations about ten oclock and the renewed work recalled the conversation which had accompanied it the night before and put her back into the same intractable temper  thats the story about me in marygreen is itthat i entrapped ee much of a catch you were lord send  as she warmed she saw some of judes dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have been laid  i wont have them books here in the way she cried petulantly and seizing them one by one she began throwing them upon the floor  leave my books alone he said  you might have thrown them aside if you had liked but as to soiling them like that it is disgusting  in the operation of making lard arabellas hands had become smeared with the hot grease and her fingers consequently left very perceptible imprints on the bookcovers  she continued deliberately to toss the books severally upon the floor till jude incensed beyond bearing caught her by the arms to make her leave off  somehow in going so he loosened the fastening of her hair and it rolled about her ears  let me go she said  promise to leave the books alone  she hesitated  let me go she repeated  promise  after a pause i do  jude relinquished his hold and she crossed the room to the door out of which she went with a set face and into the highway  here she began to saunter up and down perversely pulling her hair into a worse disorder than he had caused and unfastening several buttons of her gown  it was a fine sunday morning dry clear and frosty and the bells of alfredston church could be heard on the breeze from the north  people were going along the road dressed in their holiday clothes they were mainly loverssuch pairs as jude and arabella had been when they sported along the same track some months earlier these pedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she now presented bonnetless her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind her bodice apart her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work and her hands reeking with melted fat  one of the passers said in mock terror good lord deliver us  see how hes served me she cried  making me work sunday mornings when i ought to be going to my church and tearing my hair off my head and my gown off my back  jude was exasperated and went out to drag her in by main force then he suddenly lost his heat  illuminated with the sense that all was over between them and that it mattered not what she did or he her husband stood still regarding her  their lives were ruined he thought ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render a lifelong comradeship tolerable  going to illuse me on principle as your father illused your mother and your fathers sister illused her husband she asked all you be a queer lot as husbands and wives  jude fixed an arrested surprised look on her  but she said no more and continued her saunter till she was tired  he left the spot and after wandering vaguely a little while walked in the direction of marygreen  here he called upon his greataunt whose infirmities daily increased  auntdid my father illuse my mother and my aunt her husband said jude abruptly sitting down by the fire  she raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the bygone bonnet that she always wore  whos been telling you that she said  i have heard it spoken of and want to know all  you med so well i spose though your wifei reckon twas shemust have been a fool to open up that  there isnt much to know after all  your father and mother couldnt get on together and they parted  it was coming home from alfredston market when you were a babyon the hill by the brown house barnthat they had their last difference and took leave of one another for the last time  your mother soon afterwards diedshe drowned herself in short and your father went away with you to south wessex and never came here any more  jude recalled his fathers silence about north wessex and judes mother never speaking of either till his dying day  it was the same with your fathers sister  her husband offended her and she so disliked living with him afterwards that she went away to london with her little maid  the fawleys were not made for wedlock it never seemed to sit well upon us  theres sommat in our blood that wont take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what we do readily enough if not bound  thats why you ought to have hearkened to me and not ha married  where did father and mother partby the brown house did you say  a little further onwhere the road to fenworth branches off and the handpost stands  a gibbet once stood there not onconnected with our history  but let that be  in the dusk of that evening jude walked away from his old aunts as if to go home  but as soon as he reached the open down he struck out upon it till he came to a large round pond  the frost continued though it was not particularly sharp and the larger stars overhead came out slow and flickering  jude put one foot on the edge of the ice and then the other it cracked under his weight but this did not deter him  he ploughed his way inward to the centre the ice making sharp noises as he went  when just about the middle he looked around him and gave a jump  the cracking repeated itself but he did not go down  he jumped again but the cracking had ceased  jude went back to the edge and stepped upon the ground  it was curious he thought  what was he reserved for  he supposed he was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide  peaceful death abhorred him as a subject and would not take him  what could he do of a lower kind than selfextermination what was there less noble more in keeping with his present degraded position he could get drunk  of course that was it he had forgotten drinking was the regular stereotyped resource of the despairing worthless  he began to see now why some men boozed at inns  he struck down the hill northwards and came to an obscure publichouse on entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of samson and delilah on the wall caused him to recognize the place as that he had visited with arabella on that first sunday evening of their courtship  he called for liquor and drank briskly for an hour or more  staggering homeward late that night with all his sense of depression gone and his head fairly clear still he began to laugh boisterously and to wonder how arabella would receive him in his new aspect  the house was in darkness when he entered and in his stumbling state it was some time before he could get a light then he found that though the marks of pigdressing of fats and scallops were visible the materials themselves had been taken away a line written by his wife on the inside of an old envelope was pinned to the cotton blower of the fireplace  have gone to my friends  shall not return  all the next day he remained at home and sent off the carcase of the pig to alfredston  he then cleaned up the premises locked the door put the key in a place she would know if she came back and returned to his masonry at alfredston  at night when he again plodded home he found she had not visited the house  the next day went in the same way and the next  then there came a letter from her  that she had gone tired of him she frankly admitted  he was such a slow old coach and she did not care for the sort of life he led  there was no prospect of his ever bettering himself or her she further went on to say that her parents had as he knew for some time considered the question of emigrating to australia the pigjobbing business being a poor one nowadays  they had at last decided to go and she proposed to go with them if he had no objection  a woman of her sort would have more chance over there than in this stupid country  jude replied that he had not the least objection to her going  he thought it a wise course since she wished to go and one that might be to the advantage of both  he enclosed in the packet containing the letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig with all he had besides which was not much  from that day he heard no more of her except indirectly though her father and his household did not immediately leave but waited till his goods and other effects had been sold off  when jude learnt that there was to be an auction at the house of the donns he packed his own household goods into a waggon and sent them to her at the aforesaid homestead that she might sell them with the rest or as many of them as she should choose  he then went into lodgings at alfredston and saw in a shopwindow the little handbill announcing the sale of his fatherinlaws furniture he noted its date which came and passed without judes going near the place or perceiving that the traffic out of alfredston by the southern road was materially increased by the auction  a few days later he entered a dingy brokers shop in the main street of the town and amid a heterogeneous collection of saucepans a clotheshorse rollingpin brass candlestick swing lookingglass and other things at the back of the shop evidently just brought in from a sale he perceived a framed photograph which turned out to be his own portrait  it was one which he had had specially taken and framed by a local man in birdseye maple as a present for arabella and had duly given her on their weddingday  on the back was still to be read jude to arabella with the date  she must have thrown it in with the rest of her property at the auction  oh said the broker seeing him look at this and the other articles in the heap and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself it is a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage sale out on the road to marygreen  the frame is a very useful one if you take out the likeness you shall have it for a shilling  the utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife as brought home to him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of his portrait and gift was the conclusive little stroke required to demolish all sentiment in him  he paid the shilling took the photograph away with him and burnt it frame and all when he reached his lodging  two or three days later he heard that arabella and her parents had departed  he had sent a message offering to see her for a formal leavetaking but she had said that it would be better otherwise since she was bent on going which perhaps was true  on the evening following their emigration when his days work was done he came out of doors after supper and strolled in the starlight along the too familiar road towards the upland whereon had been experienced the chief emotions of his life  it seemed to be his own again  he could not realize himself  on the old track he seemed to be a boy still hardly a day older than when he had stood dreaming at the top of that hill inwardly fired for the first time with ardours for christminster and scholarship  yet i am a man he said  i have a wife  more i have arrived at the still riper stage of having disagreed with her disliked her had a scuffle with her and parted from her  he remembered then that he was standing not far from the spot at which the parting between his father and his mother was said to have occurred  a little further on was the summit whence christminster or what he had taken for that city had seemed to be visible  a milestone now as always stood at the roadside hard by  jude drew near it and felt rather than read the mileage to the city  he remembered that once on his way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an inscription on the back of that milestone embodying his aspirations it had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship before he had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman  he wondered if the inscription were legible still and going to the back of the milestone brushed away the nettles  by the light of a match he could still discern what he had cut so enthusiastically so long ago               thither              j f    with a pointing finger   the sight of it unimpaired within its screen of grass and nettles lit in his soul a spark of the old fire  surely his plan should be to move onward through good and illto avoid morbid sorrow even though he did see uglinesses in the world  bene agere et loetarito do good cheerfullywhich he had heard to be the philosophy of one spinoza might be his own even now  he might battle with his evil star and follow out his original intention  by moving to a spot a little way off he uncovered the horizon in a northeasterly direction  there actually rose the faint halo a small dim nebulousness hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith it was enough for him  he would go to christminster as soon as the term of his apprenticeship expired  he returned to his lodgings in a better mood and said his prayers      part second   at christminster       save his own soul he hath no starswinburne      notitiam primosque gradus vicinia fecit          tempore crevit amorovid   i   the next noteworthy move in judes life was that in which he appeared gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three years later leafage than had graced his courtship of arabella and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her  he was walking towards christminster city at a point a mile or two to the southwest of it  he had at last found himself clear of marygreen and alfredston he was out of his apprenticeship and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new startthe start to which barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with arabella he had been looking forward for about ten years  jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible meditative and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance he was of dark complexion with dark harmonizing eyes and he wore a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual at his age this with his great mass of black curly hair was some trouble to him in combing and washing out the stonedust that settled on it in the pursuit of his trade  his capabilities in the latter having been acquired in the country were of an allround sort including monumental stonecutting gothic freestone work for the restoration of churches and carving of a general kind  in london he would probably have become specialized and have made himself a moulding mason a foliage sculptorperhaps a statuary  he had that afternoon driven in a cart from alfredston to the village nearest the city in this direction and was now walking the remaining four miles rather from choice than from necessity having always fancied himself arriving thus  the ultimate impulse to come had had a curious originone more nearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual as is often the case with young men  one day while in lodgings at alfredston he had gone to marygreen to see his old aunt and had observed between the brass candlesticks on her mantlepiece the photograph of a pretty girlish face in a broad hat with radiating folds under the brim like the rays of a halo  he had asked who she was  his grandaunt had gruffly replied that she was his cousin sue bridehead of the inimical branch of the family and on further questioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in christminster though she did not know where or what she was doing  his aunt would not give him the photograph  but it haunted him and ultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his latent intent of following his friend the school master thither  he now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity and obtained his first near view of the city  greystoned and dunroofed it stood within hail of the wessex border and almost with the tip of one small toe within it at the northernmost point of the crinkled line along which the leisurely thames strokes the fields of that ancient kingdom  the buildings now lay quiet in the sunset a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues  reaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard willows growing indistinct in the twilight and soon confronted the outmost lamps of the townsome of those lamps which had sent into the sky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days of dreaming so many years ago  they winked their yellow eyes at him dubiously and as if though they had been awaiting him all these years in disappointment at his tarrying they did not much want him now  he was a species of dick whittington whose spirit was touched to finer issues than a mere material gain  he went along the outlying streets with the cautious tread of an explorer  he saw nothing of the real city in the suburbs on this side  his first want being a lodging he scrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer on inexpensive terms the modest type of accommodation he demanded and after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed beersheba though he did not know this at the time  here he installed himself and having had some tea sallied forth  it was a windy whispering moonless night  to guide himself he opened under a lamp a map he had brought  the breeze ruffled and fluttered it but he could see enough to decide on the direction he should take to reach the heart of the place  after many turnings he came up to the first ancient mediæval pile that he had encountered  it was a college as he could see by the gateway  he entered it walked round and penetrated to dark corners which no lamplight reached  close to this college was another and a little further on another and then he began to be encircled as it were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city  when he passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them  a bell began clanging and he listened till a hundredandone strokes had sounded  he must have made a mistake he thought it was meant for a hundred  when the gates were shut and he could no longer get into the quadrangles he rambled under the walls and doorways feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings and carving  the minutes passed fewer and fewer people were visible and still he serpentined among the shadows for had he not imagined these scenes through ten bygone years and what mattered a nights rest for once  high against the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed pinnacles and indented battlements  down obscure alleys apparently never trodden now by the foot of man and whose very existence seemed to be forgotten there would jut into the path porticoes oriels doorways of enriched and florid middleage design their extinct air being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones  it seemed impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit and superseded chambers  knowing not a human being here jude began to be impressed with the isolation of his own personality as with a selfspectre the sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself seen or heard  he drew his breath pensively and seeming thus almost his own ghost gave his thoughts to the other ghostly presences with which the nooks were haunted  during the interval of preparation for this venture since his wife and furnitures uncompromising disappearance into space he had read and learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his position of the worthies who had spent their youth within these reverend walls and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer age  some of them by the accidents of his reading loomed out in his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest  the brushings of the wind against the angles buttresses and doorjambs were as the passing of these only other inhabitants the tappings of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their mournful souls the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement making him comrades in his solitude  in the gloom it was as if he ran against them without feeling their bodily frames  the streets were now deserted but on account of these things he could not go in  there were poets abroad of early date and of late from the friend and eulogist of shakespeare down to him who has recently passed into silence and that musical one of the tribe who is still among us  speculative philosophers drew along not always with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits but pinkfaced slim and active as in youth modern divines sheeted in their surplices among whom the most real to jude fawley were the founders of the religious school called tractarian the wellknown three the enthusiast the poet and the formularist the echoes of whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home a start of aversion appeared in his fancy to move them at sight of those other sons of the place the form in the fullbottomed wig statesman rake reasoner and sceptic the smoothly shaven historian so ironically civil to christianity with others of the same incredulous temper who knew each quad as well as the faithful and took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters  he regarded the statesmen in their various types men of firmer movement and less dreamy air the scholar the speaker the plodder the man whose mind grew with his growth in years and the man whose mind contracted with the same  the scientists and philologists followed on in his mindsight in an odd impossible combination men of meditative faces strained foreheads and weakeyed as bats with constant research then official characterssuch men as governorgenerals and lordlieutenants in whom he took little interest chiefjustices and lord chancellors silent thinlipped figures of whom he knew barely the names  a keener regard attached to the prelates by reason of his own former hopes  of them he had an ample bandsome men of heart others rather men of head he who apologized for the church in latin the saintly author of the evening hymn and near them the great itinerant preacher hymnwriter and zealot shadowed like jude by his matrimonial difficulties  jude found himself speaking out loud holding conversations with them as it were like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the audience on the other side of the footlights till he suddenly ceased with a start at his absurdity  perhaps those incoherent words of the wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over his lamp and he may have raised his head and wondered what voice it was and what it betokened  jude now perceived that so far as solid flesh went he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception of a belated townsman here and there and that he seemed to be catching a cold  a voice reached him out of the shade a real and local voice  youve been asettin a long time on that plinthstone young man what med you be up to  it came from a policeman who had been observing jude without the latter observing him  jude went home and to bed after reading up a little about these men and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he had brought with him concerning the sons of the university  as he drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had just been conning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances some audible some unintelligible to him  one of the spectres who afterwards mourned christminster as the home of lost causes though jude did not remember this was now apostrophizing her thus  beautiful city so venerable so lovely so unravaged by the fierce intellectual life of our century so serene   her ineffable charm keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us to the ideal to perfection  another voice was that of the corn law convert whose phantom he had just seen in the quadrangle with a great bell  jude thought his soul might have been shaping the historic words of his masterspeech  sir i may be wrong but my impression is that my duty towards a country threatened with famine requires that that which has been the ordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to now namely that there should be free access to the food of man from whatever quarter it may come  deprive me of office tomorrow you can never deprive me of the consciousness that i have exercised the powers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives from no desire to gratify ambition for no personal gain  then the sly author of the immortal chapter on christianity how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the pagan and philosophic world to those evidences miracles which were presented by omnipotence   the sages of greece and rome turned aside from the awful spectacle and appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world  then the shade of the poet the last of the optimists      how the world is made for each of us                                  and each of the many helps to recruit    the life of the race by a general plan   then one of the three enthusiasts he had seen just now the author of the apologia  my argument was  that absolute certitude as to the truths of natural theology was the result of an assemblage of concurring and converging probabilities  that probabilities which did not reach to logical certainty might create a mental certitude  the second of them no polemic murmured quieter things      why should we faint and fear to live alone    since all alone so heaven has willd we die   he likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short face the genial spectator  when i look upon the tombs of the great every motion of envy dies in me when i read the epitaphs of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out when i meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone my heart melts with compassion when i see the tombs of the parents themselves i consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow  and lastly a gentlevoiced prelate spoke during whose meek familiar rhyme endeared to him from earliest childhood jude fell asleep        teach me to live that i may dread      the grave as little as my bed      teach me to die    he did not wake till morning  the ghostly past seemed to have gone and everything spoke of today  he started up in bed thinking he had overslept himself and then said  by jovei had quite forgotten my sweetfaced cousin and that shes here all the time  and my old schoolmaster too  his words about his schoolmaster had perhaps less zest in them than his words concerning his cousin    ii   necessary meditations on the actual including the mean breadandcheese question dissipated the phantasmal for a while and compelled jude to smother high thinkings under immediate needs  he had to get up and seek for work manual work the only kind deemed by many of its professors to be work at all  passing out into the streets on this errand he found that the colleges had treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances some were pompous some had put on the look of family vaults above ground something barbaric loomed in the masonries of all  the spirits of the great men had disappeared  the numberless architectural pages around him he read naturally less as an artistcritic of their forms than as an artizan and comrade of the dead handicraftsmen whose muscles had actually executed those forms  he examined the mouldings stroked them as one who knew their beginning said they were difficult or easy in the working had taken little or much time were trying to the arm or convenient to the tool  what at night had been perfect and ideal was by day the more or less defective real  cruelties insults had he perceived been inflicted on the aged erections  the condition of several moved him as he would have been moved by maimed sentient beings  they were wounded broken sloughing off their outer shape in the deadly struggle against years weather and man  the rottenness of these historical documents reminded him that he was not after all hastening on to begin the morning practically as he had intended  he had come to work and to live by work and the morning had nearly gone  it was in one sense encouraging to think that in a place of crumbling stones there must be plenty for one of his trade to do in the business of renovation  he asked his way to the workyard of the stonemason whose name had been given him at alfredston and soon heard the familiar sound of the rubbers and chisels  the yard was a little centre of regeneration  here with keen edges and smooth curves were forms in the exact likeness of those he had seen abraded and timeeaten on the walls  these were the ideas in modern prose which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry even some of those antiques might have been called prose when they were new  they had done nothing but wait and had become poetical how easy to the smallest building how impossible to most men  he asked for the foreman and looked round among the new traceries mullions transoms shafts pinnacles and battlements standing on the bankers half worked or waiting to be removed  they were marked by precision mathematical straightness smoothness exactitude there in the old walls were the broken lines of the original idea jagged curves disdain of precision irregularity disarray  for a moment there fell on jude a true illumination that here in the stone yard was a centre of effort as worthy as that dignified by the name of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges  but he lost it under stress of his old idea  he would accept any employment which might be offered him on the strength of his late employers recommendation but he would accept it as a provisional thing only this was his form of the modern vice of unrest  moreover he perceived that at best only copying patching and imitating went on here which he fancied to be owing to some temporary and local cause  he did not at that time see that mediævalism was as dead as a fernleaf in a lump of coal that other developments were shaping in the world around him in which gothic architecture and its associations had no place  the deadly animosity of contemporary logic and vision towards so much of what he held in reverence was not yet revealed to him  having failed to obtain work here as yet he went away and thought again of his cousin whose presence somewhere at hand he seemed to feel in wavelets of interest if not of emotion  how he wished he had that pretty portrait of her  at last he wrote to his aunt to send it  she did so with a request however that he was not to bring disturbance into the family by going to see the girl or her relations  jude a ridiculously affectionate fellow promised nothing put the photograph on the mantelpiece kissed ithe did not know whyand felt more at home  she seemed to look down and preside over his tea  it was cheeringthe one thing uniting him to the emotions of the living city  there remained the schoolmasterprobably now a reverend parson but he could not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet so raw and unpolished was his condition so precarious were his fortunes  thus he still remained in loneliness  although people moved round him he virtually saw none  not as yet having mingled with the active life of the place it was largely nonexistent to him but the saints and prophets in the windowtracery the paintings in the galleries the statues the busts the gargoyles the corbelheadsthese seemed to breathe his atmosphere  like all newcomers to a spot on which the past is deeply graven he heard that past announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by and even incredible to the habitual residents  for many days he haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the colleges at odd minutes in passing them surprised by impish echoes of his own footsteps smart as the blows of a mallet  the christminster sentiment as it had been called ate further and further into him till he probably knew more about those buildings materially artistically and historically than any one of their inmates  it was not till now when he found himself actually on the spot of his enthusiasm that jude perceived how far away from the object of that enthusiasm he really was  only a wall divided him from those happy young contemporaries of his with whom he shared a common mental life men who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read mark learn and inwardly digest  only a wallbut what a wall  every day every hour as he went in search of labour he saw them going and coming also rubbed shoulders with them heard their voices marked their movements  the conversation of some of the more thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes owing to his long and persistent preparation for this place to be peculiarly akin to his own thoughts  yet he was as far from them as if he had been at the antipodes  of course he was  he was a young workman in a white blouse and with stonedust in the creases of his clothes and in passing him they did not even see him or hear him rather saw through him as through a pane of glass at their familiars beyond whatever they were to him he to them was not on the spot at all and yet he had fancied he would be close to their lives by coming there  but the future lay ahead after all and if he could only be so fortunate as to get into good employment he would put up with the inevitable  so he thanked god for his health and strength and took courage  for the present he was outside the gates of everything colleges included perhaps some day he would be inside  those palaces of light and leading he might some day look down on the world through their panes  at length he did receive a message from the stonemasons yardthat a job was waiting for him  it was his first encouragement and he closed with the offer promptly  he was young and strong or he never could have executed with such zest the undertakings to which he now applied himself since they involved reading most of the night after working all the day  first he bought a shaded lamp for four and sixpence and obtained a good light  then he got pens paper and such other necessary books as he had been unable to obtain elsewhere  then to the consternation of his landlady he shifted all the furniture of his rooma single one for living and sleepingrigged up a curtain on a rope across the middle to make a double chamber out of one hung up a thick blind that nobody should know how he was curtailing the hours of sleep laid out his books and sat down  having been deeply encumbered by marrying getting a cottage and buying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife he had never been able to save any money since the time of those disastrous ventures and till his wages began to come in he was obliged to live in the narrowest way  after buying a book or two he could not even afford himself a fire and when the nights reeked with the raw and cold air from the meadows he sat over his lamp in a greatcoat hat and woollen gloves  from his window he could perceive the spire of the cathedral and the ogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city  the tall tower tall belfry windows and tall pinnacles of the college by the bridge he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase these objects he used as stimulants when his faith in the future was dim  like enthusiasts in general he made no inquiries into details of procedure  picking up general notions from casual acquaintance he never dwelt upon them  for the present he said to himself the one thing necessary was to get ready by accumulating money and knowledge and await whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming a son of the university  for wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it  his desire absorbed him and left no part of him to weigh its practicability  at this time he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old aunt on the subject which had previously distressed hera fear that jude would not be strongminded enough to keep away from his cousin sue bridehead and her relations  sues father his aunt believed had gone back to london but the girl remained at christminster  to make her still more objectionable she was an artist or designer of some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse which was a perfect seedbed of idolatry and she was no doubt abandoned to mummeries on that accountif not quite a papist miss drusilla fawley was of her date evangelical  as jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological this news of sues probable opinions did not much influence him one way or the other but the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting with an altogether singular pleasure he walked at his earliest spare minutes past the shops answering to his greataunts description and beheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk who was suspiciously like the original of the portrait  he ventured to enter on a trivial errand and having made his purchase lingered on the scene  the shop seemed to be kept entirely by women  it contained anglican books stationery texts and fancy goods little plaster angels on brackets gothicframed pictures of saints ebony crosses that were almost crucifixes prayerbooks that were almost missals he felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk she was so pretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong to him  then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the counter and he recognized in the accents certain qualities of his own voice softened and sweetened but his own  what was she doing he stole a glance round  before her lay a piece of zinc cut to the shape of a scroll three or four feet long and coated with a deadsurface paint on one side  hereon she was designing or illuminating in characters of church text the single word      a l l e l u j a   a sweet saintly christian business hers thought he  her presence here was now fairly enough explained her skill in work of this sort having no doubt been acquired from her fathers occupation as an ecclesiastical worker in metal  the lettering on which she was engaged was clearly intended to be fixed up in some chancel to assist devotion  he came out  it would have been easy to speak to her there and then but it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt to disregard her request so incontinently  she had used him roughly but she had brought him up and the fact of her being powerless to control him lent a pathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as an argument  so jude gave no sign  he would not call upon sue just yet  he had other reasons against doing so when he had walked away  she seemed so dainty beside himself in his rough workingjacket and dusty trousers that he felt he was as yet unready to encounter her as he had felt about mr phillotson  and how possible it was that she had inherited the antipathies of her family and would scorn him as far as a christian could particularly when he had told her that unpleasant part of his history which had resulted in his becoming enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire  thus he kept watch over her and liked to feel she was there the consciousness of her living presence stimulated him  but she remained more or less an ideal character about whose form he began to weave curious and fantastic daydreams  between two and three weeks afterwards jude was engaged with some more men outside crozier college in oldtime street in getting a block of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement before hoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing  standing in position the head man said spaik when he heave heho  and they heaved  all of a sudden as he lifted his cousin stood close to his elbow pausing a moment on the bend of her foot till the obstructing object should have been removed  she looked right into his face with liquid untranslatable eyes that combined or seemed to him to combine keenness with tenderness and mystery with both their expression as well as that of her lips taking its life from some words just spoken to a companion and being carried on into his face quite unconsciously  she no more observed his presence than that of the dustmotes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams  his closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled and turned his face away with a shy instinct to prevent her recognizing him though as she had never once seen him she could not possibly do so and might very well never have heard even his name  he could perceive that though she was a countrygirl at bottom a latter girlhood of some years in london and a womanhood here had taken all rawness out of her  when she was gone he continued his work reflecting on her  he had been so caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her general mould and build  he remembered now that she was not a large figure that she was light and slight of the type dubbed elegant that was about all he had seen  there was nothing statuesque in her all was nervous motion  she was mobile living yet a painter might not have called her handsome or beautiful  but the much that she was surprised him  she was quite a long way removed from the rusticity that was his  how could one of his crossgrained unfortunate almost accursed stock have contrived to reach this pitch of niceness  london had done it he supposed  from this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his breast as the bottledup effect of solitude and the poetized locality he dwelt in insensibly began to precipitate itself on this halfvisionary form and he perceived that whatever his obedient wish in a contrary direction he would soon be unable to resist the desire to make himself known to her  he affected to think of her quite in a family way since there were crushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any other  the first reason was that he was married and it would be wrong the second was that they were cousins  it was not well for cousins to fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion the third even were he free in a family like his own where marriage usually meant a tragic sadness marriage with a bloodrelation would duplicate the adverse conditions and a tragic sadness might be intensified to a tragic horror  therefore again he would have to think of sue with only a relations mutual interest in one belonging to him regard her in a practical way as some one to be proud of to talk and nod to later on to be invited to tea by the emotion spent on her being rigorously that of a kinsman and wellwisher  so would she be to him a kindly star an elevating power a companion in anglican worship a tender friend    iii   but under the various deterrent influences judes instinct was to approach her timidly and the next sunday he went to the morning service in the cathedral church of cardinal college to gain a further view of her for he had found that she frequently attended there  she did not come and he awaited her in the afternoon which was finer  he knew that if she came at all she would approach the building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from which it was accessible and he stood in a corner while the bell was going  a few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as one of the figures walking along under the college walls and at sight of her he advanced up the side opposite and followed her into the building more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed himself  to see her and to be himself unseen and unknown was enough for him at present  he lingered awhile in the vestibule and the service was some way advanced when he was put into a seat  it was a louring mournful still afternoon when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to ordinary practical men and not only a luxury of the emotional and leisured classes  in the dim light and the baffling glare of the clerestory windows he could discern the opposite worshippers indistinctly only but he saw that sue was among them  he had not long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting of the 119th psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second part in quo corriget the organ changing to a pathetic gregorian tune as the singers gave forth      wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way   it was the very question that was engaging judes attention at this moment  what a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as he had done to an animal passion for a woman and allow it to lead to such disastrous consequences then to think of putting an end to himself then to go recklessly and get drunk  the great waves of pedal music tumbled round the choir and nursed on the supernatural as he had been it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that the psalm was not specially set by some regardful providence for this moment of his first entry into the solemn building  and yet it was the ordinary psalm for the twentyfourth evening of the month  the girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary tenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those which floated into his ears and the thought was a delight to him she was probably a frequenter of this place and steeped body and soul in church sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit had no doubt much in common with him  to an impressionable and lonely young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for his thoughts which promised to supply both social and spiritual possibilities was like the dew of hermon and he remained throughout the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy  though he was loth to suspect it some people might have said to him that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from cyprus as from galilee  jude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen before he himself moved  she did not look towards him and by the time he reached the door she was halfway down the broad path being dressed up in his sunday suit he was inclined to follow her and reveal himself  but he was not quite ready and alas ought he to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him  for though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the service and he had persuaded himself that such was the case he could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism she was such a stranger that the kinship was affectation and he said it cant be  i a man with a wife must not know her  still sue was his own kin and the fact of his having a wife even though she was not in evidence in this hemisphere might be a help in one sense  it would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out of sues mind and make her intercourse with him free and fearless it was with some heartache that he saw how little he cared for the freedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such knowledge    some little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the pretty liquideyed lightfooted young woman sue bridehead had an afternoons holiday and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in which she not only assisted but lodged took a walk into the country with a book in her hand  it was one of those cloudless days which sometimes occur in wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet as if intercalated by caprice of the weathergod  she went along for a mile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the city she had left behind her  the road passed between green fields and coming to a stile sue paused there to finish the page she was reading and then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles new and old  on the other side of the stile in the footpath she beheld a foreigner with black hair and a sallow face sitting on the grass beside a large square board whereon were fixed as closely as they could stand a number of plaster statuettes some of them bronzed which he was rearranging before proceeding with them on his way they were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles and comprised divinities of a very different character from those the girl was accustomed to see portrayed among them being a venus of standard pattern a diana and of the other sex apollo bacchus and mars  though the figures were many yards away from her the southwest sun brought them out so brilliantly against the green herbage that she could discern their contours with luminous distinctness and being almost in a line between herself and the church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and contrasting set of ideas by comparison  the man rose and seeing her politely took off his cap and cried iiimages in an accent that agreed with his appearance  in a moment he dexterously lifted upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine and human and raised it to the top of his head bringing them on to her and resting the board on the stile  first he offered her his smaller waresthe busts of kings and queens then a minstrel then a winged cupid  she shook her head  how much are these two she said touching with her finger the venus and the apollothe largest figures on the tray  he said she should have them for ten shillings  i cannot afford that said sue  she offered considerably less and to her surprise the imageman drew them from their wire stay and handed them over the stile  she clasped them as treasures  when they were paid for and the man had gone she began to be concerned as to what she should do with them  they seemed so very large now that they were in her possession and so very naked being of a nervous temperament she trembled at her enterprise when she handled them the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and jacket  after carrying them along a little way openly an idea came to her and pulling some huge burdock leaves parsley and other rank growths from the hedge she wrapped up her burden as well as she could in these so that what she carried appeared to be an enormous armful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature  well anything is better than those everlasting church fallals she said  but she was still in a trembling state and seemed almost to wish she had not bought the figures  occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that venuss arm was not broken she entered with her heathen load into the most christian city in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main one and round a corner to the side door of the establishment to which she was attached  her purchases were taken straight up to her own chamber and she at once attempted to lock them in a box that was her very own property but finding them too cumbersome she wrapped them in large sheets of brown paper and stood them on the floor in a corner  the mistress of the house miss fontover was an elderly lady in spectacles dressed almost like an abbess a dab at ritual as become one of her business and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of st silas in the suburb of beersheba beforementioned which jude also had begun to attend  she was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced circumstances and at his death which had occurred several years before this date she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable proportions  she wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only ornament and knew the christian year by heart  she now came to call sue to tea and finding that the girl did not respond for a moment entered the room just as the other was hastily putting a string round each parcel  something you have been buying miss bridehead she asked regarding the enwrapped objects  yesjust something to ornament my room said sue  well i should have thought i had put enough here already said miss fontover looking round at the gothicframed prints of saints the churchtext scrolls and other articles which having become too stale to sell had been used to furnish this obscure chamber  what is it  how bulky  she tore a little hole about as big as a wafer in the brown paper and tried to peep in  why statuary  two figures  where did you get them  ohi bought them of a travelling man who sells casts  two saints  yes  what ones  st peter and stst mary magdalen  wellnow come down to tea and go and finish that organtext if theres light enough afterwards  these little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest passing fancy created in sue a great zest for unpacking her objects and looking at them and at bedtime when she was sure of being undisturbed she unrobed the divinities in comfort  placing the pair of figures on the chest of drawers a candle on each side of them she withdrew to the bed flung herself down thereon and began reading a book she had taken from her box which miss fontover knew nothing of  it was a volume of gibbon and she read the chapter dealing with the reign of julian the apostate  occasionally she looked up at the statuettes which appeared strange and out of place there happening to be a calvary print hanging between them and as if the scene suggested the action she at length jumped up and withdrew another book from her boxa volume of verseand turned to the familiar poem      thou hast conquered o pale galilean    the world has grown grey from thy breath   which she read to the end  presently she put out the candles undressed and finally extinguished her own light  she was of an age which usually sleeps soundly yet tonight she kept waking up and every time she opened her eyes there was enough diffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment of text and martyr and the gothicframed crucifixpicture that was only discernible now as a latin cross the figure thereon being obscured by the shades  on one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour it fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his books at a not very distant spot in the same city  being saturday night the morrow was one on which jude had not set his alarmclock to call him at his usually early time and hence he had stayed up as was his custom two or three hours later than he could afford to do on any other day of the week  just then he was earnestly reading from his griesbachs text  at the very time that sue was tossing and staring at her figures the policeman and belated citizens passing along under his window might have heard if they had stood still strange syllables mumbled with fervour withinwords that had for jude an indescribable enchantment inexplicable sounds something like these  all hemin heis theos ho pater ex hou ta panta kai hemeis eis auton  till the sounds rolled with reverent loudness as a book was heard to close  kai heis kurios iesous christos di hou ta panta kai hemeis di autou    iv   he was a handy man at his trade an allround man as artizans in countrytowns are apt to be  in london the man who carves the boss or knob of leafage declines to cut the fragment of moulding which merges in that leafage as if it were a degradation to do the second half of one whole  when there was not much gothic moulding for jude to run or much windowtracery on the bankers he would go out lettering monuments or tombstones and take a pleasure in the change of handiwork  the next time that he saw her was when he was on a ladder executing a job of this sort inside one of the churches  there was a short morning service and when the parson entered jude came down from his ladder and sat with the halfdozen people forming the congregation till the prayer should be ended and he could resume his tapping  he did not observe till the service was half over that one of the women was sue who had perforce accompanied the elderly miss fontover thither  jude sat watching her pretty shoulders her easy curiously nonchalant risings and sittings and her perfunctory genuflexions and thought what a help such an anglican would have been to him in happier circumstances  it was not so much his anxiety to get on with his work that made him go up to it immediately the worshipers began to take their leave it was that he dared not in this holy spot confront the woman who was beginning to influence him in such an indescribable manner  those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate acquaintance with sue bridehead now that his interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind loomed as stubbornly as ever  but it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone that the particular man jude at any rate wanted something to love  some men would have rushed incontinently to her snatched the pleasure of easy friendship which she could hardly refuse and have left the rest to chance  not so judeat first  but as the days and still more particularly the lonely evenings dragged along he found himself to his moral consternation to be thinking more of her instead of thinking less of her and experiencing a fearful bliss in doing what was erratic informal and unexpected  surrounded by her influence all day walking past the spots she frequented he was always thinking of her and was obliged to own to himself that his conscience was likely to be the loser in this battle  to be sure she was almost an ideality to him still  perhaps to know her would be to cure himself of this unexpected and unauthorized passion  a voice whispered that though he desired to know her he did not desire to be cured  there was not the least doubt that from his own orthodox point of view the situation was growing immoral  for sue to be the loved one of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love arabella and none other unto his lifes end was a pretty bad second beginning when the man was bent on such a course as jude purposed  this conviction was so real with him that one day when as was frequent he was at work in a neighbouring village church alone he felt it to be his duty to pray against his weakness  but much as he wished to be an exemplar in these things he could not get on  it was quite impossible he found to ask to be delivered from temptation when your hearts desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven  so he excused himself  after all he said it is not altogether an erotolepsy that is the matter with me as at that first time i can see that she is exceptionally bright and it is partly a wish for intellectual sympathy and a craving for lovingkindness in my solitude  thus he went on adoring her fearing to realize that it was human perversity  for whatever sues virtues talents or ecclesiastical saturation it was certain that those items were not at all the cause of his affection for her  on an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stonemasons yard with some hesitation and lifting her skirts to avoid draggling them in the white dust crossed towards the office  thats a nice girl said one of the men known as uncle joe  who is she asked another  i dont knowive seen her about here and there  why yes shes the daughter of that clever chap bridehead who did all the wrought ironwork at st silas ten years ago and went away to london afterwards  i dont know what hes doing nownot much i fancyas shes come back here  meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and asked if mr jude fawley was at work in the yard  it so happened that jude had gone out somewhere or other that afternoon which information she received with a look of disappointment and went away immediately when jude returned they told him and described her whereupon he exclaimed whythats my cousin sue  he looked along the street after her but she was out of sight  he had no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her and resolved to call upon her that very evening  and when he reached his lodging he found a note from hera first noteone of those documents which simple and commonplace in themselves are seen retrospectively to have been pregnant with impassioned consequences the very unconsciousness of a looming drama which is shown in such innocent first epistles from women to men or vice versa makes them when such a drama follows and they are read over by the purple or lurid light of it all the more impressive solemn and in cases terrible  sues was of the most artless and natural kind  she addressed him as her dear cousin jude said she had only just learnt by the merest accident that he was living in christminster and reproached him with not letting her know  they might have had such nice times together she said for she was thrown much upon herself and had hardly any congenial friend  but now there was every probability of her soon going away so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps for ever  a cold sweat overspread jude at the news that she was going away that was a contingency he had never thought of and it spurred him to write all the more quickly to her  he would meet her that very evening he said one hour from the time of writing at the cross in the pavement which marked the spot of the martyrdoms  when he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted that in his hurry he should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors when he might have said he would call upon her  it was in fact the country custom to meet thus and nothing else had occurred to him arabella had been met in the same way unfortunately and it might not seem respectable to a dear girl like sue  however it could not be helped now and he moved towards the point a few minutes before the hour under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps  the broad street was silent and almost deserted although it was not late  he saw a figure on the other side which turned out to be hers and they both converged towards the crossmark at the same moment  before either had reached it she called out to him  i am not going to meet you just there for the first time in my life  come further on  the voice though positive and silvery had been tremulous  they walked on in parallel lines and waiting her pleasure jude watched till she showed signs of closing in when he did likewise the place being where the carriers carts stood in the daytime though there was none on the spot then  i am sorry that i asked you to meet me and didnt call began jude with the bashfulness of a lover  but i thought it would save time if we were going to walk  ohi dont mind that she said with the freedom of a friend  i have really no place to ask anybody in to  what i meant was that the place you chose was so horridi suppose i ought not to say horridi mean gloomy and inauspicious in its associations  but isnt it funny to begin like this when i dont know you yet  she looked him up and down curiously though jude did not look much at her  you seem to know me more than i know you she added  yesi have seen you now and then  and you knew who i was and didnt speak  and now i am going away  yes  thats unfortunate  i have hardly any other friend  i have indeed one very old friend here somewhere but i dont quite like to call on him just yet  i wonder if you know anything of himmr phillotson  a parson somewhere about the county i think he is  noi only know of one mr phillotson  he lives a little way out in the country at lumsdon  hes a village schoolmaster  ah  i wonder if hes the same  surely it is impossible  only a schoolmaster still  do you know his christian nameis it richard  yesit is ive directed books to him though ive never seen him  then he couldnt do it  judes countenance fell for how could he succeed in an enterprise wherein the great phillotson had failed  he would have had a day of despair if the news had not arrived during his sweet sues presence but even at this moment he had visions of how phillotsons failure in the grand university scheme would depress him when she had gone  as we are going to take a walk suppose we go and call upon him said jude suddenly  it is not late  she agreed and they went along up a hill and through some prettily wooded country  presently the embattled tower and square turret of the church rose into the sky and then the schoolhouse they inquired of a person in the street if mr phillotson was likely to be at home and were informed that he was always at home  a knock brought him to the schoolhouse door with a candle in his hand and a look of inquiry on his face which had grown thin and careworn since jude last set eyes on him  that after all these years the meeting with mr phillotson should be of this homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had surrounded the schoolmasters figure in judes imagination ever since their parting  it created in him at the same time a sympathy with phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man jude told him his name and said he had come to see him as an old friend who had been kind to him in his youthful days  i dont remember you in the least said the schoolmaster thoughtfully  you were one of my pupils you say  yes no doubt but they number so many thousands by this time of my life and have naturally changed so much that i remember very few except the quite recent ones  it was out at marygreen said jude wishing he had not come  yes  i was there a short time  and is this an old pupil too  nothats my cousin  i wrote to you for some grammars if you recollect and you sent them  ahyesi do dimly recall that incident  it was very kind of you to do it  and it was you who first started me on that course  on the morning you left marygreen when your goods were on the waggon you wished me goodbye and said your scheme was to be a university man and enter the churchthat a degree was the necessary hallmark of one who wanted to do anything as a theologian or teacher  i remember i thought all that privately but i wonder i did not keep my own counsel  the idea was given up years ago  i have never forgotten it  it was that which brought me to this part of the country and out here to see you tonight  come in said phillotson  and your cousin too  they entered the parlour of the schoolhouse where there was a lamp with a paper shade which threw the light down on three or four books  phillotson took it off so that they could see each other better and the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious dark eyes and hair of sue on the earnest features of her cousin and on the schoolmasters own maturer face and figure showing him to be a spare and thoughtful personage of fiveandforty with a thinlipped somewhat refined mouth a slightly stooping habit and a black frock coat which from continued frictions shone a little at the shoulderblades the middle of the back and the elbows  the old friendship was imperceptibly renewed the schoolmaster speaking of his experiences and the cousins of theirs  he told them that he still thought of the church sometimes and that though he could not enter it as he had intended to do in former years he might enter it as a licentiate  meanwhile he said he was comfortable in his present position though he was in want of a pupilteacher  they did not stay to supper sue having to be indoors before it grew late and the road was retraced to christminster  though they had talked of nothing more than general subjects jude was surprised to find what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him  she was so vibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling an exciting thought would make her walk ahead so fast that he could hardly keep up with her and her sensitiveness on some points was such that it might have been misread as vanity  it was with heartsickness he perceived that while her sentiments towards him were those of the frankest friendliness only he loved her more than before becoming acquainted with her and the gloom of the walk home lay not in the night overhead but in the thought of her departure  why must you leave christminster he said regretfully  how can you do otherwise than cling to a city in whose history such men as newman pusey ward keble loom so large  yesthey do  though how large do they loom in the history of the world   what a funny reason for caring to stay  i should never have thought of it  she laughed  welli must go she continued  miss fontover one of the partners whom i serve is offended with me and i with her and it is best to go  how did that happen  she broke some statuary of mine  oh  wilfully  yes  she found it in my room and though it was my property she threw it on the floor and stamped on it because it was not according to her taste and ground the arms and the head of one of the figures all to bits with her heela horrid thing  too catholicapostolic for her i suppose  no doubt she called them popish images and talked of the invocation of saints  no  no she didnt do that  she saw the matter quite differently  ah  then i am surprised  yes  it was for quite some other reason that she didnt like my patronsaints  so i was led to retort upon her and the end of it was that i resolved not to stay but to get into an occupation in which i shall be more independent  why dont you try teaching again  you once did i heard  i never thought of resuming it for i was getting on as an artdesigner  do let me ask mr phillotson to let you try your hand in his school  if you like it and go to a training college and become a firstclass certificated mistress you get twice as large an income as any designer or church artist and twice as much freedom  wellask him  now i must go in  goodbye dear jude  i am so glad we have met at last  we neednt quarrel because our parents did need we  jude did not like to let her see quite how much he agreed with her and went his way to the remote street in which he had his lodging  to keep sue bridehead near him was now a desire which operated without regard of consequences and the next evening he again set out for lumsdon fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note only  the schoolmaster was unprepared for such a proposal  what i rather wanted was a second years transfer as it is called he said  of course your cousin would do personally but she has had no experience  ohshe has has she  does she really think of adopting teaching as a profession  jude said she was disposed to do so he thought and his ingenious arguments on her natural fitness for assisting mr phillotson of which jude knew nothing whatever so influenced the schoolmaster that he said he would engage her assuring jude as a friend that unless his cousin really meant to follow on in the same course and regarded this step as the first stage of an apprenticeship of which her training in a normal school would be the second stage her time would be wasted quite the salary being merely nominal  the day after this visit phillotson received a letter from jude containing the information that he had again consulted his cousin who took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition and that she had agreed to come  it did not occur for a moment to the schoolmaster and recluse that judes ardour in promoting the arrangement arose from any other feelings towards sue than the instinct of cooperation common among members of the same family    v   the schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling attached to the school both being modern erections and he looked across the way at the old house in which his teacher sue had a lodging  the arrangement had been concluded very quickly  a pupilteacher who was to have been transferred to mr phillotsons school had failed him and sue had been taken as stopgap  all such provisional arrangements as these could only last till the next annual visit of hm inspector whose approval was necessary to make them permanent  having taught for some two years in london though she had abandoned that vocation of late miss bridehead was not exactly a novice and phillotson thought there would be no difficulty in retaining her services which he already wished to do though she had only been with him three or four weeks  he had found her quite as bright as jude had described her and what mastertradesman does not wish to keep an apprentice who saves him half his labour  it was a little over halfpast eight oclock in the morning and he was waiting to see her cross the road to the school when he would follow  at twenty minutes to nine she did cross a light hat tossed on her head and he watched her as a curiosity  a new emanation which had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher seemed to surround her this morning  he went to the school also and sue remained governing her class at the other end of the room all day under his eye  she certainly was an excellent teacher  it was part of his duty to give her private lessons in the evening and some article in the code made it necessary that a respectable elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and the taught were of different sexes  richard phillotson thought of the absurdity of the regulation in this case when he was old enough to be the girls father but he faithfully acted up to it and sat down with her in a room where mrs hawes the widow at whose house sue lodged occupied herself with sewing  the regulation was indeed not easy to evade for there was no other sittingroom in the dwelling  sometimes as she figuredit was arithmetic that they were working atshe would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile at him as if she assumed that being the master he must perceive all that was passing in her brain as right or wrong  phillotson was not really thinking of the arithmetic at all but of her in a novel way which somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor  perhaps she knew that he was thinking of her thus  for a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in itself was a delight to him  then it happened that the children were to be taken to christminster to see an itinerant exhibition in the shape of a model of jerusalem to which schools were admitted at a penny a head in the interests of education  they marched along the road two and two she beside her class with her simple cotton sunshade her little thumb cocked up against its stem and phillotson behind in his long dangling coat handling his walkingstick genteelly in the musing mood which had come over him since her arrival  the afternoon was one of sun and dust and when they entered the exhibition room few people were present but themselves the model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment and the proprietor with a fine religious philanthropy written on his features walked round it with a pointer in his hand showing the young people the various quarters and places known to them by name from reading their bibles mount moriah the valley of jehoshaphat the city of zion the walls and the gates outside one of which there was a large mound like a tumulus and on the mound a little white cross  the spot he said was calvary  i think said sue to the schoolmaster as she stood with him a little in the background that this model elaborate as it is is a very imaginary production  how does anybody know that jerusalem was like this in the time of christ  i am sure this man doesnt  it is made after the best conjectural maps based on actual visits to the city as it now exists  i fancy we have had enough of jerusalem she said considering we are not descended from the jews  there was nothing firstrate about the place or people after allas there was about athens rome alexandria and other old cities  but my dear girl consider what it is to us  she was silent for she was easily repressed and then perceived behind the group of children clustered round the model a young man in a white flannel jacket his form being bent so low in his intent inspection of the valley of jehoshaphat that his face was almost hidden from view by the mount of olives  look at your cousin jude continued the schoolmaster  he doesnt think we have had enough of jerusalem  ahi didnt see him she cried in her quick light voice judehow seriously you are going into it  jude started up from his reverie and saw her  ohsue he said with a glad flush of embarrassment  these are your schoolchildren of course  i saw that schools were admitted in the afternoons and thought you might come but i got so deeply interested that i didnt remember where i was  how it carries one back doesnt it  i could examine it for hours but i have only a few minutes unfortunately for i am in the middle of a job out here  your cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it unmercifully said phillotson with goodhumoured satire  she is quite sceptical as to its correctness  no mr phillotson i am notaltogether  i hate to be what is called a clever girlthere are too many of that sort now answered sue sensitively  i only meanti dont know what i meantexcept that it was what you dont understand  i know your meaning said jude ardently although he did not and i think you are quite right  thats a good judei know you believe in me  she impulsively seized his hand and leaving a reproachful look on the schoolmaster turned away to jude her voice revealing a tremor which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle  she had not the least conception how the hearts of the twain went out to her at this momentary revelation of feeling and what a complication she was building up thereby in the futures of both  the model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not to tire of it soon and a little later in the afternoon they were all marched back to lumsdon jude returning to his work  he watched the juvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores filing down the street towards the country beside phillotson and sue and a sad dissatisfied sense of being out of the scheme of the latters lives had possession of him  phillotson had invited him to walk out and see them on friday evening when there would be no lessons to give to sue and jude had eagerly promised to avail himself of the opportunity  meanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards and the next day on looking on the blackboard in sues class phillotson was surprised to find upon it skilfully drawn in chalk a perspective view of jerusalem with every building shown in its place  i thought you took no interest in the model and hardly looked at it he said  i hardly did said she but i remembered that much of it  it is more than i had remembered myself  her majestys schoolinspector was at that time paying surprisevisits in this neighbourhood to test the teaching unawares and two days later in the middle of the morning lessons the latch of the door was softly lifted and in walked my gentleman the king of terrorsto pupilteachers  to mr phillotson the surprise was not great like the lady in the story he had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared but sues class was at the further end of the room and her back was towards the entrance the inspector therefore came and stood behind her and watched her teaching some halfminute before she became aware of his presence  she turned and realized that an oftdreaded moment had come  the effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a cry of fright  phillotson with a strange instinct of solicitude quite beyond his control was at her side just in time to prevent her falling from faintness  she soon recovered herself and laughed but when the inspector had gone there was a reaction and she was so white that phillotson took her into his room and gave her some brandy to bring her round  she found him holding her hand  you ought to have told me she gasped petulantly that one of the inspectors surprisevisits was imminent  oh what shall i do  now hell write and tell the managers that i am no good and i shall be disgraced for ever  he wont do that my dear little girl  you are the best teacher ever i had  he looked so gently at her that she was moved and regretted that she had upbraided him  when she was better she went home  jude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for friday  on both wednesday and thursday he had been so much under the influence of his desire to see her that he walked after dark some distance along the road in the direction of the village and on returning to his room to read found himself quite unable to concentrate his mind on the page  on friday as soon as he had got himself up as he thought sue would like to see him and made a hasty tea he set out notwithstanding that the evening was wet  the trees overhead deepened the gloom of the hour and they dripped sadly upon him impressing him with forebodingsillogical forebodings for though he knew that he loved her he also knew that he could not be more to her than he was  on turning the corner and entering the village the first sight that greeted his eyes was that of two figures under one umbrella coming out of the vicarage gate  he was too far back for them to notice him but he knew in a moment that they were sue and phillotson  the latter was holding the umbrella over her head and they had evidently been paying a visit to the vicarprobably on some business connected with the school work  and as they walked along the wet and deserted lane jude saw phillotson place his arm round the girls waist whereupon she gently removed it but he replaced it and she let it remain looking quickly round her with an air of misgiving  she did not look absolutely behind her and therefore did not see jude who sank into the hedge like one struck with a blight  there he remained hidden till they had reached sues cottage and she had passed in phillotson going on to the school hard by  oh hes too old for hertoo old cried jude in all the terrible sickness of hopeless handicapped love  he could not interfere  was he not arabellas  he was unable to go on further and retraced his steps towards christminster  every tread of his feet seemed to say to him that he must on no account stand in the schoolmasters way with sue  phillotson was perhaps twenty years her senior but many a happy marriage had been made in such conditions of age  the ironical clinch to his sorrow was given by the thought that the intimacy between his cousin and the schoolmaster had been brought about entirely by himself    vi   judes old and embittered aunt lay unwell at marygreen and on the following sunday he went to see hera visit which was the result of a victorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the village of lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin in which the word nearest his heart could not be spoken and the sight which had tortured him could not be revealed  his aunt was now unable to leave her bed and a great part of judes short day was occupied in making arrangements for her comfort  the little bakery business had been sold to a neighbour and with the proceeds of this and her savings she was comfortably supplied with necessaries and more a widow of the same village living with her and ministering to her wants  it was not till the time had nearly come for him to leave that he obtained a quiet talk with her and his words tended insensibly towards his cousin  was sue born here  she wasin this room  they were living here at that time  what made ee ask that  ohi wanted to know  now youve been seeing her said the harsh old woman  and what did i tell ee  wellthat i was not to see her  have you gossiped with her  yes  then dont keep it up  she was brought up by her father to hate her mothers family and shell look with no favour upon a working chap like youa townish girl as shes become by now  i never cared much about her  a pert little thing thats what she was too often with her tightstrained nerves  manys the time ive smacked her for her impertinence  why one day when she was walking into the pond with her shoes and stockings off and her petticoats pulled above her knees afore i could cry out for shame she said move on aunty this is no sight for modest eyes  she was a little child then  she was twelve if a day  wellof course  but now shes older shes of a thoughtful quivering tender nature and as sensitive as  jude cried his aunt springing up in bed  dont you be a fool about her  no no of course not  your marrying that woman arabella was about as bad a thing as a man could possibly do for himself by trying hard  but shes gone to the other side of the world and med never trouble you again  and therell be a worse thing if you tied and bound as you be should have a fancy for sue  if your cousin is civil to you take her civility for what it is worth  but anything more than a relations good wishes it is stark madness for ee to give her  if shes townish and wanton it med bring ee to ruin  dont say anything against her aunt  dont please  a relief was afforded to him by the entry of the companion and nurse of his aunt who must have been listening to the conversation for she began a commentary on past years introducing sue bridehead as a character in her recollections  she described what an odd little maid sue had been when a pupil at the village school across the green opposite before her father went to londonhow when the vicar arranged readings and recitations she appeared on the platform the smallest of them all in her little white frock and shoes and pink sash how she recited excelsior there was a sound of revelry by night and the raven how during the delivery she would knit her little brows and glare round tragically and say to the empty air as if some real creature stood there      ghastly grim and ancient raven       wandering from the nightly shore    tell me what thy lordly name is       on the nights plutonian shore   shed bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear corroborated the sick woman reluctantly as she stood there in her little sash and things that you could see un amost before your very eyes  you too jude had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the air  the neighbour told also of sues accomplishments in other kinds  she was not exactly a tomboy you know but she could do things that only boys do as a rule  ive seen her hit in and steer down the long slide on yonder pond with her little curls blowing one of a file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted on glass and up the back slide without stopping  all boys except herself and then theyd cheer her and then shed say dont be saucy boys and suddenly run indoors  theyd try to coax her out again  but a wouldnt come  these retrospective visions of sue only made jude the more miserable that he was unable to woo her and he left the cottage of his aunt that day with a heavy heart  he would fain have glanced into the school to see the room in which sues little figure had so glorified itself but he checked his desire and went on  it being sunday evening some villagers who had known him during his residence here were standing in a group in their best clothes  jude was startled by a salute from one of them  yeve got there right enough then  jude showed that he did not understand  why to the seat of larningthe city of light you used to talk to us about as a little boy  is it all you expected of it  yes more cried jude  when i was there once for an hour i didnt see much in it for my part auld crumbling buildings half church half almshouse and not much going on at that  you are wrong john there is more going on than meets the eye of a man walking through the streets  it is a unique centre of thought and religionthe intellectual and spiritual granary of this country all that silence and absence of goingson is the stillness of infinite motionthe sleep of the spinningtop to borrow the simile of a wellknown writer  oh well it med be all that or it med not  as i say i didnt see nothing of it the hour or two i was there so i went in and had a pot o beer and a penny loaf and a haporth o cheese and waited till it was time to come along home  youve jined a college by this time i suppose  ah no said jude  i am almost as far off that as ever  how so  jude slapped his pocket  just what we thought  such places be not for such as youonly for them with plenty o money  there you are wrong said jude with some bitterness  they are for such ones  still the remark was sufficient to withdraw judes attention from the imaginative world he had lately inhabited in which an abstract figure more or less himself was steeping his mind in a sublimation of the arts and sciences and making his calling and election sure to a seat in the paradise of the learned  he was set regarding his prospects in a cold northern light  he had lately felt that he could not quite satisfy himself in his greekin the greek of the dramatists particularly  so fatigued was he sometimes after his days work that he could not maintain the critical attention necessary for thorough application  he felt that he wanted a coacha friend at his elbow to tell him in a moment what sometimes would occupy him a weary month in extracting from unanticipative clumsy books  it was decidedly necessary to consider facts a little more closely than he had done of late  what was the good after all of using up his spare hours in a vague labour called private study without giving an outlook on practicabilities  i ought to have thought of this before he said as he journeyed back  it would have been better never to have embarked in the scheme at all than to do it without seeing clearly where i am going or what i am aiming at  this hovering outside the walls of the colleges as if expecting some arm to be stretched out from them to lift me inside wont do  i must get special information  the next week accordingly he sought it  what at first seemed an opportunity occurred one afternoon when he saw an elderly gentleman who had been pointed out as the head of a particular college walking in the public path of a parklike enclosure near the spot at which jude chanced to be sitting  the gentleman came nearer and jude looked anxiously at his face  it seemed benign considerate yet rather reserved  on second thoughts jude felt that he could not go up and address him but he was sufficiently influenced by the incident to think what a wise thing it would be for him to state his difficulties by letter to some of the best and most judicious of these old masters and obtain their advice  during the next week or two he accordingly placed himself in such positions about the city as would afford him glimpses of several of the most distinguished among the provosts wardens and other heads of houses and from those he ultimately selected five whose physiognomies seemed to say to him that they were appreciative and farseeing men  to these five he addressed letters briefly stating his difficulties and asking their opinion on his stranded situation  when the letters were posted jude mentally began to criticize them he wished they had not been sent  it is just one of those intrusive vulgar pushing applications which are so common in these days he thought  why couldnt i know better than address utter strangers in such a way  i may be an impostor an idle scamp a man with a bad character for all that they know to the contrary perhaps thats what i am  nevertheless he found himself clinging to the hope of some reply as to his one last chance of redemption  he waited day after day saying that it was perfectly absurd to expect yet expecting while he waited he was suddenly stirred by news about phillotson phillotson was giving up the school near christminster for a larger one further south in midwessex  what this meant how it would affect his cousin whether as seemed possible it was a practical move of the schoolmasters towards a larger income in view of a provision for two instead of one he would not allow himself to say and the tender relations between phillotson and the young girl of whom jude was passionately enamoured effectually made it repugnant to judes tastes to apply to phillotson for advice on his own scheme  meanwhile the academic dignitaries to whom jude had written vouchsafed no answer and the young man was thus thrown back entirely on himself as formerly with the added gloom of a weakened hope  by indirect inquiries he soon perceived clearly what he had long uneasily suspected that to qualify himself for certain open scholarships and exhibitions was the only brilliant course  but to do this a good deal of coaching would be necessary and much natural ability  it was next to impossible that a man reading on his own system however widely and thoroughly even over the prolonged period of ten years should be able to compete with those who had passed their lives under trained teachers and had worked to ordained lines  the other course that of buying himself in so to speak seemed the only one really open to men like him the difficulty being simply of a material kind  with the help of his information he began to reckon the extent of this material obstacle and ascertained to his dismay that at the rate at which with the best of fortune he would be able to save money fifteen years must elapse before he could be in a position to forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance to a matriculation examination  the undertaking was hopeless  he saw what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the place had exercised over him  to get there and live there to move among the churches and halls and become imbued with the genius loci had seemed to his dreaming youth as the spot shaped its charms to him from its halo on the horizon the obvious and ideal thing to do  let me only get there he had said with the fatuousness of crusoe over his big boat and the rest is but a matter of time and energy  it would have been far better for him in every way if he had never come within sight and sound of the delusive precincts had gone to some busy commercial town with the sole object of making money by his wits and thence surveyed his plan in true perspective  well all that was clear to him amounted to this that the whole scheme had burst up like an iridescent soapbubble under the touch of a reasoned inquiry  he looked back at himself along the vista of his past years and his thought was akin to heines      above the youths inspired and flashing eyes    i see the motley mocking foolscap rise   fortunately he had not been allowed to bring his disappointment into his dear sues life by involving her in this collapse  and the painful details of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should now be spared her as far as possible  after all she had only known a little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged thus unequipped poor and unforeseeing  he always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he awoke from his dream  not quite knowing what to do with himself he went up to an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built theatre that was set amidst this quaint and singular city  it had windows all round from which an outlook over the whole town and its edifices could be gained  judes eyes swept all the views in succession meditatively mournfully yet sturdily  those buildings and their associations and privileges were not for him  from the looming roof of the great library into which he hardly ever had time to enter his gaze travelled on to the varied spires halls gables streets chapels gardens quadrangles which composed the ensemble of this unrivalled panorama  he saw that his destiny lay not with these but among the manual toilers in the shabby purlieu which he himself occupied unrecognized as part of the city at all by its visitors and panegyrists yet without whose denizens the hard readers could not read nor the high thinkers live  he looked over the town into the country beyond to the trees which screened her whose presence had at first been the support of his heart and whose loss was now a maddening torture  but for this blow he might have borne with his fate  with sue as companion he could have renounced his ambitions with a smile  without her it was inevitable that the reaction from the long strain to which he had subjected himself should affect him disastrously  phillotson had no doubt passed through a similar intellectual disappointment to that which now enveloped him  but the schoolmaster had been since blest with the consolation of sweet sue while for him there was no consoler  descending to the streets he went listlessly along till he arrived at an inn and entered it  here he drank several glasses of beer in rapid succession and when he came out it was night  by the light of the flickering lamps he rambled home to supper and had not long been sitting at table when his landlady brought up a letter that had just arrived for him  she laid it down as if impressed with a sense of its possible importance and on looking at it jude perceived that it bore the embossed stamp of one of the colleges whose heads he had addressed  oneat last cried jude  the communication was brief and not exactly what he had expected though it really was from the master in person  it ran thus      biblioll college     siri have read your letter with interest and judging    from your description of yourself as a workingman i    venture to think that you will have a much better chance    of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and    sticking to your trade than by adopting any other course    that therefore is what i advise you to do  yours    faithfully     t tetuphenay     to mr j fawley stonemason   this terribly sensible advice exasperated jude  he had known all that before  he knew it was true  yet it seemed a hard slap after ten years of labour and its effect upon him just now was to make him rise recklessly from the table and instead of reading as usual to go downstairs and into the street  he stood at a bar and tossed off two or three glasses then unconsciously sauntered along till he came to a spot called the fourways in the middle of the city gazing abstractedly at the groups of people like one in a trance till coming to himself he began talking to the policeman fixed there  that officer yawned stretched out his elbows elevated himself an inch and a half on the balls of his toes smiled and looking humorously at jude said youve had a wet young man  no ive only begun he replied cynically  whatever his wetness his brains were dry enough  he only heard in part the policemans further remarks having fallen into thought on what struggling people like himself had stood at that crossway whom nobody ever thought of now  it had more history than the oldest college in the city  it was literally teeming stratified with the shades of human groups who had met there for tragedy comedy farce real enactments of the intensest kind  at fourways men had stood and talked of napoleon the loss of america the execution of king charles the burning of the martyrs the crusades the norman conquest possibly of the arrival of caesar  here the two sexes had met for loving hating coupling parting had waited had suffered for each other had triumphed over each other cursed each other in jealousy blessed each other in forgiveness  he began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating varied and compendious than the gown life these struggling men and women before him were the reality of christminster though they knew little of christ or minster that was one of the humours of things  the floating population of students and teachers who did know both in a way were not christminster in a local sense at all  he looked at his watch and in pursuit of this idea he went on till he came to a public hall where a promenade concert was in progress jude entered and found the room full of shop youths and girls soldiers apprentices boys of eleven smoking cigarettes and light women of the more respectable and amateur class  he had tapped the real christminster life  a band was playing and the crowd walked about and jostled each other and every now and then a man got upon a platform and sang a comic song  the spirit of sue seemed to hover round him and prevent his flirting and drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advanceswistful to gain a little joy  at ten oclock he came away choosing a circuitous route homeward to pass the gates of the college whose head had just sent him the note  the gates were shut and by an impulse he took from his pocket the lump of chalk which as a workman he usually carried there and wrote along the wall  i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as thesejob xii 3    vii   the stroke of scorn relieved his mind and the next morning he laughed at his selfconceit but the laugh was not a healthy one he reread the letter from the master and the wisdom in its lines which had at first exasperated him chilled and depressed him now he saw himself as a fool indeed  deprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion he could not proceed to his work  whenever he felt reconciled to his fate as a student there came to disturb his calm his hopeless relations with sue  that the one affined soul he had ever met was lost to him through his marriage returned upon him with cruel persistency till unable to bear it longer he again rushed for distraction to the real christminster life  he now sought it out in an obscure and lowceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies of the place and in brighter times would have interested him simply by its quaintness  here he sat more or less all the day convinced that he was at bottom a vicious character of whom it was hopeless to expect anything  in the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one jude still retaining his seat in the corner though his money was all spent and he had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit he surveyed his gathering companions with all the equanimity and philosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly and made friends with several to wit tinker taylor a decayed churchironmonger who appeared to have been of a religious turn in earlier years but was somewhat blasphemous now also a rednosed auctioneer also two gothic masons like himself called uncle jim and uncle joe  there were present too some clerks and a gown and surplicemakers assistant two ladies who sported moral characters of various depths of shade according to their company nicknamed bower o bliss and freckles some horsey men in the know of betting circles a travelling actor from the theatre and two devilmaycare young men who proved to be gownless undergraduates they had slipped in by stealth to meet a man about bullpups and stayed to drink and smoke short pipes with the racing gents aforesaid looking at their watches every now and then  the conversation waxed general  christminster society was criticized the dons magistrates and other people in authority being sincerely pitied for their shortcomings while opinions on how they ought to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly respected were exchanged in a largeminded and disinterested manner  jude fawley with the selfconceit effrontery and aplomb of a strongbrained fellow in liquor threw in his remarks somewhat peremptorily and his aims having been what they were for so many years everything the others said turned upon his tongue by a sort of mechanical craze to the subject of scholarship and study the extent of his own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that would have appeared pitiable to himself in his sane hours  i dont care a damn he was saying for any provost warden principal fellow or cursed master of arts in the university  what i know is that id lick em on their own ground if theyd give me a chance and show em a few things they are not up to yet  hear hear said the undergraduates from the corner where they were talking privately about the pups  you always was fond o books ive heard said tinker taylor and i dont doubt what you state  now with me twas different  i always saw there was more to be learnt outside a book than in and i took my steps accordingly or i shouldnt have been the man i am  you aim at the church i believe said uncle joe  if you are such a scholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that why not give us a specimen of your scholarship  canst say the creed in latin man that was how they once put it to a chap down in my country  i should think so said jude haughtily  not he  like his conceit screamed one of the ladies  just you shut up bower o bliss said one of the undergraduates silence  he drank off the spirits in his tumbler rapped with it on the counter and announced the gentleman in the corner is going to rehearse the articles of his belief in the latin tongue for the edification of the company  i wont said jude  yeshave a try said the surplicemaker  you cant said uncle joe  yes he can said tinker taylor  ill swear i can said jude  well come now stand me a small scotch cold and ill do it straight off  thats a fair offer said the undergraduate throwing down the money for the whisky  the barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species and the glass was handed across to jude who having drunk the contents stood up and began rhetorically without hesitation  credo in unum deum patrem omnipotentem factorem coeli et terrae visibilium omnium et invisibilium  good  excellent latin cried one of the undergraduates who however had not the slightest conception of a single word  a silence reigned among the rest in the bar and the maid stood still judes voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour where the landlord was dozing and bringing him out to see what was going on  jude had declaimed steadily ahead and was continuing  crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub pontio pilato passus et sepultus est  et resurrexit tertia die secundum scripturas  thats the nicene sneered the second undergraduate  and we wanted the apostles  you didnt say so  and every fool knows except you that the nicene is the most historic creed  let un go on let un go on said the auctioneer  but judes mind seemed to grow confused soon and he could not get on  he put his hand to his forehead and his face assumed an expression of pain  give him another glassthen hell fetch up and get through it said tinker taylor  somebody threw down threepence the glass was handed jude stretched out his arm for it without looking and having swallowed the liquor went on in a moment in a revived voice raising it as he neared the end with the manner of a priest leading a congregation  et in spiritum sanctum dominum et vivificantem qui ex patre filioque procedit  qui cum patre et filio simul adoratur et conglorificatur  qui locutus est per prophetas  et unam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam  confiteor unum baptisma in remissionem peccatorum  et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum  et vitam venturi saeculi  amen  well done said several enjoying the last word as being the first and only one they had recognized  then jude seemed to shake the fumes from his brain as he stared round upon them  you pack of fools he cried  which one of you knows whether i have said it or no  it might have been the ratcatchers daughter in double dutch for all that your besotted heads can tell  see what i have brought myself tothe crew i have come among  the landlord who had already had his license endorsed for harbouring queer characters feared a riot and came outside the counter but jude in his sudden flash of reason had turned in disgust and left the scene the door slamming with a dull thud behind him  he hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street which he followed till it merged in the highway and all sound of his late companions had been left behind  onward he still went under the influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world to whom it seemed possible to flyan unreasoning desire whose ill judgement was not apparent to him now  in the course of an hour when it was between ten and eleven oclock he entered the village of lumsdon and reaching the cottage saw that a light was burning in a downstairs room which he assumed rightly as it happened to be hers  jude stepped close to the wall and tapped with his finger on the pane saying impatiently sue sue  she must have recognized his voice for the light disappeared from the apartment and in a second or two the door was unlocked and opened and sue appeared with a candle in her hand  is it jude  yes it is  my dear dear cousin whats the matter  oh i ami couldnt help coming sue said he sinking down upon the doorstep  i am so wicked suemy heart is nearly broken and i could not bear my life as it was  so i have been drinking and blaspheming or next door to it and saying holy things in disreputable quartersrepeating in idle bravado words which ought never to be uttered but reverently  oh do anything with me suekill mei dont care  only dont hate me and despise me like all the rest of the world  you are ill poor dear  no i wont despise you of course i wont come in and rest and let me see what i can do for you  now lean on me and dont mind  with one hand holding the candle and the other supporting him she led him indoors and placed him in the only easy chair the meagrely furnished house afforded stretching his feet upon another and pulling off his boots  jude now getting towards his sober senses could only say dear dear sue in a voice broken by grief and contrition  she asked him if he wanted anything to eat but he shook his head then telling him to go to sleep and that she would come down early in the morning and get him some breakfast she bade him goodnight and ascended the stairs  almost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber and did not wake till dawn  at first he did not know where he was but by degrees his situation cleared to him and he beheld it in all the ghastliness of a right mind  she knew the worst of himthe very worst  how could he face her now  she would soon be coming down to see about breakfast as she had said and there would he be in all his shame confronting her  he could not bear the thought and softly drawing on his boots and taking his hat from the nail on which she had hung it he slipped noiselessly out of the house  his fixed idea was to get away to some obscure spot and hide and perhaps pray and the only spot which occurred to him was marygreen he called at his lodging in christminster where he found awaiting him a note of dismissal from his employer and having packed up he turned his back upon the city that had been such a thorn in his side and struck southward into wessex  he had no money left in his pocket his small savings deposited at one of the banks in christminster having fortunately been left untouched  to get to marygreen therefore his only course was walking and the distance being nearly twenty miles he had ample time to complete on the way the sobering process begun in him  at some hour of the evening he reached alfredston  here he pawned his waistcoat and having gone out of the town a mile or two slept under a rick that night  at dawn he rose shook off the hayseeds and stems from his clothes and started again breasting the long white road up the hill to the downs which had been visible to him a long way off and passing the milestone at the top whereon he had carved his hopes years ago  he reached the ancient hamlet while the people were at breakfast weary and mudbespattered but quite possessed of his ordinary clearness of brain he sat down by the well thinking as he did so what a poor christ he made  seeing a trough of water near he bathed his face and went on to the cottage of his greataunt whom he found breakfasting in bed attended by the woman who lived with her  whatout o work asked his relative regarding him through eyes sunken deep under lids heavy as potcovers no other cause for his tumbled appearance suggesting itself to one whose whole life had been a struggle with material things  yes said jude heavily  i think i must have a little rest  refreshed by some breakfast he went up to his old room and lay down in his shirtsleeves after the manner of the artizan  he fell asleep for a short while and when he awoke it was as if he had awakened in hell  it was hellthe hell of conscious failure both in ambition and in love  he thought of that previous abyss into which he had fallen before leaving this part of the country the deepest deep he had supposed it then but it was not so deep as this that had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his hope this was of his second line  if he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous tension which he was now undergoing  but that relief being denied to his virility he clenched his teeth in misery bringing lines about his mouth like those in the laocoön and corrugations between his brows  a mournful wind blew through the trees and sounded in the chimney like the pedal notes of an organ  each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall of the churchless churchyard hard by now abandoned pecked its neighbour smartly and the vane on the new victoriangothic church in the new spot had already begun to creak  yet apparently it was not always the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs it was a voice he guessed its origin in a moment or two the curate was praying with his aunt in the adjoining room  he remembered her speaking of him presently the sounds ceased and a step seemed to cross the landing jude sat up and shouted hoi  the step made for his door which was open and a man looked in it was a young clergyman  i think you are mr highridge said jude  my aunt has mentioned you more than once  well here i am just come home a fellow gone to the bad though i had the best intentions in the world at one time  now i am melancholy mad what with drinking and one thing and another  slowly jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements by an unconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious side of his dream and more upon the theological though this had up till now been merely a portion of the general plan of advancement  now i know i have been a fool and that folly is with me added jude in conclusion  and i dont regret the collapse of my university hopes one jot  i wouldnt begin again if i were sure to succeed  i dont care for social success any more at all  but i do feel i should like to do some good thing and i bitterly regret the church and the loss of my chance of being her ordained minister  the curate who was a new man to this neighbourhood had grown deeply interested and at last he said if you feel a real call to the ministry and i wont say from your conversation that you do not for it is that of a thoughtful and educated man you might enter the church as a licentiate  only you must make up your mind to avoid strong drink  i could avoid that easily enough if i had any kind of hope to support me      part third   at melchester       for there was no other girl o bridegroom     like hersappho h t wharton   i   it was a new ideathe ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct from the intellectual and emulative life  a man could preach and do good to his fellowcreatures without taking doublefirsts in the schools of christminster or having anything but ordinary knowledge the old fancy which had led on to the culminating vision of the bishopric had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all but a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice  he feared that his whole scheme had degenerated to even though it might not have originated in a social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler instincts which was purely an artificial product of civilization there were thousands of young men on the same selfseeking track at the present moment  the sensual hind who ate drank and lived carelessly with his wife through the days of his vanity was a more likable being than he  but to enter the church in such an unscholarly way that he could not in any probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than that of the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village or city slumthat might have a touch of goodness and greatness in it that might be true religion and a purgatorial course worthy of being followed by a remorseful man  the favourable light in which this new thought showed itself by contrast with his foregone intentions cheered jude as he sat there shabby and lonely and it may be said to have given during the next few days the coup de grâce to his intellectual careera career which had extended over the greater part of a dozen years  he did nothing however for some long stagnant time to advance his new desire occupying himself with little local jobs in putting up and lettering headstones about the neighbouring villages and submitting to be regarded as a social failure a returned purchase by the halfdozen or so of farmers and other countrypeople who condescended to nod to him  the human interest of the new intentionand a human interest is indispensable to the most spiritual and selfsacrificingwas created by a letter from sue bearing a fresh postmark  she evidently wrote with anxiety and told very little about her own doings more than that she had passed some sort of examination for a queens scholarship and was going to enter a training college at melchester to complete herself for the vocation she had chosen partly by his influence  there was a theological college at melchester melchester was a quiet and soothing place almost entirely ecclesiastical in its tone a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no establishment where the altruistic feeling that he did possess would perhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he did not  as it would be necessary that he should continue for a time to work at his trade while reading up divinity which he had neglected at christminster for the ordinary classical grind what better course for him than to get employment at the further city and pursue this plan of reading  that his excessive human interest in the new place was entirely of sues making while at the same time sue was to be regarded even less than formerly as proper to create it had an ethical contradictoriness to which he was not blind  but that much he conceded to human frailty and hoped to learn to love her only as a friend and kinswoman  he considered that he might so mark out his coming years as to begin his ministry at the age of thirtyan age which much attracted him as being that of his exemplar when he first began to teach in galilee this would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study and for acquiring capital by his trade to help his aftercourse of keeping the necessary terms at a theological college    christmas had come and passed and sue had gone to the melchester normal school  the time was just the worst in the year for jude to get into new employment and he had written suggesting to her that he should postpone his arrival for a month or so till the days had lengthened  she had acquiesced so readily that he wished he had not proposed itshe evidently did not much care about him though she had never once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to her that night and his silent disappearance  neither had she ever said a word about her relations with mr phillotson  suddenly however quite a passionate letter arrived from sue she was quite lonely and miserable she told him  she hated the place she was in it was worse than the ecclesiastical designers worse than anywhere  she felt utterly friendless could he come immediatelythough when he did come she would only be able to see him at limited times the rules of the establishment she found herself in being strict to a degree  it was mr phillotson who had advised her to come there and she wished she had never listened to him  phillotsons suit was not exactly prospering evidently and jude felt unreasonably glad  he packed up his things and went to melchester with a lighter heart than he had known for months  this being the turning over a new leaf he duly looked about for a temperance hotel and found a little establishment of that description in the street leading from the station  when he had had something to eat he walked out into the dull winter light over the town bridge and turned the corner towards the close  the day was foggy and standing under the walls of the most graceful architectural pile in england he paused and looked up  the lofty building was visible as far as the roofridge above the dwindling spire rose more and more remotely till its apex was quite lost in the mist drifting across it  the lamps now began to be lighted and turning to the west front he walked round  he took it as a good omen that numerous blocks of stone were lying about which signified that the cathedral was undergoing restoration or repair to a considerable extent  it seemed to him full of the superstitions of his beliefs that this was an exercise of forethought on the part of a ruling power that he might find plenty to do in the art he practised while waiting for a call to higher labours  then a wave of warmth came over him as he thought how near he now stood to the brighteyed vivacious girl with the broad forehead and pile of dark hair above it the girl with the kindling glance daringly soft at timessomething like that of the girls he had seen in engravings from paintings of the spanish school  she was hereactually in this closein one of the houses confronting this very west façade  he went down the broad gravel path towards the building  it was an ancient edifice of the fifteenth century once a palace now a trainingschool with mullioned and transomed windows and a courtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall  jude opened the gate and went up to the door through which on inquiring for his cousin he was gingerly admitted to a waitingroom and in a few minutes she came  though she had been here such a short while she was not as he had seen her last  all her bounding manner was gone her curves of motion had become subdued lines  the screens and subtleties of convention had likewise disappeared  yet neither was she quite the woman who had written the letter that summoned him  that had plainly been dashed off in an impulse which second thoughts had somewhat regretted thoughts that were possibly of his recent selfdisgrace jude was quite overcome with emotion  you dontthink me a demoralized wretchfor coming to you as i wasand going so shamefully sue  oh i have tried not to  you said enough to let me know what had caused it  i hope i shall never have any doubt of your worthiness my poor jude  and i am glad you have come  she wore a murreycoloured gown with a little lace collar  it was made quite plain and hung about her slight figure with clinging gracefulness  her hair which formerly she had worn according to the custom of the day was now twisted up tightly and she had altogether the air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline an underbrightness shining through from the depths which that discipline had not yet been able to reach  she had come forward prettily but jude felt that she had hardly expected him to kiss her as he was burning to do under other colours than those of cousinship  he could not perceive the least sign that sue regarded him as a lover or ever would do so now that she knew the worst of him even if he had the right to behave as one and this helped on his growing resolve to tell her of his matrimonial entanglement which he had put off doing from time to time in sheer dread of losing the bliss of her company  sue came out into the town with him and they walked and talked with tongues centred only on the passing moments  jude said he would like to buy her a little present of some sort and then she confessed with something of shame that she was dreadfully hungry  they were kept on very short allowances in the college and a dinner tea and supper all in one was the present she most desired in the world jude thereupon took her to an inn and ordered whatever the house afforded which was not much  the place however gave them a delightful opportunity for a têteàtête nobody else being in the room and they talked freely  she told him about the school as it was at that date and the rough living and the mixed character of her fellowstudents gathered together from all parts of the diocese and how she had to get up and work by gaslight in the early morning with all the bitterness of a young person to whom restraint was new  to all this he listened but it was not what he wanted especially to knowher relations with phillotson  that was what she did not tell  when they had sat and eaten jude impulsively placed his hand upon hers she looked up and smiled and took his quite freely into her own little soft one dividing his fingers and coolly examining them as if they were the fingers of a glove she was purchasing  your hands are rather rough jude arent they she said  yes  so would yours be if they held a mallet and chisel all day  i dont dislike it you know  i think it is noble to see a mans hands subdued to what he works in  well im rather glad i came to this trainingschool after all  see how independent i shall be after the two years training  i shall pass pretty high i expect and mr phillotson will use his influence to get me a big school  she had touched the subject at last  i had a suspicion a fear said jude that hecared about you rather warmly and perhaps wanted to marry you  now dont be such a silly boy  he has said something about it i expect  if he had what would it matter  an old man like him  oh come sue hes not so very old  and i know what i saw him doing  not kissing methat im certain  no but putting his arm round your waist  ahi remember  but i didnt know he was going to  you are wriggling out if it sue and it isnt quite kind  her eversensitive lip began to quiver and her eye to blink at something this reproof was deciding her to say  i know youll be angry if i tell you everything and thats why i dont want to  very well then dear he said soothingly  i have no real right to ask you and i dont wish to know  i shall tell you said she with the perverseness that was part of her  this is what i have done i have promisedi have promisedthat i will marry him when i come out of the trainingschool two years hence and have got my certificate his plan being that we shall then take a large double school in a great townhe the boys and i the girlsas married schoolteachers often do and make a good income between us  oh sue   but of course it is rightyou couldnt have done better  he glanced at her and their eyes met the reproach in his own belying his words  then he drew his hand quite away from hers and turned his face in estrangement from her to the window  sue regarded him passively without moving  i knew you would be angry she said with an air of no emotion whatever  very welli am wrong i suppose  i ought not to have let you come to see me  we had better not meet again and well only correspond at long intervals on purely business matters  this was just the one thing he would not be able to bear as she probably knew and it brought him round at once  oh yes we will he said quickly  your being engaged can make no difference to me whatever  i have a perfect right to see you when i want to and i shall  then dont let us talk of it any more  it is quite spoiling our evening together  what does it matter about what one is going to do two years hence  she was something of a riddle to him and he let the subject drift away  shall we go and sit in the cathedral he asked when their meal was finished  cathedral  yes  though i think id rather sit in the railway station she answered a remnant of vexation still in her voice thats the centre of the town life now  the cathedral has had its day  how modern you are  so would you be if you had lived so much in the middle ages as i have done these last few years  the cathedral was a very good place four or five centuries ago but it is played out now  i am not modern either  i am more ancient than mediævalism if you only knew  jude looked distressed  therei wont say any more of that she cried  only you dont know how bad i am from your point of view or you wouldnt think so much of me or care whether i was engaged or not  now theres just time for us to walk round the close then i must go in or i shall be locked out for the night  he took her to the gate and they parted  jude had a conviction that his unhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this marriage engagement and it did anything but add to his happiness her reproach had taken that shape then and not the shape of words however next day he set about seeking employment which it was not so easy to get as at christminster there being as a rule less stonecutting in progress in this quiet city and hands being mostly permanent  but he edged himself in by degrees  his first work was some carving at the cemetery on the hill and ultimately he became engaged on the labour he most desiredthe cathedral repairs which were very extensive the whole interior stonework having been overhauled to be largely replaced by new  it might be a labour of years to get it all done and he had confidence enough in his own skill with the mallet and chisel to feel that it would be a matter of choice with himself how long he would stay  the lodgings he took near the close gate would not have disgraced a curate the rent representing a higher percentage on his wages than mechanics of any sort usually care to pay  his combined bed and sittingroom was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories and deaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in her time and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece inscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same seriousminded woman by her fellowservants on the occasion of her marriage  jude added to the furniture of his room by unpacking photographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he had executed with his own hands and he was deemed a satisfactory acquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment  he found an ample supply of theological books in the city bookshops and with these his studies were recommenced in a different spirit and direction from his former course  as a relaxation from the fathers and such stock works as paley and butler he read newman pusey and many other modern lights  he hired a harmonium set it up in his lodging and practised chants thereon single and double    ii   tomorrow is our grand day you know  where shall we go  i have leave from three till nine  wherever we can get to and come back from in that time  not ruins judei dont care for them  wellwardour castle  and then we can do fonthill if we likeall in the same afternoon  wardour is gothic ruinsand i hate gothic  no  quite otherwise  it is a classic buildingcorinthian i think with a lot of pictures  ahthat will do  i like the sound of corinthian  well go  their conversation had run thus some few weeks later and next morning they prepared to start  every detail of the outing was a facet reflecting a sparkle to jude and he did not venture to meditate on the life of inconsistency he was leading  his sues conduct was one lovely conundrum to him he could say no more  there duly came the charm of calling at the college door for her her emergence in a nunlike simplicity of costume that was rather enforced than desired the traipsing along to the station the porters byour leave the screaming of the trainseverything formed the basis of a beautiful crystallization  nobody stared at sue because she was so plainly dressed which comforted jude in the thought that only himself knew the charms those habiliments subdued  a matter of ten pounds spent in a draperyshop which had no connection with her real life or her real self would have set all melchester staring  the guard of the train thought they were lovers and put them into a compartment all by themselves  thats a good intention wasted said she  jude did not respond  he thought the remark unnecessarily cruel and partly untrue  they reached the park and castle and wandered through the picturegalleries jude stopping by preference in front of the devotional pictures by del sarto guido reni spagnoletto sassoferrato carlo dolci and others  sue paused patiently beside him and stole critical looks into his face as regarding the virgins holy families and saints it grew reverent and abstracted when she had thoroughly estimated him at this she would move on and wait for him before a lely or reynolds  it was evident that her cousin deeply interested her as one might be interested in a man puzzling out his way along a labyrinth from which one had ones self escaped  when they came out a long time still remained to them and jude proposed that as soon as they had had something to eat they should walk across the high country to the north of their present position and intercept the train of another railway leading back to melchester at a station about seven miles off  sue who was inclined for any adventure that would intensify the sense of her days freedom readily agreed and away they went leaving the adjoining station behind them  it was indeed open country wide and high  they talked and bounded on jude cutting from a little covert a long walkingstick for sue as tall as herself with a great crook which made her look like a shepherdess  about halfway on their journey they crossed a main road running due east and westthe old road from london to lands end  they paused and looked up and down it for a moment and remarked upon the desolation which had come over this once lively thoroughfare while the wind dipped to earth and scooped straws and haystems from the ground  they crossed the road and passed on but during the next halfmile sue seemed to grow tired and jude began to be distressed for her they had walked a good distance altogether and if they could not reach the other station it would be rather awkward  for a long time there was no cottage visible on the wide expanse of down and turnipland but presently they came to a sheepfold and next to the shepherd pitching hurdles  he told them that the only house near was his mothers and his pointing to a little dip ahead from which a faint blue smoke arose and recommended them to go on and rest there  this they did and entered the house admitted by an old woman without a single tooth to whom they were as civil as strangers can be when their only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of the householder  a nice little cottage said jude  oh i dont know about the niceness  i shall have to thatch it soon and where the thatch is to come from i cant tell for straw do get that dear that twill soon be cheaper to cover your house wi chainey plates than thatch  they sat resting and the shepherd came in  dont ee mind i he said with a deprecating wave of the hand bide here as long as ye will  but mid you be thinking o getting back to melchester tonight by train  because youll never do it in this world since you dont know the lie of the country  i dont mind going with ye some o the ways but even then the train mid be gone  they started up  you can bide here you know over the nightcant em mother the place is welcome to ye  tis hard lying rather but volk may do worse  he turned to jude and asked privately be you a married couple  hshno said jude  ohi meant nothing badynot i  well then she can go into mothers room and you and i can lie in the outer chimmer after theyve gone through  i can call ye soon enough to catch the first train back  youve lost this one now  on consideration they decided to close with this offer and drew up and shared with the shepherd and his mother the boiled bacon and greens for supper  i rather like this said sue while their entertainers were clearing away the dishes  outside all laws except gravitation and germination  you only think you like it you dont you are quite a product of civilization said jude a recollection of her engagement reviving his soreness a little  indeed i am not jude  i like reading and all that but i crave to get back to the life of my infancy and its freedom  do you remember it so well  you seem to me to have nothing unconventional at all about you  oh havent i  you dont know whats inside me  what  the ishmaelite  an urban miss is what you are  she looked severe disagreement and turned away  the shepherd aroused them the next morning as he had said  it was bright and clear and the four miles to the train were accomplished pleasantly  when they had reached melchester and walked to the close and the gables of the old building in which she was again to be immured rose before sues eyes she looked a little scared  i expect i shall catch it she murmured  they rang the great bell and waited  oh i bought something for you which i had nearly forgotten she said quickly searching her pocket  it is a new little photograph of me  would you like it  would i  he took it gladly and the porter came  there seemed to be an ominous glance on his face when he opened the gate  she passed in looking back at jude and waving her hand    iii   the seventy young women of ages varying in the main from nineteen to oneandtwenty though several were older who at this date filled the species of nunnery known as the trainingschool at melchester formed a very mixed community which included the daughters of mechanics curates surgeons shopkeepers farmers dairymen soldiers sailors and villagers  they sat in the large schoolroom of the establishment on the evening previously described and word was passed round that sue bridehead had not come in at closingtime  she went out with her young man said a secondyears student who knew about young men  and miss traceley saw her at the station with him  shell have it hot when she does come  she said he was her cousin observed a youthful new girl  that excuse has been made a little too often in this school to be effectual in saving our souls said the head girl of the year drily  the fact was that only twelve months before there had occurred a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same statement in order to gain meetings with her lover  the affair had created a scandal and the management had consequently been rough on cousins ever since  at nine oclock the names were called sues being pronounced three times sonorously by miss traceley without eliciting an answer  at a quarter past nine the seventy stood up to sing the evening hymn and then knelt down to prayers  after prayers they went in to supper and every girls thought was where is sue bridehead  some of the students who had seen jude from the window felt that they would not mind risking her punishment for the pleasure of being kissed by such a kindlyfaced young men  hardly one among them believed in the cousinship  half an hour later they all lay in their cubicles their tender feminine faces upturned to the flaring gasjets which at intervals stretched down the long dormitories every face bearing the legend the weaker upon it as the penalty of the sex wherein they were moulded which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and abilities could be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature remain what they are  they formed a pretty suggestive pathetic sight of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious and would not discover till amid the storms and strains of afteryears with their injustice loneliness childbearing and bereavement their minds would revert to this experience as to something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently regarded  one of the mistresses came in to turn out the lights and before doing so gave a final glance at sues cot which remained empty and at her little dressingtable at the foot which like all the rest was ornamented with various girlish trifles framed photographs being not the least conspicuous among them  sues table had a moderate show two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together beside her lookingglass  who are these mendid she ever say asked the mistress  strictly speaking relations portraits only are allowed on these tables you know  onethe middleaged man said a student in the next bedis the schoolmaster she served undermr phillotson  and the otherthis undergraduate in cap and gownwho is he  he is a friend or was  she has never told his name  was it either of these two who came for her  no  you are sure twas not the undergraduate  quite  he was a young man with a black beard  the lights were promptly extinguished and till they fell asleep the girls indulged in conjectures about sue and wondered what games she had carried on in london and at christminster before she came here some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral opposite and the spire rising behind it  when they awoke the next morning they glanced into sues nook to find it still without a tenant  after the early lessons by gaslight in halftoilet and when they had come up to dress for breakfast the bell of the entrance gate was heard to ring loudly the mistress of the dormitory went away and presently came back to say that the principals orders were that nobody was to speak to bridehead without permission  when accordingly sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy herself looking flushed and tired she went to her cubicle in silence none of them coming out to greet her or to make inquiry when they had gone downstairs they found that she did not follow them into the dininghall to breakfast and they then learnt that she had been severely reprimanded and ordered to a solitary room for a week there to be confined and take her meals and do all her reading  at this the seventy murmured the sentence being they thought too severe  a round robin was prepared and sent in to the principal asking for a remission of sues punishment  no notice was taken towards evening when the geography mistress began dictating her subject the girls in the class sat with folded arms  you mean that you are not going to work said the mistress at last i may as well tell you that it has been ascertained that the young man bridehead stayed out with was not her cousin for the very good reason that she has no such relative  we have written to christminster to ascertain  we are willing to take her word said the head girl  this young man was discharged from his work at christminster for drunkenness and blasphemy in publichouses and he has come here to live entirely to be near her  however they remained stolid and motionless and the mistress left the room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done  presently towards dusk the pupils as they sat heard exclamations from the firstyears girls in an adjoining classroom and one rushed in to say that sue bridehead had got out of the back window of the room in which she had been confined escaped in the dark across the lawn and disappeared  how she had managed to get out of the garden nobody could tell as it was bounded by the river at the bottom and the side door was locked  they went and looked at the empty room the casement between the middle mullions of which stood open  the lawn was again searched with a lantern every bush and shrub being examined but she was nowhere hidden  then the porter of the front gate was interrogated and on reflection he said that he remembered hearing a sort of splashing in the stream at the back but he had taken no notice thinking some ducks had come down the river from above  she must have walked through the river said a mistress  or drownded herself said the porter  the mind of the matron was horrifiednot so much at the possible death of sue as at the possible halfcolumn detailing that event in all the newspapers which added to the scandal of the year before would give the college an unenviable notoriety for many months to come  more lanterns were procured and the river examined and then at last on the opposite shore which was open to the fields some little boottracks were discerned in the mud which left no doubt that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water reaching nearly to her shouldersfor this was the chief river of the county and was mentioned in all the geography books with respect as sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself the matron began to speak superciliously of her and to express gladness that she was gone  on the selfsame evening jude sat in his lodgings by the close gate often at this hour after dusk he would enter the silent close and stand opposite the house that contained sue and watch the shadows of the girls heads passing to and fro upon the blinds and wish he had nothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many of the thoughtless inmates despised  but tonight having finished tea and brushed himself up he was deep in the perusal of the twentyninth volume of puseys library of the fathers a set of books which he had purchased of a secondhand dealer at a price that seemed to him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work he fancied he heard something rattle lightly against his window then he heard it again  certainly somebody had thrown gravel  he rose and gently lifted the sash  jude from below  sue  yesit is  can i come up without being seen  oh yes  then dont come down  shut the window  jude waited knowing that she could enter easily enough the front door being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn as in most old country towns  he palpitated at the thought that she had fled to him in her trouble as he had fled to her in his what counterparts they were  he unlatched the door of his room heard a stealthy rustle on the dark stairs and in a moment she appeared in the light of his lamp  he went up to seize her hand and found she was clammy as a marine deity and that her clothes clung to her like the robes upon the figures in the parthenon frieze  im so cold she said through her chattering teeth  can i come by your fire jude  she crossed to his little grate and very little fire but as the water dripped from her as she moved the idea of drying herself was absurd  whatever have you done darling he asked with alarm the tender epithet slipping out unawares  walked through the largest river in the countythats what ive done  they locked me up for being out with you and it seemed so unjust that i couldnt bear it so i got out of the window and escaped across the stream  she had begun the explanation in her usual slightly independent tones but before she had finished the thin pink lips trembled and she could hardly refrain from crying  dear sue he said  you must take off all your things  and let me seeyou must borrow some from the landlady ill ask her  no no  dont let her know for gods sake  we are so near the school that theyll come after me  then you must put on mine  you dont mind  oh no  my sunday suit you know  it is close here  in fact everything was close and handy in judes single chamber because there was not room for it to be otherwise  he opened a drawer took out his best dark suit and giving the garments a shake said now how long shall i give you  ten minutes  jude left the room and went into the street where he walked up and down  a clock struck halfpast seven and he returned  sitting in his only armchair he saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as himself on a sunday so pathetic in her defencelessness that his heart felt big with the sense of it  on two other chairs before the fire were her wet garments she blushed as he sat down beside her but only for a moment  i suppose jude it is odd that you should see me like this and all my things hanging there  yet what nonsense  they are only a womans clothessexless cloth and linen  i wish i didnt feel so ill and sick  will you dry my clothes now  please do jude and ill get a lodging by and by  it is not late yet  no you shant if you are ill  you must stay here  dear dear sue what can i get for you  i dont know  i cant help shivering  i wish i could get warm jude put on her his greatcoat in addition and then ran out to the nearest publichouse whence he returned with a little bottle in his hand  heres six of best brandy he said  now you drink it dear all of it  i cant out of the bottle can i  jude fetched the glass from the dressingtable and administered the spirit in some water  she gasped a little but gulped it down and lay back in the armchair  she then began to relate circumstantially her experiences since they had parted but in the middle of her story her voice faltered her head nodded and she ceased  she was in a sound sleep  jude dying of anxiety lest she should have caught a chill which might permanently injure her was glad to hear the regular breathing  he softly went nearer to her and observed that a warm flush now rosed her hitherto blue cheeks and felt that her hanging hand was no longer cold  then he stood with his back to the fire regarding her and saw in her almost a divinity    iv   judes reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending the stairs  he whisked sues clothing from the chair where it was drying thrust it under the bed and sat down to his book  somebody knocked and opened the door immediately  it was the landlady  oh i didnt know whether you was in or not mr fawley  i wanted to know if you would require supper  i see youve a young gentleman  yes maam but i think i wont come down tonight will you bring supper up on a tray and ill have a cup of tea as well  it was judes custom to go downstairs to the kitchen and eat his meals with the family to save trouble  his landlady brought up the supper however on this occasion and he took it from her at the door  when she had descended he set the teapot on the hob and drew out sues clothes anew but they were far from dry  a thick woollen gown he found held a deal of water  so he hung them up again and enlarged his fire and mused as the steam from the garments went up the chimney  suddenly she said jude  yes  all right  how do you feel now  better  quite well  why i fell asleep didnt i  what time is it  not late surely  it is past ten  is it really  what shall i do she said starting up  stay where you are  yes thats what i want to do  but i dont know what they would say  and what will you do  i am going to sit here by the fire all night and read  tomorrow is sunday and i havent to go out anywhere  perhaps you will be saved a severe illness by resting there  dont be frightened  im all right  look here what i have got for you  some supper  when she had sat upright she breathed plaintively and said i do feel rather weak still  i thought i was well and i ought not to be here ought i  but the supper fortified her somewhat and when she had had some tea and had lain back again she was bright and cheerful  the tea must have been green or too long drawn for she seemed preternaturally wakeful afterwards though jude who had not taken any began to feel heavy till her conversation fixed his attention  you called me a creature of civilization or something didnt you she said breaking a silence  it was very odd you should have done that  why  well because it is provokingly wrong  i am a sort of negation of it  you are very philosophical  a negation is profound talking  is it  do i strike you as being learned she asked with a touch of raillery  nonot learned  only you dont talk quite like a girlwell a girl who has had no advantages  i have had advantages  i dont know latin and greek though i know the grammars of those tongues  but i know most of the greek and latin classics through translations and other books too  i read lemprière catullus martial juvenal lucian beaumont and fletcher boccaccio scarron de brantôme sterne de foe smollett fielding shakespeare the bible and other such and found that all interest in the unwholesome part of those books ended with its mystery  you have read more than i he said with a sigh  how came you to read some of those queerer ones  well she said thoughtfully it was by accident  my life has been entirely shaped by what people call a peculiarity in me  i have no fear of men as such nor of their books i have mixed with themone or two of them particularlyalmost as one of their own sex  i mean i have not felt about them as most women are taught to feelto be on their guard against attacks on their virtue for no average manno man short of a sensual savagewill molest a woman by day or night at home or abroad unless she invites him  until she says by a look come on he is always afraid to and if you never say it or look it he never comes  however what i was going to say is that when i was eighteen i formed a friendly intimacy with an undergraduate at christminster and he taught me a great deal and lent me books which i should never have got hold of otherwise  is your friendship broken off  oh yes  he died poor fellow two or three years after he had taken his degree and left christminster  you saw a good deal of him i suppose  yes  we used to go about togetheron walking tours reading tours and things of that sortlike two men almost  he asked me to live with him and i agreed to by letter  but when i joined him in london i found he meant a different thing from what i meant  he wanted me to be his mistress in fact but i wasnt in love with himand on my saying i should go away if he didnt agree to my plan he did so  we shared a sittingroom for fifteen months and he became a leaderwriter for one of the great london dailies till he was taken ill and had to go abroad  he said i was breaking his heart by holding out against him so long at such close quarters he could never have believed it of woman  i might play that game once too often he said  he came home merely to die  his death caused a terrible remorse in me for my crueltythough i hope he died of consumption and not of me entirely  i went down to sandbourne to his funeral and was his only mourner  he left me a little moneybecause i broke his heart i suppose  thats how men areso much better than women  good heavenswhat did you do then  ahnow you are angry with me she said a contralto note of tragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice  i wouldnt have told you if i had known  no i am not  tell me all  well i invested his money poor fellow in a bubble scheme and lost it  i lived about london by myself for some time and then i returned to christminster as my father who was also in london and had started as an art metalworker near longacrewouldnt have me back and i got that occupation in the artistshop where you found me  i said you didnt know how bad i was  jude looked round upon the armchair and its occupant as if to read more carefully the creature he had given shelter to  his voice trembled as he said however you have lived sue i believe you are as innocent as you are unconventional  i am not particularly innocent as you see now that i have                              twitched the robe    from that blank layfigure your fancy draped   said she with an ostensible sneer though he could hear that she was brimming with tears  but i have never yielded myself to any lover if thats what you mean  i have remained as i began  i quite believe you  but some women would not have remained as they began  perhaps not  better women would not  people say i must be coldnaturedsexlesson account of it  but i wont have it some of the most passionately erotic poets have been the most selfcontained in their daily lives  have you told mr phillotson about this university scholar friend  yeslong ago  i have never made any secret of it to anybody  what did he say  he did not pass any criticismonly said i was everything to him whatever i did and things like that  jude felt much depressed she seemed to get further and further away from him with her strange ways and curious unconsciousness of gender  arent you really vexed with me dear jude she suddenly asked in a voice of such extraordinary tenderness that it hardly seemed to come from the same woman who had just told her story so lightly  i would rather offend anybody in the world than you i think  i dont know whether i am vexed or not  i know i care very much about you  i care as much for you as for anybody i ever met  you dont care more  there i ought not to say that  dont answer it  there was another long silence  he felt that she was treating him cruelly though he could not quite say in what way  her very helplessness seemed to make her so much stronger than he  i am awfully ignorant on general matters although i have worked so hard he said to turn the subject  i am absorbed in theology you know  and what do you think i should be doing just about now if you werent here  i should be saying my evening prayers  i suppose you wouldnt like  oh no no she answered i would rather not if you dont mind i should seem sosuch a hypocrite  i thought you wouldnt join so i didnt propose it  you must remember that i hope to be a useful minister some day  to be ordained i think you said  yes  then you havent given up the ideai thought that perhaps you had by this time  of course not  i fondly thought at first that you felt as i do about that as you were so mixed up in christminster anglicanism and mr phillotson  i have no respect for christminster whatever except in a qualified degree on its intellectual side said sue bridehead earnestly  my friend i spoke of took that out of me  he was the most irreligious man i ever knew and the most moral  and intellect at christminster is new wine in old bottles  the mediævalism of christminster must go be sloughed off or christminster itself will have to go  to be sure at times one couldnt help having a sneaking liking for the traditions of the old faith as preserved by a section of the thinkers there in touching and simple sincerity but when i was in my saddest rightest mind i always felt      o ghastly glories of saints dead limbs of gibbeted gods   sue you are not a good friend of mine to talk like that  then i wont dear jude  the emotional throatnote had come back and she turned her face away  i still think christminster has much that is glorious though i was resentful because i couldnt get there  he spoke gently and resisted his impulse to pique her on to tears  it is an ignorant place except as to the townspeople artizans drunkards and paupers she said perverse still at his differing from her  they see life as it is of course but few of the people in the colleges do  you prove it in your own person  you are one of the very men christminster was intended for when the colleges were founded a man with a passion for learning but no money or opportunities or friends  but you were elbowed off the pavement by the millionaires sons  well i can do without what it confers  i care for something higher  and i for something broader truer she insisted  at present intellect in christminster is pushing one way and religion the other and so they stand stockstill like two rams butting each other  what would mr phillotson  it is a place full of fetishists and ghostseers  he noticed that whenever he tried to speak of the schoolmaster she turned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending university  jude was extremely morbidly curious about her life as phillotsons protégée and betrothed yet she would not enlighten him  well thats just what i am too he said  i am fearful of life spectreseeing always  but you are good and dear she murmured  his heart bumped and he made no reply  you are in the tractarian stage just now are you not she added putting on flippancy to hide real feeling a common trick with her let me seewhen was i there  in the year eighteen hundred and  theres a sarcasm in that which is rather unpleasant to me sue now will you do what i want you to  at this time i read a chapter and then say prayers as i told you  now will you concentrate your attention on any book of these you like and sit with your back to me and leave me to my custom  you are sure you wont join me  ill look at you  no dont tease sue  very wellill do just as you bid me and i wont vex you jude she replied in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever after turning her back upon him accordingly  a small bible other than the one he was using lay near her and during his retreat she took it up and turned over the leaves  jude she said brightly when he had finished and come back to her will you let me make you a new new testament like the one i made for myself at christminster  oh yes  how was that made  i altered my old one by cutting up all the epistles and gospels into separate brochures and rearranging them in chronological order as written beginning the book with thessalonians following on with the epistles and putting the gospels much further on  then i had the volume rebound  my university friend mrbut never mind his name poor boysaid it was an excellent idea  i know that reading it afterwards made it twice as interesting as before and twice as understandable  hm said jude with a sense of sacrilege  and what a literary enormity this is she said as she glanced into the pages of solomons song  i mean the synopsis at the head of each chapter explaining away the real nature of that rhapsody you neednt be alarmed nobody claims inspiration for the chapter headings  indeed many divines treat them with contempt  it seems the drollest thing to think of the fourandtwenty elders or bishops or whatever number they were sitting with long faces and writing down such stuff  jude looked pained  you are quite voltairean he murmured  indeed  then i wont say any more except that people have no right to falsify the bible  i hate such humbug as could attempt to plaster over with ecclesiastical abstractions such ecstatic natural human love as lies in that great and passionate song  her speech had grown spirited and almost petulant at his rebuke and her eyes moist  i wish i had a friend here to support me but nobody is ever on my side  but my dear sue my very dear sue i am not against you he said taking her hand and surprised at her introducing personal feeling into mere argument  yes you are yes you are she cried turning away her face that he might not see her brimming eyes  you are on the side of the people in the trainingschoolat least you seem almost to be  what i insist on is that to explain such verses as this whither is thy beloved gone o thou fairest among women by the note the church professeth her faith is supremely ridiculous  well then let it be  you make such a personal matter of everything  i amonly too inclined just now to apply the words profanely  you know you are fairest among women to me come to that  but you are not to say it now  sue replied her voice changing to its softest note of severity  then their eyes met and they shook hands like cronies in a tavern and jude saw the absurdity of quarrelling on such a hypothetical subject and she the silliness of crying about what was written in an old book like the bible  i wont disturb your convictionsi really wont she went on soothingly for now he was rather more ruffled than she  but i did want and long to ennoble some man to high aims and when i saw you and knew you wanted to be my comrade ishall i confess itthought that man might be you  but you take so much tradition on trust that i dont know what to say  well dear i suppose one must take some things on trust  life isnt long enough to work out everything in euclid problems before you believe it  i take christianity  well perhaps you might take something worse  indeed i might  perhaps i have done so  he thought of arabella  i wont ask what because we are going to be very nice with each other arent we and never never vex each other any more  she looked up trustfully and her voice seemed trying to nestle in his breast  i shall always care for you said jude  and i for you  because you are singlehearted and forgiving to your faulty and tiresome little sue  he looked away for that epicene tenderness of hers was too harrowing  was it that which had broken the heart of the poor leaderwriter and was he to be the next one   but sue was so dear   if he could only get over the sense of her sex as she seemed to be able to do so easily of his what a comrade she would make for their difference of opinion on conjectural subjects only drew them closer together on matters of daily human experience  she was nearer to him than any other woman he had ever met and he could scarcely believe that time creed or absence would ever divide him from her  but his grief at her incredulities returned  they sat on till she fell asleep again and he nodded in his chair likewise  whenever he aroused himself he turned her things and made up the fire anew about six oclock he awoke completely and lighting a candle found that her clothes were dry  her chair being a far more comfortable one than his she still slept on inside his greatcoat looking warm as a new bun and boyish as a ganymede  placing the garments by her and touching her on the shoulder he went downstairs and washed himself by starlight in the yard    v   when he returned she was dressed as usual  now could i get out without anybody seeing me she asked  the town is not yet astir  but you have had no breakfast  oh i dont want any  i fear i ought not to have run away from that school  things seem so different in the cold light of morning dont they  what mr phillotson will say i dont know  it was quite by his wish that i went there  he is the only man in the world for whom i have any respect or fear  i hope hell forgive me but hell scold me dreadfully i expect  ill go to him and explain began jude  oh no you shant i dont care for him  he may think what he likesi shall do just as i choose  but you just this moment said  well if i did i shall do as i like for all him  i have thought of what i shall dogo to the sister of one of my fellowstudents in the trainingschool who has asked me to visit her  she has a school near shaston about eighteen miles from hereand i shall stay there till this has blown over and i get back to the trainingschool again  at the last moment he persuaded her to let him make her a cup of coffee in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising to go to his work every day before the household was astir  now a dewbit to eat with it he said and off we go  you can have a regular breakfast when you get there  they went quietly out of the house jude accompanying her to the station  as they departed along the street a head was thrust out of an upper window of his lodging and quickly withdrawn  sue still seemed sorry for her rashness and to wish she had not rebelled telling him at parting that she would let him know as soon as she got readmitted to the trainingschool  they stood rather miserably together on the platform and it was apparent that he wanted to say more  i want to tell you somethingtwo things he said hurriedly as the train came up  one is a warm one the other a cold one  jude she said  i know one of them  and you mustnt  what  you mustnt love me  you are to like methats all  judes face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was agitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage window  and then the train moved on and waving her pretty hand to him she vanished away    melchester was a dismal place enough for jude that sunday of her departure and the close so hateful that he did not go once to the cathedral services  the next morning there came a letter from her which with her usual promptitude she had written directly she had reached her friends house  she told him of her safe arrival and comfortable quarters and then added      what i really write about dear jude is something i said    to you at parting  you had been so very good and kind to    me that when you were out of sight i felt what a cruel and    ungrateful woman i was to say it and it has reproached me    ever since  if you want to love me jude you may i dont    mind at all and ill never say again that you mustnt     now i wont write any more about that  you do forgive your    thoughtless friend for her cruelty and wont make her    miserable by saying you dontever     sue   it would be superfluous to say what his answer was and how he thought what he would have done had he been free which should have rendered a long residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for sue  he felt he might have been pretty sure of his own victory if it had come to a conflict between phillotson and himself for the possession of her  yet jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to sues impulsive note than it really was intended to bear  after the lapse of a few days he found himself hoping that she would write again  but he received no further communication and in the intensity of his solicitude he sent another note suggesting that he should pay her a visit some sunday the distance being under eighteen miles  he expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his missive but none came  the third morning arrived the postman did not stop  this was saturday and in a feverish state of anxiety about her he sent off three brief lines stating that he was coming the following day for he felt sure something had happened  his first and natural thought had been that she was ill from her immersion but it soon occurred to him that somebody would have written for her in such a case  conjectures were put an end to by his arrival at the village schoolhouse near shaston on the bright morning of sunday between eleven and twelve oclock when the parish was as vacant as a desert most of the inhabitants having gathered inside the church whence their voices could occasionally be heard in unison  a little girl opened the door  miss bridehead is upstairs she said  and will you please walk up to her  is she ill asked jude hastily  only a littlenot very  jude entered and ascended  on reaching the landing a voice told him which way to turnthe voice of sue calling his name  he passed the doorway and found her lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet square  oh sue he cried sitting down beside her and taking her hand how is this  you couldnt write  noit wasnt that she answered  i did catch a bad coldbut i could have written  only i wouldnt  why notfrightening me like this  yesthat was what i was afraid of  but i had decided not to write to you any more  they wont have me back at the schoolthats why i couldnt write  not the fact but the reason  well  they not only wont have me but they gave me a parting piece of advice  what  she did not answer directly  i vowed i never would tell you judeit is so vulgar and distressing  is it about us  yes  but do tell me  wellsomebody has sent them baseless reports about us and they say you and i ought to marry as soon as possible for the sake of my reputation   therenow i have told you and i wish i hadnt  oh poor sue  i dont think of you like that means  it did just occur to me to regard you in the way they think i do but i hadnt begun to  i have recognized that the cousinship was merely nominal since we met as total strangers  but my marrying you dear judewhy of course if i had reckoned upon marrying you i shouldnt have come to you so often  and i never supposed you thought of such a thing as marrying me till the other evening when i began to fancy you did love me a little  perhaps i ought not to have been so intimate with you  it is all my fault  everything is my fault always  the speech seemed a little forced and unreal and they regarded each other with a mutual distress  i was so blind at first she went on  i didnt see what you felt at all  oh you have been unkind to meyou haveto look upon me as a sweetheart without saying a word and leaving me to discover it myself  your attitude to me has become known and naturally they think weve been doing wrong  ill never trust you again  yes sue he said simply i am to blamemore than you think  i was quite aware that you did not suspect till within the last meeting or two what i was feeling about you  i admit that our meeting as strangers prevented a sense of relationship and that it was a sort of subterfuge to avail myself of it  but dont you think i deserve a little consideration for concealing my wrong very wrong sentiments since i couldnt help having them  she turned her eyes doubtfully towards him and then looked away as if afraid she might forgive him  by every law of nature and sex a kiss was the only rejoinder that fitted the mood and the moment under the suasion of which sues undemonstrative regard of him might not inconceivably have changed its temperature  some men would have cast scruples to the winds and ventured it oblivious both of sues declaration of her neutral feelings and of the pair of autographs in the vestry chest of arabellas parish church  jude did not  he had in fact come in part to tell his own fatal story  it was upon his lips yet at the hour of this distress he could not disclose it  he preferred to dwell upon the recognized barriers between them  of coursei know you dontcare about me in any particular way he sorrowed  you ought not and you are right  you belong tomr phillotson  i suppose he has been to see you  yes she said shortly her face changing a little  though i didnt ask him to come  you are glad of course that he has been but i shouldnt care if he didnt come any more  it was very perplexing to her lover that she should be piqued at his honest acquiescence in his rival if judes feelings of love were deprecated by her  he went on to something else  this will blow over dear sue he said  the trainingschool authorities are not all the world  you can get to be a student in some other no doubt  ill ask mr phillotson she said decisively  sues kind hostess now returned from church and there was no more intimate conversation  jude left in the afternoon hopelessly unhappy  but he had seen her and sat with her  such intercourse as that would have to content him for the remainder of his life the lesson of renunciation it was necessary and proper that he as a parish priest should learn  but the next morning when he awoke he felt rather vexed with her and decided that she was rather unreasonable not to say capricious then in illustration of what he had begun to discern as one of her redeeming characteristics there came promptly a note which she must have written almost immediately he had gone from her      forgive me for my petulance yesterday  i was horrid to    you i know it and i feel perfectly miserable at my    horridness  it was so dear of you not to be angry  jude    please still keep me as your friend and associate with    all my faults  ill try not to be like it again     i am coming to melchester on saturday to get my things    away from the t s c  i could walk with you for half    an hour if you would likeyour repentant     sue   jude forgave her straightway and asked her to call for him at the cathedral works when she came    vi   meanwhile a middleaged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty concerning the writer of the above letter  he was richard phillotson who had recently removed from the mixed village school at lumsdon near christminster to undertake a large boys school in his native town of shaston which stood on a hill sixty miles to the southwest as the crow flies  a glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal that the schoolmasters plans and dreams so long indulged in had been abandoned for some new dream with which neither the church nor literature had much in common  essentially an unpractical man he was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purposethat of keeping a wife who if she chose might conduct one of the girls schools adjoining his own for which purpose he had advised her to go into training since she would not marry him offhand  about the time that jude was removing from marygreen to melchester and entering on adventures at the latter place with sue the schoolmaster was settling down in the new schoolhouse at shaston all the furniture being fixed the books shelved and the nails driven he had begun to sit in his parlour during the dark winter nights and reattempt some of his old studiesone branch of which had included romanbritannic antiquitiesan unremunerative labour for a national schoolmaster but a subject that after his abandonment of the university scheme had interested him as being a comparatively unworked mine practicable to those who like himself had lived in lonely spots where these remains were abundant and were seen to compel inferences in startling contrast to accepted views on the civilization of that time  a resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby of phillotson at presenthis ostensible reason for going alone into fields where causeways dykes and tumuli abounded or shutting himself up in his house with a few urns tiles and mosaics he had collected instead of calling round upon his new neighbours who for their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with him  but it was not the real or the whole reason after all thus on a particular evening in the month when it had grown quite lateto near midnight indeedand the light of his lamp shining from his window at a salient angle of the hilltop town over infinite miles of valley westward announced as by words a place and person given over to study he was not exactly studying  the interior of the roomthe books the furniture the schoolmasters loose coat his attitude at the table even the flickering of the fire bespoke the same dignified tale of undistracted researchmore than creditable to a man who had had no advantages beyond those of his own making  and yet the tale true enough till latterly was not true now  what he was regarding was not history  they were historic notes written in a bold womanly hand at his dictation some months before and it was the clerical rendering of word after word that absorbed him  he presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters few very few as correspondence counts nowadays  each was in its envelope just as it had arrived and the handwriting was of the same womanly character as the historic notes  he unfolded them one by one and read them musingly at first sight there seemed in these small documents to be absolutely nothing to muse over  they were straightforward frank letters signed sue b just such ones as would be written during short absences with no other thought than their speedy destruction and chiefly concerning books in reading and other experiences of a training school forgotten doubtless by the writer with the passing of the day of their inditing  in one of themquite a recent notethe young woman said that she had received his considerate letter and that it was honourable and generous of him to say he would not come to see her oftener than she desired the school being such an awkward place for callers and because of her strong wish that her engagement to him should not be known which it would infallibly be if he visited her often over these phrases the schoolmaster pored  what precise shade of satisfaction was to be gathered from a womans gratitude that the man who loved her had not been often to see her  the problem occupied him distracted him  he opened another drawer and found therein an envelope from which he drew a photograph of sue as a child long before he had known her standing under trelliswork with a little basket in her hand  there was another of her as a young woman her dark eyes and hair making a very distinct and attractive picture of her which just disclosed too the thoughtfulness that lay behind her lighter moods  it was a duplicate of the one she had given jude and would have given to any man  phillotson brought it halfway to his lips but withdrew it in doubt at her perplexing phrases ultimately kissing the dead pasteboard with all the passionateness and more than all the devotion of a young man of eighteen  the schoolmasters was an unhealthylooking oldfashioned face rendered more oldfashioned by his style of shaving  a certain gentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature suggesting an inherent wish to do rightly by all  his speech was a little slow but his tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect his greying hair was curly and radiated from a point in the middle of his crown  there were four lines across his forehead and he only wore spectacles when reading at night  it was almost certainly a renunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose rather than a distaste for women which had hitherto kept him from closing with one of the sex in matrimony  such silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many and oft times when he was not under the eye of the boys whose quick and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to the selfconscious master in his present anxious care for sue making him in the grey hours of morning dread to meet anew the gimlet glances lest they should read what the dream within him was  he had honourably acquiesced in sues announced wish that he was not often to visit her at the training school but at length his patience being sorely tried he set out one saturday afternoon to pay her an unexpected call  there the news of her departureexpulsion as it might almost have been consideredwas flashed upon him without warning or mitigation as he stood at the door expecting in a few minutes to behold her face and when he turned away he could hardly see the road before him  sue had in fact never written a line to her suitor on the subject although it was fourteen days old  a short reflection told him that this proved nothing a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for silence as any degree of blameworthiness  they had informed him at the school where she was living and having no immediate anxiety about her comfort his thoughts took the direction of a burning indignation against the training school committee  in his bewilderment phillotson entered the adjacent cathedral just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of the repairs  he sat down on a block of freestone regardless of the dusty imprint it made on his breeches and his listless eyes following the movements of the workmen he presently became aware that the reputed culprit sues lover jude was one amongst them  jude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the model of jerusalem  having inadvertently witnessed phillotsons tentative courtship of sue in the lane there had grown up in the younger mans mind a curious dislike to think of the elder to meet him to communicate in any way with him and since phillotsons success in obtaining at least her promise had become known to jude he had frankly recognized that he did not wish to see or hear of his senior any more learn anything of his pursuits or even imagine again what excellencies might appertain to his character  on this very day of the schoolmasters visit jude was expecting sue as she had promised and when therefore he saw the schoolmaster in the nave of the building saw moreover that he was coming to speak to him he felt no little embarrassment which phillotsons own embarrassment prevented his observing  jude joined him and they both withdrew from the other workmen to the spot where phillotson had been sitting  jude offered him a piece of sackcloth for a cushion and told him it was dangerous to sit on the bare block  yes yes said phillotson abstractedly as he reseated himself his eyes resting on the ground as if he were trying to remember where he was  i wont keep you long  it was merely that i have heard that you have seen my little friend sue recently  it occurred to me to speak to you on that account  i merely want to askabout her  i think i know what  jude hurriedly said  about her escaping from the training school and her coming to me  yes  welljude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to annihilate his rival at all cost  by the exercise of that treachery which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most honourable in every other relation of life he could send off phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true and that sue had irretrievably committed herself with him  but his action did not respond for a moment to his animal instinct and what he said was i am glad of your kindness in coming to talk plainly to me about it  you know what they saythat i ought to marry her  what  and i wish with all my soul i could  phillotson trembled and his naturally pale face acquired a corpselike sharpness in its lines  i had no idea that it was of this nature  god forbid  no no said jude aghast  i thought you understood  i mean that were i in a position to marry her or someone and settle down instead of living in lodgings here and there i should be glad  what he had really meant was simply that he loved her  butsince this painful matter has been opened upwhat really happened asked phillotson with the firmness of a man who felt that a sharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter cases arise and this is one when even ungenerous questions must be put to make false assumptions impossible and to kill scandal  jude explained readily giving the whole series of adventures including the night at the shepherds her wet arrival at his lodging her indisposition from her immersion their vigil of discussion and his seeing her off next morning  well now said phillotson at the conclusion i take it as your final word and i know i can believe you that the suspicion which led to her rustication is an absolutely baseless one  it is said jude solemnly  absolutely  so help me god  the schoolmaster rose  each of the twain felt that the interview could not comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent experiences after the manner of friends and when jude had taken him round and shown him some features of the renovation which the old cathedral was undergoing phillotson bade the young man goodday and went away  this visit took place about eleven oclock in the morning but no sue appeared  when jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved ahead of him in the street leading up from the north gate walking as if no way looking for him  speedily overtaking her he remarked that he had asked her to come to him at the cathedral and she had promised  i have been to get my things from the college she saidan observation which he was expected to take as an answer though it was not one  finding her to be in this evasive mood he felt inclined to give her the information so long withheld  you have not seen mr phillotson today he ventured to inquire  i have not  but i am not going to be crossexamined about him and if you ask anything more i wont answer  it is very odd that he stopped regarding her  what  that you are often not so nice in your real presence as you are in your letters  does it really seem so to you said she smiling with quick curiosity  well thats strange but i feel just the same about you jude  when you are gone away i seem such a coldhearted  as she knew his sentiment towards her jude saw that they were getting upon dangerous ground  it was now he thought that he must speak as an honest man  but he did not speak and she continued it was that which made me write and sayi didnt mind your loving meif you wanted to much  the exultation he might have felt at what that implied or seemed to imply was nullified by his intention and he rested rigid till he began i have never told you  yes you have murmured she  i mean i have never told you my historyall of it  but i guess it  i know nearly  jude looked up  could she possibly know of that morning performance of his with arabella which in a few months had ceased to be a marriage more completely than by death  he saw that she did not  i cant quite tell you here in the street he went on with a gloomy tongue  and you had better not come to my lodgings  let us go in here  the building by which they stood was the markethouse it was the only place available and they entered the market being over and the stalls and areas empty  he would have preferred a more congenial spot but as usually happens in place of a romantic field or solemn aisle for his tale it was told while they walked up and down over a floor littered with rotten cabbageleaves and amid all the usual squalors of decayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse  he began and finished his brief narrative which merely led up to the information that he had married a wife some years earlier and that his wife was living still  almost before her countenance had time to change she hurried out the words  why didnt you tell me before  i couldnt it seemed so cruel to tell it  to yourself jude  so it was better to be cruel to me  no dear darling cried jude passionately  he tried to take her hand but she withdrew it  their old relations of confidence seemed suddenly to have ended and the antagonisms of sex to sex were left without any counterpoising predilections  she was his comrade friend unconscious sweetheart no longer and her eyes regarded him in estranged silence  i was ashamed of the episode in my life which brought about the marriage he continued  i cant explain it precisely now  i could have done it if you had taken it differently  but how can i she burst out  here i have been saying or writing thatthat you might love me or something of the sortjust out of charityand all the timeoh it is perfectly damnable how things are she said stamping her foot in a nervous quiver  you take me wrong sue  i never thought you cared for me at all till quite lately so i felt it did not matter  do you care for me sueyou know how i meani dont like out of charity at all  it was a question which in the circumstances sue did not choose to answer  i suppose sheyour wifeisa very pretty woman even if shes wicked she asked quickly  shes pretty enough as far as that goes  prettier than i am no doubt  you are not the least alike  and i have never seen her for years  but shes sure to come backthey always do  how strange of you to stay apart from her like this said sue her trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony  you such a religious man  how will the demigods in your pantheoni mean those legendary persons you call saintsintercede for you after this now if i had done such a thing it would have been different and not remarkable for i at least dont regard marriage as a sacrament your theories are not so advanced as your practice  sue you are terribly cutting when you like to bea perfect voltaire  but you must treat me as you will  when she saw how wretched he was she softened and trying to blink away her sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness of a hearthurt woman ahyou should have told me before you gave me that idea that you wanted to be allowed to love me  i had no feeling before that moment at the railwaystation except  for once sue was as miserable as he in her attempts to keep herself free from emotion and her less than halfsuccess  dont cry dear he implored  i amnot cryingbecause i meant tolove you but because of your want ofconfidence  they were quite screened from the marketsquare without and he could not help putting out his arm towards her waist  his momentary desire was the means of her rallying  no no she said drawing back stringently and wiping her eyes  of course not  it would be hypocrisy to pretend that it would be meant as from my cousin and it cant be in any other way  they moved on a dozen paces and she showed herself recovered  it was distracting to jude and his heart would have ached less had she appeared anyhow but as she did appear essentially largeminded and generous on reflection despite a previous exercise of those narrow womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex  i dont blame you for what you couldnt help she said smiling how should i be so foolish  i do blame you a little bit for not telling me before  but after all it doesnt matter  we should have had to keep apart you see even if this had not been in your life  no we shouldnt sue  this is the only obstacle  you forget that i must have loved you and wanted to be your wife even if there had been no obstacle said sue with a gentle seriousness which did not reveal her mind  and then we are cousins and it is bad for cousins to marry  andi am engaged to somebody else  as to our going on together as we were going in a sort of friendly way the people round us would have made it unable to continue  their views of the relations of man and woman are limited as is proved by their expelling me from the school  their philosophy only recognizes relations based on animal desire  the wide field of strong attachment where desire plays at least only a secondary part is ignored by themthe part ofwho is itvenus urania  her being able to talk learnedly showed that she was mistress of herself again and before they parted she had almost regained her vivacious glance her reciprocity of tone her gay manner and her secondthought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her age and sex  he could speak more freely now  there were several reasons against my telling you rashly  one was what i have said another that it was always impressed upon me that i ought not to marrythat i belonged to an odd and peculiar familythe wrong breed for marriage  ahwho used to say that to you  my greataunt she said it always ended badly with us fawleys  thats strange  my father used to say the same to me  they stood possessed by the same thought ugly enough even as an assumption that a union between them had such been possible would have meant a terrible intensification of unfitnesstwo bitters in one dish  oh but there cant be anything in it she said with nervous lightness  our family have been unlucky of late years in choosing matesthats all  and then they pretended to persuade themselves that all that had happened was of no consequence and that they could still be cousins and friends and warm correspondents and have happy genial times when they met even if they met less frequently than before  their parting was in good friendship and yet judes last look into her eyes was tinged with inquiry for he felt that he did not even now quite know her mind    vii   tidings from sue a day or two after passed across jude like a withering blast  before reading the letter he was led to suspect that its contents were of a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the signaturewhich was in her full name never used in her correspondence with him since her first note      my dear judei have something to tell you which perhaps    you will not be surprised to hear though certainly it may    strike you as being accelerated as the railway companies    say of their trains mr phillotson and i are to be married    quite soonin three or four weeks  we had intended as you    know to wait till i had gone through my course of training    and obtained my certificate so as to assist him if    necessary in the teaching  but he generously says he does    not see any object in waiting now i am not at the training    school  it is so good of him because the awkwardness of my    situation has really come about by my fault in getting    expelled     wish me joy  remember i say you are to and you mustnt    refuseyour affectionate cousin     susanna florence mary bridehead   jude staggered under the news could eat no breakfast and kept on drinking tea because his mouth was so dry  then presently he went back to his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so confronted  everything seemed turning to satire  and yet what could the poor girl do he asked himself and felt worse than shedding tears  o susanna florence mary he said as he worked  you dont know what marriage means  could it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had pricked her on to this just as his visit to her when in liquor may have pricked her on to her engagement  to be sure there seemed to exist these other and sufficient reasons practical and social for her decision but sue was not a very practical or calculating person and he was compelled to think that a pique at having his secret sprung upon her had moved her to give way to phillotsons probable representations that the best course to prove how unfounded were the suspicions of the school authorities would be to marry him offhand as in fulfilment of an ordinary engagement  sue had in fact been placed in an awkward corner  poor sue  he determined to play the spartan to make the best of it and support her but he could not write the requested good wishes for a day or two  meanwhile there came another note from his impatient little dear      jude will you give me away  i have nobody else who could    do it so conveniently as you being the only married relation    i have here on the spot even if my father were friendly    enough to be willing which he isnt  i hope you wont think    it a trouble  i have been looking at the marriage service in    the prayerbook and it seems to me very humiliating that a    giveraway should be required at all  according to the    ceremony as there printed my bridegroom chooses me of his    own will and pleasure but i dont choose him  somebody    gives me to him like a sheass or shegoat or any other    domestic animal  bless your exalted views of woman o    churchman  but i forget i am no longer privileged to tease    youever     susanna florence mary bridehead   jude screwed himself up to heroic key and replied      my dear sueof course i wish you joy  and also of course    i will give you away  what i suggest is that as you have    no house of your own you do not marry from your school    friends but from mine  it would be more proper i think    since i am as you say the person nearest related to you in    this part of the world     i dont see why you sign your letter in such a new and    terribly formal way  surely you care a bit about me    stillever your affectionate     jude   what had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little sting he had been silent onthe phrase married relationwhat an idiot it made him seem as her lover  if sue had written that in satire he could hardly forgive her if in sufferingah that was another thing  his offer of his lodging must have commended itself to phillotson at any rate for the schoolmaster sent him a line of warm thanks accepting the convenience  sue also thanked him  jude immediately moved into more commodious quarters as much to escape the espionage of the suspicious landlady who had been one cause of sues unpleasant experience as for the sake of room  then sue wrote to tell him the day fixed for the wedding and jude decided after inquiry that she should come into residence on the following saturday which would allow of a ten days stay in the city prior to the ceremony sufficiently representing a nominal residence of fifteen  she arrived by the ten oclock train on the day aforesaid jude not going to meet her at the station by her special request that he should not lose a mornings work and pay she said if this were her true reason  but so well by this time did he know sue that the remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might he thought have weighed with her in this  when he came home to dinner she had taken possession of her apartment  she lived in the same house with him but on a different floor and they saw each other little an occasional supper being the only meal they took together when sues manner was something like that of a scared child  what she felt he did not know their conversation was mechanical though she did not look pale or ill  phillotson came frequently but mostly when jude was absent  on the morning of the wedding when jude had given himself a holiday sue and her cousin had breakfast together for the first and last time during this curious interval in his roomthe parlourwhich he had hired for the period of sues residence  seeing as women do how helpless he was in making the place comfortable she bustled about  whats the matter jude she said suddenly  he was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his hands looking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the tablecloth  ohnothing  you are father you know  thats what they call the man who gives you away  jude could have said phillotsons age entitles him to be called that  but he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort  she talked incessantly as if she dreaded his indulgence in reflection and before the meal was over both he and she wished they had not put such confidence in their new view of things and had taken breakfast apart  what oppressed jude was the thought that having done a wrong thing of this sort himself he was aiding and abetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing instead of imploring and warning her against it  it was on his tongue to say you have quite made up your mind  after breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual thought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging in unceremonious companionship  by the irony of fate and the curious trick in sues nature of tempting providence at critical times she took his arm as they walked through the muddy streeta thing she had never done before in her lifeand on turning the corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church with a lowpitched roofthe church of st thomas  thats the church said jude  where i am going to be married  yes  indeed she exclaimed with curiosity  how i should like to go in and see what the spot is like where i am so soon to kneel and do it  again he said to himself she does not realize what marriage means  he passively acquiesced in her wish to go in and they entered by the western door  the only person inside the gloomy building was a charwoman cleaning  sue still held judes arm almost as if she loved him  cruelly sweet indeed she had been to him that morning but his thoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an ache                              i can find no way    how a blow should fall such as falls on men    nor prove too much for your womanhood   they strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar railing which they stood against in silence turning then and walking down the nave again her hand still on his arm precisely like a couple just married  the too suggestive incident entirely of her making nearly broke down jude  i like to do things like this she said in the delicate voice of an epicure in emotions which left no doubt that she spoke the truth  i know you do said jude  they are interesting because they have probably never been done before  i shall walk down the church like this with my husband in about two hours shant i  no doubt you will  was it like this when you were married  good god suedont be so awfully merciless   there dear one i didnt mean it  ahyou are vexed she said regretfully as she blinked away an access of eye moisture  and i promised never to vex you   i suppose i ought not to have asked you to bring me in here  oh i oughtnt  i see it now  my curiosity to hunt up a new sensation always leads me into these scrapes  forgive me   you will wont you jude  the appeal was so remorseful that judes eyes were even wetter than hers as he pressed her hand for yes  now well hurry away and i wont do it any more she continued humbly and they came out of the building sue intending to go on to the station to meet phillotson  but the first person they encountered on entering the main street was the schoolmaster himself whose train had arrived sooner than sue expected  there was nothing really to demur to in her leaning on judes arm but she withdrew her hand and jude thought that phillotson had looked surprised  we have been doing such a funny thing said she smiling candidly weve been to the church rehearsing as it were  havent we jude  how said phillotson curiously  jude inwardly deplored what he thought to be unnecessary frankness but she had gone too far not to explain all which she accordingly did telling him how they had marched up to the altar  seeing how puzzled phillotson seemed jude said as cheerfully as he could i am going to buy her another little present  will you both come to the shop with me  no said sue ill go on to the house with him and requesting her lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster  jude soon joined them at his rooms and shortly after they prepared for the ceremony  phillotsons hair was brushed to a painful extent and his shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for the previous twenty years  beyond this he looked dignified and thoughtful and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict that he would make a kind and considerate husband  that he adored sue was obvious and she could almost be seen to feel that she was undeserving his adoration  although the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the red lion and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door when they came out  the schoolmaster and sue were unknown though jude was getting to be recognized as a citizen and the couple were judged to be some relations of his from a distance nobody supposing sue to have been a recent pupil at the training school  in the carriage jude took from his pocket his extra little weddingpresent which turned out to be two or three yards of white tulle which he threw over her bonnet and all as a veil  it looks so odd over a bonnet she said  ill take the bonnet off  oh nolet it stay said phillotson  and she obeyed  when they had passed up the church and were standing in their places jude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge of this performance but by the time they were halfway on with the service he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the business of giving her away  how could sue have had the temerity to ask him to do ita cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him women were different from men in such matters  was it that they were instead of more sensitive as reputed more callous and less romantic or were they more heroic  or was sue simply so perverse that she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful luxury of practising longsuffering in her own person and of being touched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it  he could perceive that her face was nervously set and when they reached the trying ordeal of jude giving her to phillotson she could hardly command herself rather however as it seemed from her knowledge of what her cousin must feel whom she need not have had there at all than from selfconsideration  possibly she would go on inflicting such pains again and again and grieving for the sufferer again and again in all her colossal inconsistency  phillotson seemed not to notice to be surrounded by a mist which prevented his seeing the emotions of others  as soon as they had signed their names and come away and the suspense was over jude felt relieved  the meal at his lodging was a very simple affair and at two oclock they went off  in crossing the pavement to the fly she looked back and there was a frightened light in her eyes  could it be that sue had acted with such unusual foolishness as to plunge into she knew not what for the sake of asserting her independence of him of retaliating on him for his secrecy  perhaps sue was thus venturesome with men because she was childishly ignorant of that side of their natures which wore out womens hearts and lives  when her foot was on the carriagestep she turned round saying that she had forgotten something  jude and the landlady offered to get it  no she said running back  it is my handkerchief  i know where i left it  jude followed her back  she had found it and came holding it in her hand  she looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones and her lips suddenly parted as if she were going to avow something  but she went on and whatever she had meant to say remained unspoken    viii   jude wondered if she had really left her handkerchief behind or whether it were that she had miserably wished to tell him of a love that at the last moment she could not bring herself to express  he could not stay in his silent lodging when they were gone and fearing that he might be tempted to drown his misery in alcohol he went upstairs changed his dark clothes for his white his thin boots for his thick and proceeded to his customary work for the afternoon  but in the cathedral he seemed to hear a voice behind him and to be possessed with an idea that she would come back  she could not possibly go home with phillotson he fancied  the feeling grew and stirred  the moment that the clock struck the last of his working hours he threw down his tools and rushed homeward  has anybody been for me he asked  nobody had been there  as he could claim the downstairs sittingroom till twelve oclock that night he sat in it all the evening and even when the clock had struck eleven and the family had retired he could not shake off the feeling that she would come back and sleep in the little room adjoining his own in which she had slept so many previous days  her actions were always unpredictable why should she not come  gladly would he have compounded for the denial of her as a sweetheart and wife by having her live thus as a fellowlodger and friend even on the most distant terms  his supper still remained spread and going to the front door and softly setting it open he returned to the room and sat as watchers sit on oldmidsummer eves expecting the phantom of the beloved  but she did not come  having indulged in this wild hope he went upstairs and looked out of the window and pictured her through the evening journey to london whither she and phillotson had gone for their holiday their rattling along through the damp night to their hotel under the same sky of ribbed cloud as that he beheld through which the moon showed its position rather than its shape and one or two of the larger stars made themselves visible as faint nebulae only  it was a new beginning of sues history  he projected his mind into the future and saw her with children more or less in her own likeness around her  but the consolation of regarding them as a continuation of her identity was denied to him as to all such dreamers by the wilfulness of nature in not allowing issue from one parent alone every desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy if at the estrangement or death of my lost love i could go and see her childhers solelythere would be comfort in it said jude and then he again uneasily saw as he had latterly seen with more and more frequency the scorn of nature for mans finer emotions and her lack of interest in his aspirations  the oppressive strength of his affection for sue showed itself on the morrow and following days yet more clearly  he could no longer endure the light of the melchester lamps the sunshine was as drab paint and the blue sky as zinc  then he received news that his old aunt was dangerously ill at marygreen which intelligence almost coincided with a letter from his former employer at christminster who offered him permanent work of a good class if he would come back the letters were almost a relief to him  he started to visit aunt drusilla and resolved to go onward to christminster to see what worth there might be in the builders offer  jude found his aunt even worse than the communication from the widow edlin had led him to expect  there was every possibility of her lingering on for weeks or months though little likelihood  he wrote to sue informing her of the state of her aunt and suggesting that she might like to see her aged relative alive  he would meet her at alfredston road the following evening monday on his way back from christminster if she could come by the uptrain which crossed his downtrain at that station  next morning according he went on to christminster intending to return to alfredston soon enough to keep the suggested appointment with sue  the city of learning wore an estranged look and he had lost all feeling for its associations  yet as the sun made vivid lights and shades of the mullioned architecture of the façades and drew patterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the quadrangles jude thought he had never seen the place look more beautiful  he came to the street in which he had first beheld sue the chair she had occupied when leaning over her ecclesiastical scrolls a hoghair brush in her hand her girlish figure had arrested the gaze of his inquiring eyes stood precisely in its former spot empty  it was as if she were dead and nobody had been found capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit  hers was now the city phantom while those of the intellectual and devotional worthies who had once moved him to emotion were no longer able to assert their presence there  however here he was and in fulfilment of his intention he went on to his former lodging in beersheba near the ritualistic church of st silas  the old landlady who opened the door seemed glad to see him again and bringing some lunch informed him that the builder who had employed him had called to inquire his address  jude went on to the stoneyard where he had worked  but the old sheds and bankers were distasteful to him he felt it impossible to engage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams he longed for the hour of the homeward train to alfredston where he might probably meet sue  then for one ghastly halfhour of depression caused by these scenes there returned upon him that feeling which had been his undoing more than oncethat he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of either by himself or others and during this halfhour he met tinker taylor the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger at fourways who proposed that they should adjourn to a bar and drink together they walked along the street till they stood before one of the great palpitating centres of christminster life the inn wherein he formerly had responded to the challenge to rehearse the creed in latinnow a popular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance which gave admittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and refitted in modern style since judes residence here  tinker taylor drank off his glass and departed saying it was too stylish a place now for him to feel at home in unless he was drunker than he had money to be just then  jude was longer finishing his and stood abstractedly silent in the for the minute almost empty place  the bar had been gutted and newly arranged throughout mahogany fixtures having taken the place of the old painted ones while at the back of the standingspace there were stuffed sofabenches  the room was divided into compartments in the approved manner between which were screens of ground glass in mahogany framing to prevent topers in one compartment being put to the blush by the recognitions of those in the next  on the inside of the counter two barmaids leant over the whitehandled beerengines and the row of little silvered taps inside dripping into a pewter trough  feeling tired and having nothing more to do till the train left jude sat down on one of the sofas  at the back of the barmaids rose beveledged mirrors with glass shelves running along their front on which stood precious liquids that jude did not know the name of in bottles of topaz sapphire ruby and amethyst  the moment was enlivened by the entrance of some customers into the next compartment and the starting of the mechanical telltale of monies received which emitted a tingting every time a coin was put in  the barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to judes direct glance though a reflection of her back in the glass behind her was occasionally caught by his eyes  he had only observed this listlessly when she turned her face for a moment to the glass to set her hair tidy  then he was amazed to discover that the face was arabellas  if she had come on to his compartment she would have seen him but she did not this being presided over by the maiden on the other side  abby was in a black gown with white linen cuffs and a broad white collar and her figure more developed than formerly was accentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom in the compartment she served stood an electroplated fountain of water over a spiritlamp whose blue flame sent a steam from the top all this being visible to him only in the mirror behind her which also reflected the faces of the men she was attending toone of them a handsome dissipated young fellow possibly an undergraduate who had been relating to her an experience of some humorous sort  oh mr cockman now  how can you tell such a tale to me in my innocence she cried gaily  mr cockman what do you use to make your moustache curl so beautiful  as the young man was clean shaven the retort provoked a laugh at his expense  come said he ill have a curaçao and a light please  she served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and striking a match held it to his cigarette with ministering archness while he whiffed  well have you heard from your husband lately my dear he asked  not a sound said she  where is he  i left him in australia and i suppose hes there still  judes eyes grew rounder  what made you part from him  dont you ask questions and you wont hear lies  come then give me my change which youve been keeping from me for the last quarter of an hour and ill romantically vanish up the street of this picturesque city  she handed the change over the counter in taking which he caught her fingers and held them  there was a slight struggle and titter and he bade her goodbye and left  jude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher  it was extraordinary how far removed from his life arabella now seemed to be  he could not realize their nominal closeness  and this being the case in his present frame of mind he was indifferent to the fact that arabella was his wife indeed  the compartment that she served emptied itself of visitors and after a brief thought he entered it and went forward to the counter arabella did not recognize him for a moment  then their glances met she started till a humorous impudence sparkled in her eyes and she spoke  well im blest  i thought you were underground years ago  oh  i never heard anything of you or i dont know that i should have come here  but never mind  what shall i treat you to this afternoon  a scotch and soda  come anything that the house will afford for old acquaintance sake  thanks arabella said jude without a smile  but i dont want anything more than ive had  the fact was that her unexpected presence there had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for strong liquor as completely as if it had whisked him back to his milkfed infancy  thats a pity now you could get it for nothing  how long have you been here  about six weeks  i returned from sydney three months ago  i always liked this business you know  i wonder you came to this place  well as i say i thought you were gone to glory and being in london i saw the situation in an advertisement  nobody was likely to know me here even if i had minded for i was never in christminster in my growing up  why did you return from australia  oh i had my reasons  then you are not a don yet  no  not even a reverend  no  nor so much as a rather reverend dissenting gentleman  i am as i was  trueyou look so  she idly allowed her fingers to rest on the pull of the beerengine as she inspected him critically  he observed that her hands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with her and that on the hand which pulled the engine she wore an ornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphireswhich they were indeed and were much admired as such by the young men who frequented the bar  so you pass as having a living husband he continued  yes  i thought it might be awkward if i called myself a widow as i should have liked  true  i am known here a little  i didnt mean on that accountfor as i said i didnt expect you it was for other reasons  what were they  i dont care to go into them she replied evasively  i make a very good living and i dont know that i want your company  here a chappie with no chin and a moustache like a ladys eyebrow came and asked for a curiously compounded drink and arabella was obliged to go and attend to him  we cant talk here she said stepping back a moment  cant you wait till nine  say yes and dont be a fool  i can get off duty two hours sooner than usual if i ask  i am not living in the house at present  he reflected and said gloomily ill come back  i suppose wed better arrange something  oh bother arranging  im not going to arrange anything  but i must know a thing or two and as you say we cant talk here very well ill call for you  depositing his unemptied glass he went out and walked up and down the street  here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of his sad attachment to sue  though arabellas word was absolutely untrustworthy he thought there might be some truth in her implication that she had not wished to disturb him and had really supposed him dead  however there was only one thing now to be done and that was to play a straightforward part the law being the law and the woman between whom and himself there was no more unity than between east and west being in the eye of the church one person with him  having to meet arabella here it was impossible to meet sue at alfredston as he had promised  at every thought of this a pang had gone through him but the conjuncture could not be helped arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his unauthorized love  passing the evening therefore in a desultory waiting about the town wherein he avoided the precincts of every cloister and hall because he could not bear to behold them he repaired to the tavern bar while the hundred and one strokes were resounding from the great bell of cardinal college a coincidence which seemed to him gratuitous irony  the inn was now brilliantly lighted up and the scene was altogether more brisk and gay  the faces of the barmaidens had risen in colour each having a pink flush on her cheek their manners were still more vivacious than beforemore abandoned more excited more sensuous and they expressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically laughing in a lackadaisical tone without reserve  the bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous hour and he had heard from without the hubbub of their voices but the customers were fewer at last  he nodded to arabella and told her that she would find him outside the door when she came away  but you must have something with me first she said with great good humour  just an early nightcap i always do  then you can go out and wait a minute as it is best we should not be seen going together  she drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy and though she had evidently from her countenance already taken in enough alcohol either by drinking or more probably from the atmosphere she had breathed for so many hours she finished hers quickly  he also drank his and went outside the house  in a few minutes she came in a thick jacket and a hat with a black feather  i live quite near she said taking his arm and can let myself in by a latchkey at any time  what arrangement do you want to come to  ohnone in particular he answered thoroughly sick and tired his thoughts again reverting to alfredston and the train he did not go by the probable disappointment of sue that he was not there when she arrived and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and lonely climb by starlight up the hills to marygreen  i ought to have gone back really  my aunt is on her deathbed i fear  ill go over with you tomorrow morning  i think i could get a day off  there was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of arabella who had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him coming to the bedside of his dying aunt and meeting sue  yet he said of course if youd like to you can  well that well consider  now until we have come to some agreement it is awkward our being together herewhere you are known and i am getting known though without any suspicion that i have anything to do with you  as we are going towards the station suppose we take the nineforty train to aldbrickham  we shall be there in little more than half an hour and nobody will know us for one night and we shall be quite free to act as we choose till we have made up our minds whether well make anything public or not  as you like  then wait till i get two or three things  this is my lodging sometimes when late i sleep at the hotel where i am engaged so nobody will think anything of my staying out  she speedily returned and they went on to the railway and made the halfhours journey to aldbrickham where they entered a thirdrate inn near the station in time for a late supper    ix   on the morrow between nine and halfpast they were journeying back to christminster the only two occupants of a compartment in a thirdclass railwaycarriage  having like jude made rather a hasty toilet to catch the train arabella looked a little frowsy and her face was very far from possessing the animation which had characterized it at the bar the night before  when they came out of the station she found that she still had half an hour to spare before she was due at the bar  they walked in silence a little way out of the town in the direction of alfredston  jude looked up the far highway  ah  poor feeble me he murmured at last  what said she  this is the very road by which i came into christminster years ago full of plans  well whatever the road is i think my time is nearly up as i have to be in the bar by eleven oclock  and as i said i shant ask for the day to go with you to see your aunt  so perhaps we had better part here  id sooner not walk up chief street with you since weve come to no conclusion at all  very well  but you said when we were getting up this morning that you had something you wished to tell me before i left  so i hadtwo thingsone in particular  but you wouldnt promise to keep it a secret  ill tell you now if you promise  as an honest woman i wish you to know it  it was what i began telling you in the nightabout that gentleman who managed the sydney hotel arabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her  youll keep it close  yesyesi promise said jude impatiently  of course i dont want to reveal your secrets  whenever i met him out for a walk he used to say that he was much taken with my looks and he kept pressing me to marry him  i never thought of coming back to england again and being out there in australia with no home of my own after leaving my father i at last agreed and did  whatmarry him  yes  regularlylegallyin church  yes  and lived with him till shortly before i left  it was stupid i know but i did  there now ive told you  dont round upon me he talks of coming back to england poor old chap  but if he does he wont be likely to find me  jude stood pale and fixed  why the devil didnt you tell me last night he said  welli didnt  wont you make it up with me then  so in talking of your husband to the bar gentlemen you meant him of coursenot me  of course  come dont fuss about it  i have nothing more to say replied jude  i have nothing at all to say about thecrimeyouve confessed to  crime  pooh  they dont think much of such as that over there lots of em do it  well if you take it like that i shall go back to him  he was very fond of me and we lived honourable enough and as respectable as any married couple in the colony  how did i know where you were  i wont go blaming you  i could say a good deal but perhaps it would be misplaced  what do you wish me to do  nothing  there was one thing more i wanted to tell you but i fancy weve seen enough of one another for the present  i shall think over what you said about your circumstances and let you know  thus they parted  jude watched her disappear in the direction of the hotel and entered the railway station close by  finding that it wanted threequarters of an hour of the time at which he could get a train back to alfredston he strolled mechanically into the city as far as to the fourways where he stood as he had so often stood before and surveyed chief street stretching ahead with its college after college in picturesqueness unrivalled except by such continental vistas as the street of palaces in genoa the lines of the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an architectural drawing  but jude was far from seeing or criticizing these things they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of arabellas midnight contiguity a sense of degradation at his revived experiences with her of her appearance as she lay asleep at dawn which set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst  if he could only have felt resentment towards her he would have been less unhappy but he pitied while he contemned her  jude turned and retraced his steps  drawing again towards the station he started at hearing his name pronouncedless at the name than at the voice  to his great surprise no other than sue stood like a vision before himher look bodeful and anxious as in a dream her little mouth nervous and her strained eyes speaking reproachful inquiry  oh judei am so gladto meet you like this she said in quick uneven accents not far from a sob  then she flushed as she observed his thought that they had not met since her marriage  they looked away from each other to hide their emotion took each others hand without further speech and went on together awhile till she glanced at him with furtive solicitude  i arrived at alfredston station last night as you asked me to and there was nobody to meet me  but i reached marygreen alone and they told me aunt was a trifle better  i sat up with her and as you did not come all night i was frightened about youi thought that perhaps when you found yourself back in the old city you were upset atat thinking i wasmarried and not there as i used to be and that you had nobody to speak to so you had tried to drown your gloomas you did at that former time when you were disappointed about entering as a student and had forgotten your promise to me that you never would again  and this i thought was why you hadnt come to meet me  and you came to hunt me up and deliver me like a good angel  i thought i would come by the morning train and try to find youin casein case  i did think of my promise to you dear continually  i shall never break out again as i did i am sure  i may have been doing nothing better but i was not doing thati loathe the thought of it  i am glad your staying had nothing to do with that  but she said the faintest pout entering into her tone you didnt come back last night and meet me as you engaged to  i didnti am sorry to say  i had an appointment at nine oclocktoo late for me to catch the train that would have met yours or to get home at all  looking at his loved one as she appeared to him now in his tender thought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade that he had ever had living largely in vivid imaginings so ethereal a creature that her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs he felt heartily ashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours he had spent in arabellas company  there was something rude and immoral in thrusting these recent facts of his life upon the mind of one who to him was so uncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human wife to any average man  and yet she was phillotsons  how she had become such how she lived as such passed his comprehension as he regarded her today  youll go back with me he said  theres a train just now  i wonder how my aunt is by this time  and so sue you really came on my account all this way  at what an early time you must have started poor thing  yes  sitting up watching alone made me all nerves for you and instead of going to bed when it got light i started  and now you wont frighten me like this again about your morals for nothing  he was not so sure that she had been frightened about his morals for nothing  he released her hand till they had entered the trainit seemed the same carriage he had lately got out of with anotherwhere they sat down side by side sue between him and the window  he regarded the delicate lines of her profile and the small tight applelike convexities of her bodice so different from arabellas amplitudes  though she knew he was looking at her she did not turn to him but kept her eyes forward as if afraid that by meeting his own some troublous discussion would be initiated  sueyou are married now you know like me and yet we have been in such a hurry that we have not said a word about it  theres no necessity she quickly returned  oh wellperhaps not  but i wish  judedont talk about mei wish you wouldnt she entreated it distresses me rather  forgive my saying it   where did you stay last night  she had asked the question in perfect innocence to change the topic he knew that and said merely at an inn though it would have been a relief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one  but the latters final announcement of her marriage in australia bewildered him lest what he might say should do his ignorant wife an injury  their talk proceeded but awkwardly till they reached alfredston that sue was not as she had been but was labelled phillotson paralyzed jude whenever he wanted to commune with her as an individual  yet she seemed unalteredhe could not say why there remained the fivemile extra journey into the country which it was just as easy to walk as to drive the greater part of it being uphill  jude had never before in his life gone that road with sue though he had with another  it was now as if he carried a bright light which temporarily banished the shady associations of the earlier time  sue talked but jude noticed that she still kept the conversation from herself  at length he inquired if her husband were well  o yes she said  he is obliged to be in the school all the day or he would have come with me  he is so good and kind that to accompany me he would have dismissed the school for once even against his principlesfor he is strongly opposed to giving casual holidaysonly i wouldnt let him  i felt it would be better to come alone  aunt drusilla i knew was so very eccentric and his being almost a stranger to her now would have made it irksome to both since it turns out that she is hardly conscious i am glad i did not ask him  jude had walked moodily while this praise of phillotson was being expressed  mr phillotson obliges you in everything as he ought he said  of course  you ought to be a happy wife  and of course i am  bride i might almost have said as yet  it is not so many weeks since i gave you to him and  yes i know  i know  there was something in her face which belied her late assuring words so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken that they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in the wifes guide to conduct  jude knew the quality of every vibration in sues voice could read every symptom of her mental condition and he was convinced that she was unhappy although she had not been a month married  but her rushing away thus from home to see the last of a relative whom she had hardly known in her life proved nothing for sue naturally did such things as those  well you have my good wishes now as always mrs phillotson  she reproached him by a glance  no you are not mrs phillotson murmured jude  you are dear free sue bridehead only you dont know it  wifedom has not yet squashed up and digested you in its vast maw as an atom which has no further individuality  sue put on a look of being offended till she answered nor has husbandom you so far as i can see  but it has he said shaking his head sadly  when they reached the lone cottage under the firs between the brown house and marygreen in which jude and arabella had lived and quarrelled he turned to look at it  a squalid family lived there now  he could not help saying to sue thats the house my wife and i occupied the whole of the time we lived together  i brought her home to that house  she looked at it  that to you was what the schoolhouse at shaston is to me  yes but i was not very happy there as you are in yours  she closed her lips in retortive silence and they walked some way till she glanced at him to see how he was taking it  of course i may have exaggerated your happinessone never knows he continued blandly  dont think that jude for a moment even though you may have said it to sting me  hes as good to me as a man can be and gives me perfect libertywhich elderly husbands dont do in general  if you think i am not happy because hes too old for me you are wrong  i dont think anything against himto you dear  and you wont say things to distress me will you  i will not  he said no more but he knew that from some cause or other in taking phillotson as a husband sue felt that she had done what she ought not to have done  they plunged into the concave field on the other side of which rose the villagethe field wherein jude had received a thrashing from the farmer many years earlier  on ascending to the village and approaching the house they found mrs edlin standing at the door who at sight of them lifted her hands deprecatingly  shes downstairs if youll believe me cried the widow  out o bed she got and nothing could turn her  what will come ot i do not know  on entering there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman wrapped in blankets and turning upon them a countenance like that of sebastianos lazarus  they must have looked their amazement for she said in a hollow voice  ahsceered ye have i  i wasnt going to bide up there no longer to please nobody  tis more than flesh and blood can bear to be ordered to do this and that by a feller that dont know half as well as you do yourself   ahyoull rue this marrying as well as he she added turning to sue  all our family doand nearly all everybody elses  you should have done as i did you simpleton  and phillotson the schoolmaster of all men  what made ee marry him  what makes most women marry aunt  ah  you mean to say you loved the man  i dont meant to say anything definite  do ye love un  dont ask me aunt  i can mind the man very well  a very civil honourable liver but lordi dont want to wownd your feelings butthere be certain men here and there that no woman of any niceness can stomach  i should have said he was one  i dont say so now since you must ha known better than ibut thats what i should have said  sue jumped up and went out  jude followed her and found her in the outhouse crying  dont cry dear said jude in distress  she means well but is very crusty and queer now you know  oh noit isnt that said sue trying to dry her eyes  i dont mind her roughness one bit  what is it then  it is that what she says isis true  godwhatyou dont like him asked jude  i dont mean that she said hastily  that i oughtperhaps i ought not to have married  he wondered if she had really been going to say that at first they went back and the subject was smoothed over and her aunt took rather kindly to sue telling her that not many young women newly married would have come so far to see a sick old crone like her in the afternoon sue prepared to depart jude hiring a neighbour to drive her to alfredston  ill go with you to the station if youd like he said  she would not let him  the man came round with the trap and jude helped her into it perhaps with unnecessary attention for she looked at him prohibitively  i supposei may come to see you some day when i am back again at melchester he halfcrossly observed  she bent down and said softly no dearyou are not to come yet i dont think you are in a good mood  very well said jude  goodbye  goodbye she waved her hand and was gone  shes right  i wont go he murmured  he passed the evening and following days in mortifying by every possible means his wish to see her nearly starving himself in attempts to extinguish by fasting his passionate tendency to love her  he read sermons on discipline and hunted up passages in church history that treated of the ascetics of the second century  before he had returned from marygreen to melchester there arrived a letter from arabella  the sight of it revived a stronger feeling of selfcondemnation for his brief return to her society than for his attachment to sue  the letter he perceived bore a london postmark instead of the christminster one  arabella informed him that a few days after their parting in the morning at christminster she had been surprised by an affectionate letter from her australian husband formerly manager of the hotel in sydney  he had come to england on purpose to find her and had taken a free fullylicensed public in lambeth where he wished her to join him in conducting the business which was likely to be a very thriving one the house being situated in an excellent densely populated gindrinking neighbourhood and already doing a trade of £200 a month which could be easily doubled  as he had said that he loved her very much still and implored her to tell him where she was and as they had only parted in a slight tiff and as her engagement in christminster was only temporary she had just gone to join him as he urged  she could not help feeling that she belonged to him more than to jude since she had properly married him and had lived with him much longer than with her first husband in thus wishing jude goodbye she bore him no illwill and trusted he would not turn upon her a weak woman and inform against her and bring her to ruin now that she had a chance of improving her circumstances and leading a genteel life    x   jude returned to melchester which had the questionable recommendation of being only a dozen and a half miles from his sues now permanent residence  at first he felt that this nearness was a distinct reason for not going southward at all but christminster was too sad a place to bear while the proximity of shaston to melchester might afford him the glory of worsting the enemy in a close engagement such as was deliberately sought by the priests and virgins of the early church who disdaining an ignominious flight from temptation became even chamberpartners with impunity jude did not pause to remember that in the laconic words of the historian insulted nature sometimes vindicated her rights in such circumstances  he now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the priesthoodin the recognition that the singlemindedness of his aims and his fidelity to the cause had been more than questionable of late  his passion for sue troubled his soul yet his lawful abandonment to the society of arabella for twelve hours seemed instinctively a worse thingeven though she had not told him of her sydney husband till afterwards  he had he verily believed overcome all tendency to fly to liquorwhich indeed he had never done from taste but merely as an escape from intolerable misery of mind  yet he perceived with despondency that taken all round he was a man of too many passions to make a good clergyman the utmost he could hope for was that in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and spirit the former might not always be victorious  as a hobby auxiliary to his readings in divinity he developed his slight skill in churchmusic and thoroughbass till he could join in partsinging from notation with some accuracy  a mile or two from melchester there was a restored village church to which jude had originally gone to fix the new columns and capitals  by this means he had become acquainted with the organist and the ultimate result was that he joined the choir as a bass voice  he walked out to this parish twice every sunday and sometimes in the week  one evening about easter the choir met for practice and a new hymn which jude had heard of as being by a wessex composer was to be tried and prepared for the following week  it turned out to be a strangely emotional composition  as they all sang it over and over again its harmonies grew upon jude and moved him exceedingly  when they had finished he went round to the organist to make inquiries  the score was in manuscript the name of the composer being at the head together with the title of the hymn the foot of the cross  yes said the organist  he is a local man  he is a professional musician at kennetbridgebetween here and christminster  the vicar knows him  he was brought up and educated in christminster traditions which accounts for the quality of the piece  i think he plays in the large church there and has a surpliced choir  he comes to melchester sometimes and once tried to get the cathedral organ when the post was vacant  the hymn is getting about everywhere this easter  as he walked humming the air on his way home jude fell to musing on its composer and the reasons why he composed it  what a man of sympathies he must be  perplexed and harassed as he himself was about sue and arabella and troubled as was his conscience by the complication of his position how he would like to know that man he of all men would understand my difficulties said the impulsive jude  if there were any person in the world to choose as a confidant this composer would be the one for he must have suffered and throbbed and yearned  in brief ill as he could afford the time and money for the journey fawley resolved like the child that he was to go to kennetbridge the very next sunday  he duly started early in the morning for it was only by a series of crooked railways that he could get to the town  about midday he reached it and crossing the bridge into the quaint old borough he inquired for the house of the composer  they told him it was a red brick building some little way further on also that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not five minutes before  which way asked jude with alacrity  straight along homeward from church  jude hastened on and soon had the pleasure of observing a man in a black coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance ahead  stretching out his legs yet more widely he stalked after a hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul he said  i must speak to that man  he could not however overtake the musician before he had entered his own house and then arose the question if this were an expedient time to call  whether or not he decided to do so there and then now that he had got here the distance home being too great for him to wait till late in the afternoon  this man of soul would understand scant ceremony and might be quite a perfect adviser in a case in which an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained entrance into his heart through the opening afforded for religion  jude accordingly rang the bell and was admitted  the musician came to him in a moment and being respectably dressed goodlooking and frank in manner jude obtained a favourable reception  he was nevertheless conscious that there would be a certain awkwardness in explaining his errand  i have been singing in the choir of a little church near melchester he said  and we have this week practised the foot of the cross which i understand sir that you composed  i dida year or so ago  ilike it  i think it supremely beautiful  ah wellother people have said so too  yes theres money in it if i could only see about getting it published  i have other compositions to go with it too i wish i could bring them out for i havent made a fivepound note out of any of them yet  these publishing peoplethey want the copyright of an obscure composers work such as mine is for almost less than i should have to pay a person for making a fair manuscript copy of the score  the one you speak of i have lent to various friends about here and melchester and so it has got to be sung a little  but music is a poor staff to lean oni am giving it up entirely  you must go into trade if you want to make money nowadays  the wine business is what i am thinking of  this is my forthcoming listit is not issued yetbut you can take one  he handed jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet shape ornamentally margined with a red line in which were set forth the various clarets champagnes ports sherries and other wines with which he purposed to initiate his new venture  it took jude more than by surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus and he felt that he could not open up his confidences  they talked a little longer but constrainedly for when the musician found that jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had been while judes appearance and address deceived him as to his position and pursuits  jude stammered out something about his feelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted composition and took an embarrassed leave  all the way home by the slow sunday train sitting in the fireless waitingrooms on this cold spring day he was depressed enough at his simplicity in taking such a journey  but no sooner did he reach his melchester lodging than he found awaiting him a letter which had arrived that morning a few minutes after he had left the house  it was a contrite little note from sue in which she said with sweet humility that she felt she had been horrid in telling him he was not to come to see her that she despised herself for having been so conventional and that he was to be sure to come by the elevenfortyfive train that very sunday and have dinner with them at halfpast one  jude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was too late to act upon its contents but he had chastened himself considerably of late and at last his chimerical expedition to kennetbridge really did seem to have been another special intervention of providence to keep him away from temptation  but a growing impatience of faith which he had noticed in himself more than once of late made him pass over in ridicule the idea that god sent people on fools errands  he longed to see her he was angry at having missed her and he wrote instantly telling her what had happened and saying he had not enough patience to wait till the following sunday but would come any day in the week that she liked to name  since he wrote a little overardently sue as her manner was delayed her reply till thursday before good friday when she said he might come that afternoon if he wished this being the earliest day on which she could welcome him for she was now assistantteacher in her husbands school  jude therefore got leave from the cathedral works at the trifling expense of a stoppage of pay and went      part fourth   at shaston       whoso prefers either matrimony or other ordinance before     the good of man and the plain exigence of charity let     him profess papist or protestant or what he will he     is no better than a phariseej milton   i   shaston the ancient british palladour       from whose foundation first such strange reports      arise   as drayton sang it was and is in itself the city of a dream vague imaginings of its castle its three mints its magnificent apsidal abbey the chief glory of south wessex its twelve churches its shrines chantries hospitals its gabled freestone mansionsall now ruthlessly swept awaythrow the visitor even against his will into a pensive melancholy which the stimulating atmosphere and limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel  the spot was the burialplace of a king and a queen of abbots and abbesses saints and bishops knights and squires  the bones of king edward the martyr carefully removed hither for holy preservation brought shaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part of europe and enabled it to maintain a reputation extending far beyond english shores  to this fair creation of the great middleage the dissolution was as historians tell us the deathknell with the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a general ruin the martyrs bones met with the fate of the sacred pile that held them and not a stone is now left to tell where they lie  the natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain but strange to say these qualities which were noted by many writers in ages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated are passed over in this and one of the queerest and quaintest spots in england stands virtually unvisited today  it has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp rising on the north south and west sides of the borough out of the deep alluvial vale of blackmoor the view from the castle green over three counties of verdant pasturesouth mid and nether wessexbeing as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant travellers eyes as the medicinal air is to his lungs  impossible to a railway it can best be reached on foot next best by light vehicles and it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the northeast that connects it with the high chalk tableland on that side  such is and such was the now worldforgotten shaston or palladour its situation rendered water the great want of the town and within living memory horses donkeys and men may have been seen toiling up the winding ways to the top of the height laden with tubs and barrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain and hawkers retailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful  this difficulty in the water supply together with two other odd facts namely that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a roof behind the church and that in former times the town passed through a curious period of corruption conventual and domestic gave rise to the saying that shaston was remarkable for three consolations to man such as the world afforded not elsewhere  it was a place where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple where beer was more plentiful than water and where there were more wanton women than honest wives and maids  it is also said that after the middle ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests and hence were compelled to pull down their churches and refrain altogether from the public worship of god a necessity which they bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on sunday afternoons  in those days the shastonians were apparently not without a sense of humour  there was another peculiaritythis a modern onewhich shaston appeared to owe to its site  it was the restingplace and headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans shows shootinggalleries and other itinerant concerns whose business lay largely at fairs and markets  as strange wild birds are seen assembled on some lofty promontory meditatively pausing for longer flights or to return by the course they followed thither so here in this clifftown stood in stultified silence the yellow and green caravans bearing names not local as if surprised by a change in the landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress and here they usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again their old tracks in the following spring  it was to this breezy and whimsical spot that jude ascended from the nearest station for the first time in his life about four oclock one afternoon and entering on the summit of the peak after a toilsome climb passed the first houses of the aerial town and drew towards the schoolhouse  the hour was too early the pupils were still in school humming small like a swarm of gnats and he withdrew a few steps along abbey walk whence he regarded the spot which fate had made the home of all he loved best in the world  in front of the schools which were extensive and stonebuilt grew two enormous beeches with smooth mousecoloured trunks as such trees will only grow on chalk uplands  within the mullioned and transomed windows he could see the black brown and flaxen crowns of the scholars over the sills and to pass the time away he walked down to the level terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread his heart throbbing in spite of him  unwilling to enter till the children were dismissed he remained here till young voices could be heard in the open air and girls in white pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared dancing along the paths which the abbess prioress subprioress and fifty nuns had demurely paced three centuries earlier  retracing his steps he found that he had waited too long and that sue had gone out into the town at the heels of the last scholar mr phillotson having been absent all the afternoon at a teachers meeting at shottsford  jude went into the empty schoolroom and sat down the girl who was sweeping the floor having informed him that mrs phillotson would be back again in a few minutes  a piano stood nearactually the old piano that phillotson had possessed at marygreenand though the dark afternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes jude touched them in his humble way and could not help modulating into the hymn which had so affected him in the previous week  a figure moved behind him and thinking it was still the girl with the broom jude took no notice till the person came close and laid her fingers lightly upon his bass hand  the imposed hand was a little one he seemed to know and he turned  dont stop said sue  i like it  i learnt it before i left melchester  they used to play it in the training school  i cant strum before you  play it for me  oh welli dont mind  sue sat down and her rendering of the piece though not remarkable seemed divine as compared with his own  she like him was evidently touchedto her own surpriseby the recalled air and when she had finished and he moved his hand towards hers it met his own halfway jude grasped itjust as he had done before her marriage  it is odd she said in a voice quite changed that i should care about that air because  because what  i am not that sortquite  not easily moved  i didnt quite mean that  oh but you are one of that sort for you are just like me at heart  but not at head  she played on and suddenly turned round and by an unpremeditated instinct each clasped the others hand again  she uttered a forced little laugh as she relinquished his quickly how funny she said  i wonder what we both did that for  i suppose because we are both alike as i said before  not in our thoughts  perhaps a little in our feelings  and they rule thoughts  isnt it enough to make one blaspheme that the composer of that hymn is one of the most commonplace men i ever met  whatyou know him  i went to see him  oh you gooseto do just what i should have done  why did you  because we are not alike he said drily  now well have some tea said sue  shall we have it here instead of in my house  it is no trouble to get the kettle and things brought in  we dont live at the school you know but in that ancient dwelling across the way called oldgrove place  it is so antique and dismal that it depresses me dreadfully  such houses are very well to visit but not to live ini feel crushed into the earth by the weight of so many previous lives there spent  in a new place like these schools there is only your own life to support  sit down and ill tell ada to bring the teathings across  he waited in the light of the stove the door of which she flung open before going out and when she returned followed by the maiden with tea they sat down by the same light assisted by the blue rays of a spiritlamp under the brass kettle on the stand  this is one of your weddingpresents to me she said signifying the latter  yes said jude  the kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note to his mind and to change the subject he said do you know of any good readable edition of the uncanonical books of the new testament  you dont read them in the school i suppose  oh dear notwould alarm the neighbourhood  yes there is one i am not familiar with it now though i was interested in it when my former friend was alive  cowpers apocryphal gospels  that sounds like what i want  his thoughts however reverted with a twinge to the former friendby whom she meant as he knew the university comrade of her earlier days  he wondered if she talked of him to phillotson  the gospel of nicodemus is very nice she went on to keep him from his jealous thoughts which she read clearly as she always did indeed when they talked on an indifferent subject as now there was ever a second silent conversation passing between their emotions so perfect was the reciprocity between them  it is quite like the genuine article  all cut up into verses too so that it is like one of the other evangelists read in a dream when things are the same yet not the same  but jude do you take an interest in those questions still  are you getting up apologetica  yes  i am reading divinity harder than ever  she regarded him curiously  why do you look at me like that said jude  ohwhy do you want to know  i am sure you can tell me anything i may be ignorant of in that subject  you must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear dead friend  we wont get on to that now she coaxed  will you be carving out at that church again next week where you learnt the pretty hymn  yes perhaps  that will be very nice  shall i come and see you there  it is in this direction and i could come any afternoon by train for half an hour  no dont come  whatarent we going to be friends then any longer as we used to be  no  i didnt know that  i thought you were always going to be kind to me  no i am not  what have i done then  i am sure i thought we two  the tremolo in her voice caused her to break off  sue i sometimes think you are a flirt said he abruptly  there was a momentary pause till she suddenly jumped up and to his surprise he saw by the kettleflame that her face was flushed  i cant talk to you any longer jude she said the tragic contralto note having come back as of old  it is getting too dark to stay together like this after playing morbid good friday tunes that make one feel what one shouldnt   we mustnt sit and talk in this way any more  yesyou must go away for you mistake me  i am very much the reverse of what you say so cruellyoh jude it was cruel to say that  yet i cant tell you the truthi should shock you by letting you know how i give way to my impulses and how much i feel that i shouldnt have been provided with attractiveness unless it were meant to be exercised  some womens love of being loved is insatiable and so often is their love of loving and in the last case they may find that they cant give it continuously to the chamberofficer appointed by the bishops licence to receive it but you are so straightforward jude that you cant understand me   now you must go i am sorry my husband is not at home  are you  i perceive i have said that in mere convention  honestly i dont think i am sorry  it does not matter either way sad to say  as they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner she touched his fingers but lightly when he went out now  he had hardly gone from the door when with a dissatisfied look she jumped on a form and opened the iron casement of a window beneath which he was passing in the path without  when do you leave here to catch your train jude she asked  he looked up in some surprise  the coach that runs to meet it goes in threequarters of an hour or so  what will you do with yourself for the time  ohwander about i suppose  perhaps i shall go and sit in the old church  it does seem hard of me to pack you off so  you have thought enough of churches heaven knows without going into one in the dark stay there  where  where you are  i can talk to you better like this than when you were inside  it was so kind and tender of you to give up half a days work to come to see me   you are joseph the dreamer of dreams dear jude  and a tragic don quixote  and sometimes you are st stephen who while they were stoning him could see heaven opened  oh my poor friend and comrade youll suffer yet  now that the high windowsill was between them so that he could not get at her she seemed not to mind indulging in a frankness she had feared at close quarters  i have been thinking she continued still in the tone of one brimful of feeling that the social moulds civilization fits us into have no more relation to our actual shapes than the conventional shapes of the constellations have to the real starpatterns  i am called mrs richard phillotson living a calm wedded life with my counterpart of that name  but i am not really mrs richard phillotson but a woman tossed about all alone with aberrant passions and unaccountable antipathies  now you mustnt wait longer or you will lose the coach  come and see me again  you must come to the house then  yes said jude  when shall it be  tomorrow week  goodbyegoodbye  she stretched out her hand and stroked his forehead pitifullyjust once  jude said goodbye and went away into the darkness  passing along bimport street he thought he heard the wheels of the coach departing and truly enough when he reached the dukes arms in the market place the coach had gone  it was impossible for him to get to the station on foot in time for this train and he settled himself perforce to wait for the nextthe last to melchester that night  he wandered about awhile obtained something to eat and then having another halfhour on his hands his feet involuntarily took him through the venerable graveyard of trinity church with its avenues of limes in the direction of the schools again  they were entirely in darkness  she had said she lived over the way at oldgrove place a house which he soon discovered from her description of its antiquity  a glimmering candlelight shone from a front window the shutters being yet unclosed  he could see the interior clearlythe floor sinking a couple of steps below the road without which had become raised during the centuries since the house was built  sue evidently just come in was standing with her hat on in this front parlour or sittingroom whose walls were lined with wainscoting of panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling the latter being crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head  the mantelpiece was of the same heavy description carved with jacobean pilasters and scrollwork  the centuries did indeed ponderously overhang a young wife who passed her time here  she had opened a rosewood workbox and was looking at a photograph having contemplated it a little while she pressed it against her bosom and put it again in its place  then becoming aware that she had not obscured the windows she came forward to do so candle in hand  it was too dark for her to see jude without but he could see her face distinctly and there was an unmistakable tearfulness about the dark longlashed eyes  she closed the shutters and jude turned away to pursue his solitary journey home  whose photograph was she looking at he said  he had once given her his but she had others he knew  yet it was his surely  he knew he should go to see her again according to her invitation those earnest men he read of the saints whom sue with gentle irreverence called his demigods would have shunned such encounters if they doubted their own strength  but he could not  he might fast and pray during the whole interval but the human was more powerful in him than the divine    ii   however if god disposed not woman did  the next morning but one brought him this note from her      dont come next week  on your own account dont  we were    too free under the influence of that morbid hymn and the    twilight  think no more than you can help of     susanna florence mary   the disappointment was keen  he knew her mood the look of her face when she subscribed herself at length thus  but whatever her mood he could not say she was wrong in her view he replied      i acquiesce  you are right  it is a lesson in    renunciation which i suppose i ought to learn at this    season     jude   he despatched the note on easter eve and there seemed a finality in their decisions  but other forces and laws than theirs were in operation  on easter monday morning he received a message from the widow edlin whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious happened      your aunt is sinking  come at once   he threw down his tools and went  three and a half hours later he was crossing the downs about marygreen and presently plunged into the concave field across which the short cut was made to the village as he ascended on the other side a labouring man who had been watching his approach from a gate across the path moved uneasily and prepared to speak  i can see in his face that she is dead said jude  poor aunt drusilla  it was as he had supposed and mrs edlin had sent out the man to break the news to him  she wouldnt have knowed ee  she lay like a doll wi glass eyes so it didnt matter that you wasnt here said he  jude went on to the house and in the afternoon when everything was done and the layersout had finished their beer and gone he sat down alone in the silent place  it was absolutely necessary to communicate with sue though two or three days earlier they had agreed to mutual severance  he wrote in the briefest terms      aunt drusilla is dead having been taken almost suddenly    the funeral is on friday afternoon   he remained in and about marygreen through the intervening days went out on friday morning to see that the grave was finished and wondered if sue would come  she had not written and that seemed to signify rather that she would come than that she would not  having timed her by her only possible train he locked the door about midday and crossed the hollow field to the verge of the upland by the brown house where he stood and looked over the vast prospect northwards and over the nearer landscape in which alfredston stood two miles behind it a jet of white steam was travelling from the left to the right of the picture  there was a long time to wait even now till he would know if she had arrived  he did wait however and at last a small hired vehicle pulled up at the bottom of the hill and a person alighted the conveyance going back while the passenger began ascending the hill  he knew her and she looked so slender today that it seemed as if she might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate embracesuch as it was not for him to give  twothirds of the way up her head suddenly took a solicitous poise and he knew that she had at that moment recognized him  her face soon began a pensive smile which lasted till having descended a little way he met her  i thought she began with nervous quickness that it would be so sad to let you attend the funeral alone  and soat the last momenti came  dear faithful sue murmured jude  with the elusiveness of her curious double nature however sue did not stand still for any further greeting though it wanted some time to the burial  a pathos so unusually compounded as that which attached to this hour was unlikely to repeat itself for years if ever and jude would have paused and meditated and conversed  but sue either saw it not at all or seeing it more than he would not allow herself to feel it  the sad and simple ceremony was soon over their progress to the church being almost at a trot the bustling undertaker having a more important funeral an hour later three miles off  drusilla was put into the new ground quite away from her ancestors  sue and jude had gone side by side to the grave and now sat down to tea in the familiar house their lives united at least in this last attention to the dead  she was opposed to marriage from first to last you say murmured sue  yes  particularly for members of our family  her eyes met his and remained on him awhile  we are rather a sad family dont you think jude  she said we made bad husbands and wives  certainly we make unhappy ones  at all events i do for one  sue was silent  is it wrong jude she said with a tentative tremor for a husband or wife to tell a third person that they are unhappy in their marriage  if a marriage ceremony is a religious thing it is possibly wrong but if it is only a sordid contract based on material convenience in householding rating and taxing and the inheritance of land and money by children making it necessary that the male parent should be knownwhich it seems to bewhy surely a person may say even proclaim upon the housetops that it hurts and grieves him or her  i have said so anyhow to you  presently she went on are there many couples do you think where one dislikes the other for no definite fault  yes i suppose  if either cares for another person for instance  but even apart from that  wouldnt the woman for example be very badnatured if she didnt like to live with her husband merelyher voice undulated and he guessed thingsmerely because she had a personal feeling against ita physical objectiona fastidiousness or whatever it may be calledalthough she might respect and be grateful to him  i am merely putting a case  ought she to try to overcome her pruderies  jude threw a troubled look at her  he said looking away it would be just one of those cases in which my experiences go contrary to my dogmas  speaking as an orderloving manwhich i hope i am though i fear i am noti should say yes  speaking from experience and unbiased nature i should say no  sue i believe you are not happy  of course i am she contradicted  how can a woman be unhappy who has only been married eight weeks to a man she chose freely  chose freely  why do you repeat it   but i have to go back by the six oclock train  you will be staying on here i suppose  for a few days to wind up aunts affairs  this house is gone now shall i go to the train with you  a little laugh of objection came from sue  i think not  you may come part of the way  but stopyou cant go tonight  that train wont take you to shaston  you must stay and go back tomorrow  mrs edlin has plenty of room if you dont like to stay here  very well she said dubiously  i didnt tell him i would come for certain  jude went to the widows house adjoining to let her know and returning in a few minutes sat down again  it is horrible how we are circumstanced suehorrible he said abruptly with his eyes bent to the floor  no  why  i cant tell you all my part of the gloom  your part is that you ought not to have married him  i saw it before you had done it but i thought i mustnt interfere  i was wrong  i ought to have  but what makes you assume all this dear  becausei can see you through your feathers my poor little bird  her hand lay on the table and jude put his upon it  sue drew hers away  thats absurd sue cried he after what weve been talking about i am more strict and formal than you if it comes to that and that you should object to such an innocent action shows that you are ridiculously inconsistent  perhaps it was too prudish she said repentantly  only i have fancied it was a sort of trick of ourstoo frequent perhaps  there you may hold it as much as you like is that good of me  yes very  but i must tell him  who  richard  ohof course if you think it necessary  but as it means nothing it may be bothering him needlessly  wellare you sure you mean it only as my cousin  absolutely sure  i have no feelings of love left in me  thats news  how has it come to be  ive seen arabella  she winced at the hit then said curiously when did you see her  when i was at christminster  so shes come back and you never told me  i suppose you will live with her now  of coursejust as you live with your husband  she looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses withered for want of attention and through them at the outer distance till her eyes began to grow moist  what is it said jude in a softened tone  why should you be so glad to go back to her ifif what you used to say to me is still truei mean if it were true then  of course it is not now  how could your heart go back to arabella so soon  a special providence i suppose helped it on its way  ahit isnt true she said with gentle resentment  you are teasing methats allbecause you think i am not happy  i dont know  i dont wish to know  if i were unhappy it would be my fault my wickedness not that i should have a right to dislike him  he is considerate to me in everything and he is very interesting from the amount of general knowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his way  do you think jude that a man ought to marry a woman his own age or one younger than himselfeighteen yearsas i am than he  it depends upon what they feel for each other  he gave her no opportunity of selfsatisfaction and she had to go on unaided which she did in a vanquished tone verging on tears  ii think i must be equally honest with you as you have been with me  perhaps you have seen what it is i want to saythat though i like mr phillotson as a friend i dont like himit is a torture to me tolive with him as a husbandthere now i have let it outi couldnt help it although i have beenpretending i am happynow youll have a contempt for me for ever i suppose  she bent down her face upon her hands as they lay upon the cloth and silently sobbed in little jerks that made the fragile threelegged table quiver  i have only been married a month or two she went on still remaining bent upon the table and sobbing into her hands  and it is said that what a woman shrinks fromin the early days of her marriageshe shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a dozen years  but that is much like saying that the amputation of a limb is no affliction since a person gets comfortably accustomed to the use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time  jude could hardly speak but he said i thought there was something wrong sue  oh i thought there was  but it is not as you thinkthere is nothing wrong except my own wickedness i suppose youd call ita repugnance on my part for a reason i cannot disclose and what would not be admitted as one by the world in general   what tortures me so much is the necessity of being responsive to this man whenever he wishes good as he is morallythe dreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a matter whose essence is its voluntariness   i wish he would beat me or be faithless to me or do some open thing that i could talk about as a justification for feeling as i do  but he does nothing except that he has grown a little cold since he has found out how i feel  thats why he didnt come to the funeral  oh i am very miserablei dont know what to do   dont come near me jude because you mustnt  dontdont  but he had jumped up and put his face against hersor rather against her ear her face being inaccessible  i told you not to jude  i know you didi only wish toconsole you  it all arose through my being married before we met didnt it  you would have been my wife sue wouldnt you if it hadnt been for that  instead of replying she rose quickly and saying she was going to walk to her aunts grave in the churchyard to recover herself went out of the house  jude did not follow her  twenty minutes later he saw her cross the village green towards mrs edlins and soon she sent a little girl to fetch her bag and tell him she was too tired to see him again that night  in the lonely room of his aunts house jude sat watching the cottage of the widow edlin as it disappeared behind the night shade he knew that sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and disheartened and again questioned his devotional motto that all was for the best  he retired to rest early but his sleep was fitful from the sense that sue was so near at hand  at some time near two oclock when he was beginning to sleep more soundly he was aroused by a shrill squeak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly at marygreen  it was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin  as was the little creatures habit it did not soon repeat its cry and probably would not do so more than once or twice but would remain bearing its torture till the morrow when the trapper would come and knock it on the head  he who in his childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now began to picture the agonies of the rabbit from its lacerated leg if it were a bad catch by the hindleg the animal would tug during the ensuing six hours till the iron teeth of the trap had stripped the legbone of its flesh when should a weakspringed instrument enable it to escape it would die in the fields from the mortification of the limb  if it were a good catch namely by the foreleg the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in attempts at an impossible escape  almost half an hour passed and the rabbit repeated its cry  jude could rest no longer till he had put it out of its pain so dressing himself quickly he descended and by the light of the moon went across the green in the direction of the sound  he reached the hedge bordering the widows garden when he stood still  the faint click of the trap as dragged about by the writhing animal guided him now and reaching the spot he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck with the side of his palm and it stretched itself out dead  he was turning away when he saw a woman looking out of the open casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage jude said a voice timidlysues voice  it is youis it not  yes dear  i havent been able to sleep at all and then i heard the rabbit and couldnt help thinking of what it suffered till i felt i must come down and kill it  but i am so glad you got there first  they ought not to be allowed to set these steel traps ought they  jude had reached the window which was quite a low one so that she was visible down to her waist  she let go the casementstay and put her hand upon his her moonlit face regarding him wistfully  did it keep you awake he said  noi was awake  how was that  oh you knownow  i know you with your religious doctrines think that a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal sin in making a man the confidant of it as i did you  i wish i hadnt now  dont wish it dear he said  that may have been my view but my doctrines and i begin to part company  i knew iti knew it  and thats why i vowed i wouldnt disturb your belief  buti am so glad to see youand oh i didnt mean to see you again now the last tie between us aunt drusilla is dead  jude seized her hand and kissed it  there is a stronger one left he said  ill never care about my doctrines or my religion any more  let them go  let me help you even if i do love you and even if you  dont say iti know what you mean but i cant admit so much as that  there  guess what you like but dont press me to answer questions  i wish you were happy whatever i may be  i cant be  so few could enter into my feelingthey would say twas my fanciful fastidiousness or something of that sort and condemn me  it is none of the natural tragedies of love thats loves usual tragedy in civilized life but a tragedy artificially manufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in parting   it would have been wrong perhaps for me to tell my distress to you if i had been able to tell it to anybody else  but i have nobody  and i must tell somebody  jude before i married him i had never thought out fully what marriage meant even though i knew  it was idiotic of methere is no excuse  i was old enough and i thought i was very experienced  so i rushed on when i had got into that training school scrape with all the cocksureness of the fool that i was   i am certain one ought to be allowed to undo what one had done so ignorantly  i daresay it happens to lots of women only they submit and i kick  when people of a later age look back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of the times that we have the unhappiness to live in what will they say  you are very bitter darling sue  how i wishi wish  you must go in now  in a moment of impulse she bent over the sill and laid her face upon his hair weeping and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little kiss upon the top of his head withdrawing quickly so that he could not put his arms round her as otherwise he unquestionably would have done  she shut the casement and he returned to his cottage    iii   sues distressful confession recurred to judes mind all the night as being a sorrow indeed  the morning after when it was time for her to go the neighbours saw her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path which led into the lonely road to alfredston  an hour passed before he returned along the same route and in his face there was a look of exaltation not unmixed with recklessness  an incident had occurred  they had stood parting in the silent highway and their tense and passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how far their intimacy ought to go till they had almost quarrelled and she said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in embryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he now wished to do  then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss would be nothing all would depend upon the spirit of it  if given in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection if in the spirit of a lover she could not permit it  will you swear that it will not be in that spirit she had said  no he would not  and then they had turned from each other in estrangement and gone their several ways till at a distance of twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously that look behind was fatal to the reserve hitherto more or less maintained  they had quickly run back and met and embracing most unpremeditatedly kissed close and long  when they parted for good it was with flushed cheeks on her side and a beating heart on his  the kiss was a turningpoint in judes career  back again in the cottage and left to reflection he saw one thing that though his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his faultful life as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it was glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded as at its best a frailty and at its worst damnation  what sue had said in warmth was really the cold truth  when to defend his affection tooth and nail to persist with headlong force in impassioned attentions to her was all he thought of he was condemned ipso facto as a professor of the accepted school of morals  he was as unfit obviously by nature as he had been by social position to fill the part of a propounder of accredited dogma  strange that his first aspirationtowards academical proficiencyhad been checked by a woman and that his second aspirationtowards apostleshiphad also been checked by a woman is it he said that the women are to blame or is it the artificial system of things under which the normal seximpulses are turned into devilish domestic gins and springs to noose and hold back those who want to progress  it had been his standing desire to become a prophet however humble to his struggling fellowcreatures without any thought of personal gain  yet with a wife living away from him with another husband and himself in love erratically the loved ones revolt against her state being possibly on his account he had sunk to be barely respectable according to regulation views  it was not for him to consider further he had only to confront the obvious which was that he had made himself quite an impostor as a lawabiding religious teacher  at dusk that evening he went into the garden and dug a shallow hole to which he brought out all the theological and ethical works that he possessed and had stored here  he knew that in this country of true believers most of them were not saleable at a much higher price than wastepaper value and preferred to get rid of them in his own way even if he should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of thus destroying them  lighting some loose pamphlets to begin with he cut the volumes into pieces as well as he could and with a threepronged fork shook them over the flames  they kindled and lighted up the back of the house the pigsty and his own face till they were more or less consumed  though he was almost a stranger here now passing cottagers talked to him over the garden hedge  burning up your awld aunts rubbidge i suppose  ay a lot gets heaped up in nooks and corners when youve lived eighty years in one house  it was nearly one oclock in the morning before the leaves covers and binding of jeremy taylor butler doddridge paley pusey newman and the rest had gone to ashes but the night was quiet and as he turned and turned the paper shreds with the fork the sense of being no longer a hypocrite to himself afforded his mind a relief which gave him calm  he might go on believing as before but he professed nothing and no longer owned and exhibited engines of faith which as their proprietor he might naturally be supposed to exercise on himself first of all  in his passion for sue he could not stand as an ordinary sinner and not as a whited sepulchre  meanwhile sue after parting from him earlier in the day had gone along to the station with tears in her eyes for having run back and let him kiss her  jude ought not to have pretended that he was not a lover and made her give way to an impulse to act unconventionally if not wrongly  she was inclined to call it the latter for sues logic was extraordinarily compounded and seemed to maintain that before a thing was done it might be right to do but that being done it became wrong or in other words that things which were right in theory were wrong in practice  i have been too weak i think she jerked out as she pranced on shaking down teardrops now and then  it was burning like a loversoh it was  and i wont write to him any more or at least for a long time to impress him with my dignity  and i hope it will hurt him very muchexpecting a letter tomorrow morning and the next and the next and no letter coming  hell suffer then with suspensewont he thats alland i am very glad of ittears of pity for judes approaching sufferings at her hands mingled with those which had surged up in pity for herself  then the slim little wife of a husband whose person was disagreeable to her the ethereal finenerved sensitive girl quite unfitted by temperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial relation with phillotson possibly with scarce any man walked fitfully along and panted and brought weariness into her eyes by gazing and worrying hopelessly  phillotson met her at the arrival station and seeing that she was troubled thought it must be owing to the depressing effect of her aunts death and funeral  he began telling her of his days doings and how his friend gillingham a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he had not seen for years had called upon him  while ascending to the town seated on the top of the omnibus beside him she said suddenly and with an air of selfchastisement regarding the white road and its bordering bushes of hazel  richardi let mr fawley hold my hand a long while  i dont know whether you think it wrong  he waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould said vaguely oh did you  what did you do that for  i dont know  he wanted to and i let him  i hope it pleased him  i should think it was hardly a novelty  they lapsed into silence  had this been a case in the court of an omniscient judge he might have entered on his notes the curious fact that sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion and had not said a word about the kiss  after tea that evening phillotson sat balancing the school registers she remained in an unusually silent tense and restless condition and at last saying she was tired went to bed early  when phillotson arrived upstairs weary with the drudgery of the attendancenumbers it was a quarter to twelve oclock  entering their chamber which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty miles over the vale of blackmoor and even into outer wessex he went to the window and pressing his face against the pane gazed with hardbreathing fixity into the mysterious darkness which now covered the farreaching scene  he was musing i think he said at last without turning his head that i must get the committee to change the schoolstationer  all the copybooks are sent wrong this time  there was no reply  thinking sue was dozing he went on  and there must be a rearrangement of that ventilator in the classroom  the wind blows down upon my head unmercifully and gives me the earache  as the silence seemed more absolute than ordinarily he turned round the heavy gloomy oak wainscot which extended over the walls upstairs and down in the dilapidated oldgrove place and the massive chimneypiece reaching to the ceiling stood in odd contrast to the new and shining brass bedstead and the new suite of birch furniture that he had bought for her the two styles seeming to nod to each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor  soo he said this being the way in which he pronounced her name  she was not in the bed though she had apparently been therethe clothes on her side being flung back  thinking she might have forgotten some kitchen detail and gone downstairs for a moment to see to it he pulled off his coat and idled quietly enough for a few minutes when finding she did not come he went out upon the landing candle in hand and said again soo  yes came back to him in her voice from the distant kitchen quarter  what are you doing down there at midnighttiring yourself out for nothing  i am not sleepy i am reading and there is a larger fire here  he went to bed  some time in the night he awoke  she was not there even now  lighting a candle he hastily stepped out upon the landing and again called her name  she answered yes as before but the tones were small and confined and whence they came he could not at first understand  under the staircase was a large clothescloset without a window they seemed to come from it  the door was shut but there was no lock or other fastening  phillotson alarmed went towards it wondering if she had suddenly become deranged  what are you doing in there he asked  not to disturb you i came here as it was so late  but theres no bed is there  and no ventilation  why youll be suffocated if you stay all night  oh no i think not  dont trouble about me  but  phillotson seized the knob and pulled at the door  she had fastened it inside with a piece of string which broke at his pull there being no bedstead she had flung down some rugs and made a little nest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet afforded  when he looked in upon her she sprang out of her lair greateyed and trembling  you ought not to have pulled open the door she cried excitedly it is not becoming in you  oh will you go away please will you  she looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the shadowy lumberhole that he was quite worried  she continued to beseech him not to disturb her  he said ive been kind to you and given you every liberty and it is monstrous that you should feel in this way  yes said she weeping  i know that  it is wrong and wicked of me i suppose  i am very sorry  but it is not i altogether that am to blame  who is then  am i  noi dont know  the universe i supposethings in general because they are so horrid and cruel  well it is no use talking like that  making a mans house so unseemly at this time o night  eliza will hear if we dont mind he meant the servant  just think if either of the parsons in this town was to see us now  i hate such eccentricities sue  theres no order or regularity in your sentiments   but i wont intrude on you further only i would advise you not to shut the door too tight or i shall find you stifled tomorrow  on rising the next morning he immediately looked into the closet but sue had already gone downstairs  there was a little nest where she had lain and spiders webs hung overhead  what must a womans aversion be when it is stronger than her fear of spiders he said bitterly  he found her sitting at the breakfasttable and the meal began almost in silence the burghers walking past upon the pavementor rather roadway pavements being scarce herewhich was two or three feet above the level of the parlour floor  they nodded down to the happy couple their morning greetings as they went on  richard she said all at once would you mind my living away from you  away from me  why thats what you were doing when i married you what then was the meaning of marrying at all  you wouldnt like me any the better for telling you  i dont object to know  because i thought i could do nothing else  you had got my promise a long time before that remember  then as time went on i regretted i had promised you and was trying to see an honourable way to break it off  but as i couldnt i became rather reckless and careless about the conventions  then you know what scandals were spread and how i was turned out of the training school you had taken such time and trouble to prepare me for and get me into and this frightened me and it seemed then that the one thing i could do would be to let the engagement stand  of course i of all people ought not to have cared what was said for it was just what i fancied i never did care for  but i was a cowardas so many women areand my theoretic unconventionality broke down  if that had not entered into the case it would have been better to have hurt your feelings once for all then than to marry you and hurt them all my life after  and you were so generous in never giving credit for a moment to the rumour  i am bound in honesty to tell you that i weighed its probability and inquired of your cousin about it  ah she said with pained surprise  i didnt doubt you  but you inquired  i took his word  her eyes had filled  he wouldnt have inquired she said but you havent answered me  will you let me go away  i know how irregular it is of me to ask it  it is irregular  but i do ask it  domestic laws should be made according to temperaments which should be classified  if people are at all peculiar in character they have to suffer from the very rules that produce comfort in others   will you let me  but we married  what is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances she burst out if they make you miserable when you know you are committing no sin  but you are committing a sin in not liking me  i do like you  but i didnt reflect it would bethat it would be so much more than that  for a man and woman to live on intimate terms when one feels as i do is adultery in any circumstances however legal  thereive said it   will you let me richard  you distress me susanna by such importunity  why cant we agree to free each other  we made the compact and surely we can cancel itnot legally of course but we can morally especially as no new interests in the shape of children have arisen to be looked after  then we might be friends and meet without pain to either  oh richard be my friend and have pity  we shall both be dead in a few years and then what will it matter to anybody that you relieved me from constraint for a little while  i daresay you think me eccentric or supersensitive or something absurd  wellwhy should i suffer for what i was born to be if it doesnt hurt other people  but it doesit hurts me  and you vowed to love me  yesthats it  i am in the wrong  i always am  it is as culpable to bind yourself to love always as to believe a creed always and as silly as to vow always to like a particular food or drink  and do you mean by living away from me living by yourself  well if you insisted yes  but i meant living with jude  as his wife  as i choose  phillotson writhed  sue continued she or he who lets the world or his own portion of it choose his plan of life for him has no need of any other faculty than the apelike one of imitation  j s mills words those are  i have been reading it up  why cant you act upon them i wish to always  what do i care about j s mill moaned he  i only want to lead a quiet life  do you mind my saying that i have guessed what never once occurred to me before our marriagethat you were in love and are in love with jude fawley  you may go on guessing that i am since you have begun  but do you suppose that if i had been i should have asked you to let me go and live with him  the ringing of the school bell saved phillotson from the necessity of replying at present to what apparently did not strike him as being such a convincing argumentum ad verecundiam as she in her loss of courage at the last moment meant it to appear  she was beginning to be so puzzling and unstateable that he was ready to throw in with her other little peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could make  they proceeded to the schools that morning as usual sue entering the classroom where he could see the back of her head through the glass partition whenever he turned his eyes that way  as he went on giving and hearing lessons his forehead and eyebrows twitched from concentrated agitation of thought till at length he tore a scrap from a sheet of scribbling paper and wrote      your request prevents my attending to work at all  i dont    know what i am doing  was it seriously made   he folded the piece of paper very small and gave it to a little boy to take to sue  the child toddled off into the classroom phillotson saw his wife turn and take the note and the bend of her pretty head as she read it her lips slightly crisped to prevent undue expression under fire of so many young eyes  he could not see her hands but she changed her position and soon the child returned bringing nothing in reply  in a few minutes however one of sues class appeared with a little note similar to his own  these words only were pencilled therein      i am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made   phillotson looked more disturbed than before and the meetingplace of his brows twitched again  in ten minutes he called up the child he had just sent to her and dispatched another missive      god knows i dont want to thwart you in any reasonable way    my whole thought is to make you comfortable and happy  but    i cannot agree to such a preposterous notion as your going    to live with your lover  you would lose everybodys respect    and regard and so should i   after an interval a similar part was enacted in the classroom and an answer came      i know you mean my good  but i dont want to be respectable    to produce human development in its richest diversity to    quote your humboldt is to my mind far above respectability    no doubt my tastes are lowin your viewhopelessly low    if you won t let me go to him will you grant me this one    requestallow me to live in your house in a separate way   to this he returned no answer  she wrote again      i know what you think  but cannot you have pity on me  i beg    you to i implore you to be merciful  i would not ask if i    were not almost compelled by what i cant bear  no poor woman    has ever wished more than i that eve had not fallen so that    as the primitive christians believed some harmless mode of    vegetation might have peopled paradise  but i wont trifle    be kind to meeven though i have not been kind to you  i    will go away go abroad anywhere and never trouble you   nearly an hour passed and then he returned an answer      i do not wish to pain you  how well you know i dont give me    a little time  i am disposed to agree to your last request   one line from her      thank you from my heart richard  i do not deserve your    kindness   all day phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her through the glazed partition and he felt as lonely as when he had not known her  but he was as good as his word and consented to her living apart in the house  at first when they met at meals she had seemed more composed under the new arrangement but the irksomeness of their position worked on her temperament and the fibres of her nature seemed strained like harpstrings  she talked vaguely and indiscriminately to prevent his talking pertinently    iv   phillotson was sitting up late as was often his custom trying to get together the materials for his longneglected hobby of roman antiquities  for the first time since reviving the subject he felt a return of his old interest in it  he forgot time and place and when he remembered himself and ascended to rest it was nearly two oclock  his preoccupation was such that though he now slept on the other side of the house he mechanically went to the room that he and his wife had occupied when he first became a tenant of oldgrove place which since his differences with sue had been hers exclusively he entered and unconsciously began to undress  there was a cry from the bed and a quick movement  before the schoolmaster had realized where he was he perceived sue starting up halfawake staring wildly and springing out upon the floor on the side away from him which was towards the window  this was somewhat hidden by the canopy of the bedstead and in a moment he heard her flinging up the sash  before he had thought that she meant to do more than get air she had mounted upon the sill and leapt out  she disappeared in the darkness and he heard her fall below  phillotson horrified ran downstairs striking himself sharply against the newel in his haste  opening the heavy door he ascended the two or three steps to the level of the ground and there on the gravel before him lay a white heap  phillotson seized it in his arms and bringing sue into the hall seated her on a chair where he gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set down in the draught on the bottom stair  she had certainly not broken her neck  she looked at him with eyes that seemed not to take him in and though not particularly large in general they appeared so now  she pressed her side and rubbed her arm as if conscious of pain then stood up averting her face in evident distress at his gaze  thank godyou are not killed  though its not for want of tryingnot much hurt i hope  her fall in fact had not been a serious one probably owing to the lowness of the old rooms and to the high level of the ground without beyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she had apparently incurred little harm  i was asleep i think she began her pale face still turned away from him  and something frightened mea terrible dreami thought i saw you  the actual circumstances seemed to come back to her and she was silent  her cloak was hanging at the back of the door and the wretched phillotson flung it round her  shall i help you upstairs he asked drearily for the significance of all this sickened him of himself and of everything  no thank you richard  i am very little hurt  i can walk  you ought to lock your door he mechanically said as if lecturing in school  then no one could intrude even by accident  i have triedit wont lock  all the doors are out of order  the aspect of things was not improved by her admission  she ascended the staircase slowly the waving light of the candle shining on her phillotson did not approach her or attempt to ascend himself till he heard her enter her room  then he fastened up the front door and returning sat down on the lower stairs holding the newel with one hand and bowing his face into the other  thus he remained for a long long timea pitiable object enough to one who had seen him till raising his head and sighing a sigh which seemed to say that the business of his life must be carried on whether he had a wife or no he took the candle and went upstairs to his lonely room on the other side of the landing  no further incident touching the matter between them occurred till the following evening when immediately school was over phillotson walked out of shaston saying he required no tea and not informing sue where he was going  he descended from the town level by a steep road in a northwesterly direction and continued to move downwards till the soil changed from its white dryness to a tough brown clay he was now on the low alluvial beds      where duncliffe is the travellers mark    and cloty stours arolling dark   more than once he looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening against the sky was shaston dimly visible      on the greytoppd height    of paladore as pale day wore    away william barnes   the newlit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine as if watching him one of which windows was his own  above it he could just discern the pinnacled tower of trinity church  the air down here tempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay was not as it had been above but soft and relaxing so that when he had walked a mile or two he was obliged to wipe his face with his handkerchief  leaving duncliffe hill on the left he proceeded without hesitation through the shade as a man goes on night or day in a district over which he has played as a boy  he had walked altogether about four and a half miles      where stour receives her strength    from six cleere fountains fed drayton   when he crossed a tributary of the stour and reached leddentona little town of three or four thousand inhabitantswhere he went on to the boys school and knocked at the door of the masters residence  a boy pupilteacher opened it and to phillotsons inquiry if mr gillingham was at home replied that he was going at once off to his own house and leaving phillotson to find his way in as he could  he discovered his friend putting away some books from which he had been giving evening lessons  the light of the paraffin lamp fell on phillotsons facepale and wretched by contrast with his friends who had a cool practical look  they had been schoolmates in boyhood and fellowstudents at wintoncester training college many years before this time  glad to see you dick  but you dont look well  nothing the matter  phillotson advanced without replying and gillingham closed the cupboard and pulled up beside his visitor  why you havent been herelet me seesince you were married i called you know but you were out and upon my word it is such a climb after dark that i have been waiting till the days are longer before lumpering up again  i am glad you didnt wait however  though welltrained and even proficient masters they occasionally used a dialectword of their boyhood to each other in private  ive come george to explain to you my reasons for taking a step that i am about to take so that you at least will understand my motives if other people question them anywhenas they may indeed certainly will  but anything is better than the present condition of things  god forbid that you should ever have such an experience as mine  sit down  you dont meananything wrong between you and mrs phillotson  i do  my wretched state is that ive a wife i love who not only does not love me butbut  well i wont say  i know her feeling  i should prefer hatred from her  ssh  and the sad part of it is that she is not so much to blame as i she was a pupilteacher under me as you know and i took advantage of her inexperience and toled her out for walks and got her to agree to a long engagement before she well knew her own mind  afterwards she saw somebody else but she blindly fulfilled her engagement  loving the other  yes with a curious tender solicitude seemingly though her exact feeling for him is a riddle to meand to him too i thinkpossibly to herself  she is one of the oddest creatures i ever met  however i have been struck with these two facts the extraordinary sympathy or similarity between the pair  he is her cousin which perhaps accounts for some of it  they seem to be one person split in two and with her unconquerable aversion to myself as a husband even though she may like me as a friend tis too much to bear longer she has conscientiously struggled against it but to no purpose i cannot bear iti cannot  i cant answer her argumentsshe has read ten times as much as i  her intellect sparkles like diamonds while mine smoulders like brown paper  shes one too many for me  shell get over it goodnow  never  it isbut i wont go into itthere are reasons why she never will  at last she calmly and firmly asked if she might leave me and go to him  the climax came last night when owing to my entering her room by accident she jumped out of windowso strong was her dread of me  she pretended it was a dream but that was to soothe me  now when a woman jumps out of window without caring whether she breaks her neck or no shes not to be mistaken and this being the case i have come to a conclusion that it is wrong to so torture a fellowcreature any longer and i wont be the inhuman wretch to do it cost what it may  whatyoull let her go  and with her lover  whom with is her matter  i shall let her go with him certainly if she wishes  i know i may be wrongi know i cant logically or religiously defend my concession to such a wish of hers or harmonize it with the doctrines i was brought up in  only i know one thing something within me tells me i am doing wrong in refusing her  i like other men profess to hold that if a husband gets such a socalled preposterous request from his wife the only course that can possibly be regarded as right and proper and honourable in him is to refuse it and put her virtuously under lock and key and murder her lover perhaps  but is that essentially right and proper and honourable or is it contemptibly mean and selfish  i dont profess to decide  i simply am going to act by instinct and let principles take care of themselves  if a person who has blindly walked into a quagmire cries for help i am inclined to give it if possible  butyou see theres the question of neighbours and societywhat will happen if everybody  oh i am not going to be a philosopher any longer  i only see whats under my eyes  welli dont agree with your instinct dick said gillingham gravely  i am quite amazed to tell the truth that such a sedate plodding fellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a moment  you said when i called that she was puzzling and peculiar i think you are  have you ever stood before a woman whom you know to be intrinsically a good woman while she has pleaded for releasebeen the man she has knelt to and implored indulgence of  i am thankful to say i havent  then i dont think you are in a position to give an opinion  i have been that man and it makes all the difference in the world if one has any manliness or chivalry in him  i had not the remotest idealiving apart from women as i have done for so many yearsthat merely taking a woman to church and putting a ring upon her finger could by any possibility involve one in such a daily continuous tragedy as that now shared by her and me  well i could admit some excuse for letting her leave you provided she kept to herself  but to go attended by a cavalierthat makes a difference  not a bit  suppose as i believe she would rather endure her present misery than be made to promise to keep apart from him all that is a question for herself  it is not the same thing at all as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him false  however she has not distinctly implied living with him as wife though i think she means to  and to the best of my understanding it is not an ignoble merely animal feeling between the two that is the worst of it because it makes me think their affection will be enduring  i did not mean to confess to you that in the first jealous weeks of my marriage before i had come to my right mind i hid myself in the school one evening when they were together there and i heard what they said  i am ashamed of it now though i suppose i was only exercising a legal right  i found from their manner that an extraordinary affinity or sympathy entered into their attachment which somehow took away all flavour of grossness their supreme desire is to be togetherto share each others emotions and fancies and dreams  platonic  well no  shelleyan would be nearer to it  they remind me ofwhat are their nameslaon and cythna  also of paul and virginia a little  the more i reflect the more entirely i am on their side  but if people did as you want to do thered be a general domestic disintegration  the family would no longer be the social unit  yesi am all abroad i suppose said phillotson sadly  i was never a very bright reasoner you remember  and yet i dont see why the woman and the children should not be the unit without the man  by the lord harrymatriarchy   does she say all this too  oh no  she little thinks i have outsued sue in thisall in the last twelve hours  it will upset all received opinion hereabout  good godwhat will shaston say  i dont say that it wont  i dont knowi dont know   as i say i am only a feeler not a reasoner  now said gillingham let us take it quietly and have something to drink over it  he went under the stairs and produced a bottle of ciderwine of which they drank a rummer each  i think you are rafted and not yourself he continued  do go back and make up your mind to put up with a few whims  but keep her  i hear on all sides that shes a charming young thing  ah yes  thats the bitterness of it  well i wont stay  i have a long walk before me  gillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way and at parting expressed his hope that this consultation singular as its subject was would be the renewal of their old comradeship  stick to her were his last words flung into the darkness after phillotson from which his friend answered aye aye  but when phillotson was alone under the clouds of night and no sound was audible but that of the purling tributaries of the stour he said so gillingham my friend you had no stronger arguments against it than those  i think she ought to be smacked and brought to her sensesthats what i think murmured gillingham as he walked back alone  the next morning came and at breakfast phillotson told sue  you may gowith whom you will  i absolutely and unconditionally agree  having once come to this conclusion it seemed to phillotson more and more indubitably the true one  his mild serenity at the sense that he was doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy almost overpowered his grief at relinquishing her  some days passed and the evening of their last meal together had comea cloudy evening with windwhich indeed was very seldom absent in this elevated place  how permanently it was imprinted upon his vision that look of her as she glided into the parlour to tea a slim flexible figure a face strained from its roundness and marked by the pallors of restless days and nights suggesting tragic possibilities quite at variance with her times of buoyancy a trying of this morsel and that and an inability to eat either  her nervous manner begotten of a fear lest he should be injured by her course might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure that phillotson intruded his presence on her for the few brief minutes that remained  you had better have a slice of ham or an egg or something with your tea  you cant travel on a mouthful of bread and butter  she took the slice he helped her to and they discussed as they sat trivial questions of housekeeping such as where he would find the key of this or that cupboard what little bills were paid and what not  i am a bachelor by nature as you know sue he said in a heroic attempt to put her at her ease  so that being without a wife will not really be irksome to me as it might be to other men who have had one a little while  i have too this grand hobby in my head of writing the roman antiquities of wessex which will occupy all my spare hours  if you will send me some of the manuscript to copy at any time as you used to i will do it with so much pleasure she said with amenable gentleness  i should much like to be some help to you stillas afriend  phillotson mused and said no i think we ought to be really separate if we are to be at all  and for this reason that i dont wish to ask you any questions and particularly wish you not to give me information as to your movements or even your address  now what money do you want  you must have some you know  oh of course richard i couldnt think of having any of your money to go away from you with  i dont want any either  i have enough of my own to last me for a long while and jude will let me have  i would rather not know anything about him if you dont mind you are free absolutely and your course is your own  very well  but ill just say that i have packed only a change or two of my own personal clothing and one or two little things besides that are my very own  i wish you would look into my trunk before it is closed  besides that i have only a small parcel that will go into judes portmanteau  of course i shall do no such thing as examine your luggage  i wish you would take threequarters of the household furniture  i dont want to be bothered with it  i have a sort of affection for a little of it that belonged to my poor mother and father  but the rest you are welcome to whenever you like to send for it  that i shall never do  you go by the sixthirty train dont you  it is now a quarter to six  you  you dont seem very sorry i am going richard  oh noperhaps not  i like you much for how you have behaved  it is a curious thing that directly i have begun to regard you as not my husband but as my old teacher i like you  i wont be so affected as to say i love you because you know i dont except as a friend  but you do seem that to me  sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections and then the station omnibus came round to take her up  phillotson saw her things put on the top handed her in and was obliged to make an appearance of kissing her as he wished her goodbye which she quite understood and imitated  from the cheerful manner in which they parted the omnibusman had no other idea than that she was going for a short visit  when phillotson got back into the house he went upstairs and opened the window in the direction the omnibus had taken  soon the noise of its wheels died away  he came down then his face compressed like that of one bearing pain he put on his hat and went out following by the same route for nearly a mile  suddenly turning round he came home  he had no sooner entered than the voice of his friend gillingham greeted him from the front room  i could make nobody hear so finding your door open i walked in and made myself comfortable  i said i would call you remember  yes  i am much obliged to you gillingham particularly for coming tonight  how is mrs  she is quite well  she is gonejust gone  thats her teacup that she drank out of only an hour ago  and thats the plate she  phillotsons throat got choked up and he could not go on he turned and pushed the teathings aside  have you had any tea by the by he asked presently in a renewed voice  noyesnever mind said gillingham preoccupied  gone you say she is  yes  i would have died for her but i wouldnt be cruel to her in the name of the law  she is as i understand gone to join her lover  what they are going to do i cannot say  whatever it may be she has my full consent to  there was a stability a ballast in phillotsons pronouncement which restrained his friends comment  shall ileave you he asked  no no  it is a mercy to me that you have come  i have some articles to arrange and clear away  would you help me  gillingham assented and having gone to the upper rooms the schoolmaster opened drawers and began taking out all sues things that she had left behind and laying them in a large box  she wouldnt take all i wanted her to he continued  but when i made up my mind to her going to live in her own way i did make up my mind  some men would have stopped at an agreement to separate  ive gone into all that and dont wish to argue it  i was and am the most oldfashioned man in the world on the question of marriagein fact i had never thought critically about its ethics at all  but certain facts stared me in the face and i couldnt go against them  they went on with the packing silently  when it was done phillotson closed the box and turned the key  there he said  to adorn her in somebodys eyes never again in mine    v   fourandtwenty hours before this time sue had written the following note to jude      it is as i told you and i am leaving tomorrow evening    richard and i thought it could be done with less    obtrusiveness after dark  i feel rather frightened and    therefore ask you to be sure you are on the melchester    platform to meet me  i arrive at a little to seven  i    know you will of course dear jude but i feel so timid    that i cant help begging you to be punctual  he has    been so very kind to me through it all     now to our meeting     s   as she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from the mountain townthe single passenger that eveningshe regarded the receding road with a sad face  but no hesitation was apparent therein  the uptrain by which she was departing stopped by signal only  to sue it seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway train should be brought to a standstill on purpose for hera fugitive from her lawful home  the twenty minutes journey drew towards its close and sue began gathering her things together to alight  at the moment that the train came to a standstill by the melchester platform a hand was laid on the door and she beheld jude  he entered the compartment promptly  he had a black bag in his hand and was dressed in the dark suit he wore on sundays and in the evening after work altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow his ardent affection for her burning in his eyes  oh jude  she clasped his hand with both hers and her tense state caused her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs  ii am so glad  i get out here  no i get in dear one  ive packed  besides this bag ive only a big box which is labelled  but dont i get out  arent we going to stay here  we couldnt possibly dont you see  we are known herei at any rate am well known  ive booked for aldbrickham and heres your ticket for the same place as you have only one to here  i thought we should have stayed here she repeated  it wouldnt have done at all  ah  perhaps not  there wasnt time for me to write and say the place i had decided on  aldbrickham is a much bigger townsixty or seventy thousand inhabitantsand nobody knows anything about us there  and you have given up your cathedral work here  yes  it was rather suddenyour message coming unexpectedly strictly i might have been made to finish out the week  but i pleaded urgency and i was let off  i would have deserted any day at your command dear sue  i have deserted more than that for you  i fear i am doing you a lot of harm  ruining your prospects of the church ruining your progress in your trade everything  the church is no more to me  let it lie  i am not to be one of         the soldiersaints who row on row    burn upward each to his point of bliss   if any such there be  my point of bliss is not upward but here  oh i seem so badupsetting mens courses like this said she taking up in her voice the emotion that had begun in his  but she recovered her equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen miles  he has been so good in letting me go she resumed  and heres a note i found on my dressingtable addressed to you  yes  hes not an unworthy fellow said jude glancing at the note and i am ashamed of myself for hating him because he married you  according to the rule of womens whims i suppose i ought to suddenly love him because he has let me go so generously and unexpectedly she answered smiling  but i am so cold or devoid of gratitude or so something that even this generosity hasnt made me love him or repent or want to stay with him as his wife although i do feel i like his largemindedness and respect him more than ever  it may not work so well for us as if he had been less kind and you had run away against his will murmured jude  that i never would have done  judes eyes rested musingly on her face  then he suddenly kissed her and was going to kiss her again  noonly once nowplease jude  thats rather cruel he answered but acquiesced  such a strange thing has happened to me jude continued after a silence  arabella has actually written to ask me to get a divorce from herin kindness to her she says  she wants to honestly and legally marry that man she has already married virtually and begs me to enable her to do it  what have you done  i have agreed  i thought at first i couldnt do it without getting her into trouble about that second marriage and i dont want to injure her in any way  perhaps shes no worse than i am after all but nobody knows about it over here and i find it will not be a difficult proceeding at all  if she wants to start afresh i have only too obvious reasons for not hindering her  then youll be free  yes i shall be free  where are we booked for she asked with the discontinuity that marked her tonight  aldbrickham as i said  but it will be very late when we get there  yes  i thought of that and i wired for a room for us at the temperance hotel there  one  yesone  she looked at him  oh jude  sue bent her forehead against the corner of the compartment  i thought you might do it and that i was deceiving you  but i didnt mean that  in the pause which followed judes eyes fixed themselves with a stultified expression on the opposite seat  well he said  well  he remained in silence and seeing how discomfited he was she put her face against his cheek murmuring dont be vexed dear  ohtheres no harm done he said  buti understood it like that  is this a sudden change of mind  you have no right to ask me such a question and i shant answer she said smiling  my dear one your happiness is more to me than anythingalthough we seem to verge on quarrelling so oftenand your will is law to me i am something more than a mereselfish fellow i hope  have it as you wish  on reflection his brow showed perplexity  but perhaps it is that you dont love menot that you have become conventional much as under your teaching i hate convention i hope it is that not the other terrible alternative  even at this obvious moment for candour sue could not be quite candid as to the state of that mystery her heart  put it down to my timidity she said with hurried evasiveness to a womans natural timidity when the crisis comes  i may feel as well as you that i have a perfect right to live with you as you thoughtfrom this moment  i may hold the opinion that in a proper state of society the father of a womans child will be as much a private matter of hers as the cut of her underlinen on whom nobody will have any right to question her  but partly perhaps because it is by his generosity that i am now free i would rather not be other than a little rigid  if there had been a ropeladder and he had run after us with pistols it would have seemed different and i may have acted otherwise  but dont press me and criticize me jude  assume that i havent the courage of my opinions  i know i am a poor miserable creature  my nature is not so passionate as yours  he repeated simply  i thoughtwhat i naturally thought  but if we are not lovers we are not  phillotson thought so i am sure  see here is what he has written to me  he opened the letter she had brought and read  i make only one conditionthat you are tender and kind to her  i know you love her  but even love may be cruel at times  you are made for each other it is obvious palpable to any unbiased older person  you were all along the shadowy third in my short life with her  i repeat take care of sue  hes a good fellow isnt he she said with latent tears  on reconsideration she added he was very resigned to letting me gotoo resigned almost  i never was so near being in love with him as when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable on my journey and offering to provide money  yet i was not  if i loved him ever so little as a wife id go back to him even now  but you dont do you  it is trueoh so terribly truei dont  nor me neither i halffear he said pettishly  nor anybody perhaps  sue sometimes when i am vexed with you i think you are incapable of real love  thats not good and loyal of you she said and drawing away from him as far as she could looked severely out into the darkness  she added in hurt tones without turning round my liking for you is not as some womens perhaps  but it is a delight in being with you of a supremely delicate kind and i dont want to go further and risk it byan attempt to intensify it  i quite realized that as woman with man it was a risk to come  but as me with you i resolved to trust you to set my wishes above your gratification  dont discuss it further dear jude  of course if it would make you reproach yourself but you do like me very much sue  say you do  say that you do a quarter a tenth as much as i do you and ill be content  ive let you kiss me and that tells enough  just once or so  welldont be a greedy boy  he leant back and did not look at her for a long time  that episode in her past history of which she had told himof the poor christminster graduate whom she had handled thus returned to judes mind and he saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing destiny  this is a queer elopement he murmured  perhaps you are making a cats paw of me with phillotson all this time  upon my word it almost seems soto see you sitting up there so prim  now you mustnt be angryi wont let you she coaxed turning and moving nearer to him  you did kiss me just now you know and i didnt dislike you to i own it jude  only i dont want to let you do it again just yetconsidering how we are circumstanced dont you see  he could never resist her when she pleaded as she well knew and they sat side by side with joined hands till she aroused herself at some thought  i cant possibly go to that temperance inn after your telegraphing that message  why not  you can see well enough  very well therell be some other one open no doubt  i have sometimes thought since your marrying phillotson because of a stupid scandal that under the affectation of independent views you are as enslaved to the social code as any woman i know  not mentally  but i havent the courage of my views as i said before  i didnt marry him altogether because of the scandal but sometimes a womans love of being loved gets the better of her conscience and though she is agonized at the thought of treating a man cruelly she encourages him to love her while she doesnt love him at all  then when she sees him suffering her remorse sets in and she does what she can to repair the wrong  you simply mean that you flirted outrageously with him poor old chap and then repented and to make reparation married him though you tortured yourself to death by doing it  wellif you will put it brutallyit was a little like thatthat and the scandal togetherand your concealing from me what you ought to have told me before  he could see that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms and soothed her saying there dear dont mind  crucify me if you will  you know you are all the world to me whatever you do  i am very bad and unprincipledi know you think that she said trying to blink away her tears  i think and know you are my dear sue from whom neither length nor breadth nor things present nor things to come can divide me  though so sophisticated in many things she was such a child in others that this satisfied her and they reached the end of their journey on the best of terms  it was about ten oclock when they arrived at aldbrickham the county town of north wessex  as she would not go to the temperance hotel because of the form of his telegram jude inquired for another and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled their luggage to the george farther on which proved to be the inn at which jude had stayed with arabella on that one occasion of their meeting after their division for years  owing however to their now entering it by another door and to his preoccupation he did not at first recognize the place  when they had engaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper during judes temporary absence the waitingmaid spoke to sue  i think maam i remember your relation or friend or whatever he is coming here once beforelate just like this with his wifea lady at any rate that wasnt you by no manner of meansjest as med be with you now  oh do you said sue with a certain sickness of heart  though i think you must be mistaken  how long ago was it  about a month or two  a handsome fullfigured woman  they had this room  when jude came back and sat down to supper sue seemed moping and miserable  jude she said to him plaintively at their parting that night upon the landing it is not so nice and pleasant as it used to be with us  i dont like it herei cant bear the place and i dont like you so well as i did  how fidgeted you seem dear  why do you change like this  because it was cruel to bring me here  why  you were lately here with arabella  there now i have said it  dear me why said jude looking round him  yesit is the same i really didnt know it sue  wellit is not cruel since we have come as we havetwo relations staying together  how long ago was it you were here  tell me tell me  the day before i met you in christminster when we went back to marygreen together  i told you i had met her  yes you said you had met her but you didnt tell me all  your story was that you had met as estranged people who were not husband and wife at all in heavens sightnot that you had made it up with her  we didnt make it up he said sadly  i cant explain sue  youve been false to me you my last hope  and i shall never forget it never  but by your own wish dear sue we are only to be friends not lovers  it is so very inconsistent of you to  friends can be jealous  i dont see that  you concede nothing to me and i have to concede everything to you  after all you were on good terms with your husband at that time  no i wasnt jude  oh how can you think so  and you have taken me in even if you didnt intend to  she was so mortified that he was obliged to take her into her room and close the door lest the people should hear  was it this room  yes it wasi see by your look it was  i wont have it for mine  oh it was treacherous of you to have her again  i jumped out of the window  but sue she was after all my legal wife if not  slipping down on her knees sue buried her face in the bed and wept  i never knew such an unreasonablesuch a doginthemanger feeling said jude  i am not to approach you nor anybody else  oh dont you understand my feeling  why dont you  why are you so gross  i jumped out of the window  jumped out of window  i cant explain  it was true that he did not understand her feelings very well  but he did a little and began to love her none the less  ii thought you cared for nobodydesired nobody in the world but me at that timeand ever since continued sue  it is true  i did not and dont now said jude as distressed as she  but you must have thought much of her  or  noi need notyou dont understand me eitherwomen never do  why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing  looking up from the quilt she pouted provokingly if it hadnt been for that perhaps i would have gone on to the temperance hotel after all as you proposed for i was beginning to think i did belong to you  oh it is of no consequence said jude distantly  i thought of course that she had never been really your wife since she left you of her own accord years and years ago  my sense of it was that a parting such as yours from her and mine from him ended the marriage  i cant say more without speaking against her and i dont want to do that said he  yet i must tell you one thing which would settle the matter in any case  she has married another manreally married him  i knew nothing about it till after the visit we made here  married another   it is a crimeas the world treats it but does not believe  therenow you are yourself again  yes it is a crimeas you dont hold but would fearfully concede  but i shall never inform against her  and it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led her to urge me to get a divorce that she may remarry this man legally  so you perceive i shall not be likely to see her again  and you didnt really know anything of this when you saw her said sue more gently as she rose  i did not  considering all things i dont think you ought to be angry darling  i am not  but i shant go to the temperance hotel  he laughed  never mind he said  so that i am near you i am comparatively happy  it is more than this earthly wretch called me deservesyou spirit you disembodied creature you dear sweet tantalizing phantomhardly flesh at all so that when i put my arms round you i almost expect them to pass through you as through air forgive me for being gross as you call it  remember that our calling cousins when really strangers was a snare  the enmity of our parents gave a piquancy to you in my eyes that was intenser even than the novelty of ordinary new acquaintance  say those pretty lines then from shelleys epipsychidion as if they meant me she solicited slanting up closer to him as they stood  dont you know them  i know hardly any poetry he replied mournfully  dont you  these are some of them      there was a being whom my spirit oft    met on its visioned wanderings far aloft                                  a seraph of heaven too gentle to be human    veiling beneath that radiant form of woman   oh it is too flattering so i wont go on  but say its me  say its me  it is you dear exactly like you  now i forgive you  and you shall kiss me just once therenot very long  she put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek and he did as commanded  you do care for me very much dont you in spite of my notyou know  yes sweet he said with a sigh and bade her goodnight    vi   in returning to his native town of shaston as schoolmaster phillotson had won the interest and awakened the memories of the inhabitants who though they did not honour him for his miscellaneous aquirements as he would have been honoured elsewhere retained for him a sincere regard  when shortly after his arrival he brought home a pretty wifeawkwardly pretty for him if he did not take care they saidthey were glad to have her settle among them  for some time after her flight from that home sues absence did not excite comment  her place as monitor in the school was taken by another young woman within a few days of her vacating it which substitution also passed without remark sues services having been of a provisional nature only  when however a month had passed and phillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he did not know where his wife was staying curiosity began to be aroused till jumping to conclusions people ventured to affirm that sue had played him false and run away from him  the schoolmasters growing languor and listlessness over his work gave countenance to the idea  though phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could except to his friend gillingham his honesty and directness would not allow him to do so when misapprehensions as to sues conduct spread abroad on a monday morning the chairman of the school committee called and after attending to the business of the school drew phillotson aside out of earshot of the children  youll excuse my asking phillotson since everybody is talking of it is this true as to your domestic affairsthat your wifes going away was on no visit but a secret elopement with a lover  if so i condole with you  dont said phillotson  there was no secret about it  she has gone to visit friends  no  then what has happened  she has gone away under circumstances that usually call for condolence with the husband  but i gave my consent  the chairman looked as if he had not apprehended the remark  what i say is quite true phillotson continued testily  she asked leave to go away with her lover and i let her  why shouldnt i  a woman of full age it was a question of her own consciencenot for me  i was not her gaoler  i cant explain any further  i dont wish to be questioned  the children observed that much seriousness marked the faces of the two men and went home and told their parents that something new had happened about mrs phillotson  then phillotsons little maidservant who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards said that mr phillotson had helped in his wifes packing had offered her what money she required and had written a friendly letter to her young man telling him to take care of her  the chairman of committee thought the matter over and talked to the other managers of the school till a request came to phillotson to meet them privately  the meeting lasted a long time and at the end the schoolmaster came home looking as usual pale and worn  gillingham was sitting in his house awaiting him  well it is as you said observed phillotson flinging himself down wearily in a chair  they have requested me to send in my resignation on account of my scandalous conduct in giving my tortured wife her libertyor as they call it condoning her adultery  but i shant resign  i think i would  i wont it is no business of theirs  it doesnt affect me in my public capacity at all  they may expel me if they like  if you make a fuss it will get into the papers and youll never get appointed to another school  you see they have to consider what you did as done by a teacher of youthand its effects as such upon the morals of the town and to ordinary opinion your position is indefensible  you must let me say that  to this good advice however phillotson would not listen  i dont care he said  i dont go unless i am turned out  and for this reason that by resigning i acknowledge i have acted wrongly by her when i am more and more convinced every day that in the sight of heaven and by all natural straightforward humanity i have acted rightly  gillingham saw that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to maintain such a position as this but he said nothing further and in due timeindeed in a quarter of an hourthe formal letter of dismissal arrived the managers having remained behind to write it after phillotsons withdrawal  the latter replied that he should not accept dismissal and called a public meeting which he attended although he looked so weak and ill that his friend implored him to stay at home  when he stood up to give his reasons for contesting the decision of the managers he advanced them firmly as he had done to his friend and contended moreover that the matter was a domestic theory which did not concern them  this they overruled insisting that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite within their sphere of control as it touched the morals of those he taught  phillotson replied that he did not see how an act of natural charity could injure morals  all the respectable inhabitants and welltodo fellownatives of the town were against phillotson to a man  but somewhat to his surprise some dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from the ground  it has been stated that shaston was the anchorage of a curious and interesting group of itinerants who frequented the numerous fairs and markets held up and down wessex during the summer and autumn months  although phillotson had never spoken to one of these gentlemen they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his defence the body included two cheap jacks a shootinggallery proprietor and the ladies who loaded the guns a pair of boxingmasters a steamroundabout manager two travelling broommakers who called themselves widows a gingerbreadstall keeper a swingboat owner and a testyourstrength man  this generous phalanx of supporters and a few others of independent judgment whose own domestic experiences had been not without vicissitude came up and warmly shook hands with phillotson after which they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that issue was joined the result being a general scuffle wherein a black board was split three panes of the school windows were broken an inkbottle was spilled over a towncouncillors shirt front a churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of palestine that his head went right through samaria and many black eyes and bleeding noses were given one of which to everybodys horror was the venerable incumbents owing to the zeal of an emancipated chimneysweep who took the side of phillotsons party  when phillotson saw the blood running down the rectors face he deplored almost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances regretted that he had not resigned when called upon and went home so ill that next morning he could not leave his bed  the farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious illness for him and he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state of mind of a middleaged man who perceives at length that his life intellectual and domestic is tending to failure and gloom gillingham came to see him in the evenings and on one occasion mentioned sues name  she doesnt care anything about me said phillotson  why should she  she doesnt know you are ill  so much the better for both of us  where are her lover and she living  at melchesteri suppose at least he was living there some time ago  when gillingham reached home he sat and reflected and at last wrote an anonymous line to sue on the bare chance of its reaching her the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to jude at the diocesan capital  arriving at that place it was forwarded to marygreen in north wessex and thence to aldbrickham by the only person who knew his present addressthe widow who had nursed his aunt  three days later in the evening when the sun was going down in splendour over the lowlands of blackmoor and making the shaston windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale the sick man fancied that he heard somebody come to the house and a few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door  phillotson did not speak the door was hesitatingly opened and there enteredsue  she was in light spring clothing and her advent seemed ghostlylike the flitting in of a moth  he turned his eyes upon her and flushed but appeared to check his primary impulse to speak  i have no business here she said bending her frightened face to him  but i heard you were illvery ill andand as i know that you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical love i have come  i am not very ill my dear friend  only unwell  i didnt know that and i am afraid that only a severe illness would have justified my coming  yes yes  and i almost wish you had not come  it is a little too soonthats all i mean  still let us make the best of it  you havent heard about the school i suppose  nowhat about it  only that i am going away from here to another place  the managers and i dont agree and we are going to partthats all  sue did not for a moment either now or later suspect what troubles had resulted to him from letting her go it never once seemed to cross her mind and she had received no news whatever from shaston they talked on slight and ephemeral subjects and when his tea was brought up he told the amazed little servant that a cup was to be set for sue  that young person was much more interested in their history than they supposed and as she descended the stairs she lifted her eyes and hands in grotesque amazement  while they sipped sue went to the window and thoughtfully said it is such a beautiful sunset richard  they are mostly beautiful from here owing to the rays crossing the mist of the vale  but i lose them all as they dont shine into this gloomy corner where i lie  wouldnt you like to see this particular one  it is like heaven opened  ah yes  but i cant  ill help you to  nothe bedstead cant be shifted  but see how i mean  she went to where a swingglass stood and taking it in her hands carried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine moving the glass till the beams were reflected into phillotsons face  thereyou can see the great red sun now she said  and i am sure it will cheer youi do so hope it will  she spoke with a childlike repentant kindness as if she could not do too much for him  phillotson smiled sadly  you are an odd creature he murmured as the sun glowed in his eyes  the idea of your coming to see me after what has passed  dont let us go back upon that she said quickly  i have to catch the omnibus for the train as jude doesnt know i have come he was out when i started so i must return home almost directly  richard i am so very glad you are better  you dont hate me do you  you have been such a kind friend to me  i am glad to know you think so said phillotson huskily  no i dont hate you  it grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent chat and when candles were brought and it was time to leave she put her hand in his or rather allowed it to flit through his for she was significantly light in touch  she had nearly closed the door when he said sue  he had noticed that in turning away from him tears were on her face and a quiver in her lip  it was bad policy to recall herhe knew it while he pursued it but he could not help it  she came back  sue he murmured do you wish to make it up and stay  ill forgive you and condone everything  oh you cant you cant she said hastily  you cant condone it now  he is your husband now in effect you mean of course  you may assume it  he is obtaining a divorce from his wife arabella  his wife  it is altogether news to me that he has a wife  it was a bad marriage  like yours  like mine  he is not doing it so much on his own account as on hers  she wrote and told him it would be a kindness to her since then she could marry and live respectably  and jude has agreed  a wife  a kindness to her  ah yes a kindness to her to release her altogether  but i dont like the sound of it  i can forgive sue  no no  you cant have me back now i have been so wickedas to do what i have done  there had arisen in sues face that incipient fright which showed itself whenever he changed from friend to husband and which made her adopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him  i must go now  ill come againmay i  i dont ask you to go even now  i ask you to stay  i thank you richard but i must  as you are not so ill as i thought i cannot stay  shes hishis from lips to heel said phillotson but so faintly that in closing the door she did not hear it  the dread of a reactionary change in the schoolmasters sentiments coupled perhaps with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him know what a slipshod lack of thoroughness from a mans point of view characterized her transferred allegiance prevented her telling him of her thus far incomplete relations with jude and phillotson lay writhing like a man in hell as he pictured the prettily dressed maddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his name returning impatiently to the home of her lover  gillingham was so interested in phillotsons affairs and so seriously concerned about him that he walked up the hillside to shaston two or three times a week although there and back it was a journey of nine miles which had to be performed between tea and supper after a hard days work in school  when he called on the next occasion after sues visit his friend was downstairs and gillingham noticed that his restless mood had been supplanted by a more fixed and composed one  shes been here since you called last said phillotson  not mrs phillotson  yes  ah  you have made it up  no  she just came patted my pillow with her little white hand played the thoughtful nurse for half an hour and went away  wellim hanged  a little hussy  what do you say  ohnothing  what do you mean  i mean what a tantalizing capricious little woman  if she were not your wife  she is not shes another mans except in name and law  and i have been thinkingit was suggested to me by a conversation i had with herthat in kindness to her i ought to dissolve the legal tie altogether which singularly enough i think i can do now she has been back and refused my request to stay after i said i had forgiven her  i believe that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it though i did not see it at the moment  whats the use of keeping her chained on to me if she doesnt belong to me  i knowi feel absolutely certainthat she would welcome my taking such a step as the greatest charity to her  for though as a fellowcreature she sympathizes with and pities me and even weeps for me as a husband she cannot endure meshe loathes metheres no use in mincing wordsshe loathes me and my only manly and dignified and merciful course is to complete what i have begun  and for worldly reasons too it will be better for her to be independent  i have hopelessly ruined my prospects because of my decision as to what was best for us though she does not know it i see only dire poverty ahead from my feet to the grave for i can be accepted as teacher no more  i shall probably have enough to do to make both ends meet during the remainder of my life now my occupations gone and i shall be better able to bear it alone  i may as well tell you that what has suggested my letting her go is some news she brought methe news that fawley is doing the same  ohhe had a spouse too  a queer couple these lovers  welli dont want your opinion on that  what i was going to say is that my liberating her can do her no possible harm and will open up a chance of happiness for her which she has never dreamt of hitherto for then theyll be able to marry as they ought to have done at first  gillingham did not hurry to reply  i may disagree with your motive he said gently for he respected views he could not share but i think you are right in your determinationif you can carry it out i doubt however if you can      part fifth   at aldbrickham and elsewhere       thy aerial part and all the fiery parts which are     mingled in thee though by nature they have an upward     tendency still in obedience to the disposition of the     universe they are overpowered here in the compound     mass the bodym  antoninus long   i   how gillinghams doubts were disposed of will most quickly appear by passing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed the events of the last chapter and coming on to a sunday in the february of the year following  sue and jude were living in aldbrickham in precisely the same relations that they had established between themselves when she left shaston to join him the year before  the proceedings in the lawcourts had reached their consciousness but as a distant sound and an occasional missive which they hardly understood  they had met as usual to breakfast together in the little house with judes name on it that he had taken at fifteen pounds a year with threepoundsten extra for rates and taxes and furnished with his aunts ancient and lumbering goods which had cost him about their full value to bring all the way from marygreen  sue kept house and managed everything  as he entered the room this morning sue held up a letter she had just received  well and what is it about he said after kissing her  that the decree nisi in the case of phillotson versus phillotson and fawley pronounced six months ago has just been made absolute  ah said jude as he sat down  the same concluding incident in judes suit against arabella had occurred about a month or two earlier  both cases had been too insignificant to be reported in the papers further than by name in a long list of other undefended cases  now then sue at any rate you can do what you like  he looked at his sweetheart curiously  are weyou and ijust as free now as if we had never married at all  just as freeexcept i believe that a clergyman may object personally to remarry you and hand the job on to somebody else  but i wonderdo you think it is really so with us  i know it is generally  but i have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has been obtained under false pretences  how  wellif the truth about us had been known the decree wouldnt have been pronounced  it is only is it because we have made no defence and have led them into a false supposition  therefore is my freedom lawful however proper it may be  wellwhy did you let it be under false pretences  you have only yourself to blame he said mischievously  judedont you ought not to be touchy about that still  you must take me as i am  very well darling so i will  perhaps you were right  as to your question we were not obliged to prove anything  that was their business  anyhow we are living together  yes  though not in their sense  one thing is certain that however the decree may be brought about a marriage is dissolved when it is dissolved  there is this advantage in being poor obscure people like usthat these things are done for us in a rough and ready fashion  it was the same with me and arabella  i was afraid her criminal second marriage would have been discovered and she punished but nobody took any interest in hernobody inquired nobody suspected it  if wed been patented nobilities we should have had infinite trouble and days and weeks would have been spent in investigations  by degrees sue acquired her lovers cheerfulness at the sense of freedom and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields even if they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it jude agreed and sue went upstairs and prepared to start putting on a joyful coloured gown in observance of her liberty seeing which jude put on a lighter tie  now well strut arm and arm he said like any other engaged couple  weve a legal right to  they rambled out of the town and along a path over the lowlying lands that bordered it though these were frosty now and the extensive seedfields were bare of colour and produce  the pair however were so absorbed in their own situation that their surroundings were little in their consciousness  well my dearest the result of all this is that we can marry after a decent interval  yes i suppose we can said sue without enthusiasm  and arent we going to  i dont like to say no dear jude but i feel just the same about it now as i have done all along  i have just the same dread lest an iron contract should extinguish your tenderness for me and mine for you as it did between our unfortunate parents  still what can we do  i do love you as you know sue  i know it abundantly  but i think i would much rather go on living always as lovers as we are living now and only meeting by day  it is so much sweeterfor the woman at least and when she is sure of the man  and henceforward we neednt be so particular as we have been about appearances  our experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging i own said he with some gloom either owing to our own dissatisfied unpractical natures or by our misfortune  but we two  should be two dissatisfied ones linked together which would be twice as bad as before  i think i should begin to be afraid of you jude the moment you had contracted to cherish me under a government stamp and i was licensed to be loved on the premises by youugh how horrible and sordid  although as you are free i trust you more than any other man in the world  no nodont say i should change he expostulated yet there was misgiving in his own voice also  apart from ourselves and our unhappy peculiarities it is foreign to a mans nature to go on loving a person when he is told that he must and shall be that persons lover  there would be a much likelier chance of his doing it if he were told not to love  if the marriage ceremony consisted in an oath and signed contract between the parties to cease loving from that day forward in consideration of personal possession being given and to avoid each others society as much as possible in public there would be more loving couples than there are now  fancy the secret meetings between the perjuring husband and wife the denials of having seen each other the clambering in at bedroom windows and the hiding in closets  thered be little cooling then  yes but admitting this or something like it to be true you are not the only one in the world to see it dear little sue  people go on marrying because they cant resist natural forces although many of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a months pleasure with a lifes discomfort  no doubt my father and mother and your father and mother saw it if they at all resembled us in habits of observation  but then they went and married just the same because they had ordinary passions  but you sue are such a phantasmal bodiless creature one whoif youll allow me to say ithas so little animal passion in you that you can act upon reason in the matter when we poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance cant  well she sighed youve owned that it would probably end in misery for us  and i am not so exceptional a woman as you think fewer women like marriage than you suppose only they enter into it for the dignity it is assumed to confer and the social advantages it gains them sometimesa dignity and an advantage that i am quite willing to do without  jude fell back upon his old complaintthat intimate as they were he had never once had from her an honest candid declaration that she loved or could love him  i really fear sometimes that you cannot he said with a dubiousness approaching anger  and you are so reticent  i know that women are taught by other women that they must never admit the full truth to a man  but the highest form of affection is based on full sincerity on both sides  not being men these women dont know that in looking back on those he has had tender relations with a mans heart returns closest to her who was the soul of truth in her conduct  the better class of man even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying is not retained by them  a nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of elusiveness too often in the utter contempt for her that sooner or later her old admirers feel under which they allow her to go unlamented to her grave  sue who was regarding the distance had acquired a guilty look and she suddenly replied in a tragic voice i dont think i like you today so well as i did jude  dont you  why  oh wellyou are not nicetoo sermony  though i suppose i am so bad and worthless that i deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing  no you are not bad  you are a dear  but as slippery as an eel when i want to get a confession from you  oh yes i am bad and obstinate and all sorts  it is no use your pretending i am not  people who are good dont want scolding as i do  but now that i have nobody but you and nobody to defend me it is very hard that i mustnt have my own way in deciding how ill live with you and whether ill be married or no  sue my own comrade and sweetheart i dont want to force you either to marry or to do the other thingof course i dont  it is too wicked of you to be so pettish  now we wont say any more about it and go on just the same as we have done and during the rest of our walk well talk of the meadows only and the floods and the prospect of the farmers this coming year  after this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for several days though living as they were with only a landing between them it was constantly in their minds  sue was assisting jude very materially now he had latterly occupied himself on his own account in working and lettering headstones which he kept in a little yard at the back of his little house where in the intervals of domestic duties she marked out the letters full size for him and blacked them in after he had cut them  it was a lower class of handicraft than were his former performances as a cathedral mason and his only patrons were the poor people who lived in his own neighbourhood and knew what a cheap man this jude fawley monumental mason as he called himself on his front door was to employ for the simple memorials they required for their dead  but he seemed more independent than before and it was the only arrangement under which sue who particularly wished to be no burden on him could render any assistance    ii   it was an evening at the end of the month and jude had just returned home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not far off  when he entered sue who had been keeping indoors during his absence laid out supper for him  contrary to custom she did not speak  jude had taken up some illustrated paper which he perused till raising his eyes he saw that her face was troubled  are you depressed sue he said  she paused a moment  i have a message for you she answered  somebody has called  yes  a woman  sues voice quavered as she spoke and she suddenly sat down from her preparations laid her hands in her lap and looked into the fire  i dont know whether i did right or not she continued  i said you were not at home and when she said she would wait i said i thought you might not be able to see her  why did you say that dear  i suppose she wanted a headstone  was she in mourning  no she wasnt in mourning and she didnt want a headstone and i thought you couldnt see her  sue looked critically and imploringly at him  but who was she  didnt she say  no she wouldnt give her name  but i know who she wasi think i do  it was arabella  heaven save us  what should arabella come for  what made you think it was she  oh i can hardly tell  but i know it was  i feel perfectly certain it wasby the light in her eyes as she looked at me  she was a fleshy coarse woman  welli should not have called arabella coarse exactly except in speech though she may be getting so by this time under the duties of the public house  she was rather handsome when i knew her  handsome  but yesso she is  i think i heard a quiver in your little mouth  well waiving that as she is nothing to me and virtuously married to another man why should she come troubling us  are you sure shes married  have you definite news of it  nonot definite news  but that was why she asked me to release her  she and the man both wanted to lead a proper life as i understood  oh judeit was it was arabella cried sue covering her eyes with her hand  and i am so miserable  it seems such an ill omen whatever she may have come for  you could not possibly see her could you  i dont really think i could  it would be so very painful to talk to her nowfor her as much as for me  however shes gone  did she say she would come again  no but she went away very reluctantly  sue whom the least thing upset could not eat any supper and when jude had finished his he prepared to go to bed  he had no sooner raked out the fire fastened the doors and got to the top of the stairs than there came a knock  sue instantly emerged from her room which she had but just entered  there she is again  sue whispered in appalled accents  how do you know  she knocked like that last time  they listened and the knocking came again  no servant was kept in the house and if the summons were to be responded to one of them would have to do it in person  ill open a window said jude whoever it is cannot be expected to be let in at this time  he accordingly went into his bedroom and lifted the sash  the lonely street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of one figurethat of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few yards off  whos there he asked  is that mr fawley came up from the woman in a voice which was unmistakably arabellas  jude replied that it was  is it she asked sue from the door with lips apart  yes dear said jude  what do you want arabella he inquired  i beg your pardon jude for disturbing you said arabella humbly but i called earlieri wanted particularly to see you tonight if i could  i am in trouble and have nobody to help me  in trouble are you  yes  there was a silence  an inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in judes breast at the appeal  but arent you married he said  arabella hesitated  no jude i am not she returned  he wouldnt after all  and i am in great difficulty  i hope to get another situation as barmaid soon  but it takes time and i really am in great distress because of a sudden responsibility thats been sprung upon me from australia or i wouldnt trouble youbelieve me i wouldnt i want to tell you about it  sue remained at gaze in painful tension hearing every word but speaking none  you are not really in want of money arabella he asked in a distinctly softened tone  i have enough to pay for the nights lodging i have obtained but barely enough to take me back again  where are you living  in london still  she was about to give the address but she said i am afraid somebody may hear so i dont like to call out particulars of myself so loud  if you could come down and walk a little way with me towards the prince inn where i am staying tonight i would explain all  you may as well for old times sake  poor thing  i must do her the kindness of hearing whats the matter i suppose said jude in much perplexity  as shes going back tomorrow it cant make much difference  but you can go and see her tomorrow jude  dont go now jude came in plaintive accents from the doorway  oh it is only to entrap you i know it is as she did before  dont go dear  she is such a lowpassioned womani can see it in her shape and hear it in her voice  but i shall go said jude  dont attempt to detain me sue  god knows i love her little enough now but i dont want to be cruel to her  he turned to the stairs  but shes not your wife cried sue distractedly  and i  and you are not either dear yet said jude  oh but are you going to her  dont  stay at home  please please stay at home jude and not go to her now shes not your wife any more than i  well she is rather more than you come to that he said taking his hat determinedly  ive wanted you to be and ive waited with the patience of job and i dont see that ive got anything by my selfdenial  i shall certainly give her something and hear what it is she is so anxious to tell me no man could do less  there was that in his manner which she knew it would be futile to oppose  she said no more but turning to her room as meekly as a martyr heard him go downstairs unbolt the door and close it behind him  with a womans disregard of her dignity when in the presence of nobody but herself she also trotted down sobbing articulately as she went  she listened  she knew exactly how far it was to the inn that arabella had named as her lodging  it would occupy about seven minutes to get there at an ordinary walking pace seven to come back again  if he did not return in fourteen minutes he would have lingered  she looked at the clock  it was twentyfive minutes to eleven  he might enter the inn with arabella as they would reach it before closing time she might get him to drink with her and heaven only knew what disasters would befall him then  in a still suspense she waited on  it seemed as if the whole time had nearly elapsed when the door was opened again and jude appeared  sue gave a little ecstatic cry  oh i knew i could trust youhow good you areshe began  i cant find her anywhere in this street and i went out in my slippers only  she has walked on thinking ive been so hardhearted as to refuse her requests entirely poor woman  ive come back for my boots as it is beginning to rain  oh but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served you so badly said sue in a jealous burst of disappointment  but sue shes a woman and i once cared for her and one cant be a brute in such circumstances  she isnt your wife any longer exclaimed sue passionately excited  you mustnt go out to find her  it isnt right  you cant join her now shes a stranger to you  how can you forget such a thing my dear dear one  she seems much the same as everan erring careless unreflecting fellowcreature he said continuing to pull on his boots  what those legal fellows have been playing at in london makes no difference in my real relations to her  if she was my wife while she was away in australia with another husband shes my wife now  but she wasnt  thats just what i hold  theres the absurdity wellyoull come straight back after a few minutes wont you dear  she is too low too coarse for you to talk to long jude and was always  perhaps i am coarse too worse luck  i have the germs of every human infirmity in me i verily believethat was why i saw it was so preposterous of me to think of being a curate  i have cured myself of drunkenness i think but i never know in what new form a suppressed vice will break out in me  i do love you sue though i have danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns  all thats best and noblest in me loves you and your freedom from everything thats gross has elevated me and enabled me to do what i should never have dreamt myself capable of or any man a year or two ago  it is all very well to preach about selfcontrol and the wickedness of coercing a woman  but i should just like a few virtuous people who have condemned me in the past about arabella and other things to have been in my tantalizing position with you through these late weekstheyd believe i think that i have exercised some little restraint in always giving in to your wishesliving here in one house and not a soul between us  yes you have been good to me jude i know you have my dear protector  wellarabella has appealed to me for help  i must go out and speak to her sue at least  i cant say any moreoh if you must you must she said bursting out into sobs that seemed to tear her heart  i have nobody but you jude and you are deserting me  i didnt know you were like thisi cant bear it i cant  if she were yours it would be different  or if you were  very well thenif i must i must  since you will have it so i agree  i will be  only i didnt mean to  and i didnt want to marry again either   but yesi agree i agree  i do love you i ought to have known that you would conquer in the long run living like this  she ran across and flung her arms round his neck  i am not a coldnatured sexless creature am i for keeping you at such a distance  i am sure you dont think so  wait and see  i do belong to you dont i  i give in  and ill arrange for our marriage tomorrow or as soon as ever you wish  yes jude  then ill let her go said he embracing sue softly  i do feel that it would be unfair to you to see her and perhaps unfair to her she is not like you my darling and never was it is only bare justice to say that  dont cry any more  there and there and there  he kissed her on one side and on the other and in the middle and rebolted the front door    the next morning it was wet  now dear said jude gaily at breakfast as this is saturday i mean to call about the banns at once so as to get the first publishing done tomorrow or we shall lose a week  banns will do we shall save a pound or two  sue absently agreed to banns  but her mind for the moment was running on something else  a glow had passed away from her and depression sat upon her features  i feel i was wickedly selfish last night she murmured  it was sheer unkindness in meor worseto treat arabella as i did  i didnt care about her being in trouble and what she wished to tell you  perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling you  thats some more of my badness i suppose  love has its own dark morality when rivalry enters inat least mine has if other peoples hasnt  i wonder how she got on  i hope she reached the inn all right poor woman  oh yes she got on all right said jude placidly  i hope she wasnt shut out and that she hadnt to walk the streets in the rain  do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in  ive been thinking of her all the morning  wellis it necessary  you havent the least idea how arabella is able to shift for herself  still darling if you want to go and inquire you can  there was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which sue would meekly undertake when in a contrite mood and this going to see all sorts of extraordinary persons whose relation to her was precisely of a kind that would have made other people shun them was her instinct ever so that the request did not surprise him  and when you come back he added ill be ready to go about the banns  youll come with me  sue agreed and went off under cloak and umbrella letting jude kiss her freely and returning his kisses in a way she had never done before  times had decidedly changed  the little bird is caught at last she said a sadness showing in her smile  noonly nested he assured her  she walked along the muddy street till she reached the public house mentioned by arabella which was not so very far off  she was informed that arabella had not yet left and in doubt how to announce herself so that her predecessor in judes affections would recognize her she sent up word that a friend from spring street had called naming the place of judes residence  she was asked to step upstairs and on being shown into a room found that it was arabellas bedroom and that the latter had not yet risen  she halted on the turn of her toe till arabella cried from the bed come in and shut the door which sue accordingly did  arabella lay facing the window and did not at once turn her head and sue was wicked enough despite her penitence to wish for a moment that jude could behold her forerunner now with the daylight full upon her  she may have seemed handsome enough in profile under the lamps but a frowsiness was apparent this morning and the sight of her own fresh charms in the lookingglass made sues manner bright till she reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in her and hated herself for it  ive just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night thats all she said gently  i was afraid afterwards that you might have met with any mishap  ohhow stupid this is  i thought my visitor wasyour friendyour husbandmrs fawley as i suppose you call yourself said arabella flinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss and ceasing to retain the dimple she had just taken the trouble to produce  indeed i dont said sue  oh i thought you might have even if hes not really yours decency is decency any hour of the twentyfour  i dont know what you mean said sue stiffly  he is mine if you come to that  he wasnt yesterday  sue coloured roseate and said how do you know  from your manner when you talked to me at the door  well my dear youve been quick about it and i expect my visit last night helped it onhaha  but i dont want to get him away from you  sue looked out at the rain and at the dirty toiletcover and at the detached tail of arabellas hair hanging on the lookingglass just as it had done in judes time and wished she had not come  in the pause there was a knock at the door and the chambermaid brought in a telegram for mrs cartlett  arabella opened it as she lay and her ruffled look disappeared  i am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me she said blandly when the maid had gone but it is not necessary you should feel it  my man finds he cant do without me after all and agrees to stand by the promise to marry again over here that he has made me all along  see here  this is in answer to one from me  she held out the telegram for sue to read but sue did not take it  he asks me to come back  his little corner public in lambeth would go to pieces without me he says  but he isnt going to knock me about when he has had a drop any more after we are spliced by english law than before   as for you i should coax jude to take me before the parson straight off and have done with it if i were in your place  i say it as a friend my dear  hes waiting to any day returned sue with frigid pride  then let him in heavens name  life with a man is more businesslike after it and money matters work better  and then you see if you have rows and he turns you out of doors you can get the law to protect you which you cant otherwise unless he halfruns you through with a knife or cracks your noddle with a poker  and if he bolts away from youi say it friendly as woman to woman for theres never any knowing what a man med doyoull have the sticks o furniture and wont be looked upon as a thief  i shall marry my man over again now hes willing as there was a little flaw in the first ceremony  in my telegram last night which this is an answer to i told him i had almost made it up with jude and that frightened him i expect  perhaps i should quite have done it if it hadnt been for you she said laughing and then how different our histories might have been from today  never such a tender fool as jude is if a woman seems in trouble and coaxes him a bit  just as he used to be about birds and things  however as it happens it is just as well as if i had made it up and i forgive you  and as i say id advise you to get the business legally done as soon as possible youll find it an awful bother later on if you dont  i have told you he is asking me to marry himto make our natural marriage a legal one said sue with yet more dignity  it was quite by my wish that he didnt the moment i was free  ah yesyou are a oneyer too like myself said arabella eyeing her visitor with humorous criticism  bolted from your first didnt you like me  good morningi must go said sue hastily  and i too must up and off replied the other springing out of bed so suddenly that the soft parts of her person shook  sue jumped aside in trepidation  lord i am only a womannot a sixfoot sojer   just a moment dear she continued putting her hand on sues arm  i really did want to consult jude on a little matter of business as i told him  i came about that more than anything else would he run up to speak to me at the station as i am going  you think not  well ill write to him about it  i didnt want to write it but never mindi will    iii   when sue reached home jude was awaiting her at the door to take the initial step towards their marriage  she clasped his arm and they went along silently together as true comrades ofttimes do  he saw that she was preoccupied and forbore to question her  oh judeive been talking to her she said at last  i wish i hadnt  and yet it is best to be reminded of things  i hope she was civil  yes  ii cant help liking herjust a little bit  shes not an ungenerous nature and i am so glad her difficulties have all suddenly ended  she explained how arabella had been summoned back and would be enabled to retrieve her position  i was referring to our old question  what arabella has been saying to me has made me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal marriage isa sort of trap to catch a mani cant bear to think of it  i wish i hadnt promised to let you put up the banns this morning  oh dont mind me  any time will do for me  i thought you might like to get it over quickly now  indeed i dont feel any more anxious now than i did before perhaps with any other man i might be a little anxious but among the very few virtues possessed by your family and mine dear i think i may set staunchness  so i am not a bit frightened about losing you now i really am yours and you really are mine  in fact i am easier in my mind than i was for my conscience is clear about richard who now has a right to his freedom  i felt we were deceiving him before  sue you seem when you are like this to be one of the women of some grand old civilization whom i used to read about in my bygone wasted classical days rather than a denizen of a mere christian country  i almost expect you to say at these times that you have just been talking to some friend whom you met in the via sacra about the latest news of octavia or livia or have been listening to aspasias eloquence or have been watching praxiteles chiselling away at his latest venus while phryne made complaint that she was tired of posing  they had now reached the house of the parish clerk  sue stood back while her lover went up to the door  his hand was raised to knock when she said jude  he looked round  wait a minute would you mind  he came back to her  just let us think she said timidly  i had such a horrid dream one night   and arabella  what did arabella say to you he asked  oh she said that when people were tied up you could get the law of a man better if he beat youand how when couples quarrelled  jude do you think that when you must have me with you by law we shall be so happy as we are now  the men and women of our family are very generous when everything depends upon their goodwill but they always kick against compulsion  dont you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation dont you think it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its gratuitousness  upon my word love you are beginning to frighten me too with all this foreboding  well lets go back and think it over  her face brightened  yesso we will said she  and they turned from the clerks door sue taking his arm and murmuring as they walked on homeward      can you keep the bee from ranging    or the ringdoves neck from changing    no nor fetterd love    they thought it over or postponed thinking  certainly they postponed action and seemed to live on in a dreamy paradise at the end of a fortnight or three weeks matters remained unadvanced and no banns were announced to the ears of any aldbrickham congregation  whilst they were postponing and postponing thus a letter and a newspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from arabella seeing the handwriting jude went up to sues room and told her and as soon as she was dressed she hastened down  sue opened the newspaper jude the letter  after glancing at the paper she held across the first page to him with her finger on a paragraph but he was so absorbed in his letter that he did not turn awhile  look said she  he looked and read  the paper was one that circulated in south london only and the marked advertisement was simply the announcement of a marriage at st johns church waterloo road under the names cartlettdonn the united pair being arabella and the innkeeper  well it is satisfactory said sue complacently  though after this it seems rather low to do likewise and i am glad  however she is provided for now in a way i suppose whatever her faults poor thing  it is nicer that we are able to think that than to be uneasy about her  i ought too to write to richard and ask him how he is getting on perhaps  but judes attention was still absorbed  having merely glanced at the announcement he said in a disturbed voice listen to this letter  what shall i say or do      the three horns lambeth     dear jude i wont be so distant as to call you mr    fawleyi send today a newspaper from which useful    document you will learn that i was married over again to    cartlett last tuesday  so that business is settled right    and tight at last  but what i write about more particular    is that private affair i wanted to speak to you on when i    came down to aldbrickham  i couldnt very well tell it to    your lady friend and should much have liked to let you    know it by word of mouth as i could have explained better    than by letter  the fact is jude that though i have    never informed you before there was a boy born of our    marriage eight months after i left you when i was at    sydney living with my father and mother  all that is    easily provable  as i had separated from you before i    thought such a thing was going to happen  and i was over    there and our quarrel had been sharp i did not think it    convenient to write about the birth  i was then looking    out for a good situation so my parents took the child    and he has been with them ever since  that was why i did    not mention it when i met you in christminster nor at    the law proceedings  he is now of an intelligent age of    course and my mother and father have lately written to    say that as they have rather a hard struggle over there    and i am settled comfortably here they dont see why    they should be encumbered with the child any longer his    parents being alive  i would have him with me here in    a moment but he is not old enough to be of any use in    the bar nor will be for years and years and naturally    cartlett might think him in the way  they have however    packed him off to me in charge of some friends who    happened to be coming home and i must ask you to take    him when he arrives for i dont know what to do with him    he is lawfully yours that i solemnly swear  if anybody    says he isnt call them brimstone liars for my sake    whatever i may have done before or afterwards i was    honest to you from the time we were married till i went    away and i remain yours c     arabella cartlett   sues look was one of dismay  what will you do dear she asked faintly  jude did not reply and sue watched him anxiously with heavy breaths  it hits me hard said he in an undervoice it may be true i cant make it out  certainly if his birth was exactly when she says hes mine  i cannot think why she didnt tell me when i met her at christminster and came on here that evening with her   ahi do remember now that she said something about having a thing on her mind that she would like me to know if ever we lived together again  the poor child seems to be wanted by nobody  sue replied and her eyes filled  jude had by this time come to himself  what a view of life he must have mine or not mine he said  i must say that if i were better off i should not stop for a moment to think whose he might be  i would take him and bring him up  the beggarly question of parentagewhat is it after all  what does it matter when you come to think of it whether a child is yours by blood or not  all the little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of the time and entitled to our general care  that excessive regard of parents for their own children and their dislike of other peoples is like classfeeling patriotism saveyourownsoulism and other virtues a mean exclusiveness at bottom  sue jumped up and kissed jude with passionate devotion  yesso it is dearest  and well have him here  and if he isnt yours it makes it all the better  i do hope he isntthough perhaps i ought not to feel quite that  if he isnt i should like so much for us to have him as an adopted child  well you must assume about him what is most pleasing to you my curious little comrade he said  i feel that anyhow i dont like to leave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect  just think of his life in a lambeth pothouse and all its evil influences with a parent who doesnt want him and has indeed hardly seen him and a stepfather who doesnt know him  let the day perish wherein i was born and the night in which it was said there is a man child conceived  thats what the boymy boy perhaps will find himself saying before long  oh no  as i was the petitioner i am really entitled to his custody i suppose  whether or no we must have him  i see that  ill do the best i can to be a mother to him and we can afford to keep him somehow ill work harder  i wonder when hell arrive  in the course of a few weeks i suppose  i wishwhen shall we have courage to marry jude  whenever you have it i think i shall  it remains with you entirely dear  only say the word and its done  before the boy comes  certainly  it would make a more natural home for him perhaps she murmured  jude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms to request that the boy should be sent on to them as soon as he arrived making no remark whatever on the surprising nature of arabellas information nor vouchsafing a single word of opinion on the boys paternity nor on whether had he known all this his conduct towards her would have been quite the same  in the downtrain that was timed to reach aldbrickham station about ten oclock the next evening a small pale childs face could be seen in the gloom of a thirdclass carriage  he had large frightened eyes and wore a white woollen cravat over which a key was suspended round his neck by a piece of common string the key attracting attention by its occasional shine in the lamplight in the band of his hat his halfticket was stuck  his eyes remained mostly fixed on the back of the seat opposite and never turned to the window even when a station was reached and called on the other seat were two or three passengers one of them a working woman who held a basket on her lap in which was a tabby kitten the woman opened the cover now and then whereupon the kitten would put out its head and indulge in playful antics  at these the fellowpassengers laughed except the solitary boy bearing the key and ticket who regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes seemed mutely to say all laughing comes from misapprehension  rightly looked at there is no laughable thing under the sun  occasionally at a stoppage the guard would look into the compartment and say to the boy all right my man  your box is safe in the van  the boy would say yes without animation would try to smile and fail  he was age masquerading as juvenility and doing it so badly that his real self showed through crevices  a groundswell from ancient years of night seemed now and then to lift the child in this his morninglife when his face took a back view over some great atlantic of time and appeared not to care about what it saw  when the other travellers closed their eyes which they did one by oneeven the kitten curling itself up in the basket weary of its too circumscribed playthe boy remained just as before  he then seemed to be doubly awake like an enslaved and dwarfed divinity sitting passive and regarding his companions as if he saw their whole rounded lives rather than their immediate figures  this was arabellas boy  with her usual carelessness she had postponed writing to jude about him till the eve of his landing when she could absolutely postpone no longer though she had known for weeks of his approaching arrival and had as she truly said visited aldbrickham mainly to reveal the boys existence and his near homecoming to jude  this very day on which she had received her former husbands answer at some time in the afternoon the child reached the london docks and the family in whose charge he had come having put him into a cab for lambeth and directed the cabman to his mothers house bade him goodbye and went their way  on his arrival at the three horns arabella had looked him over with an expression that was as good as saying you are very much what i expected you to be had given him a good meal a little money and late as it was getting dispatched him to jude by the next train wishing her husband cartlett who was out not to see him  the train reached aldbrickham and the boy was deposited on the lonely platform beside his box  the collector took his ticket and with a meditative sense of the unfitness of things asked him where he was going by himself at that time of night  going to spring street said the little one impassively  why thats a long way from here amost out in the country and the folks will be gone to bed  ive got to go there  you must have a fly for your box  no i must walk  oh well youd better leave your box here and send for it  theres a bus goes halfway but youll have to walk the rest  i am not afraid  why didnt your friends come to meet ee  i suppose they didnt know i was coming  who is your friends  mother didnt wish me to say  all i can do then is to take charge of this  now walk as fast as you can  saying nothing further the boy came out into the street looking round to see that nobody followed or observed him  when he had walked some little distance he asked for the street of his destination  he was told to go straight on quite into the outskirts of the place  the child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an impersonal qualitythe movement of the wave or of the breeze or of the cloud  he followed his directions literally without an inquiring gaze at anything  it could have been seen that the boys ideas of life were different from those of the local boys  children begin with detail and learn up to the general they begin with the contiguous and gradually comprehend the universal  the boy seemed to have begun with the generals of life and never to have concerned himself with the particulars  to him the houses the willows the obscure fields beyond were apparently regarded not as brick residences pollards meadows but as human dwellings in the abstract vegetation and the wide dark world  he found the way to the little lane and knocked at the door of judes house  jude had just retired to bed and sue was about to enter her chamber adjoining when she heard the knock and came down  is this where father lives asked the child  who  mr fawley thats his name  sue ran up to judes room and told him and he hurried down as soon as he could though to her impatience he seemed long  whatis it heso soon she asked as jude came  she scrutinized the childs features and suddenly went away into the little sittingroom adjoining  jude lifted the boy to a level with himself keenly regarded him with gloomy tenderness and telling him he would have been met if they had known of his coming so soon set him provisionally in a chair whilst he went to look for sue whose supersensitiveness was disturbed as he knew  he found her in the dark bending over an armchair  he enclosed her with his arm and putting his face by hers whispered whats the matter  what arabella says is truetrue  i see you in him  well thats one thing in my life as it should be at any rate  but the other half of him isshe  and thats what i cant bear but i ought toill try to get used to it yes i ought  jealous little sue  i withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness never mind  time may right things  and sue darling i have an idea  well educate and train him with a view to the university what i couldnt accomplish in my own person perhaps i can carry out through him  they are making it easier for poor students now you know  oh you dreamer said she and holding his hand returned to the child with him  the boy looked at her as she had looked at him is it you whos my real mother at last he inquired  why  do i look like your fathers wife  well yes cept he seems fond of you and you of him  can i call you mother  then a yearning look came over the child and he began to cry  sue thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise being a harp which the least wind of emotion from anothers heart could make to vibrate as readily as a radical stir in her own  you may call me mother if you wish to my poor dear she said bending her cheek against his to hide her tears  whats this round your neck asked jude with affected calmness  the key of my box thats at the station  they bustled about and got him some supper and made him up a temporary bed where he soon fell asleep  both went and looked at him as he lay  he called you mother two or three times before he dropped off murmured jude  wasnt it odd that he should have wanted to  wellit was significant said sue  theres more for us to think about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the sky  i suppose dear we must pluck up courage and get that ceremony over  it is no use struggling against the current and i feel myself getting intertwined with my kind  oh jude youll love me dearly wont you afterwards  i do want to be kind to this child and to be a mother to him and our adding the legal form to our marriage might make it easier for me    iv   their next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made though it was begun on the morning following the singular childs arrival at their home  him they found to be in the habit of sitting silent his quaint and weird face set and his eyes resting on things they did not see in the substantial world  his face is like the tragic mask of melpomene said sue  what is your name dear  did you tell us  little father time is what they always called me  it is a nickname because i look so aged they say  and you talk so too said sue tenderly  it is strange jude that these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new countries  but what were you christened  i never was  why was that  because if i died in damnation twould save the expense of a christian funeral  ohyour name is not jude then said his father with some disappointment  the boy shook his head  never heerd on it  of course not said sue quickly since she was hating you all the time  well have him christened said jude and privately to sue the day we are married  yet the advent of the child disturbed him  their position lent them shyness and having an impression that a marriage at a superintendent registrars office was more private than an ecclesiastical one they decided to avoid a church this time both sue and jude together went to the office of the district to give notice they had become such companions that they could hardly do anything of importance except in each others company  jude fawley signed the form of notice sue looking over his shoulder and watching his hand as it traced the words  as she read the foursquare undertaking never before seen by her into which her own and judes names were inserted and by which that very volatile essence their love for each other was supposed to be made permanent her face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive names and surnames of the partiesthey were to be parties now not lovers she thought conditiona horrid idearank or occupationagedwelling atlength of residencechurch or building in which the marriage is to be solemnizeddistrict and county in which the parties respectively dwell  it spoils the sentiment doesnt it she said on their way home it seems making a more sordid business of it even than signing the contract in a vestry  there is a little poetry in a church  but well try to get through with it dearest now  we will  for what man is he that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her  let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her  so said the jewish lawgiver  how you know the scriptures jude  you really ought to have been a parson  i can only quote profane writers  during the interval before the issuing of the certificate sue in her housekeeping errands sometimes walked past the office and furtively glancing in saw affixed to the wall the notice of the purposed clinch to their union  she could not bear its aspect  coming after her previous experience of matrimony all the romance of their attachment seemed to be starved away by placing her present case in the same category  she was usually leading little father time by the hand and fancied that people thought him hers and regarded the intended ceremony as the patching up of an old error  meanwhile jude decided to link his present with his past in some slight degree by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on earth who was associated with his early life at marygreenthe aged widow mrs edlin who had been his greataunts friend and nurse in her last illness  he hardly expected that she would come but she did bringing singular presents in the form of apples jam brass snuffers an ancient pewter dish a warmingpan and an enormous bag of goose feathers towards a bed  she was allotted the spare room in judes house whither she retired early and where they could hear her through the ceiling below honestly saying the lords prayer in a loud voice as the rubric directed  as however she could not sleep and discovered that sue and jude were still sitting upit being in fact only ten oclockshe dressed herself again and came down and they all sat by the fire till a late hourfather time included though as he never spoke they were hardly conscious of him  well i baint set against marrying as your greataunt was said the widow  and i hope twill be a jocund wedding for ye in all respects this time  nobody can hope it more knowing what i do of your families which is more i suppose than anybody else now living  for they have been unlucky that way god knows  sue breathed uneasily  they was always goodhearted people toowouldnt kill a fly if they knowed it continued the wedding guest  but things happened to thwart em and if everything wasnt vitty they were upset  no doubt thats how he that the tale is told of came to do what a didif he were one of your family  what was that said jude  wellthat tale ye know he that was gibbeted just on the brow of the hill by the brown housenot far from the milestone between marygreen and alfredston where the other road branches off  but lord twas in my grandfathers time and it medn have been one of your folk at all  i know where the gibbet is said to have stood very well murmured jude  but i never heard of this  whatdid this manmy ancestor and sueskill his wife  twer not that exactly  she ran away from him with their child to her friends and while she was there the child died  he wanted the body to bury it where his people lay but she wouldnt give it up  her husband then came in the night with a cart and broke into the house to steal the coffin away but he was catched and being obstinate wouldnt tell what he broke in for  they brought it in burglary and thats why he was hanged and gibbeted on brown house hill  his wife went mad after he was dead  but it mednt be true that he belonged to ye more than to me  a small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside as if out of the earth if i was you mother i wouldnt marry father  it came from little time and they started for they had forgotten him  oh it is only a tale said sue cheeringly  after this exhilarating tradition from the widow on the eve of the solemnization they rose and wishing their guest goodnight retired  the next morning sue whose nervousness intensified with the hours took jude privately into the sittingroom before starting jude i want you to kiss me as a lover incorporeally she said tremulously nestling up to him with damp lashes  it wont be ever like this any more will it  i wish we hadnt begun the business but i suppose we must go on  how horrid that story was last night it spoilt my thoughts of today it makes me feel as if a tragic doom overhung our family as it did the house of atreus  or the house of jeroboam said the quondam theologian  yes  and it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying  i am going to vow to you in the same words i vowed in to my other husband and you to me in the same as you used to your other wife regardless of the deterrent lesson we were taught by those experiments  if you are uneasy i am made unhappy said he  i had hoped you would feel quite joyful  but if you dont you dont it is no use pretending  it is a dismal business to you and that makes it so to me  it is unpleasantly like that other morningthats all she murmured  let us go on now  they started arm in arm for the office aforesaid no witness accompanying them except the widow edlin  the day was chilly and dull and a clammy fog blew through the town from royaltowerd thame  on the steps of the office there were the muddy footmarks of people who had entered and in the entry were damp umbrellas within the office several persons were gathered and our couple perceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was just in progress  sue jude and the widow stood in the background while this was going on sue reading the notices of marriage on the wall  the room was a dreary place to two of their temperament though to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough lawbooks in musty calf covered one wall and elsewhere were postoffice directories and other books of reference  papers in packets tied with red tape were pigeonholed around and some iron safes filled a recess while the bare wood floor was like the doorstep stained by previous visitors  the soldier was sullen and reluctant the bride sad and timid she was soon obviously to become a mother and she had a black eye their little business was soon done and the twain and their friends straggled out one of the witnesses saying casually to jude and sue in passing as if he had known them before see the couple just come in  ha ha  that fellow is just out of gaol this morning she met him at the gaol gates and brought him straight here  shes paying for everything  sue turned her head and saw an illfavoured man closely cropped with a broadfaced pockmarked woman on his arm ruddy with liquor and the satisfaction of being on the brink of a gratified desire they jocosely saluted the outgoing couple and went forward in front of jude and sue whose diffidence was increasing  the latter drew back and turned to her lover her mouth shaping itself like that of a child about to give way to grief  judei dont like it here  i wish we hadnt come  the place gives me the horrors it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love i wish it had been at church if it had to be at all  it is not so vulgar there  dear little girl said jude  how troubled and pale you look  it must be performed here now i suppose  noperhaps not necessarily  he spoke to the clerk and came back  nowe need not marry here or anywhere unless we like even now he said  we can be married in a church if not with the same certificate with another hell give us i think  anyhow let us go out till you are calmer dear and i too and talk it over  they went out stealthily and guiltily as if they had committed a misdemeanour closing the door without noise and telling the widow who had remained in the entry to go home and await them that they would call in any casual passers as witnesses if necessary  when in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they walked up and down as they had done long ago in the markethouse at melchester  now darling what shall we do  we are making a mess of it it strikes me  still anything that pleases you will please me  but jude dearest i am worrying you  you wanted it to be there didnt you  well to tell the truth when i got inside i felt as if i didnt care much about it  the place depressed me almost as much as it did youit was ugly  and then i thought of what you had said this morning as to whether we ought  they walked on vaguely till she paused and her little voice began anew it seems so weak too to vacillate like this  and yet how much better than to act rashly a second time  how terrible that scene was to me  the expression in that flabby womans face leading her on to give herself to that gaolbird not for a few hours as she would but for a lifetime as she must  and the other poor soulto escape a nominal shame which was owing to the weakness of her character degrading herself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant who scorned hera man whom to avoid for ever was her only chance of salvation  this is our parish church isnt it  this is where it would have to be if we did it in the usual way  a service or something seems to be going on  jude went up and looked in at the door  whyit is a wedding here too he said  everybody seems to be on our tack today  sue said she supposed it was because lent was just over when there was always a crowd of marriages  let us listen she said and find how it feels to us when performed in a church  they stepped in and entered a back seat and watched the proceedings at the altar  the contracting couple appeared to belong to the welltodo middle class and the wedding altogether was of ordinary prettiness and interest  they could see the flowers tremble in the brides hand even at that distance and could hear her mechanical murmur of words whose meaning her brain seemed to gather not at all under the pressure of her selfconsciousness  sue and jude listened and severally saw themselves in time past going through the same form of selfcommittal  it is not the same to her poor thing as it would be to me doing it over again with my present knowledge sue whispered  you see they are fresh to it and take the proceedings as a matter of course but having been awakened to its awful solemnity as we have or at least as i have by experience and to my own too squeamish feelings perhaps sometimes it really does seem immoral in me to go and undertake the same thing again with open eyes  coming in here and seeing this has frightened me from a church wedding as much as the other did from a registry one  we are a weak tremulous pair jude and what others may feel confident in i feel doubts ofmy being proof against the sordid conditions of a business contract again  then they tried to laugh and went on debating in whispers the objectlesson before them  and jude said he also thought they were both too thinskinnedthat they ought never to have been bornmuch less have come together for the most preposterous of all joint ventures for themmatrimony  his betrothed shuddered and asked him earnestly if he indeed felt that they ought not to go in cold blood and sign that lifeundertaking again  it is awful if you think we have found ourselves not strong enough for it and knowing this are proposing to perjure ourselves she said  i fancy i do think itsince you ask me said jude  remember ill do it if you wish own darling  while she hesitated he went on to confess that though he thought they ought to be able to do it he felt checked by the dread of incompetency just as she didfrom their peculiarities perhaps because they were unlike other people  we are horribly sensitive thats really whats the matter with us sue he declared  i fancy more are like us than we think  well i dont know  the intention of the contract is good and right for many no doubt but in our case it may defeat its own ends because we are the queer sort of people we arefolk in whom domestic ties of a forced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness  sue still held that there was not much queer or exceptional in them that all were so  everybody is getting to feel as we do  we are a little beforehand thats all  in fifty a hundred years the descendants of these two will act and feel worse than we  they will see weltering humanity still more vividly than we do now as      shapes like our own selves hideously multiplied   and will be afraid to reproduce them  what a terrible line of poetry  though i have felt it myself about my fellowcreatures at morbid times  thus they murmured on till sue said more brightly  wellthe general question is not our business and why should we plague ourselves about it  however different our reasons are we come to the same conclusion that for us particular two an irrevocable oath is risky  then jude let us go home without killing our dream yes  how good you are my friend you give way to all my whims  they accord very much with my own  he gave her a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession entering the vestry and then they came outside the building  by the door they waited till two or three carriages which had gone away for a while returned and the new husband and wife came into the open daylight  sue sighed  the flowers in the brides hand are sadly like the garland which decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times  still sue it is no worse for the woman than for the man  thats what some women fail to see and instead of protesting against the conditions they protest against the man the other victim just as a woman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her when he is only the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him  yessome are like that instead of uniting with the man against the common enemy coercion  the bride and bridegroom had by this time driven off and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers nodont lets do it she continued  at least just now  they reached home and passing the window arm in arm saw the widow looking out at them  well cried their guest when they entered i said to myself when i zeed ye coming so loving up to the door they made up their minds at last then  they briefly hinted that they had not  whatand hant ye really done it  chok it all that i should have lived to see a good old saying like marry in haste and repent at leisure spoiled like this by you two  tis time i got back again to marygreensakes if tiddenif this is what the new notions be leading us to  nobody thought o being afeard o matrimony in my time nor of much else but a cannonball or empty cupboard  why when i and my poor man were married we thought no more ot than of a game o dibs  dont tell the child when he comes in whispered sue nervously hell think it has all gone on right and it will be better that he should not be surprised and puzzled  of course it is only put off for reconsideration  if we are happy as we are what does it matter to anybody    v   the purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him to express his personal views upon the grave controversy above given that the twain were happybetween their times of sadnesswas indubitable  and when the unexpected apparition of judes child in the house had shown itself to be no such disturbing event as it had looked but one that brought into their lives a new and tender interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind it rather helped than injured their happiness  to be sure with such pleasing anxious beings as they were the boys coming also brought with it much thought for the future particularly as he seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual hopes of childhood  but the pair tried to dismiss for a while at least a too strenuously forward view  there is in upper wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls the town may be called stokebarehills  it stands with its gaunt unattractive ancient church and its new red brick suburb amid the open chalksoiled cornlands near the middle of an imaginary triangle which has for its three corners the towns of aldbrickham and wintoncester and the important military station of quartershot the great western highway from london passes through it near a point where the road branches into two merely to unite again some twenty miles further westward  out of this bifurcation and reunion there used to arise among wheeled travellers before railway days endless questions of choice between the respective ways  but the question is now as dead as the scotandlot freeholder the road waggoner and the mail coachman who disputed it and probably not a single inhabitant of stokebarehills is now even aware that the two roads which part in his town ever meet again for nobody now drives up and down the great western highway dally  the most familiar object in stokebarehills nowadays is its cemetery standing among some picturesque mediæval ruins beside the railway the modern chapels modern tombs and modern shrubs having a look of intrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivycovered decay of the ancient walls  on a certain day however in the particular year which has now been reached by this narrativethe month being early junethe features of the town excite little interest though many visitors arrive by the trains some downtrains in especial nearly emptying themselves here  it is the week of the great wessex agricultural show whose vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like the tents of an investing army  rows of marquees huts booths pavilions arcades porticoesevery kind of structure short of a permanent onecover the green field for the space of a square halfmile and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in a mass and make straight for the exhibition ground  the way thereto is lined with shows stalls and hawkers on foot who make a marketplace of the whole roadway to the show proper and lead some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see  it is the popular day the shilling day and of the fast arriving excursion trains two from different directions enter the two contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute  one like several which have preceded it comes from london the other by a crossline from aldbrickham and from the london train alights a couple a short rather bloated man with a globular stomach and small legs resembling a top on two pegs accompanied by a woman of rather fine figure and rather red face dressed in black material and covered with beads from bonnet to skirt that made her glisten as if clad in chainmail  they cast their eyes around  the man was about to hire a fly as some others had done when the woman said dont be in such a hurry cartlett  it isnt so very far to the showyard  let us walk down the street into the place  perhaps i can pick up a cheap bit of furniture or old china  it is years since i was herenever since i lived as a girl at aldbrickham and used to come across for a trip sometimes with my young man  you cant carry home furniture by excursion train said in a thick voice her husband the landlord of the three horns lambeth for they had both come down from the tavern in that excellent densely populated gindrinking neighbourhood which they had occupied ever since the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither the configuration of the landlord showed that he too like his customers was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed  then ill get it sent if i see any worth having said his wife  they sauntered on but had barely entered the town when her attention was attracted by a young couple leading a child who had come out from the second platform into which the train from aldbrickham had steamed  they were walking just in front of the innkeepers  sakes alive said arabella  whats that said cartlett  who do you think that couple is  dont you recognize the man  no  not from the photos i have showed you  is it fawley  yesof course  oh well  i suppose he was inclined for a little sightseeing like the rest of us  cartletts interest in jude whatever it might have been when arabella was new to him had plainly flagged since her charms and her idiosyncrasies her supernumerary haircoils and her optional dimples were becoming as a tale that is told  arabella so regulated her pace and her husbands as to keep just in the rear of the other three which it was easy to do without notice in such a stream of pedestrians  her answers to cartletts remarks were vague and slight for the group in front interested her more than all the rest of the spectacle  they are rather fond of one another and of their child seemingly continued the publican  their child  tisnt their child said arabella with a curious sudden covetousness  they havent been married long enough for it to be theirs  but although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough in her to lead her to quash her husbands conjecture she was not disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary  mr cartlett had no other idea than that his wifes child by her first husband was with his grandparents at the antipodes  oh i suppose not  she looks quite a girl  they are only lovers or lately married and have the child in charge as anybody can see  all continued to move ahead  the unwitting sue and jude the couple in question had determined to make this agricultural exhibition within twenty miles of their own town the occasion of a days excursion which should combine exercise and amusement with instruction at small expense  not regardful of themselves alone they had taken care to bring father time to try every means of making him kindle and laugh like other boys though he was to some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed  but they soon ceased to consider him an observer and went along with that tender attention to each other which the shyest can scarcely disguise and which these among entire strangers as they imagined took less trouble to disguise than they might have done at home  sue in her new summer clothes flexible and light as a bird her little thumb stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade went along as if she hardly touched ground and as if a moderately strong puff of wind would float her over the hedge into the next field  jude in his light grey holidaysuit was really proud of her companionship not more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words and ways  that complete mutual understanding in which every glance and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence between them made them almost the two parts of a single whole  the pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles arabella and her husband not far behind them  when inside the enclosure the publicans wife could see that the two ahead began to take trouble with the youngster pointing out and explaining the many objects of interest alive and dead and a passing sadness would touch their faces at their every failure to disturb his indifference  how she sticks to him said arabella  oh noi fancy they are not married or they wouldnt be so much to one another as that  i wonder  but i thought you said he did marry her  i heard he was going tothats all going to make another attempt after putting it off once or twice  as far as they themselves are concerned they are the only two in the show  i should be ashamed of making myself so silly if i were he  i dont see as how theres anything remarkable in their behaviour i should never have noticed their being in love if you hadnt said so  you never see anything she rejoined  nevertheless cartletts view of the lovers or married pairs conduct was undoubtedly that of the general crowd whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by what arabellas sharpened vision discerned  hes charmed by her as if she were some fairy continued arabella see how he looks round at her and lets his eyes rest on her  i am inclined to think that she dont care for him quite so much as he does for her  shes not a particular warmhearted creature to my thinking though she cares for him pretty middling muchas much as shes able to and he could make her heart ache a bit if he liked to trywhich hes too simple to do  therenow they are going across to the carthorse sheds  come along  i dont want to see the carthorses  it is no business of ours to follow these two  if we have come to see the show let us see it in our own way as they do in theirs  wellsuppose we agree to meet somewhere in an hours timesay at that refreshment tent over there and go about independent  then you can look at what you choose to and so can i  cartlett was not loath to agree to this and they partedhe proceeding to the shed where malting processes were being exhibited and arabella in the direction taken by jude and sue  before however she had regained their wake a laughing face met her own and she was confronted by anny the friend of her girlhood  anny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance encounter  i am still living down there she said as soon as she was composed  i am soon going to be married but my intended couldnt come up here today  but theres lots of us come by excursion though ive lost the rest of em for the present  have you met jude and his young woman or wife or whatever she is i saw em by now  no not a glimpse of un for years  well they are close by here somewhere  yesthere they areby that grey horse  oh thats his present young womanwife did you say  has he married again  i dont know  shes pretty isnt she  yesnothing to complain of or jump at  not much to depend on though a slim fidgety little thing like that  hes a nicelooking chap too  you ought to ha stuck to un arabella  i dont know but i ought murmured she  anny laughed  thats you arabella  always wanting another man than your own  well and what woman dont i should like to know  as for that body with himshe dont know what love isat least what i call love  i can see in her face she dont  and perhaps abby dear you dont know what she calls love  im sure i dont wish to   ahthey are making for the art department  i should like to see some pictures myself  suppose we go that way  why if all wessex isnt here i verily believe theres dr vilbert  havent seen him for years and hes not looking a day older than when i used to know him  how do you do physician  i was just saying that you dont look a day older than when you knew me as a girl  simply the result of taking my own pills regular maam only two and threepence a boxwarranted efficacious by the government stamp now let me advise you to purchase the same immunity from the ravages of time by following my example  only twoandthree  the physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket and arabella was induced to make the purchase  at the same time continued he when the pills were paid for you have the advantage of me mrs  surely not mrs fawley once miss donn of the vicinity of marygreen  yes  but mrs cartlett now  ahyou lost him then  promising young fellow  a pupil of mine you know  i taught him the dead languages  and believe me he soon knew nearly as much as i  i lost him but not as you think said arabella dryly  the lawyers untied us  there he is look alive and lusty along with that young woman entering the art exhibition  ahdear me  fond of her apparently  they say they are cousins  cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings i should say  yes  so her husband thought no doubt when he divorced her  shall we look at the pictures too  the trio followed across the green and entered  jude and sue with the child unaware of the interest they were exciting had gone up to a model at one end of the building which they regarded with considerable attention for a long while before they went on  arabella and her friends came to it in due course and the inscription it bore was model of cardinal college christminster by j fawley and s f m bridehead  admiring their own work said arabella  how like judealways thinking of colleges and christminster instead of attending to his business  they glanced cursorily at the pictures and proceeded to the bandstand  when they had stood a little while listening to the music of the military performers jude sue and the child came up on the other side  arabella did not care if they should recognize her but they were too deeply absorbed in their own lives as translated into emotion by the military band to perceive her under her beaded veil  she walked round the outside of the listening throng passing behind the lovers whose movements had an unexpected fascination for her today  scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed that judes hand sought sues as they stood the two standing close together so as to conceal as they supposed this tacit expression of their mutual responsiveness  silly foolslike two children  arabella whispered to herself morosely as she rejoined her companions with whom she preserved a preoccupied silence  anny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to vilbert on arabellas hankering interest in her first husband  now said the physician to arabella apart do you want anything such as this mrs cartlett  it is not compounded out of my regular pharmacopoeia but i am sometimes asked for such a thing  he produced a small phial of clear liquid  a lovephiltre such as was used by the ancients with great effect  i found it out by study of their writings and have never known it to fail  what is it made of asked arabella curiously  wella distillation of the juices of doves heartsotherwise pigeonsis one of the ingredients  it took nearly a hundred hearts to produce that small bottle full  how do you get pigeons enough  to tell a secret i get a piece of rocksalt of which pigeons are inordinately fond and place it in a dovecot on my roof  in a few hours the birds come to it from all points of the compasseast west north and southand thus i secure as many as i require you use the liquid by contriving that the desired man shall take about ten drops of it in his drink  but remember all this is told you because i gather from your questions that you mean to be a purchaser  you must keep faith with me  very welli dont mind a bottleto give some friend or other to try it on her young man  she produced five shillings the price asked and slipped the phial in her capacious bosom  saying presently that she was due at an appointment with her husband she sauntered away towards the refreshment bar jude his companion and the child having gone on to the horticultural tent where arabella caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom  she waited a few minutes observing them and then proceeded to join her spouse with no very amiable sentiments  she found him seated on a stool by the bar talking to one of the gaily dressed maids who had served him with spirits  i should think you had enough of this business at home arabella remarked gloomily  surely you didnt come fifty miles from your own bar to stick in another  come take me round the show as other men do their wives  dammy one would think you were a young bachelor with nobody to look after but yourself  but we agreed to meet here and what could i do but wait  well now we have met come along she returned ready to quarrel with the sun for shining on her  and they left the tent together this potbellied man and florid woman in the antipathetic recriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of christendom  in the meantime the more exceptional couple and the boy still lingered in the pavilion of flowersan enchanted palace to their appreciative tastesues usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of the tinted roses at which she gazed for the gay sights the air the music and the excitement of a days outing with jude had quickened her blood and made her eyes sparkle with vivacity  she adored roses and what arabella had witnessed was sue detaining jude almost against his will while she learnt the names of this variety and that and put her face within an inch of their blooms to smell them  i should like to push my face quite into themthe dears she had said  but i suppose it is against the rules to touch themisnt it jude  yes you baby said he and then playfully gave her a little push so that her nose went among the petals  the policeman will be down on us and i shall say it was my husbands fault  then she looked up at him and smiled in a way that told so much to arabella  happy he murmured  she nodded  why  because you have come to the great wessex agricultural showor because we have come  you are always trying to make me confess to all sorts of absurdities  because i am improving my mind of course by seeing all these steamploughs and threshingmachines and chaffcutters and cows and pigs and sheep  jude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion but when he had forgotten that he had put the question and because he no longer wished for an answer she went on i feel that we have returned to greek joyousness and have blinded ourselves to sickness and sorrow and have forgotten what twentyfive centuries have taught the race since their time as one of your christminster luminaries says  there is one immediate shadow howeveronly one  and she looked at the aged child whom though they had taken him to everything likely to attract a young intelligence they had utterly failed to interest  he knew what they were saying and thinking  i am very very sorry father and mother he said  but please dont mindi cant help it  i should like the flowers very very much if i didnt keep on thinking theyd be all withered in a few days    vi   the unnoticed lives that the pair had hitherto led began from the day of the suspended wedding onwards to be observed and discussed by other persons than arabella  the society of spring street and the neighbourhood generally did not understand and probably could not have been made to understand sue and judes private minds emotions positions and fears  the curious facts of a child coming to them unexpectedly who called jude father and sue mother and a hitch in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a registrars office together with rumours of the undefended cases in the lawcourts bore only one translation to plain minds  little timefor though he was formally turned into jude the apt nickname stuck to himwould come home from school in the evening and repeat inquiries and remarks that had been made to him by the other boys and cause sue and jude when he heard them a great deal of pain and sadness  the result was that shortly after the attempt at the registrars the pair went offto london it was believedfor several days hiring somebody to look to the boy  when they came back they let it be understood indirectly and with total indifference and weariness of mien that they were legally married at last  sue who had previously been called mrs bridehead now openly adopted the name of mrs fawley  her dull cowed and listless manner for days seemed to substantiate all this  but the mistake as it was called of their going away so secretly to do the business kept up much of the mystery of their lives and they found that they made not such advances with their neighbours as they had expected to do thereby  a living mystery was not much less interesting than a dead scandal  the bakers lad and the grocers boy who at first had used to lift their hats gallantly to sue when they came to execute their errands in these days no longer took the trouble to render her that homage and the neighbouring artizans wives looked straight along the pavement when they encountered her  nobody molested them it is true but an oppressive atmosphere began to encircle their souls particularly after their excursion to the show as if that visit had brought some evil influence to bear on them  and their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from this atmosphere and to be indisposed to lighten it by vigorous and open statements  their apparent attempt at reparation had come too late to be effective  the headstone and epitaph orders fell off and two or three months later when autumn came jude perceived that he would have to return to journeywork again a course all the more unfortunate just now in that he had not as yet cleared off the debt he had unavoidably incurred in the payment of the lawcosts of the previous year  one evening he sat down to share the common meal with sue and the child as usual  i am thinking he said to her that ill hold on here no longer  the life suits us certainly but if we could get away to a place where we are unknown we should be lighter hearted and have a better chance  and so i am afraid we must break it up here however awkward for you poor dear  sue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of pity and she saddened  welli am not sorry said she presently  i am much depressed by the way they look at me here  and you have been keeping on this house and furniture entirely for me and the boy  you dont want it yourself and the expense is unnecessary  but whatever we do wherever we go you wont take him away from me jude dear  i could not let him go now  the cloud upon his young mind makes him so pathetic to me i do hope to lift it some day  and he loves me so you wont take him away from me  certainly i wont dear little girl  well get nice lodgings wherever we go  i shall be moving about probablygetting a job here and a job there  i shall do something too of course tilltill  well now i cant be useful in the lettering it behoves me to turn my hand to something else  dont hurry about getting employment he said regretfully  i dont want you to do that  i wish you wouldnt sue  the boy and yourself are enough for you to attend to  there was a knock at the door and jude answered it  sue could hear the conversation  is mr fawley at home   biles and willis the building contractors sent me to know if youll undertake the relettering of the ten commandments in a little church theyve been restoring lately in the country near here  jude reflected and said he could undertake it  it is not a very artistic job continued the messenger  the clergyman is a very oldfashioned chap and he has refused to let anything more be done to the church than cleaning and repairing  excellent old man said sue to herself who was sentimentally opposed to the horrors of overrestoration  the ten commandments are fixed to the east end the messenger went on and they want doing up with the rest of the wall there since he wont have them carted off as old materials belonging to the contractor in the usual way of the trade  a bargain as to terms was struck and jude came indoors  there you see he said cheerfully  one more job yet at any rate and you can help in itat least you can try  we shall have all the church to ourselves as the rest of the work is finished  next day jude went out to the church which was only two miles off  he found that what the contractors clerk had said was true the tables of the jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of christian grace as the chief ornament of the chancel end in the fine dry style of the last century  and as their framework was constructed of ornamental plaster they could not be taken down for repair  a portion crumbled by damp required renewal and when this had been done and the whole cleansed he began to renew the lettering  on the second morning sue came to see what assistance she could render and also because they liked to be together  the silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence and standing on a safe low platform erected by jude which she was nevertheless timid at mounting she began painting in the letters of the first table while he set about mending a portion of the second  she was quite pleased at her powers she had acquired them in the days she painted illumined texts for the churchfitting shop at christminster  nobody seemed likely to disturb them and the pleasant twitter of birds and rustle of october leafage came in through an open window and mingled with their talk  they were not however to be left thus snug and peaceful for long about halfpast twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without the old vicar and his churchwarden entered and coming up to see what was being done seemed surprised to discover that a young woman was assisting  they passed on into an aisle at which time the door again opened and another figure entereda small one that of little time who was crying  sue had told him where he might find her between schoolhours if he wished  she came down from her perch and said whats the matter my dear  i couldnt stay to eat my dinner in school because they said he described how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother and sue grieved expressed her indignation to jude aloft  the child went into the churchyard and sue returned to her work  meanwhile the door had opened again and there shuffled in with a businesslike air the whiteaproned woman who cleaned the church  sue recognized her as one who had friends in spring street whom she visited  the churchcleaner looked at sue gaped and lifted her hands she had evidently recognized judes companion as the latter had recognized her  next came two ladies and after talking to the charwoman they also moved forward and as sue stood reaching upward watched her hand tracing the letters and critically regarded her person in relief against the white wall till she grew so nervous that she trembled visibly  they went back to where the others were standing talking in undertones and one saidsue could not hear whichshes his wife i suppose  some say yes some say no was the reply from the charwoman  not  then she ought to be or somebodysthats very clear  theyve only been married a very few weeks whether or no  a strange pair to be painting the two tables  i wonder biles and willis could think of such a thing as hiring those  the churchwarden supposed that biles and willis knew of nothing wrong and then the other who had been talking to the old woman explained what she meant by calling them strange people  the probable drift of the subdued conversation which followed was made plain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote in a voice that everybody in the church could hear though obviously suggested by the present situation  well now it is a curious thing but my grandfather told me a strange tale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of the commandments in a church out by gaymeadwhich is quite within a walk of this one  in them days commandments were mostly done in gilt letters on a black ground and thats how they were out where i say before the owld church was rebuilded  it must have been somewhere about a hundred years ago that them commandments wanted doing up just as ours do here and they had to get men from aldbrickham to do em now they wished to get the job finished by a particular sunday so the men had to work late saturday night against their will for overtime was not paid then as tis now  there was no true religion in the country at that date neither among pasons clerks nor people and to keep the men up to their work the vicar had to let em have plenty of drink during the afternoon  as evening drawed on they sent for some more themselves rum by all account  it got later and later and they got more and more fuddled till at last they went aputting their rumbottle and rummers upon the communion table and drawed up a trestle or two and sate round comfortable and poured out again right hearty bumpers  no sooner had they tossed off their glasses than so the story goes they fell down senseless one and all  how long they bode so they didnt know but when they came to themselves there was a terrible thunderstorm araging and they seemed to see in the gloom a dark figure with very thin legs and a curious voot astanding on the ladder and finishing their work  when it got daylight they could see that the work was really finished and couldnt at all mind finishing it themselves  they went home and the next thing they heard was that a great scandal had been caused in the church that sunday morning for when the people came and service began all saw that the ten commandments wez painted with the nots left out  decent people wouldnt attend service there for a long time and the bishop had to be sent for to reconsecrate the church  thats the tradition as i used to hear it as a child  you must take it for what it is woth but this case today has reminded me ot as i say  the visitors gave one more glance as if to see whether jude and sue had left the nots out likewise and then severally left the church even the old woman at last  sue and jude who had not stopped working sent back the child to school and remained without speaking till looking at her narrowly he found she had been crying silently  never mind comrade he said  i know what it is  i cant bear that they and everybody should think people wicked because they may have chosen to live their own way  it is really these opinions that make the best intentioned people reckless and actually become immoral  never be cast down  it was only a funny story  ah but we suggested it  i am afraid i have done you mischief jude instead of helping you by coming  to have suggested such a story was certainly not very exhilarating in a serious view of their position  however in a few minutes sue seemed to see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side and wiping her eyes she laughed  it is droll after all she said that we two of all people with our queer history should happen to be here painting the ten commandments  you a reprobate and iin my condition  o dear   and with her hand over her eyes she laughed again silently and intermittently till she was quite weak  thats better said jude gaily  now we are right again arent we little girl  oh but it is serious all the same she sighed as she took up the brush and righted herself  but do you see they dont think we are married  they wont believe it  it is extraordinary  i dont care whether they think so or not said jude  i shant take any more trouble to make them  they sat down to lunchwhich they had brought with them not to hinder timeand having eaten it were about to set to work anew when a man entered the church and jude recognized in him the contractor willis  he beckoned to jude and spoke to him apart  hereive just had a complaint about this he said with rather breathless awkwardness  i dont wish to go into the matteras of course i didnt know what was going onbut i am afraid i must ask you and her to leave off and let somebody else finish this  it is best to avoid all unpleasantness  ill pay you for the week all the same  jude was too independent to make any fuss and the contractor paid him and left  jude picked up his tools and sue cleansed her brush then their eyes met  how could we be so simple as to suppose we might do this said she dropping to her tragic note  of course we ought noti ought notto have come  i had no idea that anybody was going to intrude into such a lonely place and see us  jude returned  well it cant be helped dear and of course i wouldnt wish to injure williss tradeconnection by staying  they sat down passively for a few minutes proceeded out of the church and overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way to aldbrickham  fawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education and as was natural with his experiences he was active in furthering equality of opportunity by any humble means open to him  he had joined an artizans mutual improvement society established in the town about the time of his arrival there its members being young men of all creeds and denominations including churchmen congregationalists baptists unitarians positivists and othersagnostics had scarcely been heard of at this timetheir one common wish to enlarge their minds forming a sufficiently close bond of union  the subscription was small and the room homely and judes activity uncustomary acquirements and above all singular intuition on what to read and how to set about itbegotten of his years of struggle against malignant starshad led to his being placed on the committee  a few evenings after his dismissal from the church repairs and before he had obtained any more work to do he went to attend a meeting of the aforesaid committee  it was late when he arrived all the others had come and as he entered they looked dubiously at him and hardly uttered a word of greeting  he guessed that something bearing on himself had been either discussed or mooted  some ordinary business was transacted and it was disclosed that the number of subscriptions had shown a sudden falling off for that quarter  one membera really wellmeaning and upright manbegan speaking in enigmas about certain possible causes that it behoved them to look well into their constitution for if the committee were not respected and had not at least in their differences a common standard of conduct they would bring the institution to the ground nothing further was said in judes presence but he knew what this meant and turning to the table wrote a note resigning his office there and then  thus the supersensitive couple were more and more impelled to go away  and then bills were sent in and the question arose what could jude do with his greataunts heavy old furniture if he left the town to travel he knew not whither  this and the necessity of ready money compelled him to decide on an auction much as he would have preferred to keep the venerable goods  the day of the sale came on and sue for the last time cooked her own the childs and judes breakfast in the little house he had furnished  it chanced to be a wet day moreover sue was unwell and not wishing to desert her poor jude in such gloomy circumstances for he was compelled to stay awhile she acted on the suggestion of the auctioneers man and ensconced herself in an upper room which could be emptied of its effects and so kept closed to the bidders here jude discovered her and with the child and their few trunks baskets and bundles and two chairs and a table that were not in the sale the two sat in meditative talk  footsteps began stamping up and down the bare stairs the comers inspecting the goods some of which were of so quaint and ancient a make as to acquire an adventitious value as art  their door was tried once or twice and to guard themselves against intrusion jude wrote private on a scrap of paper and stuck it upon the panel  they soon found that instead of the furniture their own personal histories and past conduct began to be discussed to an unexpected and intolerable extent by the intending bidders  it was not till now that they really discovered what a fools paradise of supposed unrecognition they had been living in of late  sue silently took her companions hand and with eyes on each other they heard these passing remarksthe quaint and mysterious personality of father time being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and innuendoes  at length the auction began in the room below whence they could hear each familiar article knocked down the highly prized ones cheaply the unconsidered at an unexpected price  people dont understand us he sighed heavily  i am glad we have decided to go  the question is where to  it ought to be to london  there one can live as one chooses  nonot london dear  i know it well  we should be unhappy there  why  cant you think  because arabella is there  thats the chief reason  but in the country i shall always be uneasy lest there should be some more of our late experience  and i dont care to lessen it by explaining for one thing all about the boys history  to cut him off from his past i have determined to keep silence  i am sickened of ecclesiastical work now and i shouldnt like to accept it if offered me  you ought to have learnt classic  gothic is barbaric art after all  pugin was wrong and wren was right  remember the interior of christminster cathedralalmost the first place in which we looked in each others faces  under the picturesqueness of those norman details one can see the grotesque childishness of uncouth people trying to imitate the vanished roman forms remembered by dim tradition only  yesyou have halfconverted me to that view by what you have said before  but one can work and despise what one does  i must do something if not churchgothic  i wish we could both follow an occupation in which personal circumstances dont count she said smiling up wistfully  i am as disqualified for teaching as you are for ecclesiastical art  you must fall back upon railway stations bridges theatres musichalls hotelseverything that has no connection with conduct  i am not skilled in those  i ought to take to breadbaking  i grew up in the baking business with aunt you know  but even a baker must be conventional to get customers  unless he keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs where people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the quality of the goods  their thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer now this antique oak settlea unique example of old english furniture worthy the attention of all collectors  that was my greatgrandfathers said jude  i wish we could have kept the poor old thing  one by one the articles went and the afternoon passed away  jude and the other two were getting tired and hungry but after the conversation they had heard they were shy of going out while the purchasers were in their line of retreat  however the later lots drew on and it became necessary to emerge into the rain soon to take on sues things to their temporary lodging  now the next lot two pairs of pigeons all alive and plumpa nice pie for somebody for next sundays dinner  the impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense of the whole afternoon  they were sues pets and when it was found that they could not possibly be kept more sadness was caused than by parting from all the furniture  sue tried to think away her tears as she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth advanced by small stages to the price at which they were finally knocked down  the purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer and they were unquestionably doomed to die before the next market day  noting her dissembled distress jude kissed her and said it was time to go and see if the lodgings were ready  he would go on with the boy and fetch her soon  when she was left alone she waited patiently but jude did not come back  at last she started the coast being clear and on passing the poulterers shop not far off she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the door  an emotion at sight of them assisted by the growing dusk of evening caused her to act on impulse and first looking around her quickly she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover and went on  the cover was lifted from within and the pigeons flew away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and swearing to the door  sue reached the lodging trembling and found jude and the boy making it comfortable for her  do the buyers pay before they bring away the things she asked breathlessly  yes i think  why  because then ive done such a wicked thing  and she explained in bitter contrition  i shall have to pay the poulterer for them if he doesnt catch them said jude  but never mind  dont fret about it dear  it was so foolish of me  oh why should natures law be mutual butchery  is it so mother asked the boy intently  yes said sue vehemently  well they must take their chance now poor things said jude as soon as the saleaccount is wound up and our bills paid we go  where do we go to asked time in suspense  we must sail under sealed orders that nobody may trace us  we mustnt go to alfredston or to melchester or to shaston or to christminster  apart from those we may go anywhere  why mustnt we go there father  because of a cloud that has gathered over us though we have wronged no man corrupted no man defrauded no man  though perhaps we have done that which was right in our own eyes    vii   from that week jude fawley and sue walked no more in the town of aldbrickham  whither they had gone nobody knew chiefly because nobody cared to know  any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such an obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble that they had taken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship to enter on a shifting almost nomadic life which was not without its pleasantness for a time  wherever jude heard of freestone work to be done thither he went choosing by preference places remote from his old haunts and sues he laboured at a job long or briefly till it was finished and then moved on  two whole years and a half passed thus  sometimes he might have been found shaping the mullions of a country mansion sometimes setting the parapet of a townhall sometimes ashlaring an hotel at sandbourne sometimes a museum at casterbridge sometimes as far down as exonbury sometimes at stokebarehills  later still he was at kennetbridge a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of marygreen this being his nearest approach to the village where he was known for he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during his ardent young manhood of study and promise and his brief and unhappy married life at that time  at some of these places he would be detained for months at others only a few weeks  his curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical work both episcopal and noncomformist which had risen in him when suffering under a smarting sense of misconception remained with him in cold blood less from any fear of renewed censure than from an ultraconscientiousness which would not allow him to seek a living out of those who would disapprove of his ways also too from a sense of inconsistency between his former dogmas and his present practice hardly a shred of the beliefs with which he had first gone up to christminster now remaining with him  he was mentally approaching the position which sue had occupied when he first met her  on a saturday evening in may nearly three years after arabellas recognition of sue and himself at the agricultural show some of those who there encountered each other met again  it was the spring fair at kennetbridge and though this ancient trademeeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times the long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene about midday  at this hour a light trap among other vehicles was driven into the town by the north road and up to the door of a temperance inn  there alighted two women one the driver an ordinary country person the other a finely built figure in the deep mourning of a widow  her sombre suit of pronounced cut caused her to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a provincial fair  i will just find out where it is anny said the widowlady to her companion when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came forward and then ill come back and meet you here and well go in and have something to eat and drink  i begin to feel quite a sinking  with all my heart said the other  though i would sooner have put up at the chequers or the jack  you cant get much at these temperance houses  now dont you give way to gluttonous desires my child said the woman in weeds reprovingly  this is the proper place  very well well meet in half an hour unless you come with me to find out where the site of the new chapel is  i dont care to  you can tell me  the companions then went their several ways the one in crape walking firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous surroundings  making inquiries she came to a hoarding within which were excavations denoting the foundations of a building and on the boards without one or two large posters announcing that the foundationstone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that afternoon at three oclock by a london preacher of great popularity among his body  having ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her steps and gave herself leisure to observe the movements of the fair by and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and gingerbreads standing between the more pretentious erections of trestles and canvas  it was covered with an immaculate cloth and tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business she being accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face who assisted her  upon mysenses murmured the widow to herself  his wife sueif she is so  she drew nearer to the stall  how do you do mrs fawley she said blandly  sue changed colour and recognized arabella through the crape veil  how are you mrs cartlett she said stiffly  and then perceiving arabellas garb her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself whatyou have lost  my poor husband  yes  he died suddenly six weeks ago leaving me none too well off though he was a kind husband to me  but whatever profit there is in publichouse keeping goes to them that brew the liquors and not to them that retail em  and you my little old man  you dont know me i expect  yes i do  you be the woman i thought wer my mother for a bit till i found you wasnt replied father time who had learned to use the wessex tongue quite naturally by now  all right  never mind  i am a friend  juey said sue suddenly go down to the station platform with this traytheres another train coming in i think  when he was gone arabella continued hell never be a beauty will he poor chap  does he know i am his mother really  no he thinks there is some mystery about his parentagethats all jude is going to tell him when he is a little older  but how do you come to be doing this  i am surprised  it is only a temporary occupationa fancy of ours while we are in a difficulty  then you are living with him still  yes  married  of course  any children  two  and another coming soon i see  sue writhed under the hard and direct questioning and her tender little mouth began to quiver  lordi mean goodness graciouswhat is there to cry about  some folks would be proud enough  it is not that i am ashamednot as you think  but it seems such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the worldso presumptuousthat i question my right to do it sometimes  take it easy my dear  but you dont tell me why you do such a thing as this  jude used to be a proud sort of chapabove any business almost leave alone keeping a standing  perhaps my husband has altered a little since then  i am sure he is not proud now  and sues lips quivered again  i am doing this because he caught a chill early in the year while putting up some stonework of a musichall at quartershot which he had to do in the rain the work having to be executed by a fixed day  he is better than he was but it has been a long weary time  we have had an old widow friend with us to help us through it but shes leaving soon  well i am respectable too thank god and of a serious way of thinking since my loss  why did you choose to sell gingerbreads  thats a pure accident  he was brought up to the baking business and it occurred to him to try his hand at these which he can make without coming out of doors  we call them christminster cakes they are a great success  i never saw any like em  why they are windows and towers and pinnacles  and upon my word they are very nice  she had helped herself and was unceremoniously munching one of the cakes  yes  they are reminiscences of the christminster colleges traceried windows and cloisters you see  it was a whim of his to do them in pastry  still harping on christminstereven in his cakes laughed arabella  just like jude  a ruling passion  what a queer fellow he is and always will be  sue sighed and she looked her distress at hearing him criticized  dont you think he is  come now you do though you are so fond of him  of course christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him which i suppose hell never be cured of believing in  he still thinks it a great centre of high and fearless thought instead of what it is a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid obsequiousness to tradition  arabella was quizzing sue with more regard of how she was speaking than of what she was saying  how odd to hear a woman selling cakes talk like that she said  why dont you go back to schoolkeeping  she shook her head  they wont have me  because of the divorce i suppose  that and other things  and there is no reason to wish it  we gave up all ambition and were never so happy in our lives till his illness came  where are you living  i dont care to say  here in kennetbridge  sues manner showed arabella that her random guess was right  here comes the boy back again continued arabella  my boy and judes  sues eyes darted a spark  you neednt throw that in my face she cried  very wellthough i halffeel as if i should like to have him with me   but lord i dont want to take him from eeever i should sin to speak so profanethough i should think you must have enough of your own  hes in very good hands that i know and i am not the woman to find fault with what the lord has ordained  ive reached a more resigned frame of mind  indeed  i wish i had been able to do so  you should try replied the widow from the serene heights of a soul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority i make no boast of my awakening but im not what i was  after cartletts death i was passing the chapel in the street next ours and went into it for shelter from a shower of rain  i felt a need of some sort of support under my loss and as twas righter than gin i took to going there regular and found it a great comfort but ive left london now you know and at present i am living at alfredston with my friend anny to be near my own old country  im not come here to the fair today theres to be the foundationstone of a new chapel laid this afternoon by a popular london preacher and i drove over with anny  now i must go back to meet her  then arabella wished sue goodbye and went on    viii   in the afternoon sue and the other people bustling about kennetbridge fair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down the street  those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of persons in broadcloth with hymnbooks in their hands standing round the excavations for the new chapelwalls arabella cartlett and her weeds stood among them  she had a clear powerful voice which could be distinctly heard with the rest rising and falling to the tune her inflated bosom being also seen doing likewise  it was two hours later on the same day that anny and mrs cartlett having had tea at the temperance hotel started on their return journey across the high and open country which stretches between kennetbridge and alfredston  arabella was in a thoughtful mood but her thoughts were not of the new chapel as anny at first surmised  noit is something else at last said arabella sullenly  i came here today never thinking of anybody but poor cartlett or of anything but spreading the gospel by means of this new tabernacle theyve begun this afternoon  but something has happened to turn my mind another way quite  anny ive heard of un again and ive seen her  who  ive heard of jude and ive seen his wife  and ever since do what i will and though i sung the hymns wi all my strength i have not been able to help thinking about n which ive no right to do as a chapel member  cant ye fix your mind upon what was said by the london preacher today and try to get rid of your wandering fancies that way  i do  but my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself  welli know what it is to have a wanton mind o my own too  if you ony knew what i do dream sometimes o nights quite against my wishes youd say i had my struggles  anny too had grown rather serious of late her lover having jilted her  what shall i do about it urged arabella morbidly  you could take a lock of your latelost husbands hair and have it made into a mourning brooch and look at it every hour of the day  i havent a morseland if i had twould be no good  after all thats said about the comforts of this religion i wish i had jude back again  you must fight valiant against the feeling since hes anothers and ive heard that another good thing for it when it afflicts volupshious widows is to go to your husbands grave in the dusk of evening and stand a long while abowed down  pooh  i know as well as you what i should do only i dont do it  they drove in silence along the straight road till they were within the horizon of marygreen which lay not far to the left of their route  they came to the junction of the highway and the crosslane leading to that village whose churchtower could be seen athwart the hollow  when they got yet farther on and were passing the lonely house in which arabella and jude had lived during the first months of their marriage and where the pigkilling had taken place she could control herself no longer  hes more mine than hers she burst out  what right has she to him i should like to know  id take him from her if i could  fie abby  and your husband only six weeks gone  pray against it  be damned if i do  feelings are feelings  i wont be a creeping hypocrite any longerso there  arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which she had brought with her to distribute at the fair and of which she had given away several  as she spoke she flung the whole remainder of the packet into the hedge  ive tried that sort o physic and have failed wi it  i must be as i was born  hush  you be excited dear  now you come along home quiet and have a cup of tea and dont let us talk about un no more  we wont come out this road again as it leads to where he is because it inflames ee so  youll be all right again soon  arabella did calm herself down by degrees and they crossed the ridgeway  when they began to descend the long straight hill they saw plodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature and thoughtful gait  in his hand he carried a basket and there was a touch of slovenliness in his attire together with that indefinable something in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his own housekeeper purveyor confidant and friend through possessing nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him the remainder of the journey was downhill and guessing him to be going to alfredston they offered him a lift which he accepted  arabella looked at him and looked again till at length she spoke if i dont mistake i am talking to mr phillotson  the wayfarer faced round and regarded her in turn  yes my name is phillotson he said  but i dont recognize you maam  i remember you well enough when you used to be schoolmaster out at marygreen and i one of your scholars  i used to walk up there from cresscombe every day because we had only a mistress down at our place and you taught better  but you wouldnt remember me as i should youarabella donn  he shook his head  no he said politely i dont recall the name and i should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim school child no doubt you were then  well i always had plenty of flesh on my bones  however i am staying down here with some friends at present  you know i suppose who i married  no  jude fawleyalso a scholar of yoursat least a night scholarfor some little time i think  and known to you afterwards if i am not mistaken  dear me dear me said phillotson starting out of his stiffness you fawleys wife  to be surehe had a wife  and hei understood  divorced heras you did yoursperhaps for better reasons  indeed  wellhe med have been right in doing itright for both for i soon married again and all went pretty straight till my husband died lately  but youyou were decidedly wrong  no said phillotson with sudden testiness  i would rather not talk of this buti am convinced i did only what was right and just and moral  i have suffered for my act and opinions but i hold to them though her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one  you lost your school and good income through her did you not  i dont care to talk of it  i have recently come back hereto marygreen i mean  you are keeping the school there again just as formerly  the pressure of a sadness that would out unsealed him  i am there he replied  just as formerly no  merely on sufferance  it was a last resourcea small thing to return to after my move upwards and my long indulged hopesa returning to zero with all its humiliations  but it is a refuge  i like the seclusion of the place and the vicar having known me before my socalled eccentric conduct towards my wife had ruined my reputation as a schoolmaster he accepted my services when all other schools were closed against me  however although i take fifty pounds a year here after taking above two hundred elsewhere i prefer it to running the risk of having my old domestic experiences raked up against me as i should do if i tried to make a move  right you are  a contented mind is a continual feast  she has done no better  she is not doing well you mean  i met her by accident at kennetbridge this very day and she is anything but thriving  her husband is ill and she anxious  you made a fool of a mistake about her i tell ee again and the harm you did yourself by dirting your own nest serves you right excusing the liberty  how  she was innocent  but nonsense  they did not even defend the case  that was because they didnt care to  she was quite innocent of what obtained you your freedom at the time you obtained it  i saw her just afterwards and proved it to myself completely by talking to her  phillotson grasped the edge of the springcart and appeared to be much stressed and worried by the information  stillshe wanted to go he said  yes  but you shouldnt have let her  thats the only way with these fanciful women that chaw highinnocent or guilty  shed have come round in time  we all do  custom does it  its all the same in the end  however i think shes fond of her man stillwhatever he med be of her  you were too quick about her  i shouldnt have let her go  i should have kept her chained onher spirit for kicking would have been broke soon enough  theres nothing like bondage and a stonedeaf taskmaster for taming us women  besides youve got the laws on your side  moses knew  dont you call to mind what he says  not for the moment maam i regret to say  call yourself a schoolmaster  i used to think ot when they read it in church and i was carrying on a bit  then shall the man be guiltless but the woman shall bear her iniquity  damn rough on us women but we must grin and put up wi it  haw haw  well shes got her deserts now  yes said phillotson with biting sadness  cruelty is the law pervading all nature and society and we cant get out of it if we would  welldont you forget to try it next time old man  i cannot answer you madam  i have never known much of womankind  they had now reached the low levels bordering alfredston and passing through the outskirts approached a mill to which phillotson said his errand led him whereupon they drew up and he alighted bidding them goodnight in a preoccupied mood  in the meantime sue though remarkably successful in her cakeselling experiment at kennetbridge fair had lost the temporary brightness which had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success when all her christminster cakes had been disposed of she took upon her arm the empty basket and the cloth which had covered the standing she had hired and giving the other things to the boy left the street with him  they followed a lane to a distance of half a mile till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes and leading a toddler in the other hand  sue kissed the children and said how is he now  still better returned mrs edlin cheerfully  before you are upstairs again your husband will be well enoughdont ee trouble  they turned and came to some old duntiled cottages with gardens and fruittrees  into one of these they entered by lifting the latch without knocking and were at once in the general livingroom  here they greeted jude who was sitting in an armchair the increased delicacy of his normally delicate features and the childishly expectant look in his eyes being alone sufficient to show that he had been passing through a severe illness  whatyou have sold them all he said a gleam of interest lighting up his face  yes  arcades gables east windows and all  she told him the pecuniary results and then hesitated  at last when they were left alone she informed him of the unexpected meeting with arabella and the latters widowhood  jude was discomposed  whatis she living here he said  no at alfredston said sue  judes countenance remained clouded  i thought i had better tell you she continued kissing him anxiously  yes  dear me  arabella not in the depths of london but down here  it is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to alfredston  what is she doing there  she told him all she knew  she has taken to chapelgoing sue added and talks accordingly  well said jude perhaps it is for the best that we have almost decided to move on  i feel much better today and shall be well enough to leave in a week or two  then mrs edlin can go home againdear faithful old soulthe only friend we have in the world  where do you think to go to  sue asked a troublousness in her tones  then jude confessed what was in his mind  he said it would surprise her perhaps after his having resolutely avoided all the old places for so long  but one thing and another had made him think a great deal of christminster lately and if she didnt mind he would like to go back there  why should they care if they were known  it was oversensitive of them to mind so much  they could go on selling cakes there for that matter if he couldnt work  he had no sense of shame at mere poverty and perhaps he would be as strong as ever soon and able to set up stonecutting for himself there  why should you care so much for christminster she said pensively christminster cares nothing for you poor dear  well i do i cant help it  i love the placealthough i know how it hates all men like methe socalled selftaughthow it scorns our laboured acquisitions when it should be the first to respect them how it sneers at our false quantities and mispronunciations when it should say i see you want help my poor friend   nevertheless it is the centre of the universe to me because of my early dream and nothing can alter it  perhaps it will soon wake up and be generous  i pray so   i should like to go back to live thereperhaps to die there  in two or three weeks i might i think  it will then be june and i should like to be there by a particular day  his hope that he was recovering proved so far well grounded that in three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories were actually treading its pavements receiving the reflection of the sunshine from its wasting walls      part sixth   at christminster again         and she humbled her body greatly and all the places     of her joy she filled with her torn hairesther apoc         there are two who decline a woman and i       and enjoy our death in the darkness here                                r browning   i   on their arrival the station was lively with strawhatted young men welcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their welcomers and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of raiment  the place seems gay said sue  whyit is remembrance dayjudehow sly of youyou came today on purpose  yes said jude quietly as he took charge of the small child and told arabellas boy to keep close to them sue attending to their own eldest  i thought we might as well come today as on any other  but i am afraid it will depress you she said looking anxiously at him up and down  oh i mustnt let it interfere with our business and we have a good deal to do before we shall be settled here  the first thing is lodgings  having left their luggage and his tools at the station they proceeded on foot up the familiar street the holiday people all drifting in the same direction  reaching the fourways they were about to turn off to where accommodation was likely to be found when looking at the clock and the hurrying crowd jude said let us go and see the procession and never mind the lodgings just now  we can get them afterwards  oughtnt we to get a house over our heads first she asked  but his soul seemed full of the anniversary and together they went down chief street their smallest child in judes arms sue leading her little girl and arabellas boy walking thoughtfully and silently beside them  crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes and meekly ignorant parents who had known no college in their youth were under convoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion written large on them that no properly qualified human beings had lived on earth till they came to grace it here and now  my failure is reflected on me by every one of those young fellows said jude  a lesson on presumption is awaiting me todayhumiliation day for me   if you my dear darling hadnt come to my rescue i should have gone to the dogs with despair  she saw from his face that he was getting into one of his tempestuous selfharrowing moods  it would have been better if we had gone at once about our own affairs dear she answered  i am sure this sight will awaken old sorrows in you and do no good  wellwe are near we will see it now said he  they turned in on the left by the church with the italian porch whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers and pursued the lane till there arose on judes sight the circular theatre with that wellknown lantern above it which stood in his mind as the sad symbol of his abandoned hopes for it was from that outlook that he had finally surveyed the city of colleges on the afternoon of his great meditation which convinced him at last of the futility of his attempt to be a son of the university  today in the open space stretching between this building and the nearest college stood a crowd of expectant people  a passage was kept clear through their midst by two barriers of timber extending from the door of the college to the door of the large building between it and the theatre  here is the placethey are just going to pass cried jude in sudden excitement  and pushing his way to the front he took up a position close to the barrier still hugging the youngest child in his arms while sue and the others kept immediately behind him the crowd filled in at their back and fell to talking joking and laughing as carriage after carriage drew up at the lower door of the college and solemn stately figures in bloodred robes began to alight  the sky had grown overcast and livid and thunder rumbled now and then  father time shuddered  it do seem like the judgment day he whispered  they are only learned doctors said sue  while they waited big drops of rain fell on their heads and shoulders and the delay grew tedious  sue again wished not to stay  they wont be long now said jude without turning his head  but the procession did not come forth and somebody in the crowd to pass the time looked at the façade of the nearest college and said he wondered what was meant by the latin inscription in its midst jude who stood near the inquirer explained it and finding that the people all round him were listening with interest went on to describe the carving of the frieze which he had studied years before and to criticize some details of masonry in other college fronts about the city  the idle crowd including the two policemen at the doors stared like the lycaonians at paul for jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over any subject in hand and they seemed to wonder how the stranger should know more about the buildings of their town than they themselves did till one of them said why i know that man he used to work here years agojude fawley thats his name  dont you mind he used to be nicknamed tutor of st slums dye mindbecause he aimed at that line o business  hes married i suppose then and thats his child hes carrying  taylor would know him as he knows everybody  the speaker was a man named jack stagg with whom jude had formerly worked in repairing the college masonries tinker taylor was seen to be standing near  having his attention called the latter cried across the barriers to jude youve honoured us by coming back again my friend  jude nodded  an you dont seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away  jude assented to this also  except found more mouths to fill  this came in a new voice and jude recognized its owner to be uncle joe another mason whom he had known  jude replied goodhumouredly that he could not dispute it and from remark to remark something like a general conversation arose between him and the crowd of idlers during which tinker taylor asked jude if he remembered the apostles creed in latin still and the night of the challenge in the public house  but fortune didnt lie that way threw in joe  yer powers wasnt enough to carry ee through  dont answer them any more entreated sue  i dont think i like christminster murmured little time mournfully as he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd  but finding himself the centre of curiosity quizzing and comment jude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he had no great reason to be ashamed of and in a little while was stimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally  it is a difficult question my friends for any young manthat question i had to grapple with and which thousands are weighing at the present moment in these uprising timeswhether to follow uncritically the track he finds himself in without considering his aptness for it or to consider what his aptness or bent may be and reshape his course accordingly  i tried to do the latter and i failed  but i dont admit that my failure proved my view to be a wrong one or that my success would have made it a right one though thats how we appraise such attempts nowadaysi mean not by their essential soundness but by their accidental outcomes  if i had ended by becoming like one of these gentlemen in red and black that we saw dropping in here by now everybody would have said see how wise that young man was to follow the bent of his nature  but having ended no better than i began they say see what a fool that fellow was in following a freak of his fancy  however it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten  it takes two or three generations to do what i tried to do in one and my impulsesaffectionsvices perhaps they should be calledwere too strong not to hamper a man without advantages who should be as coldblooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a really good chance of being one of his countrys worthies  you may ridicule mei am quite willing that you shouldi am a fit subject no doubt  but i think if you knew what i have gone through these last few years you would rather pity me  and if they knewhe nodded towards the college at which the dons were severally arrivingit is just possible they would do the same  he do look ill and wornout it is true said a woman  sues face grew more emotional but though she stood close to jude she was screened  i may do some good before i am deadbe a sort of success as a frightful example of what not to do and so illustrate a moral story continued jude beginning to grow bitter though he had opened serenely enough  i was perhaps after all a paltry victim to the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many unhappy in these days  dont tell them that whispered sue with tears at perceiving judes state of mind  you werent that  you struggled nobly to acquire knowledge and only the meanest souls in the world would blame you  jude shifted the child into a more easy position on his arm and concluded and what i appear a sick and poor man is not the worst of me  i am in a chaos of principlesgroping in the darkacting by instinct and not after example  eight or nine years ago when i came here first i had a neat stock of fixed opinions but they dropped away one by one and the further i get the less sure i am  i doubt if i have anything more for my present rule of life than following inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm and actually give pleasure to those i love best  there gentlemen since you wanted to know how i was getting on i have told you  much good may it do you i cannot explain further here  i perceive there is something wrong somewhere in our social formulas what it is can only be discovered by men or women with greater insight than mineif indeed they ever discover itat least in our time  for who knoweth what is good for man in this lifeand who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun  hear hear said the populace  well preached said tinker taylor  and privately to his neighbours why one of them jobbing pasons swarming about here that takes the services when our head reverends want a holiday wouldnt ha discoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down hey  ill take my oath not one o em would  and then he must have had it wrote down for n  and this only a workingman  as a sort of objective commentary on judes remarks there drove up at this moment with a belated doctor robed and panting a cab whose horse failed to stop at the exact point required for setting down the hirer who jumped out and entered the door  the driver alighting began to kick the animal in the belly  if that can be done said jude at college gates in the most religious and educational city in the world what shall we say as to how far weve got  order said one of the policemen who had been engaged with a comrade in opening the large doors opposite the college  keep yer tongue quiet my man while the procession passes  the rain came on more heavily and all who had umbrellas opened them  jude was not one of these and sue only possessed a small one half sunshade  she had grown pale though jude did not notice it then  let us go on dear she whispered endeavouring to shelter him we havent any lodgings yet remember and all our things are at the station and you are by no means well yet  i am afraid this wet will hurt you  they are coming now  just a moment and ill go said he  a peal of six bells struck out human faces began to crowd the windows around and the procession of heads of houses and new doctors emerged their red and black gowned forms passing across the field of judes vision like inaccessible planets across an object glass  as they went their names were called by knowing informants and when they reached the old round theatre of wren a cheer rose high  lets go that way cried jude and though it now rained steadily he seemed not to know it and took them round to the theatre  here they stood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise of wheels where the quaint and frosteaten stone busts encircling the building looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings and in particular at the bedraggled jude sue and their children as at ludicrous persons who had no business there  i wish i could get in he said to her fervidly  listeni may catch a few words of the latin speech by staying here the windows are open  however beyond the peals of the organ and the shouts and hurrahs between each piece of oratory judes standing in the wet did not bring much latin to his intelligence more than now and then a sonorous word in um or ibus  wellim an outsider to the end of my days he sighed after a while  now ill go my patient sue  how good of you to wait in the rain all this timeto gratify my infatuation  ill never care any more about the infernal cursed place upon my soul i wont  but what made you tremble so when we were at the barrier  and how pale you are sue  i saw richard amongst the people on the other side  ahdid you  he is evidently come up to jerusalem to see the festival like the rest of us and on that account is probably living not so very far away  he had the same hankering for the university that you had in a milder form  i dont think he saw me though he must have heard you speaking to the crowd  but he seemed not to notice  wellsuppose he did  your mind is free from worries about him now my sue  yes i suppose so  but i am weak  although i know it is all right with our plans i felt a curious dread of him an awe or terror of conventions i dont believe in  it comes over me at times like a sort of creeping paralysis and makes me so sad  you are getting tired sue  ohi forgot darling  yes well go on at once  they started in quest of the lodging and at last found something that seemed to promise well in mildew lanea spot which to jude was irresistiblethough to sue it was not so fascinatinga narrow lane close to the back of a college but having no communication with it  the little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate buildings within which life was so far removed from that of the people in the lane as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe yet only a thickness of wall divided them  two or three of the houses had notices of rooms to let and the newcomers knocked at the door of one which a woman opened  ahlisten said jude suddenly instead of addressing her  what  why the bellswhat church can that be  the tones are familiar  another peal of bells had begun to sound out at some distance off  i dont know said the landlady tartly  did you knock to ask that  no for lodgings said jude coming to himself  the householder scrutinized sues figure a moment  we havent any to let said she shutting the door  jude looked discomfited and the boy distressed  now jude said sue let me try  you dont know the way  they found a second place hard by but here the occupier observing not only sue but the boy and the small children said civilly i am sorry to say we dont let where there are children and also closed the door  the small child squared its mouth and cried silently with an instinct that trouble loomed  the boy sighed  i dont like christminster he said  are the great old houses gaols  no colleges said jude which perhaps youll study in some day  id rather not the boy rejoined  now well try again said sue  ill pull my cloak more round me  leaving kennetbridge for this place is like coming from caiaphas to pilate   how do i look now dear  nobody would notice it now said jude  there was one other house and they tried a third time  the woman here was more amiable but she had little room to spare and could only agree to take in sue and the children if her husband could go elsewhere  this arrangement they perforce adopted in the stress from delaying their search till so late  they came to terms with her though her price was rather high for their pockets  but they could not afford to be critical till jude had time to get a more permanent abode and in this house sue took possession of a back room on the second floor with an inner closetroom for the children  jude stayed and had a cup of tea and was pleased to find that the window commanded the back of another of the colleges  kissing all four he went to get a few necessaries and look for lodgings for himself  when he was gone the landlady came up to talk a little with sue and gather something of the circumstances of the family she had taken in sue had not the art of prevarication and after admitting several facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings she was startled by the landlady saying suddenly  are you really a married woman  sue hesitated and then impulsively told the woman that her husband and herself had each been unhappy in their first marriages after which terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union and lest the conditions of the contract should kill their love yet wishing to be together they had literally not found the courage to repeat it though they had attempted it two or three times therefore though in her own sense of the words she was a married woman in the landladys sense she was not  the housewife looked embarrassed and went downstairs  sue sat by the window in a reverie watching the rain  her quiet was broken by the noise of someone entering the house and then the voices of a man and woman in conversation in the passage below  the landladys husband had arrived and she was explaining to him the incoming of the lodgers during his absence  his voice rose in sudden anger  now who wants such a woman here and perhaps a confinement   besides didnt i say i wouldnt have children  the hall and stairs fresh painted to be kicked about by them  you must have known all was not straight with emcoming like that  taking in a family when i said a single man  the wife expostulated but as it seemed the husband insisted on his point for presently a tap came to sues door and the woman appeared  i am sorry to tell you maam she said that i cant let you have the room for the week after all  my husband objects and therefore i must ask you to go  i dont mind your staying over tonight as it is getting late in the afternoon but i shall be glad if you can leave early in the morning  though she knew that she was entitled to the lodging for a week sue did not wish to create a disturbance between the wife and husband and she said she would leave as requested  when the landlady had gone sue looked out of the window again  finding that the rain had ceased she proposed to the boy that after putting the little ones to bed they should go out and search about for another place and bespeak it for the morrow so as not to be so harddriven then as they had been that day  therefore instead of unpacking her boxes which had just been sent on from the station by jude they sallied out into the damp though not unpleasant streets sue resolving not to disturb her husband with the news of her notice to quit while he was perhaps worried in obtaining a lodging for himself  in the company of the boy she wandered into this street and into that but though she tried a dozen different houses she fared far worse alone than she had fared in judes company and could get nobody to promise her a room for the following day  every householder looked askance at such a woman and child inquiring for accommodation in the gloom  i ought not to be born ought i said the boy with misgiving  thoroughly tired at last sue returned to the place where she was not welcome but where at least she had temporary shelter  in her absence jude had left his address but knowing how weak he still was she adhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next day    ii   sue sat looking at the bare floor of the room the house being little more than an old intramural cottage and then she regarded the scene outside the uncurtained window  at some distance opposite the outer walls of sarcophagus collegesilent black and windowlessthrew their four centuries of gloom bigotry and decay into the little room she occupied shutting out the moonlight by night and the sun by day  the outlines of rubric college also were discernible beyond the other and the tower of a third farther off still  she thought of the strange operation of a simpleminded mans ruling passion that it should have led jude who loved her and the children so tenderly to place them here in this depressing purlieu because he was still haunted by his dream  even now he did not distinctly hear the freezing negative that those scholared walls had echoed to his desire  the failure to find another lodging and the lack of room in this house for his father had made a deep impression on the boya brooding undemonstrative horror seemed to have seized him  the silence was broken by his saying mother what shall we do tomorrow  i dont know said sue despondently  i am afraid this will trouble your father  i wish father was quite well and there had been room for him then it wouldnt matter so much  poor father  it wouldnt  can i do anything  no  all is trouble adversity and suffering  father went away to give us children room didnt he  partly  it would be better to be out o the world than in it wouldnt it  it would almost dear  tis because of us children too isnt it that you cant get a good lodging  wellpeople do object to children sometimes  then if children make so much trouble why do people have em  ohbecause it is a law of nature  but we dont ask to be born  no indeed  and what makes it worse with me is that you are not my real mother and you neednt have had me unless you liked  i oughtnt to have come to eethats the real truth  i troubled em in australia and i trouble folk here  i wish i hadnt been born  you couldnt help it my dear  i think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they should be killed directly before their souls come to em and not allowed to grow big and walk about  sue did not reply  she was doubtfully pondering how to treat this too reflective child  she at last concluded that so far as circumstances permitted she would be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties like an aged friend  there is going to be another in our family soon she hesitatingly remarked  how  there is going to be another baby  what  the boy jumped up wildly  oh god mother youve never asent for another and such trouble with what youve got  yes i have i am sorry to say murmured sue her eyes glistening with suspended tears  the boy burst out weeping  oh you dont care you dont care he cried in bitter reproach  how ever could you mother be so wicked and cruel as this when you neednt have done it till we was better off and father well  to bring us all into more trouble  no room for us and father aforced to go away and we turned out tomorrow and yet you be going to have another of us soon   tis done o purposetistis  he walked up and down sobbing  yyou must forgive me little jude she pleaded her bosom heaving now as much as the boys i cant explaini will when you are older  it does seemas if i had done it on purpose now we are in these difficulties  i cant explain dear  but itis not quite on purposei cant help it  yes it isit must be  for nobody would interfere with us like that unless you agreed  i wont forgive you ever ever  ill never believe you care for me or father or any of us any more  he got up and went away into the closet adjoining her room in which a bed had been spread on the floor  there she heard him say if we children was gone thered be no trouble at all  dont think that dear she cried rather peremptorily  but go to sleep  the following morning she awoke at a little past six and decided to get up and run across before breakfast to the inn which jude had informed her to be his quarters to tell him what had happened before he went out  she arose softly to avoid disturbing the children who as she knew must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday  she found jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a counterpoise to the expense of her lodging and she explained to him her homelessness  he had been so anxious about her all night he said  somehow now it was morning the request to leave the lodgings did not seem such a depressing incident as it had seemed the night before nor did even her failure to find another place affect her so deeply as at first  jude agreed with her that it would not be worth while to insist upon her right to stay a week but to take immediate steps for removal  you must all come to this inn for a day or two he said  it is a rough place and it will not be so nice for the children but we shall have more time to look round  there are plenty of lodgings in the suburbsin my old quarter of beersheba  have breakfast with me now you are here my bird  you are sure you are well  there will be plenty of time to get back and prepare the childrens meal before they wake  in fact ill go with you  she joined jude in a hasty meal and in a quarter of an hour they started together resolving to clear out from sues too respectable lodging immediately  on reaching the place and going upstairs she found that all was quiet in the childrens room and called to the landlady in timorous tones to please bring up the teakettle and something for their breakfast  this was perfunctorily done and producing a couple of eggs which she had brought with her she put them into the boiling kettle and summoned jude to watch them for the youngsters while she went to call them it being now about halfpast eight oclock  jude stood bending over the kettle with his watch in his hand timing the eggs so that his back was turned to the little inner chamber where the children lay  a shriek from sue suddenly caused him to start round  he saw that the door of the room or rather closetwhich had seemed to go heavily upon its hinges as she pushed it backwas open and that sue had sunk to the floor just within it hastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little bed spread on the boards no children were there  he looked in bewilderment round the room  at the back of the door were fixed two hooks for hanging garments and from these the forms of the two youngest children were suspended by a piece of boxcord round each of their necks while from a nail a few yards off the body of little jude was hanging in a similar manner  an overturned chair was near the elder boy and his glazed eyes were slanted into the room but those of the girl and the baby boy were closed  halfparalyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene he let sue lie cut the cords with his pocketknife and threw the three children on the bed but the feel of their bodies in the momentary handling seemed to say that they were dead  he caught up sue who was in fainting fits and put her on the bed in the other room after which he breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a doctor  when he got back sue had come to herself and the two helpless women bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them and the triplet of little corpses formed a sight which overthrew his selfcommand  the nearest surgeon came in but as jude had inferred his presence was superfluous  the children were past saving for though their bodies were still barely cold it was conjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour  the probability held by the parents later on when they were able to reason on the case was that the elder boy on waking looked into the outer room for sue and finding her absent was thrown into a fit of aggravated despondency that the events and information of the evening before had induced in his morbid temperament  moreover a piece of paper was found upon the floor on which was written in the boys hand with the bit of lead pencil that he carried      done because we are too menny   at sight of this sues nerves utterly gave way an awful conviction that her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the tragedy throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no abatement  they carried her away against her wish to a room on the lower floor and there she lay her slight figure shaken with her gasps and her eyes staring at the ceiling the woman of the house vainly trying to soothe her  they could hear from this chamber the people moving about above and she implored to be allowed to go back and was only kept from doing so by the assurance that if there were any hope her presence might do harm and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of herself lest she should endanger a coming life  her inquiries were incessant and at last jude came down and told her there was no hope as soon as she could speak she informed him what she had said to the boy and how she thought herself the cause of this  no said jude  it was in his nature to do it  the doctor says there are such boys springing up amongst usboys of a sort unknown in the last generationthe outcome of new views of life  they seem to see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist them  he says it is the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live  hes an advanced man the doctor but he can give no consolation to  jude had kept back his own grief on account of her but he now broke down and this stimulated sue to efforts of sympathy which in some degree distracted her from her poignant selfreproach  when everybody was gone she was allowed to see the children  the boys face expressed the whole tale of their situation  on that little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow which had darkened the first union of jude and all the accidents mistakes fears errors of the last  he was their nodal point their focus their expression in a single term  for the rashness of those parents he had groaned for their ill assortment he had quaked and for the misfortunes of these he had died  when the house was silent and they could do nothing but await the coroners inquest a subdued large low voice spread into the air of the room from behind the heavy walls at the back  what is it said sue her spasmodic breathing suspended  the organ of the college chapel  the organist practising i suppose its the anthem from the seventythird psalm truly god is loving unto israel  she sobbed again  oh oh my babies  they had done no harm  why should they have been taken away and not i  there was another stillnessbroken at last by two persons in conversation somewhere without  they are talking about us no doubt moaned sue  we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men  jude listenednothey are not talking of us he said  they are two clergymen of different views arguing about the eastward position  good godthe eastward position and all creation groaning  then another silence till she was seized with another uncontrollable fit of grief  there is something external to us which says you shant  first it said you shant learn  then it said you shant labour  now it says you shant love  he tried to soothe her by saying thats bitter of you darling  but its true  thus they waited and she went back again to her room  the babys frock shoes and socks which had been lying on a chair at the time of his death she would not now have removed though jude would fain have got them out of her sight  but whenever he touched them she implored him to let them lie and burst out almost savagely at the woman of the house when she also attempted to put them away  jude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her paroxysms  why dont you speak to me jude she cried out after one of these  dont turn away from me  i cant bear the loneliness of being out of your looks  there dear here i am he said putting his face close to hers  yes  oh my comrade our perfect unionour twoinonenessis now stained with blood  shadowed by deaththats all  ah but it was i who incited him really though i didnt know i was doing it  i talked to the child as one should only talk to people of mature age  i said the world was against us that it was better to be out of life than in it at this price and he took it literally and i told him i was going to have another child  it upset him  oh how bitterly he upbraided me  why did you do it sue  i cant tell  it was that i wanted to be truthful  i couldnt bear deceiving him as to the facts of life  and yet i wasnt truthful for with a false delicacy i told him too obscurelywhy was i halfwiser than my fellowwomen  and not entirely wiser  why didnt i tell him pleasant untruths instead of halfrealities  it was my want of selfcontrol so that i could neither conceal things nor reveal them  your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases only in our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps  he must have known sooner or later  and i was just making my baby darling a new frock and now i shall never see him in it and never talk to him any more   my eyes are so swollen that i can scarcely see and yet little more than a year ago i called myself happy  we went about loving each other too muchindulging ourselves to utter selfishness with each other  we saiddo you rememberthat we would make a virtue of joy  i said it was natures intention natures law and raison dêtre that we should be joyful in what instincts she afforded usinstincts which civilization had taken upon itself to thwart what dreadful things i said  and now fate has given us this stab in the back for being such fools as to take nature at her word  she sank into a quiet contemplation till she said it is best perhaps that they should be goneyesi see it is  better that they should be plucked fresh than stay to wither away miserably  yes replied jude  some say that the elders should rejoice when their children die in infancy  but they dont know   oh my babies my babies could you be alive now  you may say the boy wished to be out of life or he wouldnt have done it  it was not unreasonable for him to die it was part of his incurably sad nature poor little fellow  but then the othersmy own children and yours  again sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and shoes and her figure quivered like a string  i am a pitiable creature she said good neither for earth nor heaven any more i am driven out of my mind by things  what ought to be done she stared at jude and tightly held his hand  nothing can be done he replied  things are as they are and will be brought to their destined issue  she paused  yes  who said that she asked heavily  it comes in the chorus of the agamemnon  it has been in my mind continually since this happened  my poor judehow youve missed everythingyou more than i for i did get you  to think you should know that by your unassisted reading and yet be in poverty and despair  after such momentary diversions her grief would return in a wave  the jury duly came and viewed the bodies the inquest was held and next arrived the melancholy morning of the funeral  accounts in the newspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers who stood apparently counting the windowpanes and the stones of the walls doubt of the real relations of the couple added zest to their curiosity  sue had declared that she would follow the two little ones to the grave but at the last moment she gave way and the coffins were quietly carried out of the house while she was lying down  jude got into the vehicle and it drove away much to the relief of the landlord who now had only sue and her luggage remaining on his hands which he hoped to be also clear of later on in the day and so to have freed his house from the exasperating notoriety it had acquired during the week through his wifes unlucky admission of these strangers  in the afternoon he privately consulted with the owner of the house and they agreed that if any objection to it arose from the tragedy which had occurred there they would try to get its number changed  when jude had seen the two little boxesone containing little jude and the other the two smallestdeposited in the earth he hastened back to sue who was still in her room and he therefore did not disturb her just then  feeling anxious however he went again about four oclock  the woman thought she was still lying down but returned to him to say that she was not in her bedroom after all her hat and jacket too were missing she had gone out  jude hurried off to the public house where he was sleeping  she had not been there  then bethinking himself of possibilities he went along the road to the cemetery which he entered and crossed to where the interments had recently taken place  the idlers who had followed to the spot by reason of the tragedy were all gone now  a man with a shovel in his hands was attempting to earth in the common grave of the three children but his arm was held back by an expostulating woman who stood in the halffilled hole  it was sue whose coloured clothing which she had never thought of changing for the mourning he had bought suggested to the eye a deeper grief than the conventional garb of bereavement could express  hes filling them in and he shant till ive seen my little ones again she cried wildly when she saw jude  i want to see them once more  oh judeplease judei want to see them  i didnt know you would let them be taken away while i was asleep  you said perhaps i should see them once more before they were screwed down and then you didnt but took them away  oh jude you are cruel to me too  shes been wanting me to dig out the grave again and let her get to the coffins said the man with the spade  she ought to be took home by the look o her  she is hardly responsible poor thing seemingly  cant dig em up again now maam  do ye go home with your husband and take it quiet and thank god that therell be another soon to swage yer grief  but sue kept asking piteously cant i see them once morejust once  cant i  only just one little minute jude  it would not take long  and i should be so glad jude  i will be so good and not disobey you ever any more jude if you will let me  i would go home quietly afterwards and not want to see them any more  cant i why cant i  thus she went on  jude was thrown into such acute sorrow that he almost felt he would try to get the man to accede  but it could do no good and might make her still worse and he saw that it was imperative to get her home at once  so he coaxed her and whispered tenderly and put his arm round her to support her till she helplessly gave in and was induced to leave the cemetery  he wished to obtain a fly to take her back in but economy being so imperative she deprecated his doing so and they walked along slowly jude in black crape she in brown and red clothing  they were to have gone to a new lodging that afternoon but jude saw that it was not practicable and in course of time they entered the now hated house  sue was at once got to bed and the doctor sent for  jude waited all the evening downstairs  at a very late hour the intelligence was brought to him that a child had been prematurely born and that it like the others was a corpse    iii   sue was convalescent though she had hoped for death and jude had again obtained work at his old trade  they were in other lodgings now in the direction of beersheba and not far from the church of ceremoniessaint silas  they would sit silent more bodeful of the direct antagonism of things than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness  vague and quaint imaginings had haunted sue in the days when her intellect scintillated like a star that the world resembled a stanza or melody composed in a dream it was wonderfully excellent to the halfaroused intelligence but hopelessly absurd at the full waking that the first cause worked automatically like a somnambulist and not reflectively like a sage that at the framing of the terrestrial conditions there seemed never to have been contemplated such a development of emotional perceptiveness among the creatures subject to those conditions as that reached by thinking and educated humanity  but affliction makes opposing forces loom anthropomorphous and those ideas were now exchanged for a sense of jude and herself fleeing from a persecutor  we must conform she said mournfully  all the ancient wrath of the power above us has been vented upon us his poor creatures and we must submit  there is no choice  we must  it is no use fighting against god  it is only against man and senseless circumstance said jude  true she murmured  what have i been thinking of  i am getting as superstitious as a savage   but whoever or whatever our foe may be i am cowed into submission  i have no more fighting strength left no more enterprise  i am beaten beaten   we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men  i am always saying that now  i feel the same  what shall we do  you are in work now but remember it may only be because our history and relations are not absolutely known  possibly if they knew our marriage had not been formalized they would turn you out of your job as they did at aldbrickham  i hardly know  perhaps they would hardly do that  however i think that we ought to make it legal nowas soon as you are able to go out  you think we ought  certainly  and jude fell into thought  i have seemed to myself lately he said to belong to that vast band of men shunned by the virtuousthe men called seducers  it amazes me when i think of it i have not been conscious of it or of any wrongdoing towards you whom i love more than myself  yet i am one of those men  i wonder if any other of them are the same purblind simple creatures as i   yes suethats what i am  i seduced you  you were a distinct typea refined creature intended by nature to be left intact  but i couldnt leave you alone  no no jude she said quickly  dont reproach yourself with being what you are not  if anybody is to blame it is i  i supported you in your resolve to leave phillotson and without me perhaps you wouldnt have urged him to let you go  i should have just the same  as to ourselves the fact of our not having entered into a legal contract is the saving feature in our union  we have thereby avoided insulting as it were the solemnity of our first marriages  solemnity  jude looked at her with some surprise and grew conscious that she was not the sue of their earlier time  yes she said with a little quiver in her words i have had dreadful fears a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action i have thoughtthat i am still his wife  whose  richards  good god dearestwhy  oh i cant explain  only the thought comes to me  it is your weaknessa sick fancy without reason or meaning dont let it trouble you  sue sighed uneasily  as a setoff against such discussions as these there had come an improvement in their pecuniary position which earlier in their experience would have made them cheerful  jude had quite unexpectedly found good employment at his old trade almost directly he arrived the summer weather suiting his fragile constitution and outwardly his days went on with that monotonous uniformity which is in itself so grateful after vicissitude  people seemed to have forgotten that he had ever shown any awkward aberrancies and he daily mounted to the parapets and copings of colleges he could never enter and renewed the crumbling freestones of mullioned windows he would never look from as if he had known no wish to do otherwise  there was this change in him that he did not often go to any service at the churches now  one thing troubled him more than any other that sue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions since the tragedy events which had enlarged his own views of life laws customs and dogmas had not operated in the same manner on sues  she was no longer the same as in the independent days when her intellect played like lambent lightning over conventions and formalities which he at that time respected though he did not now  on a particular sunday evening he came in rather late  she was not at home but she soon returned when he found her silent and meditative  what are you thinking of little woman he asked curiously  oh i cant tell clearly  i have thought that we have been selfish careless even impious in our courses you and i  our life has been a vain attempt at selfdelight  but selfabnegation is the higher road  we should mortify the fleshthe terrible fleshthe curse of adam  sue he murmured  what has come over you  we ought to be continually sacrificing ourselves on the altar of duty  but i have always striven to do what has pleased me  i well deserved the scourging i have got  i wish something would take the evil right out of me and all my monstrous errors and all my sinful ways  suemy own too suffering deartheres no evil woman in you  your natural instincts are perfectly healthy not quite so impassioned perhaps as i could wish but good and dear and pure  and as i have often said you are absolutely the most ethereal least sensual woman i ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness  why do you talk in such a changed way  we have not been selfish except when no one could profit by our being otherwise  you used to say that human nature was noble and longsuffering not vile and corrupt and at last i thought you spoke truly  and now you seem to take such a much lower view  i want a humble heart and a chastened mind and i have never had them yet  you have been fearless both as a thinker and as a feeler and you deserved more admiration than i gave  i was too full of narrow dogmas at that time to see it  dont say that jude  i wish my every fearless word and thought could be rooted out of my history  selfrenunciationthats everything  i cannot humiliate myself too much  i should like to prick myself all over with pins and bleed out the badness thats in me  hush he said pressing her little face against his breast as if she were an infant  it is bereavement that has brought you to this such remorse is not for you my sensitive plant but for the wicked ones of the earthwho never feel it  i ought not to stay like this she murmured when she had remained in the position a long while  why not  it is indulgence  still on the same tack  but is there anything better on earth than that we should love one another  yes  it depends on the sort of love and yoursoursis the wrong  i wont have it sue  come when do you wish our marriage to be signed in a vestry  she paused and looked up uneasily  never she whispered  not knowing the whole of her meaning he took the objection serenely and said nothing  several minutes elapsed and he thought she had fallen asleep but he spoke softly and found that she was wide awake all the time  she sat upright and sighed  there is a strange indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you tonight sue he said  i mean not only mentally but about your clothes also  a sort of vegetable scent which i seem to know yet cannot remember  it is incense  incense  i have been to the service at st silas and i was in the fumes of it  ohst silas  yes  i go there sometimes  indeed  you go there  you see jude it is lonely here in the weekday mornings when you are at work and i think and think ofof my  she stopped till she could control the lumpiness of her throat  and i have taken to go in there as it is so near  oh wellof course i say nothing against it  only it is odd for you  they little think what sort of chiel is amang them  what do you mean jude  wella sceptic to be plain  how can you pain me so dear jude in my trouble  yet i know you didnt mean it  but you ought not to say that  i wont but i am much surprised  welli want to tell you something else jude  you wont be angry will you  i have thought of it a good deal since my babies died i dont think i ought to be your wifeor as your wifeany longer  what   but you are  from your point of view but  of course we were afraid of the ceremony and a good many others would have been in our places with such strong reasons for fears but experience has proved how we misjudged ourselves and overrated our infirmities and if you are beginning to respect rites and ceremonies as you seem to be i wonder you dont say it shall be carried out instantly  you certainly are my wife sue in all but law  what do you mean by what you said  i dont think i am  not  but suppose we had gone through the ceremony  would you feel that you were then  no i should not feel even then that i was  i should feel worse than i do now  why soin the name of all thats perverse my dear  because i am richards  ahyou hinted that absurd fancy to me before  it was only an impression with me then i feel more and more convinced as time goes on thati belong to him or to nobody  my good heavenshow we are changing places  yes  perhaps so  some few days later in the dusk of the summer evening they were sitting in the same small room downstairs when a knock came to the front door of the carpenters house where they were lodging and in a few moments there was a tap at the door of their room  before they could open it the comer did so and a womans form appeared  is mr fawley here  jude and sue started as he mechanically replied in the affirmative for the voice was arabellas  he formally requested her to come in and she sat down in the window bench where they could distinctly see her outline against the light but no characteristic that enabled them to estimate her general aspect and air  yet something seemed to denote that she was not quite so comfortably circumstanced nor so bouncingly attired as she had been during cartletts lifetime  the three attempted an awkward conversation about the tragedy of which jude had felt it to be his duty to inform her immediately though she had never replied to his letter  i have just come from the cemetery she said  i inquired and found the childs grave  i couldnt come to the funeralthank you for inviting me all the same  i read all about it in the papers and i felt i wasnt wanted  noi couldnt come to the funeral repeated arabella who seeming utterly unable to reach the ideal of a catastrophic manner fumbled with iterations  but i am glad i found the grave  as tis your trade jude youll be able to put up a handsome stone to em  i shall put up a headstone said jude drearily  he was my child and naturally i feel for him  i hope so  we all did  the others that werent mine i didnt feel so much for as was natural  of course  a sigh came from the dark corner where sue sat  i had often wished i had mine with me continued mrs cartlett perhaps twouldnt have happened then  but of course i didnt wish to take him away from your wife  i am not his wife came from sue  the unexpectedness of her words struck jude silent  oh i beg your pardon im sure said arabella  i thought you were  jude had known from the quality of sues tone that her new and transcendental views lurked in her words but all except their obvious meaning was naturally missed by arabella  the latter after evincing that she was struck by sues avowal recovered herself and went on to talk with placid bluntness about her boy for whom though in his lifetime she had shown no care at all she now exhibited a ceremonial mournfulness that was apparently sustaining to the conscience  she alluded to the past and in making some remark appealed again to sue  there was no answer sue had invisibly left the room  she said she was not your wife resumed arabella in another voice why should she do that  i cannot inform you said jude shortly  she is isnt she  she once told me so  i dont criticize what she says  ahi see  well my time is up  i am staying here tonight and thought i could do no less than call after our mutual affliction i am sleeping at the place where i used to be barmaid and tomorrow i go back to alfredston  father is come home again and i am living with him  he has returned from australia said jude with languid curiosity  yes  couldnt get on there  had a rough time of it  mother died of dyswhat do you call itin the hot weather and father and two of the young ones have just got back  he has got a cottage near the old place and for the present i am keeping house for him  judes former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good breeding even now that sue was gone and limited her stay to a number of minutes that should accord with the highest respectability  when she had departed jude much relieved went to the stairs and called suefeeling anxious as to what had become of her  there was no answer and the carpenter who kept the lodgings said she had not come in  jude was puzzled and became quite alarmed at her absence for the hour was growing late  the carpenter called his wife who conjectured that sue might have gone to st silas church as she often went there  surely not at this time o night said jude  it is shut  she knows somebody who keeps the key and she has it whenever she wants it  how long has she been going on with this  oh some few weeks i think  jude went vaguely in the direction of the church which he had never once approached since he lived out that way years before when his young opinions were more mystical than they were now  the spot was deserted but the door was certainly unfastened he lifted the latch without noise and pushing to the door behind him stood absolutely still inside  the prevalent silence seemed to contain a faint sound explicable as a breathing or a sobbing which came from the other end of the building  the floorcloth deadened his footsteps as he moved in that direction through the obscurity which was broken only by the faintest reflected nightlight from without  high overhead above the chancel steps jude could discern a huge solidly constructed latin crossas large probably as the original it was designed to commemorate  it seemed to be suspended in the air by invisible wires it was set with large jewels which faintly glimmered in some weak ray caught from outside as the cross swayed to and fro in a silent and scarcely perceptible motion  underneath upon the floor lay what appeared to be a heap of black clothes and from this was repeated the sobbing that he had heard before  it was his sues form prostrate on the paving  sue he whispered  something white disclosed itself she had turned up her face  whatdo you want with me here jude she said almost sharply you shouldnt come  i wanted to be alone  why did you intrude here  how can you ask he retorted in quick reproach for his full heart was wounded to its centre at this attitude of hers towards him why do i come  who has a right to come i should like to know if i have not  i who love you better than my own selfbetterfar betterthan you have loved me  what made you leave me to come here alone  dont criticize me judei cant bear iti have often told you so  you must take me as i am  i am a wretchbroken by my distractions  i couldnt bear it when arabella camei felt so utterly miserable i had to come away  she seems to be your wife still and richard to be my husband  but they are nothing to us  yes dear friend they are  i see marriage differently now  my babies have been taken from me to show me this  arabellas child killing mine was a judgementthe right slaying the wrong  what what shall i do  i am such a vile creaturetoo worthless to mix with ordinary human beings  this is terrible said jude verging on tears  it is monstrous and unnatural for you to be so remorseful when you have done no wrong  ahyou dont know my badness  he returned vehemently i do  every atom and dreg of it  you make me hate christianity or mysticism or sacerdotalism or whatever it may be called if its that which has caused this deterioration in you  that a womanpoet a womanseer a woman whose soul shone like a diamondwhom all the wise of the world would have been proud of if they could have known youshould degrade herself like this  i am glad i had nothing to do with divinitydamn gladif its going to ruin you in this way  you are angry jude and unkind to me and dont see how things are  then come along home with me dearest and perhaps i shall  i am overburdenedand you too are unhinged just now  he put his arm round her and lifted her but though she came she preferred to walk without his support  i dont dislike you jude she said in a sweet and imploring voice i love you as much as ever  onlyi ought not to love youany more  oh i must not any more  i cant own it  but i have made up my mind that i am not your wife  i belong to himi sacramentally joined myself to him for life  nothing can alter it  but surely we are man and wife if ever two people were in this world  natures own marriage it is unquestionably  but not heavens  another was made for me there and ratified eternally in the church at melchester  sue sueaffliction has brought you to this unreasonable state after converting me to your views on so many things to find you suddenly turn to the rightabout like thisfor no reason whatever confounding all you have formerly said through sentiment merely you root out of me what little affection and reverence i had left in me for the church as an old acquaintance  what i cant understand in you is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic  is it peculiar to you or is it common to woman  is a woman a thinking unit at all or a fraction always wanting its integer  how you argued that marriage was only a clumsy contractwhich it ishow you showed all the objections to itall the absurdities  if two and two made four when we were happy together surely they make four now  i cant understand it i repeat  ah dear jude thats because you are like a totally deaf man observing people listening to music  you say what are they regarding  nothing is there  but something is  that is a hard saying from you and not a true parallel  you threw off old husks of prejudices and taught me to do it and now you go back upon yourself  i confess i am utterly stultified in my estimate of you  dear friend my only friend dont be hard with me  i cant help being as i am i am convinced i am rightthat i see the light at last  but oh how to profit by it  they walked along a few more steps till they were outside the building and she had returned the key  can this be the girl said jude when she came back feeling a slight renewal of elasticity now that he was in the open street can this be the girl who brought the pagan deities into this most christian citywho mimicked miss fontover when she crushed them with her heelquoted gibbon and shelley and mill  where are dear apollo and dear venus now  oh dont dont be so cruel to me jude and i so unhappy she sobbed  i cant bear it  i was in errori cannot reason with you i was wrongproud in my own conceit  arabellas coming was the finish  dont satirize me it cuts like a knife  he flung his arms round her and kissed her passionately there in the silent street before she could hinder him  they went on till they came to a little coffeehouse jude she said with suppressed tears would you mind getting a lodging here  i willif if you really wish  but do you  let me go to our door and understand you  he went and conducted her in  she said she wanted no supper and went in the dark upstairs and struck a light  turning she found that jude had followed her and was standing at the chamber door  she went to him put her hand in his and said goodnight  but sue  dont we live here  you said you would do as i wished  yes  very well   perhaps it was wrong of me to argue distastefully as i have done  perhaps as we couldnt conscientiously marry at first in the oldfashioned way we ought to have parted perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as ours  who were we to think we could act as pioneers  i am so glad you see that much at any rate  i never deliberately meant to do as i did  i slipped into my false position through jealousy and agitation  but surely through loveyou loved me  yes  but i wanted to let it stop there and go on always as mere lovers until  but people in love couldnt live for ever like that  women could men cant because theywont an average woman is in this superior to an average manthat she never instigates only responds  we ought to have lived in mental communion and no more  i was the unhappy cause of the change as i have said before   well as you will   but human nature cant help being itself  oh yesthats just what it has to learnselfmastery  i repeatif either were to blame it was not you but i  noit was i  your wickedness was only the natural mans desire to possess the woman  mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy stimulated me to oust arabella  i had thought i ought in charity to let you approach methat it was damnably selfish to torture you as i did my other friend  but i shouldnt have given way if you hadnt broken me down by making me fear you would go back to her  but dont let us say any more about it  jude will you leave me to myself now  yes  but suemy wife as you are he burst out my old reproach to you was after all a true one  you have never loved me as i love younevernever  yours is not a passionate heartyour heart does not burn in a flame  you are upon the whole a sort of fay or spritenot a woman  at first i did not love you jude that i own  when i first knew you i merely wanted you to love me  i did not exactly flirt with you but that inborn craving which undermines some womens morals almost more than unbridled passionthe craving to attract and captivate regardless of the injury it may do the manwas in me and when i found i had caught you i was frightened  and theni dont know how it wasi couldnt bear to let you gopossibly to arabella againand so i got to love you jude  but you see however fondly it ended it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you  and now you add to your cruelty by leaving me  ahyes  the further i flounder the more harm i do  o sue said he with a sudden sense of his own danger  do not do an immoral thing for moral reasons  you have been my social salvation  stay with me for humanitys sake  you know what a weak fellow i am  my two archenemies you knowmy weakness for womankind and my impulse to strong liquor  dont abandon me to them sue to save your own soul only  they have been kept entirely at a distance since you became my guardianangel  since i have had you i have been able to go into any temptations of the sort without risk  isnt my safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle  i am in terror lest if you leave me it will be with me another case of the pig that was washed turning back to his wallowing in the mire  sue burst out weeping  oh but you must not jude  you wont ill pray for you night and day  wellnever mind dont grieve said jude generously  i did suffer god knows about you at that time and now i suffer again but perhaps not so much as you  the woman mostly gets the worst of it in the long run  she does  unless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible  and this one is not that anyhow  sue drew a nervous breath or two  she isi fear   now judegoodnightplease  i mustnt staynot just once more  as it has been so many timeso sue my wife why not  nononot wife   i am in your hands judedont tempt me back now i have advanced so far  very well  i do your bidding  i owe that to you darling in penance for how i overruled it at the first time  my god how selfish i was  perhapsperhaps i spoilt one of the highest and purest loves that ever existed between man and woman   then let the veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour  he went to the bed removed one of the pair of pillows thereon and flung it to the floor  sue looked at him and bending over the bedrail wept silently you dont see that it is a matter of conscience with me and not of dislike to you she brokenly murmured  dislike to you  but i cant say any moreit breaks my heartit will be undoing all i have begun  judegoodnight  goodnight he said and turned to go  oh but you shall kiss me said she starting up  i cantbear  he clasped her and kissed her weeping face as he had scarcely ever done before and they remained in silence till she said goodbye goodbye and then gently pressing him away she got free trying to mitigate the sadness by saying well be dear friends just the same jude wont we  and well see each other sometimesyesand forget all this and try to be as we were long ago  jude did not permit himself to speak but turned and descended the stairs    iv   the man whom sue in her mental volteface was now regarding as her inseparable husband lived still at marygreen  on the day before the tragedy of the children phillotson had seen both her and jude as they stood in the rain at christminster watching the procession to the theatre  but he had said nothing of it at the moment to his companion gillingham who being an old friend was staying with him at the village aforesaid and had indeed suggested the days trip to christminster  what are you thinking of said gillingham as they went home  the university degree you never obtained  no no said phillotson gruffly  of somebody i saw today  in a moment he added susanna  i saw her too  you said nothing  i didnt wish to draw your attention to her  but as you did see her you should have said how dye do my dearthatwas  ah well  i might have  but what do you think of this i have good reason for supposing that she was innocent when i divorced herthat i was all wrong  yes indeed  awkward isnt it  she has taken care to set you right since anyhow apparently  hm thats a cheap sneer  i ought to have waited unquestionably  at the end of the week when gillingham had gone back to his school near shaston phillotson as was his custom went to alfredston market ruminating again on arabellas intelligence as he walked down the long hill which he had known before jude knew it though his history had not beaten so intensely upon its incline  arrived in the town he bought his usual weekly local paper and when he had sat down in an inn to refresh himself for the five miles walk back he pulled the paper from his pocket and read awhile  the account of the strange suicide of a stonemasons children met his eye  unimpassioned as he was it impressed him painfully and puzzled him not a little for he could not understand the age of the elder child being what it was stated to be  however there was no doubt that the newspaper report was in some way true  their cup of sorrow is now full he said and thought and thought of sue and what she had gained by leaving him  arabella having made her home at alfredston and the schoolmaster coming to market there every saturday it was not wonderful that in a few weeks they met againthe precise time being just alter her return from christminster where she had stayed much longer than she had at first intended keeping an interested eye on jude though jude had seen no more of her  phillotson was on his way homeward when he encountered arabella and she was approaching the town  you like walking out this way mrs cartlett he said  ive just begun to again she replied  it is where i lived as maid and wife and all the past things of my life that are interesting to my feelings are mixed up with this road  and they have been stirred up in me too lately for ive been visiting at christminster  yes ive seen jude  ah  how do they bear their terrible affliction  in a very strange wayvery strange  she dont live with him any longer  i only heard of it as a certainty just before i left though i had thought things were drifting that way from their manner when i called on them  not live with her husband  why i should have thought twould have united them more  hes not her husband after all  she has never really married him although they have passed as man and wife so long  and now instead of this sad event making em hurry up and get the thing done legally shes took in a queer religious way just as i was in my affliction at losing cartlett only hers is of a more sterical sort than mine  and she says so i was told that shes your wife in the eye of heaven and the churchyours only and cant be anybody elses by any act of man  ahindeed   separated have they  you see the eldest boy was mine  ohyours  yes poor little fellowborn in lawful wedlock thank god  and perhaps she feels over and above other things that i ought to have been in her place  i cant say  however as for me i am soon off from here  ive got father to look after now and we cant live in such a humdrum place as this  i hope soon to be in a bar again at christminster or some other big town  they parted  when phillotson had ascended the hill a few steps he stopped hastened back and called her  what is or was their address  arabella gave it  thank you  good afternoon  arabella smiled grimly as she resumed her way and practised dimplemaking all along the road from where the pollard willows begin to the old almshouses in the first street of the town  meanwhile phillotson ascended to marygreen and for the first time during a lengthened period he lived with a forward eye  on crossing under the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse to which he had been reduced he stood a moment and pictured sue coming out of the door to meet him  no man had ever suffered more inconvenience from his own charity christian or heathen than phillotson had done in letting sue go  he had been knocked about from pillar to post at the hands of the virtuous almost beyond endurance he had been nearly starved and was now dependent entirely upon the very small stipend from the school of this village where the parson had got illspoken of for befriending him he had often thought of arabellas remarks that he should have been more severe with sue that her recalcitrant spirit would soon have been broken  yet such was his obstinate and illogical disregard of opinion and of the principles in which he had been trained that his convictions on the rightness of his course with his wife had not been disturbed  principles which could be subverted by feeling in one direction were liable to the same catastrophe in another  the instincts which had allowed him to give sue her liberty now enabled him to regard her as none the worse for her life with jude  he wished for her still in his curious way if he did not love her and apart from policy soon felt that he would be gratified to have her again as his always provided that she came willingly  but artifice was necessary he had found for stemming the cold and inhumane blast of the worlds contempt  and here were the materials ready made  by getting sue back and remarrying her on the respectable plea of having entertained erroneous views of her and gained his divorce wrongfully he might acquire some comfort resume his old courses perhaps return to the shaston school if not even to the church as a licentiate  he thought he would write to gillingham to inquire his views and what he thought of his phillotsons sending a letter to her gillingham replied naturally that now she was gone it were best to let her be and considered that if she were anybodys wife she was the wife of the man to whom she had borne three children and owed such tragical adventures  probably as his attachment to her seemed unusually strong the singular pair would make their union legal in course of time and all would be well and decent and in order  but they wontsue wont exclaimed phillotson to himself gillingham is so matter of fact  shes affected by christminster sentiment and teaching  i can see her views on the indissolubility of marriage well enough and i know where she got them  they are not mine but i shall make use of them to further mine  he wrote a brief reply to gillingham  i know i am entirely wrong but i dont agree with you  as to her having lived with and had three children by him my feeling is though i can advance no logical or moral defence of it on the old lines that it has done little more than finish her education  i shall write to her and learn whether what that woman said is true or no  as he had made up his mind to do this before he had written to his friend there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at all  however it was phillotsons way to act thus  he accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to sue and knowing her emotional temperament threw a rhadamanthine strictness into the lines here and there carefully hiding his heterodox feelings not to frighten her  he stated that it having come to his knowledge that her views had considerably changed he felt compelled to say that his own too were largely modified by events subsequent to their parting  he would not conceal from her that passionate love had little to do with his communication  it arose from a wish to make their lives if not a success at least no such disastrous failure as they threatened to become through his acting on what he had considered at the time a principle of justice charity and reason  to indulge ones instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and right was not he had found permitted with impunity in an old civilization like ours  it was necessary to act under an acquired and cultivated sense of the same if you wished to enjoy an average share of comfort and honour and to let crude loving kindness take care of itself  he suggested that she should come to him there at marygreen  on second thoughts he took out the last paragraph but one and having rewritten the letter he dispatched it immediately and in some excitement awaited the issue    a few days after a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped the beersheba suburb of christminster towards the quarter in which jude fawley had taken up his lodging since his division from sue  a timid knock sounded upon the door of his abode  it was eveningso he was at home and by a species of divination he jumped up and rushed to the door himself  will you come out with me  i would rather not come in  i want toto talk with youand to go with you to the cemetery  it had been in the trembling accents of sue that these words came jude put on his hat  it is dreary for you to be out he said but if you prefer not to come in i dont mind  yesi do  i shall not keep you long  jude was too much affected to go on talking at first she too was now such a mere cluster of nerves that all initiatory power seemed to have left her and they proceeded through the fog like acherontic shades for a long while without sound or gesture  i want to tell you she presently said her voice now quick now slow so that you may not hear of it by chance  i am going back to richard  he hasso magnanimouslyagreed to forgive all  going back  how can you go  he is going to marry me again  that is for forms sake and to satisfy the world which does not see things as they are  but of course i am his wife already  nothing has changed that  he turned upon her with an anguish that was wellnigh fierce  but you are my wife  yes you are  you know it  i have always regretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come back legally married to save appearances  i loved you and you loved me and we closed with each other and that made the marriage we still loveyou as well as iknow it sue  therefore our marriage is not cancelled  yes i know how you see it she answered with despairing selfsuppression  but i am going to marry him again as it would be called by you  strictly speaking you toodont mind my saying it judeyou should take backarabella  i should  good godwhat next  but how if you and i had married legally as we were on the point of doing  i should have felt just the samethat ours was not a marriage and i would go back to richard without repeating the sacrament if he asked me  but the world and its ways have a certain worth i suppose therefore i concede a repetition of the ceremony  dont crush all the life out of me by satire and argument i implore you i was strongest once i know and perhaps i treated you cruelly but jude return good for evil  i am the weaker now  dont retaliate upon me but be kind  oh be kind to mea poor wicked woman who is trying to mend  he shook his head hopelessly his eyes wet  the blow of her bereavement seemed to have destroyed her reasoning faculty  the once keen vision was dimmed  all wrong all wrong he said huskily errorperversity  it drives me out of my senses  do you care for him  do you love him  you know you dont  it will be a fanatic prostitutiongod forgive me yesthats what it will be  i dont love himi must must own it in deepest remorse  but i shall try to learn to love him by obeying him  jude argued urged implored but her conviction was proof against all  it seemed to be the one thing on earth on which she was firm and that her firmness in this had left her tottering in every other impulse and wish she possessed  i have been considerate enough to let you know the whole truth and to tell it you myself she said in cut tones that you might not consider yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand  i have even owned the extreme fact that i do not love him  i did not think you would be so rough with me for doing so  i was going to ask you  to give you away  no  to sendmy boxes to meif you would  but i suppose you wont  why of course i will  whatisnt he coming to fetch youto marry you from here  he wont condescend to do that  noi wont let him  i go to him voluntarily just as i went away from him  we are to be married at his little church at marygreen  she was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrongheadedness that jude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of her  i never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances as you sue  no sooner does one expect you to go straight on as the one rational proceeding than you double round the corner  ah well let that go   jude i must say goodbye  but i wanted you to go to the cemetery with me  let our farewell be therebeside the graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my views  they turned in the direction of the place and the gate was opened to them on application  sue had been there often and she knew the way to the spot in the dark  they reached it and stood still  it is herei should like to part said she  so be it  dont think me hard because i have acted on conviction  your generous devotion to me is unparalleled jude  your worldly failure if you have failed is to your credit rather than to your blame remember that the best and greatest among mankind are those who do themselves no worldly good  every successful man is more or less a selfish man  the devoted fail  charity seeketh not her own  in that chapter we are at one ever beloved darling and on it well part friends  its verses will stand fast when all the rest that you call religion has passed away  welldont discuss it  goodbye jude my fellowsinner and kindest friend  goodbye my mistaken wife  goodbye    v   the next afternoon the familiar christminster fog still hung over all things  sues slim shape was only just discernible going towards the station  jude had no heart to go to his work that day  neither could he go anywhere in the direction by which she would be likely to pass he went in an opposite one to a dreary strange flat scene where boughs dripped and coughs and consumption lurked and where he had never been before  sues gone from megone he murmured miserably  she in the meantime had left by the train and reached alfredston road where she entered the steamtram and was conveyed into the town  it had been her request to phillotson that he should not meet her  she wished she said to come to him voluntarily to his very house and hearthstone  it was friday evening which had been chosen because the schoolmaster was disengaged at four oclock that day till the monday morning following  the little car she hired at the bear to drive her to marygreen set her down at the end of the lane half a mile from the village by her desire and preceded her to the schoolhouse with such portion of her luggage as she had brought  on its return she encountered it and asked the driver if he had found the masters house open  the man informed her that he had and that her things had been taken in by the schoolmaster himself  she could now enter marygreen without exciting much observation she crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school on the other side and lifted the latch of the dwelling without knocking  phillotson stood in the middle of the room awaiting her as requested  ive come richard said she looking pale and shaken and sinking into a chair  i cannot believeyou forgive yourwife  everything darling susanna said phillotson  she started at the endearment though it had been spoken advisedly without fervour  then she nerved herself again  my childrenare deadand it is right that they should be  i am gladalmost  they were sinbegotten  they were sacrificed to teach me how to live  their death was the first stage of my purification thats why they have not died in vain   you will take me back  he was so stirred by her pitiful words and tone that he did more than he had meant to do  he bent and kissed her cheek  sue imperceptibly shrank away her flesh quivering under the touch of his lips  phillotsons heart sank for desire was renascent in him  you still have an aversion to me  oh no deari have been driving through the damp and i was chilly she said with a hurried smile of apprehension  when are we going to have the marriage  soon  tomorrow morning early i thoughtif you really wish  i am sending round to the vicar to let him know you are come  i have told him all and he highly approveshe says it will bring our lives to a triumphant and satisfactory issue  butare you sure of yourself it is not too late to refuse now ifyou think you cant bring yourself to it you know  yes yes i can  i want it done quick  tell him tell him at once my strength is tried by the undertakingi cant wait long  have something to eat and drink then and go over to your room at mrs edlins  ill tell the vicar halfpast eight tomorrow before anybody is aboutif thats not too soon for you  my friend gillingham is here to help us in the ceremony  hes been good enough to come all the way from shaston at great inconvenience to himself  unlike a woman in ordinary whose eye is so keen for material things sue seemed to see nothing of the room they were in or any detail of her environment  but on moving across the parlour to put down her muff she uttered a little oh and grew paler than before  her look was that of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin  what said phillotson  the flap of the bureau chanced to be open and in placing her muff upon it her eye had caught a document which lay there  ohonly afunny surprise she said trying to laugh away her cry as she came back to the table  ah  yes said phillotson  the licence it has just come  gillingham now joined them from his room above and sue nervously made herself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought likely to interest him except herself though that interested him most of all  she obediently ate some supper and prepared to leave for her lodging hard by  phillotson crossed the green with her bidding her goodnight at mrs edlins door  the old woman accompanied sue to her temporary quarters and helped her to unpack  among other things she laid out a nightgown tastefully embroidered  ohi didnt know that was put in said sue quickly  i didnt mean it to be  here is a different one  she handed a new and absolutely plain garment of coarse and unbleached calico  but this is the prettiest said mrs edlin  that one is no better than very sackcloth o scripture  yesi meant it to be  give me the other  she took it and began rending it with all her might the tears resounding through the house like a screechowl  but my dear dearwhatever  it is adulterous  it signifies what i dont feeli bought it long agoto please jude  it must be destroyed  mrs edlin lifted her hands and sue excitedly continued to tear the linen into strips laying the pieces in the fire  you med ha give it to me said the widow  it do make my heart ache to see such pretty openwork as that aburned by the flamesnot that ornamental nightrails can be much use to a ould ooman like i my days for such be all past and gone  it is an accursed thingit reminds me of what i want to forget sue repeated  it is only fit for the fire  lord you be too strict  what do ye use such words for and condemn to hell your dear little innocent children thats lost to ee  upon my life i dont call that religion  sue flung her face upon the bed sobbing  oh dont dont  that kills me  she remained shaken with her grief and slipped down upon her knees  ill tell ee whatyou ought not to marry this man again said mrs edlin indignantly  you are in love wi t other still  yes i musti am his already  pshoo  you be t other mans  if you didnt like to commit yourselves to the binding vow again just at first twas all the more credit to your consciences considering your reasons and you med ha lived on and made it all right at last  after all it concerned nobody but your own two selves  richard says hell have me back and im bound to go  if he had refused it might not have been so much my duty togive up jude but  she remained with her face in the bedclothes and mrs edlin left the room  phillotson in the interval had gone back to his friend gillingham who still sat over the suppertable  they soon rose and walked out on the green to smoke awhile  a light was burning in sues room a shadow moving now and then across the blind  gillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of sue and after a silence he said well youve all but got her again at last  she cant very well go a second time  the pear has dropped into your hand  yes   i suppose i am right in taking her at her word  i confess there seems a touch of selfishness in it  apart from her being what she is of course a luxury for a fogy like me it will set me right in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity who have never forgiven me for letting her go  so i may get back in some degree into my old track  wellif youve got any sound reason for marrying her again do it now in gods name  i was always against your opening the cagedoor and letting the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way  you might have been a school inspector by this time or a reverend if you hadnt been so weak about her  i did myself irreparable damagei know it  once youve got her housed again stick to her  phillotson was more evasive tonight  he did not care to admit clearly that his taking sue to him again had at bottom nothing to do with repentance of letting her go but was primarily a human instinct flying in the face of custom and profession  he said yesi shall do that  i know woman better now  whatever justice there was in releasing her there was little logic for one holding my views on other subjects  gillingham looked at him and wondered whether it would ever happen that the reactionary spirit induced by the worlds sneers and his own physical wishes would make phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her than he had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind  i perceive it wont do to give way to impulse phillotson resumed feeling more and more every minute the necessity of acting up to his position  i flew in the face of the churchs teaching but i did it without malice prepense  women are so strange in their influence that they tempt you to misplaced kindness  however i know myself better now  a little judicious severity perhaps  yes but you must tighten the reins by degrees only  dont be too strenuous at first  shell come to any terms in time  the caution was unnecessary though phillotson did not say so  i remember what my vicar at shaston said when i left after the row that was made about my agreeing to her elopement  the only thing you can do to retrieve your position and hers is to admit your error in not restraining her with a wise and strong hand and to get her back again if shell come and be firm in the future  but i was so headstrong at that time that i paid no heed  and that after the divorce she should have thought of doing so i did not dream  the gate of mrs edlins cottage clicked and somebody began crossing in the direction of the school  phillotson said goodnight  oh is that mr phillotson said mrs edlin  i was going over to see ee  ive been upstairs with her helping her to unpack her things and upon my word sir i dont think this ought to be  whatthe wedding  yes  shes forcing herself to it poor dear little thing and youve no notion what shes suffering  i was never much for religion nor against it but it cant be right to let her do this and you ought to persuade her out of it  of course everybody will say it was very good and forgiving of ee to take her to ee again  but for my part i dont  its her wish and i am willing said phillotson with grave reserve opposition making him illogically tenacious now  a great piece of laxity will be rectified  i dont believe it  shes his wife if anybodys  shes had three children by him and he loves her dearly and its a wicked shame to egg her on to this poor little quivering thing  shes got nobody on her side  the one man whod be her friend the obstinate creature wont allow to come near her  what first put her into this mood o mind i wonder  i cant tell  not i certainly  it is all voluntary on her part now thats all i have to say  phillotson spoke stiffly  youve turned round mrs edlin  it is unseemly of you  well  i knowed youd be affronted at what i had to say but i dont mind that  the truths the truth  im not affronted mrs edlin  youve been too kind a neighbour for that  but i must be allowed to know whats best for myself and susanna  i suppose you wont go to church with us then  no  be hanged if i can  i dont know what the times be coming to  matrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one really do feel afeard to move in it at all  in my time we took it more careless and i dont know that we was any the worse for it when i and my poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketing all the week and drunk the parish dry and had to borrow half a crown to begin housekeeping  when mrs edlin had gone back to her cottage phillotson spoke moodily  i dont know whether i ought to do itat any rate quite so rapidly  why  if she is really compelling herself to this against her instinctsmerely from this new sense of duty or religioni ought perhaps to let her wait a bit  now youve got so far you ought not to back out of it  thats my opinion  i cant very well put it off now thats true  but i had a qualm when she gave that little cry at sight of the licence  now never you have qualms old boy  i mean to give her away tomorrow morning and you mean to take her  it has always been on my conscience that i didnt urge more objections to your letting her go and now weve got to this stage i shant be content if i dont help you to set the matter right  phillotson nodded and seeing how staunch his friend was became more frank  no doubt when it gets known what ive done i shall be thought a soft fool by many  but they dont know sue as i do though so elusive hers is such an honest nature at bottom that i dont think she has ever done anything against her conscience  the fact of her having lived with fawley goes for nothing  at the time she left me for him she thought she was quite within her right  now she thinks otherwise  the next morning came and the selfsacrifice of the woman on the altar of what she was pleased to call her principles was acquiesced in by these two friends each from his own point of view  phillotson went across to the widow edlins to fetch sue a few minutes after eight oclock  the fog of the previous day or two on the lowlands had travelled up here by now and the trees on the green caught armfuls and turned them into showers of big drops  the bride was waiting ready bonnet and all on  she had never in her life looked so much like the lily her name connoted as she did in that pallid morning light  chastened worldweary remorseful the strain on her nerves had preyed upon her flesh and bones and she appeared smaller in outline than she had formerly done though sue had not been a large woman in her days of rudest health  prompt said the schoolmaster magnanimously taking her hand but he checked his impulse to kiss her remembering her start of yesterday which unpleasantly lingered in his mind  gillingham joined them and they left the house widow edlin continuing steadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony  where is the church said sue  she had not lived there for any length of time since the old church was pulled down and in her preoccupation forgot the new one  up here said phillotson and presently the tower loomed large and solemn in the fog  the vicar had already crossed to the building and when they entered he said pleasantly we almost want candles  you dowish me to be yours richard gasped sue in a whisper  certainly dear above all things in the world  sue said no more and for the second or third time he felt he was not quite following out the humane instinct which had induced him to let her go  there they stood five altogether the parson the clerk the couple and gillingham and the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith in the nave of the edifice were two or three villagers and when the clergyman came to the words what god hath joined a womans voice from among these was heard to utter audibly  god hath jined indeed  it was like a reenactment by the ghosts of their former selves of the similar scene which had taken place at melchester years before when the books were signed the vicar congratulated the husband and wife on having performed a noble and righteous and mutually forgiving act  alls well that ends well he said smiling may you long be happy together after thus having been saved as by fire  they came down the nearly empty building and crossed to the schoolhouse  gillingham wanted to get home that night and left early  he too congratulated the couple  now he said in parting from phillotson who walked out a little way i shall be able to tell the people in your native place a good round tale and theyll all say well done depend on it  when the schoolmaster got back sue was making a pretence of doing some housewifery as if she lived there  but she seemed timid at his approach and compunction wrought on him at sight of it  of course my dear i shant expect to intrude upon your personal privacy any more than i did before he said gravely  it is for our good socially to do this and thats its justification if it was not my reason  sue brightened a little    vi   the place was the door of judes lodging in the outskirts of christminsterfar from the precincts of st silas where he had formerly lived which saddened him to sickness  the rain was coming down  a woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep talking to jude who held the door in his hand  i am lonely destitute and houselessthats what i am  father has turned me out of doors after borrowing every penny id got to put it into his business and then accusing me of laziness when i was only waiting for a situation  i am at the mercy of the world  if you cant take me and help me jude i must go to the workhouse or to something worse  only just now two undergraduates winked at me as i came along  tis hard for a woman to keep virtuous where theres so many young men  the woman in the rain who spoke thus was arabella the evening being that of the day after sues remarriage with phillotson  i am sorry for you but i am only in lodgings said jude coldly  then you turn me away  ill give you enough to get food and lodging for a few days  oh but cant you have the kindness to take me in  i cannot endure going to a public house to lodge and i am so lonely  please jude for old times sake  no no said jude hastily  i dont want to be reminded of those things and if you talk about them i shall not help you  then i suppose i must go said arabella  she bent her head against the doorpost and began sobbing  the house is full said jude  and i have only a little extra room to my ownnot much more than a closetwhere i keep my tools and templates and the few books i have left  that would be a palace for me  there is no bedstead in it  a bit of a bed could be made on the floor  it would be good enough for me  unable to be harsh with her and not knowing what to do jude called the man who let the lodgings and said this was an acquaintance of his in great distress for want of temporary shelter  you may remember me as barmaid at the lamb and flag formerly spoke up arabella  my father has insulted me this afternoon and ive left him though without a penny  the householder said he could not recall her features  but still if you are a friend of mr fawleys well do what we can for a day or twoif hell make himself answerable  yes yes said jude  she has really taken me quite unawares but i should wish to help her out of her difficulty  and an arrangement was ultimately come to under which a bed was to be thrown down in judes lumberroom to make it comfortable for arabella till she could get out of the strait she was innot by her own fault as she declaredand return to her fathers again  while they were waiting for this to be done arabella said you know the news i suppose  i guess what you mean but i know nothing  i had a letter from anny at alfredston today she had just heard that the wedding was to be yesterday but she didnt know if it had come off  i dont wish to talk of it  no no of course you dont  only it shows what kind of woman  dont speak of her i say  shes a fool  and shes an angel too poor dear  if its done hell have a chance of getting back to his old position by everybodys account so anny says  all his wellwishers will be pleased including the bishop himself  do spare me arabella  arabella was duly installed in the little attic and at first she did not come near jude at all  she went to and fro about her own business which when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the passage she informed him was that of obtaining another place in the occupation she understood best  when jude suggested london as affording the most likely opening in the liquor trade she shook her head  nothe temptations are too many she said any humble tavern in the country before that for me  on the sunday morning following when he breakfasted later than on other days she meekly asked him if she might come in to breakfast with him as she had broken her teapot and could not replace it immediately the shops being shut  yes if you like he said indifferently  while they sat without speaking she suddenly observed you seem all in a brood old man  im sorry for you  i am all in a brood  it is about her i know  its no business of mine but i could find out all about the weddingif it really did take placeif you wanted to know  how could you  i wanted to go to alfredston to get a few things i left there  and i could see anny wholl be sure to have heard all about it as she has friends at marygreen  jude could not bear to acquiesce in this proposal but his suspense pitted itself against his discretion and won in the struggle  you can ask about it if you like he said  ive not heard a sound from there  it must have been very private ifthey have married  i am afraid i havent enough cash to take me there and back or i should have gone before  i must wait till i have earned some  ohi can pay the journey for you he said impatiently  and thus his suspense as to sues welfare and the possible marriage moved him to dispatch for intelligence the last emissary he would have thought of choosing deliberately  arabella went jude requesting her to be home not later than by the seven oclock train  when she had gone he said why should i have charged her to be back by a particular time  shes nothing to menor the other neither  but having finished work he could not help going to the station to meet arabella dragged thither by feverish haste to get the news she might bring and know the worst  arabella had made dimples most successfully all the way home and when she stepped out of the railway carriage she smiled  he merely said well with the very reverse of a smile  they are married  yesof course they are he returned  she observed however the hard strain upon his lip as he spoke  anny says she has heard from belinda her relation out at marygreen that it was very sad and curious  how do you mean sad  she wanted to marry him again didnt she and he her  yesthat was it  she wanted to in one sense but not in the other  mrs edlin was much upset by it all and spoke out her mind at phillotson  but sue was that excited about it that she burnt her best embroidery that shed worn with you to blot you out entirely wellif a woman feels like it she ought to do it  i commend her for it though others dont  arabella sighed  she felt he was her only husband and that she belonged to nobody else in the sight of god amighty while he lived  perhaps another woman feels the same about herself too  arabella sighed again  i dont want any cant exclaimed jude  it isnt cant said arabella  i feel exactly the same as she  he closed that issue by remarking abruptly wellnow i know all i wanted to know  many thanks for your information  i am not going back to my lodgings just yet  and he left her straightway  in his misery and depression jude walked to wellnigh every spot in the city that he had visited with sue thence he did not know whither and then thought of going home to his usual evening meal but having all the vices of his virtues and some to spare he turned into a public house for the first time during many months  among the possible consequences of her marriage sue had not dwelt on this  arabella meanwhile had gone back  the evening passed and jude did not return  at halfpast nine arabella herself went out first proceeding to an outlying district near the river where her father lived and had opened a small and precarious porkshop lately  well she said to him for all your rowing me that night ive called in for i have something to tell you  i think i shall get married and settled again  only you must help me and you can do no less after what ive stood ee  ill do anything to get thee off my hands  very well  i am now going to look for my young man  hes on the loose im afraid and i must get him home  all i want you to do tonight is not to fasten the door in case i should want to sleep here and should be late  i thought youd soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping away  welldont do the door  thats all i say  she then sallied out again and first hastening back to judes to make sure that he had not returned began her search for him  a shrewd guess as to his probable course took her straight to the tavern which jude had formerly frequented and where she had been barmaid for a brief term  she had no sooner opened the door of the private bar than her eyes fell upon himsitting in the shade at the back of the compartment with his eyes fixed on the floor in a blank stare  he was drinking nothing stronger than ale just then he did not observe her and she entered and sat beside him  jude looked up and said without surprise youve come to have something arabella   im trying to forget her thats all  but i cant and i am going home  she saw that he was a little way on in liquor but only a little as yet  ive come entirely to look for you dear boy  you are not well now you must have something better than that  arabella held up her finger to the barmaid  you shall have a liqueurthats better fit for a man of education than beer  you shall have maraschino or curaçao dry or sweet or cherry brandy  ill treat you poor chap  i dont care which  say cherry brandy  sue has served me badly very badly  i didnt expect it of sue  i stuck to her and she ought to have stuck to me  id have sold my soul for her sake but she wouldnt risk hers a jot for me  to save her own soul she lets mine go damn   but it isnt her fault poor little girli am sure it isnt  how arabella had obtained money did not appear but she ordered a liqueur each and paid for them  when they had drunk these arabella suggested another and jude had the pleasure of being as it were personally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation by one who knew the landmarks well  arabella kept very considerably in the rear of jude but though she only sipped where he drank she took as much as she could safely take without losing her headwhich was not a little as the crimson upon her countenance showed  her tone towards him tonight was uniformly soothing and cajoling and whenever he said i dont care what happens to me a thing he did continually she replied but i do very much  the closing hour came and they were compelled to turn out whereupon arabella put her arm round his waist and guided his unsteady footsteps  when they were in the streets she said i dont know what our landlord will say to my bringing you home in this state  i expect we are fastened out so that hell have to come down and let us in  i dont knowi dont know  thats the worst of not having a home of your own  i tell you jude what we had best do  come round to my fathersi made it up with him a bit today  i can let you in and nobody will see you at all and by tomorrow morning youll be all right  anythinganywhere replied jude  what the devil does it matter to me  they went along together like any other fuddling couple her arm still round his waist and his at last round hers though with no amatory intent but merely because he was weary unstable and in need of support  thisis th martyrsburningplace he stammered as they dragged across a broad street  i rememberin old fullers holy stateand i am reminded of itby our passing by hereold fuller in his holy state says that at the burning of ridley doctor smithpreached sermon and took as his text though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothingoften think of it as i pass here  ridley was a  yes  exactly  very thoughtful of you deary even though it hasnt much to do with our present business  why yes it has  im giving my body to be burned  butah you dont understandit wants sue to understand such things  and i was her seducerpoor little girl  and shes goneand i dont care about myself  do what you like with me   and yet she did it for conscience sake poor little sue  hang heri mean i think she was right hiccuped arabella  ive my feelings too like her and i feel i belong to you in heavens eye and to nobody else till death us do part  it ishicnever too latehic to mend  they had reached her fathers house and she softly unfastened the door groping about for a light within  the circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry into the cottage at cresscombe such a long time before  nor were perhaps arabellas motives  but jude did not think of that though she did  i cant find the matches dear she said when she had fastened up the door  but never mindthis way  as quiet as you can please  it is as dark as pitch said jude  give me your hand and ill lead you  thats it  just sit down here and ill pull off your boots  i dont want to wake him  who  father  hed make a row perhaps  she pulled off his boots  now she whispered take hold of menever mind your weight  nowfirst stair second stair  butare we out in our old house by marygreen asked the stupefied jude  i havent been inside it for years till now  hey  and where are my books  thats what i want to know  we are at my house dear where theres nobody to spy out how ill you are  nowthird stair fourth stairthats it  now we shall get on    vii   arabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this small recently hired tenement of her fathers  she put her head into the little porkshop in front and told mr donn it was ready donn endeavouring to look like a master porkbutcher in a greasy blue blouse and with a strap round his waist from which a steel dangled came in promptly  you must mind the shop this morning he said casually  ive to go and get some inwards and half a pig from lumsdon and to call elsewhere  if you live here you must put your shoulder to the wheel at least till i get the business started  well for today i cant say  she looked deedily into his face ive got a prize upstairs  oh  whats that  a husbandalmost  no  yes  its jude  hes come back to me  your old original one  well im damned  well i always did like him that i will say  but how does he come to be up there said donn humourstruck and nodding to the ceiling  dont ask inconvenient questions father  what weve to do is to keep him here till he and i areas we were  how was that  married  ah  well it is the rummest thing i ever heard ofmarrying an old husband again and so much new blood in the world  hes no catch to my thinking  id have had a new one while i was about it  it isnt rum for a woman to want her old husband back for respectability though for a man to want his old wife backwell perhaps it is funny rather  and arabella was suddenly seized with a fit of loud laughter in which her father joined more moderately  be civil to him and ill do the rest she said when she had recovered seriousness  he told me this morning that his head ached fit to burst and he hardly seemed to know where he was  and no wonder considering how he mixed his drink last night  we must keep him jolly and cheerful here for a day or two and not let him go back to his lodging  whatever you advance ill pay back to you again but i must go up and see how he is now poor deary  arabella ascended the stairs softly opened the door of the first bedroom and peeped in  finding that her shorn samson was asleep she entered to the bedside and stood regarding him  the fevered flush on his face from the debauch of the previous evening lessened the fragility of his ordinary appearance and his long lashes dark brows and curly back hair and beard against the white pillow completed the physiognomy of one whom arabella as a woman of rank passions still felt it worth while to recapture highly important to recapture as a woman straitened both in means and in reputation her ardent gaze seemed to affect him his quick breathing became suspended and he opened his eyes  how are you now dear said she  it is iarabella  ahwhereoh yes i remember  you gave me shelter  i am strandedilldemoralizeddamn bad  thats what i am  then do stay here  theres nobody in the house but father and me and you can rest till you are thoroughly well  ill tell them at the stoneworks that you are knocked up  i wonder what they are thinking at the lodgings  ill go round and explain  perhaps you had better let me pay up or theyll think weve run away  yes  youll find enough money in my pocket there  quite indifferent and shutting his eyes because he could not bear the daylight in his throbbing eyeballs jude seemed to doze again arabella took his purse softly left the room and putting on her outdoor things went off to the lodgings she and he had quitted the evening before  scarcely half an hour had elapsed ere she reappeared round the corner walking beside a lad wheeling a truck on which were piled all judes household possessions and also the few of arabellas things which she had taken to the lodging for her short sojourn there jude was in such physical pain from his unfortunate breakdown of the previous night and in such mental pain from the loss of sue and from having yielded in his halfsomnolent state to arabella that when he saw his few chattels unpacked and standing before his eyes in this strange bedroom intermixed with womans apparel he scarcely considered how they had come there or what their coming signalized  now said arabella to her father downstairs we must keep plenty of good liquor going in the house these next few days  i know his nature and if he once gets into that fearfully low state that he does get into sometimes hell never do the honourable thing by me in this world and i shall be left in the lurch  he must be kept cheerful  he has a little money in the savings bank and he has given me his purse to pay for anything necessary  well that will be the licence for i must have that ready at hand to catch him the moment hes in the humour  you must pay for the liquor  a few friends and a quiet convivial party would be the thing if we could get it up  it would advertise the shop and help me too  that can be got up easy enough by anybody wholl afford victuals and drink  well yesit would advertise the shopthats true  three days later when jude had recovered somewhat from the fearful throbbing of his eyes and brain but was still considerably confused in his mind by what had been supplied to him by arabella during the intervalto keep him jolly as she expressed itthe quiet convivial gathering suggested by her to wind jude up to the striking point took place  donn had only just opened his miserable little pork and sausage shop which had as yet scarce any customers nevertheless that party advertised it well and the donns acquired a real notoriety among a certain class in christminster who knew not the colleges nor their works nor their ways  jude was asked if he could suggest any guest in addition to those named by arabella and her father and in a saturnine humour of perfect recklessness mentioned uncle joe and stagg and the decayed auctioneer and others whom he remembered as having been frequenters of the wellknown tavern during his bout therein years before  he also suggested freckles and bower o bliss arabella took him at his word so far as the men went but drew the line at the ladies  another man they knew tinker taylor though he lived in the same street was not invited but as he went homeward from a late job on the evening of the party he had occasion to call at the shop for trotters  there were none in but he was promised some the next morning  while making his inquiry taylor glanced into the back room and saw the guests sitting round cardplaying and drinking and otherwise enjoying themselves at donns expense  he went home to bed and on his way out next morning wondered how the party went off  he thought it hardly worth while to call at the shop for his provisions at that hour donn and his daughter being probably not up if they caroused late the night before  however he found in passing that the door was open and he could hear voices within though the shutters of the meatstall were not down  he went and tapped at the sittingroom door and opened it  wellto be sure he said astonished  hosts and guests were sitting cardplaying smoking and talking precisely as he had left them eleven hours earlier the gas was burning and the curtains drawn though it had been broad daylight for two hours out of doors  yes cried arabella laughing  here we are just the same  we ought to be ashamed of ourselves oughtnt we  but it is a sort of housewarming you see and our friends are in no hurry  come in mr taylor and sit down  the tinker or rather reduced ironmonger was nothing loath and entered and took a seat  i shall lose a quarter but never mind he said  well really i could hardly believe my eyes when i looked in  it seemed as if i was flung back again into last night all of a sudden  so you are  pour out for mr taylor  he now perceived that she was sitting beside jude her arm being round his waist  jude like the rest of the company bore on his face the signs of how deeply he had been indulging  well weve been waiting for certain legal hours to arrive to tell the truth she continued bashfully and making her spirituous crimson look as much like a maiden blush as possible  jude and i have decided to make up matters between us by tying the knot again as we find we cant do without one another after all  so as a bright notion we agreed to sit on till it was late enough and go and do it offhand  jude seemed to pay no great heed to what she was announcing or indeed to anything whatever  the entrance of taylor infused fresh spirit into the company and they remained sitting till arabella whispered to her father now we may as well go  but the parson dont know  yes i told him last night that we might come between eight and nine as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and quiet as possible on account of it being our second marriage which might make people curious to look on if they knew  he highly approved  oh very well im ready said her father getting up and shaking himself  now old darling she said to jude  come along as you promised  when did i promise anything asked he whom she had made so tipsy by her special knowledge of that line of business as almost to have made him sober againor to seem so to those who did not know him  why said arabella affecting dismay  youve promised to marry me several times as weve sat here tonight these gentlemen have heard you  i dont remember it said jude doggedly  theres only one womanbut i wont mention her in this capharnaum  arabella looked towards her father  now mr fawley be honourable said donn  you and my daughter have been living here together these three or four days quite on the understanding that you were going to marry her  of course i shouldnt have had such goings on in my house if i hadnt understood that  as a point of honour you must do it now  dont say anything against my honour enjoined jude hotly standing up  id marry the w of babylon rather than do anything dishonourable  no reflection on you my dear  it is a mere rhetorical figurewhat they call in the books hyperbole  keep your figures for your debts to friends who shelter you said donn  if i am bound in honour to marry heras i suppose i amthough how i came to be here with her i know no more than a dead manmarry her i will so help me god  i have never behaved dishonourably to a woman or to any living thing  i am not a man who wants to save himself at the expense of the weaker among us  therenever mind him deary said she putting her cheek against judes  come up and wash your face and just put yourself tidy and off well go  make it up with father  they shook hands  jude went upstairs with her and soon came down looking tidy and calm  arabella too had hastily arranged herself and accompanied by donn away they went  dont go she said to the guests at parting  ive told the little maid to get the breakfast while we are gone and when we come back well all have some  a good strong cup of tea will set everybody right for going home    when arabella jude and donn had disappeared on their matrimonial errand the assembled guests yawned themselves wider awake and discussed the situation with great interest  tinker taylor being the most sober reasoned the most lucidly  i dont wish to speak against friends he said  but it do seem a rare curiosity for a couple to marry over again  if they couldnt get on the first time when their minds were limp they wont the second by my reckoning  do you think hell do it  hes been put upon his honour by the woman so he med  hed hardly do it straight off like this  hes got no licence nor anything  shes got that bless you  didnt you hear her say so to her father  well said tinker taylor relighting his pipe at the gasjet take her all together limb by limb shes not such a badlooking pieceparticular by candlelight  to be sure halfpence that have been in circulation cant be expected to look like new ones from the mint  but for a woman thats been knocking about the four hemispheres for some time shes passable enough  a little bit thick in the flitch perhaps but i like a woman that a puff o wind wont blow down  their eyes followed the movements of the little girl as she spread the breakfastcloth on the table they had been using without wiping up the slops of the liquor  the curtains were undrawn and the expression of the house made to look like morning  some of the guests however fell asleep in their chairs  one or two went to the door and gazed along the street more than once  tinker taylor was the chief of these and after a time he came in with a leer on his face  by gad they are coming  i think the deeds done  no said uncle joe following him in  take my word he turned rusty at the last minute  they are walking in a very unusual way and thats the meaning of it  they waited in silence till the weddingparty could be heard entering the house  first into the room came arabella boisterously and her face was enough to show that her strategy had succeeded  mrs fawley i presume said tinker taylor with mock courtesy  certainly  mrs fawley again replied arabella blandly pulling off her glove and holding out her left hand  theres the padlock see  well he was a very nice gentlemanly man indeed  i mean the clergyman  he said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done mrs fawley i congratulate you heartily he says  for having heard your history and that of your husband i think you have both done the right and proper thing  and for your past errors as a wife and his as a husband i think you ought now to be forgiven by the world as you have forgiven each other says he  yes he was a very nice gentlemanly man  the church dont recognize divorce in her dogma strictly speaking he says and bear in mind the words of the service in your goings out and your comings in what god hath joined together let no man put asunder  yes he was a very nice gentlemanly man  but jude my dear you were enough to make a cat laugh  you walked that straight and held yourself that steady that one would have thought you were going prentice to a judge though i knew you were seeing double all the time from the way you fumbled with my finger  i said id do anything tosave a womans honour muttered jude and ive done it  well now old deary come along and have some breakfast  i wantsomemore whisky said jude stolidly  nonsense dear  not now  theres no more left  the tea will take the muddle out of our heads and we shall be as fresh as larks  all right  ivemarried you  she said i ought to marry you again and i have straightway  it is true religion  hahaha    viii   michaelmas came and passed and jude and his wife who had lived but a short time in her fathers house after their remarriage were in lodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the city  he had done a few days work during the two or three months since the event but his health had been indifferent and it was now precarious  he was sitting in an armchair before the fire and coughed a good deal  ive got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over again arabella was saying to him  i shall have to keep ee entirelythats what twill come to  i shall have to make blackpot and sausages and hawk em about the street all to support an invalid husband id no business to be saddled with at all  why didnt you keep your health deceiving one like this  you were well enough when the wedding was  ah yes said he laughing acridly  i have been thinking of my foolish feeling about the pig you and i killed during our first marriage  i feel now that the greatest mercy that could be vouchsafed to me would be that something should serve me as i served that animal  this was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day now  the landlord of the lodging who had heard that they were a queer couple had doubted if they were married at all especially as he had seen arabella kiss jude one evening when she had taken a little cordial and he was about to give them notice to quit till by chance overhearing her one night haranguing jude in rattling terms and ultimately flinging a shoe at his head he recognized the note of genuine wedlock and concluding that they must be respectable said no more  jude did not get any better and one day he requested arabella with considerable hesitation to execute a commission for him  she asked him indifferently what it was  to write to sue  what in the namedo you want me to write to her for  to ask how she is and if shell come to see me because im ill and should like to see heronce again  it is like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing  it is just in order not to insult you that i ask you to do it  you know i love sue  i dont wish to mince the matterthere stands the fact i love her  i could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to her without your knowledge  but i wish to be quite aboveboard with you and with her husband  a message through you asking her to come is at least free from any odour of intrigue  if she retains any of her old nature at all shell come  youve no respect for marriage whatever or its rights and duties  what does it matter what my opinions area wretch like me  can it matter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an hourhere with one foot in the grave   come please write arabella he pleaded  repay my candour by a little generosity  i should think not  not just onceoh do  he felt that his physical weakness had taken away all his dignity  what do you want her to know how you are for  she dont want to see ee  shes the rat that forsook the sinking ship  dont dont  and i stuck to unthe more fool i  have that strumpet in the house indeed  almost as soon as the words were spoken jude sprang from the chair and before arabella knew where she was he had her on her back upon a little couch which stood there he kneeling above her  say another word of that sort he whispered and ill kill youhere and now  ive everything to gain by itmy own death not being the least part  so dont think theres no meaning in what i say  what do you want me to do gasped arabella  promise never to speak of her  very well  i do  i take your word he said scornfully as he loosened her  but what it is worth i cant say  you couldnt kill the pig but you could kill me  ahthere you have me  noi couldnt kill youeven in a passion taunt away  he then began coughing very much and she estimated his life with an appraisers eye as he sank back ghastly pale  ill send for her arabella murmured if youll agree to my being in the room with you all the time shes here  the softer side of his nature the desire to see sue made him unable to resist the offer even now provoked as he had been and he replied breathlessly yes i agree  only send for her  in the evening he inquired if she had written  yes she said i wrote a note telling her you were ill and asking her to come tomorrow or the day after  i havent posted it yet  the next day jude wondered if she really did post it but would not ask her and foolish hope that lives on a drop and a crumb made him restless with expectation  he knew the times of the possible trains and listened on each occasion for sounds of her  she did not come but jude would not address arabella again thereon he hoped and expected all the next day but no sue appeared neither was there any note of reply  then jude decided in the privacy of his mind that arabella had never posted hers although she had written it  there was something in her manner which told it  his physical weakness was such that he shed tears at the disappointment when she was not there to see  his suspicions were in fact well founded arabella like some other nurses thought that your duty towards your invalid was to pacify him by any means short of really acting upon his fancies  he never said another word to her about his wish or his conjecture a silent undiscerned resolve grew up in him which gave him if not strength stability and calm  one midday when after an absence of two hours she came into the room she beheld the chair empty  down she flopped on the bed and sitting meditated  now where the devil is my man gone to she said  a driving rain from the northeast had been falling with more or less intermission all the morning and looking from the window at the dripping spouts it seemed impossible to believe that any sick man would have ventured out to almost certain death  yet a conviction possessed arabella that he had gone out and it became a certainty when she had searched the house  if hes such a fool let him be she said  i can do no more  jude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to alfredston oddly swathed pale as a monumental figure in alabaster and much stared at by other passengers  an hour later his thin form in the long greatcoat and blanket he had come with but without an umbrella could have been seen walking along the fivemile road to marygreen  on his face showed the determined purpose that alone sustained him but to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation by the uphill walk he was quite blown but he pressed on and at halfpast three oclock stood by the familiar well at marygreen the rain was keeping everybody indoors jude crossed the green to the church without observation and found the building open  here he stood looking forth at the school whence he could hear the usual singsong tones of the little voices that had not learnt creations groan  he waited till a small boy came from the schoolone evidently allowed out before hours for some reason or other  jude held up his hand and the child came  please call at the schoolhouse and ask mrs phillotson if she will be kind enough to come to the church for a few minutes  the child departed and jude heard him knock at the door of the dwelling  he himself went further into the church  everything was new except a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked old fabric now fixed against the new walls  he stood by these they seemed akin to the perished people of that place who were his ancestors and sues  a light footstep which might have been accounted no more than an added drip to the rainfall sounded in the porch and he looked round  ohi didnt think it was you  i didntoh jude  a hysterical catch in her breath ended in a succession of them  he advanced but she quickly recovered and went back  dont godont go he implored  this is my last time  i thought it would be less intrusive than to enter your house  and i shall never come again  dont then be unmerciful  sue sue  we are acting by the letter and the letter killeth  ill stayi wont be unkind she said her mouth quivering and her tears flowing as she allowed him to come closer  but why did you come and do this wrong thing after doing such a right thing as you have done  what right thing  marrying arabella again  it was in the alfredston paper  she has never been other than yours judein a proper sense  and therefore you did so welloh so wellin recognizing itand taking her to you again  god aboveand is that all ive come to hear  if there is anything more degrading immoral unnatural than another in my life it is this meretricious contract with arabella which has been called doing the right thing  and you tooyou call yourself phillotsons wife his wife  you are mine  dont make me rush away from youi cant bear much  but on this point i am decided  i cannot understand how you did ithow you think iti cannot  never mind that  he is a kind husband to meand iive wrestled and struggled and fasted and prayed  i have nearly brought my body into complete subjection  and you mustntwill youwake  oh you darling little fool where is your reason  you seem to have suffered the loss of your faculties  i would argue with you if i didnt know that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all appeals to her brains  or is it that you are humbugging yourself as so many women do about these things and dont actually believe what you pretend to and only are indulging in the luxury of the emotion raised by an affected belief  luxury  how can you be so cruel  you dear sad soft most melancholy wreck of a promising human intellect that it has ever been my lot to behold  where is your scorn of convention gone  i would have died game  you crush almost insult me jude  go away from me  she turned off quickly  i will  i would never come to see you again even if i had the strength to come which i shall not have any more  sue sue you are not worth a mans love  her bosom began to go up and down  i cant endure you to say that she burst out and her eye resting on him a moment she turned back impulsively  dont dont scorn me  kiss me oh kiss me lots of times and say i am not a coward and a contemptible humbugi cant bear it  she rushed up to him and with her mouth on his continued i must tell youoh i mustmy darling love  it has beenonly a church marriagean apparent marriage i mean  he suggested it at the very first  how  i mean it is a nominal marriage only  it hasnt been more than that at all since i came back to him  sue he said  pressing her to him in his arms he bruised her lips with kisses if misery can know happiness i have a moments happiness now  now in the name of all you hold holy tell me the truth and no lie  you do love me still  i do  you know it too well   but i mustnt do this  i mustnt kiss you back as i would  but do  and yet you are so dearand you look so ill  and so do you  theres one more in memory of our dead little childrenyours and mine  the words struck her like a blow and she bent her head  i mustnti cant go on with this she gasped presently  but there there darling i give you back your kisses i do i do   and now ill hate myself for ever for my sin  nolet me make my last appeal  listen to this  weve both remarried out of our senses  i was made drunk to do it  you were the same  i was gindrunk you were creeddrunk  either form of intoxication takes away the nobler vision  let us then shake off our mistakes and run away together  no again no   why do you tempt me so far jude  it is too merciless   but ive got over myself now  dont follow medont look at me  leave me for pitys sake  she ran up the church to the east end and jude did as she requested he did not turn his head but took up his blanket which she had not seen and went straight out  as he passed the end of the church she heard his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows and in a last instinct of human affection even now unsubdued by her fetters she sprang up as if to go and succour him  but she knelt down again and stopped her ears with her hands till all possible sound of him had passed away  he was by this time at the corner of the green from which the path ran across the fields in which he had scared rooks as a boy  he turned and looked back once at the building which still contained sue and then went on knowing that his eyes would light on that scene no more  there are cold spots up and down wessex in autumn and winter weather but the coldest of all when a north or east wind is blowing is the crest of the down by the brown house where the road to alfredston crosses the old ridgeway  here the first winter sleets and snows fall and lie and here the spring frost lingers last unthawed  here in the teeth of the northeast wind and rain jude now pursued his way wet through the necessary slowness of his walk from lack of his former strength being insufficent to maintain his heat  he came to the milestone and raining as it was spread his blanket and lay down there to rest  before moving on he went and felt at the back of the stone for his own carving  it was still there but nearly obliterated by moss  he passed the spot where the gibbet of his ancestor and sues had stood and descended the hill  it was dark when he reached alfredston where he had a cup of tea the deadly chill that began to creep into his bones being too much for him to endure fasting  to get home he had to travel by a steam tramcar and two branches of railway with much waiting at a junction  he did not reach christminster till ten oclock    ix   on the platform stood arabella  she looked him up and down  youve been to see her she asked  i have said jude literally tottering with cold and lassitude  well now youd best march along home  the water ran out of him as he went and he was compelled to lean against the wall to support himself while coughing  youve done for yourself by this young man said she  i dont know whether you know it  of course i do  i meant to do for myself  whatto commit suicide  certainly  well im blest  kill yourself for a woman  listen to me arabella  you think you are the stronger and so you are in a physical sense now  you could push me over like a ninepin  you did not send that letter the other day and i could not resent your conduct  but i am not so weak in another way as you think  i made up my mind that a man confined to his room by inflammation of the lungs a fellow who had only two wishes left in the world to see a particular woman and then to die could neatly accomplish those two wishes at one stroke by taking this journey in the rain  that ive done  i have seen her for the last time and ive finished myselfput an end to a feverish life which ought never to have been begun  lordyou do talk lofty  wont you have something warm to drink  no thank you  lets get home  they went along by the silent colleges and jude kept stopping  what are you looking at  stupid fancies  i see in a way those spirits of the dead again on this my last walk that i saw when i first walked here  what a curious chap you are  i seem to see them and almost hear them rustling  but i dont revere all of them as i did then  i dont believe in half of them the theologians the apologists and their kin the metaphysicians the highhanded statesmen and others no longer interest me  all that has been spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality  the expression of judes corpselike face in the watery lamplight was indeed as if he saw people where there was nobody  at moments he stood still by an archway like one watching a figure walk out then he would look at a window like one discerning a familiar face behind it  he seemed to hear voices whose words he repeated as if to gather their meaning  they seem laughing at me  who  ohi was talking to myself  the phantoms all about here in the college archways and windows  they used to look friendly in the old days particularly addison and gibbon and johnson and dr browne and bishop ken  come along do  phantoms  theres neither living nor dead hereabouts except a damn policeman  i never saw the streets emptier  fancy  the poet of liberty used to walk here and the great dissector of melancholy there  i dont want to hear about em  they bore me  walter raleigh is beckoning to me from that lanewycliffeharvey hookerarnoldand a whole crowd of tractarian shades  i dont want to know their names i tell you  what do i care about folk dead and gone  upon my soul you are more sober when youve been drinking than when you have not  i must rest a moment he said and as he paused holding to the railings he measured with his eye the height of a college front this is old rubric  and that sarcophagus and up that lane crozier and tudor and all down there is cardinal with its long front and its windows with lifted eyebrows representing the polite surprise of the university at the efforts of such as i  come along and ill treat you  very well  it will help me home for i feel the chilly fog from the meadows of cardinal as if deathclaws were grabbing me through and through  as antigone said i am neither a dweller among men nor ghosts  but arabella when i am dead youll see my spirit flitting up and down here among these  pooh  you maynt die after all  you are tough enough yet old man    it was night at marygreen and the rain of the afternoon showed no sign of abatement  about the time at which jude and arabella were walking the streets of christminster homeward the widow edlin crossed the green and opened the back door of the schoolmasters dwelling which she often did now before bedtime to assist sue in putting things away  sue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen for she was not a good housewife though she tried to be and grew impatient of domestic details  lord love ee what do ye do that yourself for when ive come o purpose  you knew i should come  ohi dont knowi forgot  no i didnt forget  i did it to discipline myself  i have scrubbed the stairs since eight oclock i must practise myself in my household duties  ive shamefully neglected them  why should ye  hell get a better school perhaps be a parson in time and youll keep two servants  tis a pity to spoil them pretty hands  dont talk of my pretty hands mrs edlin  this pretty body of mine has been the ruin of me already  pshooyouve got no body to speak of  you put me more in mind of a sperrit  but there seems something wrong tonight my dear husband cross  no he never is  hes gone to bed early  then what is it  i cannot tell you  i have done wrong today and i want to eradicate it  welli will tell you thisjude has been here this afternoon and i find i still love himoh grossly  i cannot tell you more  ah said the widow  i told ee how twould be  but it shant be  i have not told my husband of his visit it is not necessary to trouble him about it as i never mean to see jude any more  but i am going to make my conscience right on my duty to richardby doing a penancethe ultimate thing i must  i wouldntsince he agrees to it being otherwise and it has gone on three months very well as it is  yeshe agrees to my living as i choose but i feel it is an indulgence i ought not to exact from him  it ought not to have been accepted by me  to reverse it will be terriblebut i must be more just to him  o why was i so unheroic  what is it you dont like in him asked mrs edlin curiously  i cannot tell you  it is something  i cannot say  the mournful thing is that nobody would admit it as a reason for feeling as i do so that no excuse is left me  did you ever tell jude what it was  never  ive heard strange tales o husbands in my time observed the widow in a lowered voice  they say that when the saints were upon the earth devils used to take husbands forms o nights and get poor women into all sorts of trouble  but i dont know why that should come into my head for it is only a tale  what a wind and rain it is tonight  welldont be in a hurry to alter things my dear think it over  no no  ive screwed my weak soul up to treating him more courteouslyand it must be nowat oncebefore i break down  i dont think you ought to force your nature  no woman ought to be expected to  it is my duty  i will drink my cup to the dregs  half an hour later when mrs edlin put on her bonnet and shawl to leave sue seemed to be seized with vague terror  nonodont go mrs edlin she implored her eyes enlarged and with a quick nervous look over her shoulder  but it is bedtime child  yes buttheres the little spare roommy room that was  it is quite ready  please stay mrs edlini shall want you in the morning  oh welli dont mind if you wish  nothing will happen to my four old walls whether i be there or no  she then fastened up the doors and they ascended the stairs together  wait here mrs edlin said sue  ill go into my old room a moment by myself  leaving the widow on the landing sue turned to the chamber which had been hers exclusively since her arrival at marygreen and pushing to the door knelt down by the bed for a minute or two  she then arose and taking her nightgown from the pillow undressed and came out to mrs edlin  a man could be heard snoring in the room opposite  she wished mrs edlin goodnight and the widow entered the room that sue had just vacated  sue unlatched the other chamber door and as if seized with faintness sank down outside it  getting up again she half opened the door and said richard  as the word came out of her mouth she visibly shuddered  the snoring had quite ceased for some time but he did not reply sue seemed relieved and hurried back to mrs edlins chamber  are you in bed mrs edlin she asked  no dear said the widow opening the door  i be old and slow and it takes me a long while to unray  i hant unlaced my jumps yet  idont hear him  and perhapsperhaps  what child  perhaps hes dead she gasped  and theni should be free and i could go to jude   ahnoi forgot herand god  lets go and hearken  nohes snoring again  but the rain and the wind is so loud that you can hardly hear anything but between whiles  sue had dragged herself back  mrs edlin goodnight again  i am sorry i called you out  the widow retreated a second time  the strained resigned look returned to sues face when she was alone  i must do iti must  i must drink to the dregs she whispered richard she said again  heywhat  is that you susanna  yes  what do you want  anything the matter  wait a moment  he pulled on some articles of clothing and came to the door  yes  when we were at shaston i jumped out of the window rather than that you should come near me  i have never reversed that treatment till nowwhen i have come to beg your pardon for it and ask you to let me in  perhaps you only think you ought to do this  i dont wish you to come against your impulses as i have said  but i beg to be admitted  she waited a moment and repeated i beg to be admitted  i have been in erroreven today i have exceeded my rights  i did not mean to tell you but perhaps i ought i sinned against you this afternoon  how  i met jude  i didnt know he was coming  and  well  i kissed him and let him kiss me  ohthe old story  richard i didnt know we were going to kiss each other till we did  how many times  a good many  i dont know  i am horrified to look back on it and the least i can do after it is to come to you like this  comethis is pretty bad after what ive done  anything else to confess  no  she had been intending to say i called him my darling love but as a contrite woman always keeps back a little that portion of the scene remained untold  she went on i am never going to see him any more  he spoke of some things of the past and it overcame me he spoke ofthe children  but as i have said i am gladalmost glad i meanthat they are dead richard  it blots out all that life of mine  wellabout not seeing him again any more  comeyou really mean this  there was something in phillotsons tone now which seemed to show that his three months of remarriage with sue had somehow not been so satisfactory as his magnanimity or amative patience had anticipated  yes yes  perhaps youll swear it on the new testament  i will  he went back to the room and brought out a little brown testament now then so help you god  she swore  very good  now i supplicate you richard to whom i belong and whom i wish to honour and obey as i vowed to let me in  think it over well  you know what it means  having you back in the house was one thingthis another  so think again  i have thoughti wish this  thats a complaisant spiritand perhaps you are right  with a lover hanging about a halfmarriage should be completed  but i repeat my reminder this third and last time  it is my wish   o god  what did you say o god for  i dont know  yes you do  but   he gloomily considered her thin and fragile form a moment longer as she crouched before him in her nightclothes well i thought it might end like this he said presently  i owe you nothing after these signs but ill take you in at your word and forgive you  he put his arm round her to lift her up  sue started back  whats the matter he asked speaking for the first time sternly you shrink from me againjust as formerly  no richardiiwas not thinking  you wish to come in here  yes  you still bear in mind what it means  yes  it is my duty  placing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he led her through the doorway and lifting her bodily kissed her  a quick look of aversion passed over her face but clenching her teeth she uttered no cry  mrs edlin had by this time undressed and was about to get into bed when she said to herself ahperhaps id better go and see if the little thing is all right  how it do blow and rain  the widow went out on the landing and saw that sue had disappeared  ah poor soul  weddings be funerals a blieve nowadays  fiftyfive years ago come fall since my man and i married  times have changed since then    x   despite himself jude recovered somewhat and worked at his trade for several weeks  after christmas however he broke down again  with the money he had earned he shifted his lodgings to a yet more central part of the town  but arabella saw that he was not likely to do much work for a long while and was cross enough at the turn affairs had taken since her remarriage to him  im hanged if you havent been clever in this last stroke she would say to get a nurse for nothing by marrying me  jude was absolutely indifferent to what she said and indeed often regarded her abuse in a humorous light  sometimes his mood was more earnest and as he lay he often rambled on upon the defeat of his early aims  every man has some little power in some one direction he would say  i was never really stout enough for the stone trade particularly the fixing  moving the blocks always used to strain me and standing the trying draughts in buildings before the windows are in always gave me colds and i think that began the mischief inside  but i felt i could do one thing if i had the opportunity i could accumulate ideas and impart them to others  i wonder if the founders had such as i in their mindsa fellow good for nothing else but that particular thing   i hear that soon there is going to be a better chance for such helpless students as i was  there are schemes afoot for making the university less exclusive and extending its influence  i dont know much about it  and it is too late too late for me  ahand for how many worthier ones before me  how you keep amumbling said arabella  i should have thought youd have got over all that craze about books by this time  and so you would if youd had any sense to begin with  you are as bad now as when we were first married  on one occasion while soliloquizing thus he called her sue unconsciously  i wish youd mind who you are talking to said arabella indignantly  calling a respectable married woman by the name of that  she remembered herself and he did not catch the word  but in the course of time when she saw how things were going and how very little she had to fear from sues rivalry she had a fit of generosity  i suppose you want to see yoursue she said  well i dont mind her coming  you can have her here if you like  i dont wish to see her again  ohthats a change  and dont tell her anything about methat im ill or anything she has chosen her course  let her go  one day he received a surprise  mrs edlin came to see him quite on her own account  judes wife whose feelings as to where his affections were centred had reached absolute indifference by this time went out leaving the old woman alone with jude  he impulsively asked how sue was and then said bluntly remembering what sue had told him i suppose they are still only husband and wife in name  mrs edlin hesitated  well noits different now  shes begun it quite latelyall of her own free will  when did she begin he asked quickly  the night after you came  but as a punishment to her poor self he didnt wish it but she insisted  sue my sueyou darling foolthis is almost more than i can endure   mrs edlindont be frightened at my ramblingive got to talk to myself lying here so many hours aloneshe was once a woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp who saw all my superstitions as cobwebs that she could brush away with a word  then bitter affliction came to us and her intellect broke and she veered round to darkness  strange difference of sex that time and circumstance which enlarge the views of most men narrow the views of women almost invariably  and now the ultimate horror has comeher giving herself like this to what she loathes in her enslavement to forms  she so sensitive so shrinking that the very wind seemed to blow on her with a touch of deference  as for sue and me when we were at our own best long agowhen our minds were clear and our love of truth fearlessthe time was not ripe for us  our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us and so the resistance they met with brought reaction in her and recklessness and ruin on me   therethis mrs edlin is how i go on to myself continually as i lie here  i must be boring you awfully  not at all my dear boy  i could hearken to ee all day  as jude reflected more and more on her news and grew more restless he began in his mental agony to use terribly profane language about social conventions which started a fit of coughing  presently there came a knock at the door downstairs  as nobody answered it mrs edlin herself went down  the visitor said blandly the doctor  the lanky form was that of physician vilbert who had been called in by arabella  how is my patient at present asked the physician  oh badvery bad  poor chap he got excited and do blaspeam terribly since i let out some gossip by accidentthe more to my blame  but thereyou must excuse a man in suffering for what he says and i hope god will forgive him  ah  ill go up and see him  mrs fawley at home  shes not in at present but shell be here soon  vilbert went but though jude had hitherto taken the medicines of that skilful practitioner with the greatest indifference whenever poured down his throat by arabella he was now so brought to bay by events that he vented his opinion of vilbert in the physicians face and so forcibly and with such striking epithets that vilbert soon scurried downstairs again  at the door he met arabella mrs edlin having left  arabella inquired how he thought her husband was now and seeing that the doctor looked ruffled asked him to take something  he assented  ill bring it to you here in the passage she said  theres nobody but me about the house today  she brought him a bottle and a glass and he drank  arabella began shaking with suppressed laughter  what is this my dear he asked smacking his lips  oha drop of wineand something in it  laughing again she said i poured your own lovephiltre into it that you sold me at the agricultural show dont you remember  i do i do  clever woman  but you must be prepared for the consequences  putting his arm round her shoulders he kissed her there and then  dont dont she whispered laughing goodhumouredly my man will hear  she let him out of the house and as she went back she said to herself well  weak women must provide for a rainy day  and if my poor fellow upstairs do go offas i suppose he will soonits well to keep chances open  and i cant pick and choose now as i could when i was younger  and one must take the old if one cant get the young    xi   the last pages to which the chronicler of these lives would ask the readers attention are concerned with the scene in and out of judes bedroom when leafy summer came round again  his face was now so thin that his old friends would hardly have known him  it was afternoon and arabella was at the lookingglass curling her hair which operation she performed by heating an umbrellastay in the flame of a candle she had lighted and using it upon the flowing lock  when she had finished this practised a dimple and put on her things she cast her eyes round upon jude  he seemed to be sleeping though his position was an elevated one his malady preventing him lying down  arabella hatted gloved and ready sat down and waited as if expecting some one to come and take her place as nurse  certain sounds from without revealed that the town was in festivity though little of the festival whatever it might have been could be seen here  bells began to ring and the notes came into the room through the open window and travelled round judes head in a hum they made her restless and at last she said to herself why ever doesnt father come  she looked again at jude critically gauged his ebbing life as she had done so many times during the late months and glancing at his watch which was hung up by way of timepiece rose impatiently still he slept and coming to a resolution she slipped from the room closed the door noiselessly and descended the stairs  the house was empty  the attraction which moved arabella to go abroad had evidently drawn away the other inmates long before  it was a warm cloudless enticing day  she shut the front door and hastened round into chief street and when near the theatre could hear the notes of the organ a rehearsal for a coming concert being in progress  she entered under the archway of oldgate college where men were putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the hall that evening  people who had come up from the country for the day were picnicking on the grass and arabella walked along the gravel paths and under the aged limes  but finding this place rather dull she returned to the streets and watched the carriages drawing up for the concert numerous dons and their wives and undergraduates with gay female companions crowding up likewise  when the doors were closed and the concert began she moved on  the powerful notes of that concert rolled forth through the swinging yellow blinds of the open windows over the housetops and into the still air of the lanes  they reached so far as to the room in which jude lay and it was about this time that his cough began again and awakened him  as soon as he could speak he murmured his eyes still closed a little water please  nothing but the deserted room received his appeal and he coughed to exhaustion againsaying still more feebly watersome watersuearabella  the room remained still as before  presently he gasped again throatwatersuedarlingdrop of waterpleaseoh please  no water came and the organ notes faint as a bees hum rolled in as before  while he remained his face changing shouts and hurrahs came from somewhere in the direction of the river  ahyes  the remembrance games he murmured  and i here  and sue defiled  the hurrahs were repeated drowning the faint organ notes  judes face changed more he whispered slowly his parched lips scarcely moving  let the day perish wherein i was born and the night in which it was said there is a manchild conceived  hurrah  let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it  lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein  hurrah  why died i not from the womb  why did i not give up the ghost when i came out of the belly   for now should i have lain still and been quiet  i should have slept then had i been at rest  hurrah  there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor  the small and the great are there and the servant is free from his master  wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul    meanwhile arabella in her journey to discover what was going on took a short cut down a narrow street and through an obscure nook into the quad of cardinal  it was full of bustle and brilliant in the sunlight with flowers and other preparations for a ball here also  a carpenter nodded to her one who had formerly been a fellowworkman of judes  a corridor was in course of erection from the entrance to the hall staircase of gay red and buff bunting waggonloads of boxes containing bright plants in full bloom were being placed about and the great staircase was covered with red cloth  she nodded to one workman and another and ascended to the hall on the strength of their acquaintance where they were putting down a new floor and decorating for the dance  the cathedral bell close at hand was sounding for five oclock service  i should not mind having a spin there with a fellows arm round my waist she said to one of the men  but lord i must be getting home againtheres a lot to do  no dancing for me  when she reached home she was met at the door by stagg and one or two other of judes fellow stoneworkers  we are just going down to the river said the former to see the boatbumping  but weve called round on our way to ask how your husband is  hes sleeping nicely thank you said arabella  thats right  well now cant you give yourself half an hours relaxation mrs fawley and come along with us  twould do you good  i should like to go said she  ive never seen the boatracing and i hear it is good fun  come along  how i wish i could  she looked longingly down the street  wait a minute then  ill just run up and see how he is now  father is with him i believe so i can most likely come  they waited and she entered  downstairs the inmates were absent as before having in fact gone in a body to the river where the procession of boats was to pass  when she reached the bedroom she found that her father had not even now come  why couldnt he have been here she said impatiently  he wants to see the boats himselfthats what it is  however on looking round to the bed she brightened for she saw that jude was apparently sleeping though he was not in the usual halfelevated posture necessitated by his cough  he had slipped down and lay flat  a second glance caused her to start and she went to the bed  his face was quite white and gradually becoming rigid  she touched his fingers they were cold though his body was still warm  she listened at his chest  all was still within  the bumping of near thirty years had ceased  after her first appalled sense of what had happened the faint notes of a military or other brass band from the river reached her ears and in a provoked tone she exclaimed to think he should die just now  why did he die just now  then meditating another moment or two she went to the door softly closed it as before and again descended the stairs  here she is said one of the workmen  we wondered if you were coming after all  come along we must be quick to get a good place  well how is he  sleeping well still  of course we dont want to drag ee away if  oh yessleeping quite sound  he wont wake yet she said hurriedly  they went with the crowd down cardinal street where they presently reached the bridge and the gay barges burst upon their view  thence they passed by a narrow slit down to the riverside pathnow dusty hot and thronged  almost as soon as they had arrived the grand procession of boats began the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the face of the stream as they were lowered from the perpendicular  oh i sayhow jolly  im glad ive come said arabella  andit cant hurt my husbandmy being away  on the opposite side of the river on the crowded barges were gorgeous nosegays of feminine beauty fashionably arrayed in green pink blue and white  the blue flag of the boat club denoted the centre of interest beneath which a band in red uniform gave out the notes she had already heard in the deathchamber  collegians of all sorts in canoes with ladies watching keenly for our boat darted up and down  while she regarded the lively scene somebody touched arabella in the ribs and looking round she saw vilbert  that philtre is operating you know he said with a leer  shame on ee to wreck a heart so  i shant talk of love today  why not  it is a general holiday  she did not reply  vilberts arm stole round her waist which act could be performed unobserved in the crowd  an arch expression overspread arabellas face at the feel of the arm but she kept her eyes on the river as if she did not know of the embrace  the crowd surged pushing arabella and her friends sometimes nearly into the river and she would have laughed heartily at the horseplay that succeeded if the imprint on her minds eye of a pale statuesque countenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her a little  the fun on the water reached the acme of excitement there were immersions there were shouts the race was lost and won the pink and blue and yellow ladies retired from the barges and the people who had watched began to move  wellits been awfully good cried arabella  but i think i must get back to my poor man  father is there so far as i know but i had better get back  whats your hurry  well i must go  dear dear this is awkward  at the narrow gangway where the people ascended from the riverside path to the bridge the crowd was literally jammed into one hot massarabella and vilbert with the rest and here they remained motionless arabella exclaiming dear dear more and more impatiently for it had just occurred to her mind that if jude were discovered to have died alone an inquest might be deemed necessary  what a fidget you are my love said the physician who being pressed close against her by the throng had no need of personal effort for contact  just as well have patience theres no getting away yet  it was nearly ten minutes before the wedged multitude moved sufficiently to let them pass through  as soon as she got up into the street arabella hastened on forbidding the physician to accompany her further that day  she did not go straight to her house but to the abode of a woman who performed the last necessary offices for the poorer dead where she knocked  my husband has just gone poor soul she said  can you come and lay him out  arabella waited a few minutes and the two women went along elbowing their way through the stream of fashionable people pouring out of cardinal meadow and being nearly knocked down by the carriages  i must call at the sextons about the bell too said arabella it is just round here isnt it  ill meet you at my door  by ten oclock that night jude was lying on the bedstead at his lodging covered with a sheet and straight as an arrow  through the partly opened window the joyous throb of a waltz entered from the ballroom at cardinal    two days later when the sky was equally cloudless and the air equally still two persons stood beside judes open coffin in the same little bedroom  on one side was arabella on the other the widow edlin  they were both looking at judes face the worn old eyelids of mrs edlin being red  how beautiful he is said she  yes  hes a andsome corpse said arabella  the window was still open to ventilate the room and it being about noontide the clear air was motionless and quiet without  from a distance came voices and an apparent noise of persons stamping  whats that murmured the old woman  oh thats the doctors in the theatre conferring honorary degrees on the duke of hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that sort  its remembrance week you know  the cheers come from the young men  aye young and stronglunged  not like our poor boy here  an occasional word as from some one making a speech floated from the open windows of the theatre across to this quiet corner at which there seemed to be a smile of some sort upon the marble features of jude while the old superseded delphin editions of virgil and horace and the dogeared greek testament on the neighbouring shelf and the few other volumes of the sort that he had not parted with roughened with stonedust where he had been in the habit of catching them up for a few minutes between his labours seemed to pale to a sickly cast at the sounds  the bells struck out joyously and their reverberations travelled round the bedroom  arabellas eyes removed from jude to mrs edlin  dye think she will come she asked  i could not say  she swore not to see him again  how is she looking  tired and miserable poor heart  years and years older than when you saw her last  quite a staid worn woman now  tis the manshe cant stomach un even now  if jude had been alive to see her he would hardly have cared for her any more perhaps  thats what we dont know  didnt he ever ask you to send for her since he came to see her in that strange way  no  quite the contrary  i offered to send and he said i was not to let her know how ill he was  did he forgive her  not as i know  wellpoor little thing tis to be believed shes found forgiveness somewhere  she said she had found peace  she may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace till shes hoarse but it wont be true said arabella  shes never found peace since she left his arms and never will again till shes as he is now
